5|$|The {{painting}} depicts 125 wedding guests. As was customary in the Renaissance period, the brides <b>wore</b> <b>black</b> and men wore codpieces. Voyeurism {{is depicted}} {{throughout the entire}} art work; dancing was disapproved of by the authorities and the church, and the painting {{can be seen as}} both a critique and comic depiction of a stereotypical oversexed, overindulgent, peasant class of the times.|$|E

5|$|The popular {{painting}} shows a {{group of}} 125 wedding guests wearing clothing from the times, presented in the canvas in an apparently chaotic way in an outdoor party surrounded by trees.

Voyeurism (spying on people engaged in intimate behaviours) is shown throughout the entire work amongst almost all of the people.|$|E

5|$|The Canadiens were {{scheduled}} to play the Montreal Maroons the evening of March 9, a game the NHL offered to cancel in honour of Morenz's death. However Mary insisted the game be played, saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue. The players on the Canadiens and Maroons <b>wore</b> <b>black</b> armbands for the game, and prior to the start, two minutes of silence were observed in his honour. A similar event happened in New York, where the New York Rangers and New York Americans had {{a moment of silence}} before the start of their game.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Rhodes fought Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore and A-1, in what was billed as a Prince of Darkness match next. The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 20 seconds. In this contest, there would be three falls, but the third fall would be contested under blindfold match rules, in which both wrestlers wore hoods over their heads. Roode earned the first fall with a roll-up pin, and Dustin earned the second one when he forced Roode face-first into the mat from the top rope. During the third fall, both wrestlers <b>wore</b> <b>black</b> hoods that impaired their vision, causing Dustin to accidentally knock the referee unconscious in storyline terms. Due to this, D'Amore opened the cage door and passed Roode a steel folding chair. Roode then attempted to bash Dustin with it but instead mistakenly struck D'Amore. Dustin then grabbed the chair and struck Roode with it, which gave him the pinfall as the referee came to.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} club's history, Hull {{have worn}} black and amber shirts with black shorts. These black and amber colours are where Hull's nickname, The Tigers, {{originated}} from. However, in the club's first match against Notts County in 1904, white shirts were worn, with black shorts and black socks. During their first season in the League, Hull <b>wore</b> <b>black</b> and amber striped shirts and black shorts, which they continued to wear until the Second World War {{with the exception of}} the 1935â€“36 season, in which they wore sky blue shirts. Following the end of the Second World War, Hull spent another season wearing sky blue, but changed to plain amber shirts, which they wore until the early 1960s, when they swapped back to stripes.|$|E

5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria <b>wore</b> <b>black</b> mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal family should remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E
