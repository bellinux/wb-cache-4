5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases.

Nearing the hut, he <b>was</b> <b>spotted</b> by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E

Ethalion joined the chase and at dawn two more sails were sighted, the 32-gun HMS Alcmene under Captain Henry Digby {{to the west and}} 32-gun HMS Triton under Captain John Gore to the north. With four British frigates now in full pursuit, the Spanish captains sought to split their enemy and divided, at which Pierrepont directed Ethalion, the closest British ship, to pursue the faster Thetis. Young complied, firing long-range shot in Santa Brigidas direction at 09:00, driving Pillon's ship further from his companion.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron <b>was</b> <b>spotted,</b> having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night.

Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French were thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
