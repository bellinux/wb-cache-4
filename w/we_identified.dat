2500|$|In an {{interview}} with GameSpot, Phil Larsen, Chief Marketing Officer at Halfbrick discussed the development of Fruit Ninja. [...] He stated, [...] "we tried {{a lot of different}} channels [...] indie games, PSN, XBLA, [...] and we basically did a lot of research about what was happening on iPhone and made a game that worked out pretty well." [...] He then spoke of the company's brainstorming process for new games and said [...] "Fruit Ninja came as part of [...] process, but <b>we</b> <b>identified</b> it as something special [...] decided to fast-track it through." [...] Luke Muscat, Lead Designer for Fruit Ninja stated that he felt the uniqueness of the touch screen platforms and the short development cycle further motivated Halfbrick to develop the game.|$|E

It was necessary to conduct several days of forensic analysis, and it took our experts until yesterday to understand the scope of the breach.

50|$|RADAR {{has also}} {{identified}} key barriers to timely and efficiently identifying ADRs and to comprehensively reporting these findings. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>identified</b> quality concerns with MedWatch reports (the FDA’s {{primary source of}} adverse event reports) and poor quality of dissemination of adverse event findings from the FDA and the pharmaceutical sponsor. Our efforts have found that RADAR sADR identification and dissemination efforts can be as rapid as {{one to two years}} after FDA approval, in contrast to the seven years generally seen with safety efforts from the FDA and pharmaceutical sponsors. Thus, the RADAR project has developed into an important adjunct to the current pharmaceutical drug and device safety system.|$|E
