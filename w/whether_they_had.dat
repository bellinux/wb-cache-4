5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery {{credit to}} Ortiz, but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed again just before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> discovered a new object.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories {{as to whether or not}} Keating and Lindner had remained close or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fallen out.|$|E

30|$|Beginning in the 2008 June CPS, the {{respondents}} were asked the following six questions on disability: (i) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> difficulty dressing or bathing; (ii) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> are deaf or have serious difficulty hearing; (iii) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> {{are blind or have}} serious difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses; (iv) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition; (v) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs; and (vi) <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. Since the ATUS sample is drawn from those who participated in the CPS, the responses to these questions are available for all ATUS WB respondents. Freedman et al. (2012) show that regardless of measures of subjective well-being, older married adults with disability reported worse subjective well-being than those without disability.|$|R

5|$|Spartan {{citizens}} used helots, {{a dependent}} group collectively {{owned by the}} state. It is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of Lakonia: the poet Alcman; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian; a Spartan cook bought by Dionysius the Elder or by a king of Pontus, both versions being mentioned by Plutarch; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline {{one or more of the}} honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E

5|$|Lam Wing-kee (林榮基, age 60), {{the founder}} of Causeway Bay Books, has been missing since 24 October 2015. He habitually spent long hours at the {{bookshop}} and occasionally slept there. His wife filed a missing persons report with the police on 5 November and his family received {{a telephone call from}} him several hours later; he refused to reveal his whereabouts. When filing the police report, they were referred to the Immigration Department, who said it was against privacy policy to reveal a person's records of entry and exit of Hong Kong without the subject's permission. However, legislator James To said this was a reasonable request that was exempt from privacy policy. Police followed up on his case once, asking <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> heard from him. His family allege that upon learning that he had contacted his family, the officer who called them informed that the case would be closed as resolved.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} {{appeared in}} televised debates {{during which they}} discussed various topics. One of them were the rules governing the voting of non-resident nationals, which had been changed by the National Electoral Commission during the campaign. Before the campaign, non-resident nationals who wanted to cast their votes as absentee ballots had been obliged to request voting materials, but the Commission had introduced a new system in which such materials were sent to all non-residents entered in the electoral register, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> asked for them or not. Opposition parties, representing the left-wing of Slovenian politics, disliked this move because the record of voters' addresses was not always reliable, and also because the rules had been changed after the campaign had already started. They particularly opposed the change because voters from abroad seemed to favor right-wing parties, {{so that in the}} event of a very close ballot, votes from non-residents could tip the scale in favour of Peterle.|$|E

Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> discovered a new object. Brown began to wonder if the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} nine months, Quisling {{continued}} to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics. He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought {{to go on the}} offensive against its then-ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans. After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway, that would let the Germans use Norway as a naval base. Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control. It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, Albert Hagelin, who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times. Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as to <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Wallace {{published}} the book Island Life as {{a sequel to}} The Geographical Distribution of Animals. It surveyed the distribution of both animal and plant species on islands. Wallace classified islands into three different types. Oceanic islands, such as the Galapagos and Hawaiian Islands (then known as the Sandwich Islands) formed in mid-ocean and never part of any large continent. Such islands were characterised by a complete lack of terrestrial mammals and amphibians, and their inhabitants (with the exceptions of migratory birds and species introduced by human activity) were typically the result of accidental colonisation and subsequent evolution. He divided continental islands into two separate classes depending on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> recently {{been part of a}} continent (like Britain) or much less recently (like Madagascar) and discussed how that difference affected the flora and fauna. He talked about how isolation affected evolution and how that could result in the preservation of classes of animals, such as the lemurs of Madagascar that were remnants of once widespread continental faunas. He extensively discussed how changes of climate, particularly periods of increased glaciation, may have affected the distribution of flora and fauna on some islands, and the first portion of the book discusses possible causes of these great ice ages. Island Life was considered a very important work {{at the time of its}} publication. It was discussed extensively in scientific circles both in published reviews and in private correspondence.|$|E

5|$|In 1968, the MCC was {{involved}} in controversy over the non-selection of the mixed-race cricketer Basil D'Oliveira to tour South Africa, which was then under apartheid. The South African government did not want D'Oliveira, himself South African-born, in the England team because of his colour. The MCC were aware that there was opposition to a tour taking place, and that D'Oliveira's place in the team would be an issue, but wanted the tour to go ahead. The Shadow Foreign Secretary and former MCC President Sir Alec Douglas-Home visited South Africa in January 1968 and met the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster, who privately did not want D'Oliveira to come to South Africa under any circumstances. Vorster suggested to Douglas-Home that the MCC should not explicitly ask whether D'Oliveira's selection would be acceptable, {{but that it was}} likely no protest would be made. Douglas-Home passed this information to the MCC and advised them not to push for an answer. They had earlier written to the South African Cricket Association to establish <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> a free hand in choosing a team, but their change of strategy meant that when the official reply arrived Allen refused to take receipt of it. In his biography of D'Oliveira, Peter Oborne writes that Allen and the MCC secretary Billy Griffith wished to hide any South African reply from the full MCC Committee to avoid raising awkward questions over Vorster's intentions.|$|E
5|$|The ages of {{individual}} aetosaurs {{can be determined}} by examining their osteoderms. Some isolated osteoderms have been claimed to belong to juvenile aetosaurs based on their size and shape but these hypotheses have often been questioned. For example, juvenile osteoderms of Calyptosuchus were later identified {{as those of the}} small-bodied pseudosuchian Revueltosaurus (which is not an aetosaur), and juvenile osteoderms of Desmatosuchus have been reinterpreted as those of aetosaur Acaenasuchus, which had a relatively small body size at maturity. Studies of the bone structure of paramedian osteoderms indicate that new bone was deposited along the edges of each plate over the course of an aetosaur's lifetime. This means that lines of arrested growth on the undersides of paramedian osteoderms can be used to determine an individual's age. Comparing the ages {{of individual}} specimens with their total body lengths indicates that aetosaurs increased in length at relatively constant rates, but increased in body mass at different rates depending on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> wide bodies like Typothorax or narrow bodies like Aetobarbakinoides. Aetosaurs also seem to have grown more slowly than modern crocodilians. Analysis of the limb bones of aetosaurs indicates that they grew quickly when young and more slowly when adults. This pattern of growth is seen in most other pseudosuchians.|$|E
