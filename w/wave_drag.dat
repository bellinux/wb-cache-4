Below a threshold amplitude, the acoustic <b>wave</b> <b>drags</b> electrons through the superlattice with a peak drift velocity overshooting that {{produced by a}} static electric field. In this regime, single electrons perform drifting orbits with THz frequency components. When the wave amplitude exceeds the critical threshold, an abrupt onset of Bloch-like oscillations causes negative differential velocity. The acoustic wave also affects the collective behavior of the electrons by causing the formation of localised electron accumulation and depletion regions, which propagate through the superlattice, thereby producing self-sustained current oscillations even for very small wave amplitudes. We show that the underlying single-electron dynamics, in particular the transition between the acoustic <b>wave</b> <b>dragging</b> and Bloch oscillation regimes, strongly influence the spatial distribution of the electrons and {{the form of the}} current oscillations. In particular, the amplitude of the current oscillations depends non-monotonically on the strength of the acoustic wave, reflecting the variation of the single-electron drift velocity.

25|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> on aircraft in the transonic speed range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes. The {{supercritical airfoil}} was invented and designed by NASA aeronautical engineer Richard Whitcomb in the 1960s. Testing successfully commenced on a United States Navy Vought F-8U fighter through wind tunnel results in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{low-speed}} concept {{allowed the}} design {{to dispense with}} several features normally found on jet aircraft, notably the sweptback wing. By using a conventional rectangular wing the high-speed drag was greatly increased (see <b>wave</b> <b>drag)</b> but the low-speed lift was likewise greatly increased. Further, the rectangular planform allowed the twin wing spars to be single pieces, {{and all of the}} engines, landing gear and cargo could be attached directly to the spar. With a swept wing this would place considerable torque loads on the point where the wings met the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Using {{this many}} landing gear on a swept wing would produce {{considerable}} problems when the aircraft {{tried to turn}} on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see <b>wave</b> <b>drag).</b> This was perfectly acceptable for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed high-lift performance. The result looked much more like the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft.|$|E

25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of <b>wave</b> <b>drag,</b> all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual flight conditions.|$|E
500|$|Avro {{engineering}} {{had been}} considering supersonic issues already at this point. Supersonic flight {{works in a}} very different fashion and presents a number of new problems. [...] One of the most critical, and surprising, was the sudden onset of a new form of drag, known as <b>wave</b> <b>drag.</b> The effects of <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> were so strong that engines of the era could not provide enough power to overcome it, leading to the concept of a [...] "sound barrier".|$|E
500|$|German {{research}} {{during the}} Second World War had shown {{the onset of}} <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> was greatly reduced by using airfoils that varied in curvature as gradually as possible. This suggested the use of thinner airfoils with much longer chord than designers would have used on subsonic aircraft. These designs were impractical because they left little internal room in the wing for armament or fuel. However, they also discovered {{it was possible to}} [...] "trick" [...] the airflow into the same behaviour if a conventional thicker airfoil was used swept rearward at a sharp angle, creating a swept-wing. This provided many of the advantages of a thinner airfoil while also retaining the internal space needed for strength and fuel storage. Another advantage was that the wings were clear of the supersonic shock wave generated by the nose of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{formalism}} {{is proposed}} {{to represent a}} broadband spectrum of Gravity Waves (GWs) via the superposition of a large ensemble of statistically independent monochromatic ones. To produce this large ensemble at a reasonable numerical cost, we use {{the fact that the}} life cycles of the waves needed to be parameterized in General Circulation Models (GCMs) have time scales that largely exceed the time step of the model. We can therefore launch few waves with characteristics chosen randomly at each time step, and make them having an effect on a longer time scale by applying an AR 1 relation between the gravity <b>waves</b> <b>drag</b> at a given time and that at the next time step. The stochastic GW parameterization is applied to a GCM in the tropics, and its additional drag causes a realistic Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). The more realistic wind structure also results in a better representation of the large scale equatorial waves, like the Rossby Gravity Waves (RGWs) with periods around 4 - 5 day.

2500|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>drag</b> is {{a sudden}} rise in {{drag on the}} aircraft, caused by air {{building}} {{up in front of}} it.

But at the speed of sound, this can no longer happen, and the air which was previously following the streamline around the aircraft now hits it directly. The amount of power needed to overcome this effect is considerable. The critical mach is the speed at which some of the air passing over the aircraft's wing becomes supersonic.|$|E

Newkirk's designs are primarily trimarans, and the Atlantic proa's buoyant outrigger follows naturally from a conversion of a trimaran from a tacking to a shunting vessel.|$|E

50|$|In {{supersonic}} flight (Mach numbers {{greater than}} 1.0), <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> {{is the result}} of shockwaves present in the fluid and attached to the body, typically oblique shockwaves formed at the leading and trailing edges of the body.

Additionally, local areas of transonic flow behind the initial shockwave may occur at lower supersonic speeds, and can lead to the development of additional, smaller shockwaves present on the surfaces of other lifting bodies, similar to those found in transonic flows. In supersonic flow regimes, <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> is commonly separated into two components, supersonic lift-dependent <b>wave</b> <b>drag</b> and supersonic volume-dependent <b>wave</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
