5|$|Skyline Drive was {{originally}} lined with miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline Drive was designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline Drive was designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E

There are {{changes in}} {{material}} properties of concrete when compared axially loaded short columns <b>with</b> micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled steel tube with axially loaded short columns <b>with</b> common reinforced <b>concrete</b> and these changes will inevitably {{lead to the}} change of axially loaded short columns <b>with</b> micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled steel tube in performance. It is impossible to fully use the existing research results of axially loaded short columns with common reinforced concrete; therefore, {{it is necessary to}} do experimental research on the working performance of axially loaded short columns <b>with</b> micro-expansive <b>concrete</b> filled steel tube.

5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along the western wall to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.|$|E

Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s and 1890s, {{both the}} power of naval {{artillery}} and the speed of warships had further increased, leading to further investment in the castle between 1888 and 1893.

New 6-pounder (2.7kg) quick-firing guns were installed in a battery {{on the end of}} the east wing, supported by machine guns, to enable them to target fast moving vessels, particularly the new torpedo boats. Further emplacements for 12-pounder (5.4kg) guns followed, including one on the top of the keep.|$|E

In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side.

The work involved substantial renovations that included replacing the eroded stone, infilling some of the piers <b>with</b> <b>concrete</b> to aid stability and improving drainage by separating the bridge from the aqueduct.

40|$|Circular {{steel tube}} filled <b>with</b> steel-reinforced {{high-strength}} <b>concrete</b> {{is a new}} model of composite column design. The fire resistance of this composite column was investigated experimentally. One circular steel tube column filled <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength <b>concrete</b> and one circular steel tube column filled <b>with</b> high- strength <b>concrete</b> were tested under axial load and fire. The test results show that the axial deformations of both kinds of the composite columns under the same load level have experienced three stages variation:the initial expansion deformation stage,the compression deformation gradual growth stage and the damage stage with the dramatic increasing in compression deformation. The second compression stable development stage of the circular steel tube filled <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength <b>concrete</b> is much longer than that of the circular steel tube column filled <b>with</b> high-strength <b>concrete.</b> Thus the fire endurance of the circular steel tube filled <b>with</b> steel-reinforced high-strength <b>concrete</b> reaches 166 minutes while the fire endurance of the circular steel tube column filled <b>with</b> high-strength <b>concrete</b> only reaches 46 minutes. Thus encasig section steel can remarkably improve the fire endurance of the circular steel tube filled <b>with</b> high-strength <b>concrete.</b> The research results can provide beneficial reference for the fire design of circular steel tube composite columns filled <b>with</b> steel-reinforced <b>concrete...</b>|$|R
