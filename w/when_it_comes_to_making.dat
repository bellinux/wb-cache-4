500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly hard wood, being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, particularly <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains {{a greater percentage of}} [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. [...] As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity... it was pop." ...|$|E

But to be honest, the trend works! And it’s certainly helped by 'Treasure's' bouncy beats". Kyle Anderson from EW wrote [...] "We should probably just {{change the name of}} this year from '2013' to '1978', because there are more sparkly suits and disco guitars than we know what to do with" [...] and that [...] "Bruno Mars has gone full-on Betamax for his new video for the track 'Treasure'. It's all there: the suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects". Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video, writing [...] "new low-def makes obvious — compare it next to, say, the video for [...] "Rock with You"". Similarly, Robbie Daw, from the Idolator website, drew {{attention to the fact that}} the song and dance had already been seen during the performance on Billboard Music Awards in May, since [...] "Mars and his band seem to have recreated that very same performance for this clip". He also wrote that the video was [...] "still a fun three minutes to sit through", mainly because [...] "Bruno mimics MJ's [...] "Rock With You" [...] moves so deftly". According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, [...] "everything from the choreography, stage lighting, and so on, serve as a heartfelt ode to that era". He wrote [...] "visually, the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights.

500|$|The episode has {{received}} largely positive reviews from television critics. Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as his fourth favorite {{episode of the}} first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X-Files. Reviewer Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] an A, saying that it [...] "isn’t the very best X-Files episode (though it’s certainly up there), but it’s perhaps the easiest episode to call your “favorite,” the most approachable episode, if you will" [...] and that while Gilligan penned better X-Files installments later, [...] "he’s never written one as effortlessly playful and inventive as this one. VanDerWerff later called the episode one of the [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] and named it [...] "Gilligan’s finest comedic achievement". John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it a 9 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode was a wonderful respite from the dark material of the season's character arcs, taking a humorous look at Mulder and his complete lack of a life. Gilligan channels Darin Morgan in many scenes, especially <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> scathing observations about Mulder through the soft stick of humor." [...] Furthermore, he praised Duchovny, saying that his [...] "nuanced performance" [...] was [...] "easily one of his best." [...] Topless Robot named [...] "Small Potatoes" [...] the eighth funniest episode of the series. Starpulse listed it as the eighth best episode of the series. The episode is popular with fans, specifically for the scene where Eddie, who has changed into Mulder, tries to seduce Scully in her apartment. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five and wrote that [...] "this is what Vince Gilligan has been working towards all season." [...] The two praised Gilligan's writing, applauding his decision to critically examine Mulder rather than merely tell jokes. Furthermore, the two commended the acting of Morgan, calling his casting [...] "apt". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a rave review and awarded it a rare four stars out of four. She {{described it as a}} [...] "four course meal of comic riches" [...] and praised the writing style of Giligan, calling him [...] "the believer who writes from inside the characters' heads".|$|E

2500|$|David Balls of Digital Spy {{gave the}} song a {{positive}} review: [...] "Unafraid {{to drop a}} line like [...] "My name's Shaniqua and what?", {{it was only a}} matter of time before N-Dubz turned their large underground following into mainstream success. Now, having shifted over 500,000 copies of debut disc Uncle B and reached No.1 alongside Tinchy Stryder, the Camden trio are aiming to become leaders of the Brrap pack with second album Against All Odds. Reflecting their move up pop's pecking order, this trailer single is their biggest, most bombastic moment yet. It's got hawkish sirens and loads of clubby synths - evidently inspired by Fraser T Smith's production on the Tinchy album - but N-Dubz haven't lost their usual quirky charm, dropping in oh-so-relevant references to Facebook and LBDs (that's [...] "little black dress", fellas). With an appeal that extends far beyond the back of the bus, 'I Need You' is – to borrow a word from the inimitable Dappy - probably best described as a [...] "smasher"." [...] Sarah-Louise James of the Daily Star reviewed the single as: [...] "British hip-house at its fizziest." [...] Alt-Uk.net reviewed the track: [...] "I Need You is an absolute fun-packed single from N-Dubz, and whilst listening to this one it really is difficult not to start singing along. N-Dubz once again demonstrates here a great knack for penning a perfect pop song, and this group certainly seems to know what it's doing <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>making</b> the music as infectious as possible." [...] Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog also positively reviewed the song, mentioning: [...] "It's this kind of bonkers happenstance which I love. I basically do internal bogglejumps whenever they do something like that. Pop songs are so safe, and N-Dubz seem to wander over the lines of acceptable behaviour almost as if they don't realise they are there." [...] The Chemistry Is Dead described the single as being [...] "much more mainstream" [...] as well as something that would [...] "appeal to their old fans and new fans alike." [...] Inside Gossip labelled [...] "I Need You" [...] as a [...] "club banger that has set the standards and told the world that they are here and that they are not one hit wonders." ...|$|E
