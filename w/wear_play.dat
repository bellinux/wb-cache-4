5000|$|Wear {{thought he}} had a chance to be {{selected}} in the second round of the 2014 NBA draft, but he went undrafted. He played for the Atlanta Hawks in the 2014 NBA Summer League, and was signed by the New York Knicks on September 9, 2014. The Knicks' roster already had 15 players with guaranteed contracts, and Wear was a longshot to make the team. However, they opened a roster spot for Wear by trading Travis Outlaw. Knicks president Phil Jackson said Wear was [...] "overshadowed at UCLA but has the skill set to play every position from 1 to 4." [...] He added that the team planned to have <b>Wear</b> <b>play</b> in the NBA Development League, [...] "where his possible NBA future solely depends on his ability to learn how to defend." [...] The Knicks lost their 2014-15 season opener in a 104-80 blowout to the Chicago Bulls, but Wear made his pro debut in the fourth quarter with the game already decided. The following night against the Cleveland Cavaliers, he played 13 minutes in a 95-90 win, and held LeBron James to 0-for-4 shooting when he was the primary defender on James.|$|E
40|$|Precision {{turning of}} {{polymeric}} materials increases form and shape accuracies {{in respect to}} the conventional techniques, but the relatively large tool wear of the mono-crystalline diamond tools may be a problem. This paper will discus possible tool wear mechanisms that occur during diamond turning of glassy (amorphous) polymers. Special attention is given to thermal-oxidative tool wear, tribo-electric tool wear and tribo-chemical tool wear. It will be shown that tribo-electric and tribo-chemical tool <b>wear</b> <b>play</b> {{an important role in}} the precision turning process of polymers...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn high {{temperature}} forming processes (forging, rolling, die-casting [...] .) the tool surfaces are the privileged places for mechanical, thermal and physico-chemical solicitations. More precisely, friction and <b>wear</b> <b>play</b> {{an important part}} in tool surface damage. The tool steel grades exhibit damages such as local plastic deformation, plastic flow, carbides fragmentation and oxidation. Oxide scales, which depend on the contact temperature, influence wear mechanisms and have to be considered in the wear model development. The aim of this work is to assess the third body particles circulation in a {{high temperature}} friction contact. The wear investigations are carried out using a high-temperature pin-on-disc tribometer. The pin is made of X 38 CrMoV 5 steel (AISI H 11) and the disc is made of common steel (C 38, AISI 1035). The setting temperature is 900 °C. All experiments are performed under constant load and velocity. The special design of the pin surface contributes to the trapping of third body particles and to the identification of the third body flows. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM, in ambient air) observations and Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) investigations have revealed that different types of third body particles circulate in the contact. Based on these observations and chemical analyses, a phenomenological model of the third body particles circulation in a high temperature contact is proposed, based on the third body concept approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{excellent}} microwear {{performance of}} nano-grained superelastic nickel titanium (NiTi) polycrystalline {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) is reported in this paper. The microwear test was conducted at temperatures ranging from 22 to 120 degrees C by a Hysitron triboindenter. The {{results showed that the}} NiTi SMA has superior microwear resistance compared to traditional tribo-materials such as stainless steel AISI 304 and that the material exhibits unusual hardness dependence of wear within certain temperature regimes. With the increase in temperature from 22 to 120 degrees C, wear resistance was found to decrease anomalously with an increase in hardness. Further investigation and analysis confirmed that the stress-induced phase transition during contact and <b>wear</b> <b>play</b> an essential role in the material's high wear resistance. It is demonstrated through contact mechanics analysis that the increase of hardness with temperature was mainly due to the increase in the phase transition stress. The observed applied threshold load that corresponds to the onset of the plastic deformation in the contact area was strongly influenced by the phase transition process at the tip region. For the investigated superelastic NiTi, the temperature-dependent interplay between reversible phase transition and irreversible plastic yielding {{plays a key role in}} the temperature dependence of the wear performance and is responsible for the observed apparent unusual hardness-wear relationships.

40|$|Abstract. Five-axis milling {{is widely}} used in {{machining}} of complex surfaces parts. Part quality and productivity are extremely affected by cutting force and tool wear, especially thin-walled complex surface, such as turbine blade. Although extensive {{research has been conducted}} on cutting force and tool wear in 3 -milling process, very few are on 5 -axis milling and bull-nose mills. This paper presents cutting forces with various cutting conditions as well as tool wear patterns in five-axis milling super alloy, which is essential to cutting vibration and defelction analysis of thin-walled complex surfaces parts. The roles of lead angle and tilt angle in five axis milling were investigated, which provide data for NC program edit. In addition, experiments in this research proved that tool <b>wear</b> <b>played</b> affected cutting forces outstandingly. Therefore, tool <b>wear</b> <b>played</b> an very important role in tool change...|$|R
