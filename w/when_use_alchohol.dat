30|$|Less {{polar solvent}} HX and DM, which should reach only the lumen, removed small and {{comparable}} amounts (1.6 and 1.7 %) <b>when</b> <b>used</b> independently on powder. Their yields were much smaller in solid wood. <b>When</b> DM was <b>used</b> after HX, its yield was very low, suggesting that HX had already removed most of extractives accessible to apolar solvents. Similarly, AC had a smaller yield <b>when</b> <b>used</b> after HX and DM, suggesting that <b>when</b> <b>used</b> independently, it also removed compounds from lumens. Although AC and ME {{are thought to}} be able to solubilize similar types of compounds, ME caused the most exhaustive extraction from solid wood: 6.2 % <b>when</b> <b>used</b> independently. Its efficiency was even increased <b>when</b> <b>used</b> after AC (7.14 % from solid wood). On the contrary, in powder, HW had the highest yield (8.31 %) <b>when</b> <b>used</b> independently, while it had a much smaller yield on solid. This suggests that in solid wood, polar extractives are more easily removed by ME than by HW, as the final cumulated yields were, however, similar between powder and solid.|$|R
