The farm {{was named after}} the {{original}} settlement in the area, Maynesborough, located in the White Mountains in an area {{also known as the}} Great North Woods Region. The main stallion barn, although moved from its original location, has been preserved and restored by the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society, which is also restoring the <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> barns of the Brown Company.

5|$|A pony-sized Finnhorse must measure no {{more than}} 148cm (14.2-1/2 hands, 58-1/2inches) at the withers or the croup. Both sexes are also {{required}} to pass either a drivability or a ridability test. The horse's pedigree is also evaluated, and uncharacteristically small individuals descending from larger-sized lines are not accepted. The horse should be proportionately small all over, and express all the qualities of a full-size Finnhorse. Especially thorough {{attention is paid to}} the pony-sized horse's character, obedience and cooperation. The pony-sized Finnhorse is suited to practically any use the larger Finnhorse is, with the exception of heavy draught work because of its smaller size and proportionally reduced strength. However, some individuals have been able to compete with and even win against full-size Finnhorses in <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> competitions. Many pony-sized individuals are cross-registered for trotter section breeding, as small Finnhorses can be equal competitors in harness against larger ones. In combined driving, the pony-sized Finnhorse's size is an advantage, allowing for greater agility. The section is popular for therapy and riding school use.|$|E
5|$|From the 14th to the 16thcentury, Finnish {{horses were}} {{exported}} to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually {{restrictions on the}} number of exports were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19thcentury influenced the development of the Vyatka horse. In the 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> breeds, in the mid-20thcentury, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity. In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s.|$|E

However, the Lebanese Army is trying to rearm and modernize itself through new aid and purchases from different countries such as the United States, Belgium, Russia, and The Netherlands. A list of awaiting-for-delivery armaments is constantly growing and includes Leopard 1/A5 tanks, more M60 Patton tanks, M198 Howitzers, etc. A recent Russian promise to supply Lebanon with T-90 tanks has been in discussion since the Lebanese Defense Minister's last visit to Russia on December 16, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of trucks}} was {{constrained}} {{by the lack of}} fuel and high costs of synthetic gasoline on the German side, and the losses of equipment in 1941–1942 on the Soviet side. The Soviets managed their losses with the formation of 76 horse transport battalions of 500 horses each, and employed reindeer in the Arctic and camels in the South. But overcoming shortage of horses themselves was insurmountable: a <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> matures in three to four years; farm stocks were already depleted of horses as well as tractors. Western European nations, starting with the United Kingdom, witnessed shortage of horses since the 1920s and adjusted their armies accordingly. Germany of the 1920s managed to restore their population of horses, but then it declined again as farm horses were replaced by motor power.|$|E
25|$|Eri-Aaroni was foaled in July 12, 1932. He was bred by Sulo Rintala in Seinäjoki. He was by a {{stallion}} {{who was a}} Ravikuningas title {{winner and}} tähtijuoksija named Murto 2306, {{and out of the}} mare Upeva 1640-V, a 50.0-timed, well-conformed broodmare. The colt was brought as a weanling to Turku, and then purchased by, Albin Ahlqvist, who took him to Åland. Eri-Aaroni grew to be a handsome and noble-looking horse who differed from the contemporary ideals of Finnhorse breeding, which favored a stockier, <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> look. Ahlqvist raced Eri-Aaroni occasionally at Turku. Eri-Aaroni was noticed there, and horse dealer Matti Takanen bought him from Ahlqvist for 75000 Finnish marks. Then, in 1937, the well-known horseman Fritz Buttenhoff bought the now 5-year-old Eri-Aaroni from Takanen for 100000 marks, corresponding to c. 34000 Euros, and took the stallion to his estate in Vyborg.|$|E

500|$|The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse {{developed}} in eastern Kentucky, and probably have their ancestry in smooth-gaited horses from the southeastern US and the now-extinct Narragansett Pacer. They {{are related to}} the Tennessee Walking Horse and other gaited breeds, but their exact early history is unknown. Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horses have a similar history to the Rocky Mountain Horse, and together are sometimes called [...] "Mountain Pleasure Horses". The Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse was developed by farmers looking for a small horse that could perform dual duty as a powerful <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> and comfortable riding horse. They were used for long travel over rough terrain, and were developed to have gentle temperaments so that they could be handled by young members of the farm families.

500|$|The {{working or}} draught type {{is the oldest}} of the Finnhorse types, and has had its own {{separate}} breeding section since the studbook was first split in 1924. Though {{the oldest of the}} Finnhorse types, it is rare today, with a total of only about 1,000 horses registered in the working section as of 2004. Draught-type Finnhorses are heavier and have a longer body than horses of the trotter and riding types. Though relatively small compared to other draught breeds, Finnhorses have considerable pulling power and can pull very heavy loads because of the breed's good pulling technique, with powerful take-off and a low, efficient body stature during the actual pulling. The Finnish Draught type is, pound for pound, stronger than many larger draught breeds. An average [...] horse in draught work is capable of pulling about 80percent of its own weight, while a Finnhorse can pull as much as 110percent. In <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> competitions, the best Finnhorses can achieve even higher results, pulling more than 200percent of their own body weight.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the First World War, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> on large farms in East Anglia due to its good {{temperament}} and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the Second World War, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but there has been a revival of interest in the breed since the late 1960s and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998 there were only 80 breeding mares in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. [...] In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught horse market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some Belgians to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the fillies from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.|$|E
500|$|The {{two states}} {{concluded}} a three-year truce {{in exchange for}} a heavy annual tribute—the Arab sources mention various amounts between 70,000 and 100,000 gold nomismata, while one also adds 10,000 pieces of silk. Tabari's account records that the tribute amounted to [...] "ninety or seventy thousand dinars", to be paid [...] "at the beginning of April and in June every year". In addition, the Byzantines were obliged to provide provisions and guides for Harun's army on its march home, and to hand over Tatzates's wife and property. Harun released all his captives (5,643 according to Tabari), but kept the rich plunder he had gathered, and returned to the Caliphate in September 782. Tabari, in his account of the expedition, says that Harun's forces captured 194,450 dinars in gold and 21,414,800 dirhams in silver, killed 54,000 Byzantines in battle and 2,090 in captivity and took over 20,000 riding animals captive while slaughtering 100,000 cattle and sheep. Tabari also reports that the amount of plunder was such that [...] "a <b>work</b> <b>horse</b> was sold for a dirham and a mule for less than ten dirhams, a coat of mail for less than a dirham, and twenty swords for a dirham"—at a time when one to two dirhams was the usual daily salary of a labourer or soldier.|$|E
