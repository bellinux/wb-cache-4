5|$|The {{script for}} Part 3 called for Jason {{to wear a}} mask to cover his face, having worn a bag over his head in Part 2; what no one {{knew at the time}} was that the mask chosen would become a {{trademark}} for the character, and one instantly recognizable in popular culture in the years to come. During production, Steve Miner called for a lighting check. None of the effects crew wanted to apply any make-up for the light check, so they decided to just throw a mask on Brooker. The film's 3D effects supervisor, Martin Jay Sadoff, was a hockey fan, and had a bag of hockey gear with him on the set. He pulled out a Detroit Red Wings goaltender mask for the test. Miner loved the mask, but it was too small. Using a substance called VacuForm, Doug White enlarged the mask and created a new mold to work with. After White finished the molds, Terry Ballard placed red triangles on the mask to give it a unique appearance. Holes were punched into the mask and the markings were altered, making it different from Sadoff's mask. There were two prosthetic face masks created for Richard Brooker to wear underneath the hockey mask. One mask was composed of approximately 11 different appliances and took about six hours to apply to Brooker's face; this mask was used for scenes where the hockey mask was removed. In the scenes where the hockey mask is over the face, a simple head mask was created. This one-piece mask <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> on over Brooker's head, exposing his face but not the rest of his head.|$|E

25|$|Three (C36, C37 and C38) {{had been}} sent to Hong Kong in 1911 and during the war the {{remainder}} were mainly used for coastal defence, based at the east coast ports of Leith, Harwich, Hartlepool, Grimsby and Dover, some operating with Q-ships which were decoying U-boats. The technique was for a trawler to tow the submarine and communicate with it by telephone. When a U-boat surfaced to attack the trawler with its deck gun, the British submarine <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> its tow and attempt to torpedo the U-boat.|$|E
25|$|It took Thomas {{over two}} weeks to move, causing great anxiety in Washington, where it was {{anticipated}} that Hood was poised for an invasion of the North. General Grant pressured Thomas to move, despite a bitter ice storm that struck on December 8 and stopped much fortification on both sides. A few days later, Grant sent an aide to relieve Thomas of command, believing that Hood <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> through his fingers. On December 13, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan was directed to proceed to Nashville and assume command if, upon his arrival, Thomas had not yet initiated operations. He made {{it as far as}} Louisville by December 15, but on that day the Battle of Nashville had finally begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, {{as well as other}} primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position's use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent {{as well as in the}} art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back with her legs in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan. But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> off the shoulders of the four giants who held it up above the waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.|$|E

25|$|Ching Leung – Leung is a 27-year-old renowned lawyer. He is Sum’s boyfriend {{towards the}} middle of the series. He is a moody but {{vigilant}} and caring figure who forever strives to do his best. Although he is a kind person, he has an inability to stay faithful and succumbs. At one point he had an affair with Sheung Joi Sum's best friend Shui Mak Mak, but he kept it quiet and reconciled with Sheung Joi Sum without admitting anything about the matter. Eventually information <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> and Sheung Joi Sum actively demands to know who was the other woman, but Ching felt exposing this matter would ruin everything and insists for her to drop the matter since he admitted his mistakes and assures Sheung Joi Sum it would never happen again. Sheung Joi Sum wasn't satisfied with such an answer and whenever he tries to comfort her, Tong Chi On would be around and he becomes jealous. After the big secret was exposed, everyone parted ways for some time and Leung would try to patch things between him and Sheung Joi Sum. Despite the fact that they broke up, Leung continues to love Sum. This is shown when he continues to write in his blog, Days without Sheung Joi Sum, three years after the break-up. He also helps Sheung Joi Sum think of ideas to defend Ling Lei. He eventually dies of a car crash in the end, because he was thinking about Sheung Joi Sum's decision to forgive him or not. Although he could be saved, he refuses to go to the hospital, using his final moments to tell Sheung Joi Sum ways to defeat Wong Sau-Kam. Sheung Joi Sum, who forgave Leung and is willing to renew their relationship, was greatly sadden by his death.|$|E

The only people who truly wanted him in the movie were Michael Eisner and Joe Grant – and myself, because I was assigned the character. I would sit in meetings and they’d say, 'Well, where's the cricket during all this?' Somebody else would say, 'Oh, to hell the cricket.' They felt Cri-Kee was a character who wasn't necessary to tell the story, which is true." [...] Throughout development on the film, Grant <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors' door.|$|E

500|$|Nansen chose Colin Archer, Norway's leading {{shipbuilder}} {{and naval}} architect, {{to design and}} build a suitable ship for the planned expedition. Using the toughest oak timbers available, and an intricate system of crossbeams and braces throughout its length, Archer built a vessel of extraordinary strength. Its rounded hull was designed so that it <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> upwards out of the grip of packing ice. [...] Speed and sailing performance were secondary to the requirement of making the ship a safe and warm shelter during a predicted lengthy confinement. With an overall length of [...] and a beam of , the length-to-beam ratio of just over three gave the ship its stubby appearance, justified by Archer thus: [...] "A ship that is built with exclusive regard to its suitability for [...] object must differ essentially from any known vessel." [...] The ship was launched by Eva Nansen at Archer's yard at Larvik, on 6 October 1892, and was named Fram, in English [...] "Forward".|$|E
500|$|Giancarlo Esposito {{said that}} when he first read the script for [...] "Box Cutter", he was so shocked that he had to put it down and walk away from it. Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he <b>would</b> <b>slip,</b> which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E
500|$|Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, Count Wratislaw, and the Duke of Marlborough {{realised}} {{the implications}} of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the Moselle – a plan approved of by The Hague – but once there, he <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. [...] "My intentions", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, Sidney Godolphin, [...] "are to march with the English to Coblenz and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1989–90, {{his second}} NHL season, Sakic {{was able to}} switch his number back to his {{familiar}} #19 (Alain Côté had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At {{the start of the}} next season, 1990–91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> during 1991–92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, [...] "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here {{and there are a lot}} of others in this locker room who really care about the game." [...] Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991.|$|E
500|$|The Mk 12 Gun Assembly (pictured) was a semi-automatic, power rammed, {{vertical}} sliding-wedge {{breech block}} type gun. Since this gun assembly fired semi-fixed ammunition, (pictured) each round {{was delivered to}} the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. [...] At the load command, the powder man <b>would</b> <b>slip</b> a primer protector {{off the end of}} the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back {{to the rear of the}} rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.|$|E
