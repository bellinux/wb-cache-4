This was a technical decision made by Richard Stallman, who thought it would speed up the work by saving {{a large part of}} it. He has admitted that he was <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Other Unix-like systems working on the Mach microkernel include OSF/1, Lites, and MkLinux. macOS and NeXTSTEP use hybrid kernels based on Mach.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} {{the rights to the}} game in July 2013, NOLF {{designer}} Craig Hubbard also expressed confusion about the legal complexities behind the series. According to Hubbard, [...] "my understanding was that Monolith owned the IP and Fox owned the title of the first game, which was technically The Operative: No One Lives Forever. I think Monolith actually owned A Spy in H.A.R.M.'s Way, the subtitle of the sequel, but I could be <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> Fox got acquired by VUG, which in turn got acquired by Activision, while Monolith got bought by Warner Brothers, so some stars would have to align for everything to get sorted out." [...] Hubbard added that [...] "there didn't seem to be any interest in resurrecting the franchise" [...] as of 2012, while he was still working at Monolith/Warner Bros.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the record, David Bowie praised the band, writing, [...] " [...] might be all shamrocks and deutsche marks to some, but I feel that they {{are one of the few}} rock bands even {{attempting}} to hint at a world which will continue past the next great wallâ€”the year 2000." [...] Although the record was a success, in the years following its release, the group have regarded it with mixed feelings and rarely play its material in live performances. Bono said, [...] "I thought of Zooropa at the time as a work of genius. I really thought our pop discipline was matching our experimentation and this was our Sgt. Pepper. I was a little <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> The truth is our pop disciplines were letting us down. We didn't create hits. We didn't quite deliver the songs. And what would Sgt. Pepper be without the pop songs?" [...] The Edge said that he did not think the songs were [...] "potent", further stating, [...] "I never thought of Zooropa as anything more than an interlude... but a great one, as interludes go. By far our most interesting." [...] Clayton said, [...] "It's an odd record and a favourite of mine." ...|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, when MTV News first {{announced}} that Ellis had finished writing Imperial Bedrooms, the writer told them in {{interview that he}} had begun looking ahead {{to the possibility of}} a film adaptation, and felt that interpreting it as a sequel to the 1987 movie adaptation starring Andrew McCarthy, Robert Downey Jr., James Spader and Jami Gertz [...] "would be a great idea". Two months prior to the book's release, Less Than Zero actor Andrew McCarthy stated it was [...] "early days" [...] in thinking about a potential film adaptation; McCarthy felt, however, that the novel would adapt well. Because the characters in Imperial Bedrooms have been owned by 20th Century Fox since Ellis sold the film rights to Less Than Zero, prospective film for Imperial Bedrooms rights revert to Fox. Ellis stated to Vice in June 2010 that he would be interested in writing the screenplay. In July 2010 however, the author clarified to California Chronicle, saying [...] "There's no deal, there's no one attached. There's been some vague talk among the cast members... As far as I know right now nothing's happening." [...] Ellis opines that were Robert Downey Jr. to get involved, the film would move straight into production. However, remembering the adaptation process Less Than Zero went through, he admits [...] "I've learned to be cautious about saying oh they'll never turn this dark depraved character into any sort of interesting Mulholland Drive, David Lynch kind of movie, but I could be totally <b>wrong</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> I don't know." ...|$|E
