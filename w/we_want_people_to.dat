In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and {{for a lot of the}} year I think we got it right." ...|$|E
500|$|Elsa's {{appearance}} {{had to be}} redesigned {{following her}} transition from antagonist to protagonist. She was originally drawn in a style similar to other Disney villains, with blue skin and spiky black hair. A {{few months after the}} film's release, visual development artist Claire Keane (the daughter of Disney Legend Glen Keane) published early concept art of Elsa that was modeled after the singer Amy Winehouse. At the time, she was imagined as having blue [...] "bouffant" [...] hair as well as [...] "a deep, soulful voice and dramatic mood swings". Lasseter reportedly influenced the creation of the character's much softer final appearance, particularly in regards to her very thick platinum blonde hair, which animators found difficult to design. Art director Michael Giaimo said that while a number of strategies were proposed for Elsa's hair, Lasseter would push the animation team to continue making improvements, saying, [...] "It's not aspirational enough. <b>We</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> feel like this hair is a beautiful statement." [...] During a research trip, producers found that [...] "there are lots of braids" [...] worn by women in Norway; they then hired a stylist from New York named [...] "Danilo" [...] who helped to create a style that would reflect that while still being [...] "a little different". A new animation program called Tonic was invented to assist with the task, and the character's hair ultimately required 420,000 CGI threads. By contrast, Anna was given roughly 140,000 hairs while Rapunzel from Tangled had only required 27,000 CGI threads for her hair.|$|E

2500|$|Welcome to DisneySea! Here {{you will}} {{experience}} a thrilling {{journey through the}} mysteries, challenges and natural wonders of the sea. Among the highlights of your trip will be an intimate encounter with our plant's most important environmental resource {{and the chance to}} participate in exciting research activities conducted by some of the world's leading oceanic scientists.For millions of Southern California residents and visitors, this fantastic voyage may become a reality based on the conceptual master plan {{for one of the most}} innovative theme parks ever conceived by The Walt Disney Company. According to its designers, the goal of DisneySea is to enable everyone to experience the [...] "marvels of nature's secret world beneath the sea" [...] and to gain firsthand experience of how the oceans affect human life as well as the life of the planet.Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative, design, production and project management subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company responsible for the creation of Disney theme parks and their attractions, ahs been charged to develop DisneySea. Its vision for Long Beach is a singular blend of entertainment and education through Disney-style rides and attractions, marine research facilities, an oceanarium and other aquatic adventures."Our goal is to sensitize millions of visitors each year to the enormous challenges and opportunities of our seas — our most precious resource — in a setting that encourages play and fantasy," [...] said David Malmuth, project director and vice president with Disney Development Company. [...] "Basically, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have fun. We also want our guests to directly experience the sea, to wonder about it, to ask questions and to have a memorable time."OceanaThe architectural centerpiece of DisneySea, Oceana would also serve as one of the main educational components of the park. Within this oceanarium, guests will experience true-to-life recreations of marine habitats and ecological systems from around the globe. Visitors will be able to touch, smell, feel and hear the world of water. Overhead walkways and underwater portholes would provide both bird's-eye and crab's-eye views.In Oceana, interactive displays and hands-on participation will encourage children and adults to learn about the ocean in ways that are fun, challenging, and informative. For example, guests can see for themselves how gills work, how fish communicate, and how coral build their fragile, complex reefs. Through special lenses, they may see through the eyes of an octopus, a lobster, a penguin, and a whale. A variety of demonstrations and experiments will be specially created to educate as well as entertain.Future Research CenterSet at the edge of DisneySea, the Future Research Center will be a state-of-the-art research laboratory where guests could interact with some of the nation's top marine scientists conducting oceanographic research.Southern Californians active in marine science will be invited to serve on an advisory board to direct the initial mission statement of the Center.Through an ongoing dialogue with the local scientific community and nearby universities, joint research programs will offer students of all ages a rare opportunity for hands-on exploration.Guests will be able to visit the heart of this functioning sea laboratory, observing scientists at work. Watching these experts, visitors can glimpse the future of man's involvement with the seas and probe deeper into man's relationship with the environment. For the more light-hearted adventurers, the Center will include a simulator adventure that will give guests a glimpse of the drama — and danger — faced by real explorers of the deep.Interactive Programs for Students of all AgesIn addition to Oceana and the Future Research Center, DisneySea will offer more formal on-site educational programs. A variety of full and half-day programs will be designed to help teachers in their efforts to share the wonder of the ocean with students. Programs may include special field trips featuring multi-media presentations, tours and lectures for the Los Angeles and Orange County area schools.Ocean Outreach CenterSimilar to the Teacher's Center in Walt Disney World's Epcot Center, an Ocean Outreach Center is envisioned to assist visitors in their quest for more information about the ocean. Serving as a library of the sea, the Outreach Center will offer computer terminals, reading rooms and research files designed to meet the need of guests, staff scientists, teachers and students.Attractions Capture Spirit of the SeaWhile plans for DisneySea are still evolving, Walt Disney Imagineering is planning attractions for visitors to enjoy the spirit of the sea with fun as the common denominator. For example, on the exotic beaches of Venture Reefs, guests will enjoy scenic beach vistas from the Caribbean, Polynesian, and the Pacific. They'll be entertained and invited to dine, shop, and take a dip in the ocean, where they'll find sunken ships and marine life [...] "under the sea."Fleets of Fantasy, adventurous attractions themed to storybook seafaring, would recapture the spirit and whimsy of turn-of-the-century amusement park rides. Mysterious Island and Hero's Harbor would feature [...] "high seas" [...] thrill rides incorporating thousands of years of mythic folklore relating to the ocean.At the rim of the American continent and the Pacific Ocean, DisneySea will offer a unique entertainment experience — and a site of magic and wonder.}}}} ...|$|E
