25|$|I think I thought I {{could handle}} things. Didn't {{know how to}} shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before <b>we</b> <b>shoot.</b> We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E
500|$|The {{political}} and public outcry after the withdrawal was significant. The Congress was appalled, and criticized both Schuyler and St. Clair for the loss. [...] John Adams wrote, [...] "I think we shall {{never be able}} to defend a post until <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> a general", and George Washington said it was [...] "an event of chagrin and surprise, not apprehended nor within the compass of my reasoning". [...] Rumors circulated that St. Clair and Schuyler were traitors who had taken bribes in exchange for the retreat.|$|E
500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was too young to know I was being foolhardy when I demanded that <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
5000|$|Showtime {{approached}} Corman {{with the}} idea of doing a series of science fiction and horror feature films. They started filming in January 1995 and finished shooting 13 films in mid June. Corman said, [...] "I don't think a day went by that <b>we</b> weren't <b>shooting.</b> <b>We</b> were <b>shooting</b> on weekends, <b>we</b> were <b>shooting</b> at our studio here. <b>We</b> were <b>shooting</b> at local locations, and we shot one film in Moscow and one film in Manila. So we were all over the world with this thing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} it would be a good plan to above the bears by taking a {{roundabout}} route?" [...] came from Whopper. [...] "I think <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> down at them better than <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> up. Besides, if we are above them I think we'll be safer. They can jump down on us easily enough, but jumping up is another matter." ...|$|R
2500|$|Corporal Sam Gillis: [...] "We make {{everyone}} {{get into his}} house by seven p.m., and we only tell a man once. If he refuses <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> him. We killed over 300 natives the first night. They tried to set the town on fire. If they fire a shot from the house we burn the house down and every house near it, and shoot the natives, so they are pretty quiet in town now." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 5, 2009, Hogan {{announced}} on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)'s The Ultimate Fighter {{that he would}} be making his official TNA debut on January 4, 2010, in a special live three-hour Monday night episode of Impact! to compete with WWE's Raw (which featured the return of Bret Hart). Dixie Carter revealed Hogan's role in the company in an interview with The UK Sun stating when his job came to question, [...] "He is involved with everything from looking at the talent to how <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> the show".|$|E
2500|$|In January 1986, Tracht {{created an}} uproar by telling an on-air joke {{regarding}} {{the new federal}} holiday, Martin Luther King Day. [...] Tracht said, [...] "Why don't <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> four more and get the whole week off?" [...] followed by, [...] "Come on, now, you know I don't mean nothin'!" [...] He was suspended from the station for five days, publicly apologized, and donated money to create a scholarship at Howard University in honor of Dr. King. The Washington Post noted {{that he was the}} highest paid DJ in D.C. during 1987, making $400,000 a year.|$|E
6000|$|... "Next morning Viljoen {{told me to}} go away, {{and gave}} me a pass into the Free State. He said (in Dutch), 'you must not drive for any Englishmen again. If we catch you doing so <b>we</b> will <b>shoot</b> you, and if you do not go away quick, and we catch you hanging about when we bring the two men to the line, <b>we</b> will <b>shoot</b> you too.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if you oppose us and act ugly {{about this}} fête, gentlemen, {{we shall be}} obliged to put a few bullets into you, and decide {{afterward}} what disposition {{to make of the}} girls. About the best stunt <b>we</b> do is <b>shooting.</b> <b>We</b> can't work; we're too poor to gamble much; but we hunt a good bit and <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> straight. I assure you we wouldn't mind losing and taking a few lives if a scrimmage is necessary. Eh, boys?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody watch out," [...] said Giant. [...] "And if <b>we</b> can't <b>shoot</b> something, why, toward dinner time, I'll try my hand at fishing again." ...|$|R
2500|$|Imperial {{and provincial}} {{government}} bureaucracies attempted to Germanise the state's national minorities situated near {{the borders of}} the empire: the Danes in the North, the Francophones in the West and Poles in the East. As minister president of Prussia and as imperial chancellor, Bismarck [...] "sorted people into their linguistic [...] ‘tribes’", however, he pursued a policy of hostility in particular toward the Poles, which was an expedient rooted in Prussian history. [...] "He never had a Pole among his peasants" [...] working the Bismarckian estates; it was the educated Polish bourgeoisie and revolutionaries he denounced from personal experience, and [...] "because of them he disliked intellectuals in politics." [...] Bismarck’s antagonism is revealed in a private letter to his sister in 1861: [...] "Hammer the Poles until they despair of living [...] I have all the sympathy in the world for their situation, but if we want to exist {{we have no choice but}} to wipe them out: wolves are only what God made them, but <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> them all the same when we can get at them." [...] Later that year, the public Bismarck modified his belligerence and wrote to Prussia’s foreign minister: [...] "Every success of the Polish national movement is a defeat for Prussia, we cannot carry on the fight against this element according to the rules of civil justice, but only in accordance with the rules of war." [...] With Polish nationalism the ever-present menace, Bismarck preferred expulsion rather than Germanisation.|$|E
6000|$|... "To justify one's guns. A man {{takes to}} {{shooting}} {{as a matter}} of course. It's a kind of institution. There ain't any tigers, and so <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> birds. And {{in this part of the}} world there ain't any pheasants, and so <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> sea-gulls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Americanos surrender," [...] came in bad English {{from back}} of the fence. [...] "Surrender quick, or <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> both dead on the spot!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{pilot for}} the comedy was {{commissioned}} by the BBC in April 2010. Gervais reported on progress in his blog. In April 2010, he stated, [...] "Some reports {{are saying that the}} Life's Too Short pilot <b>we</b> are <b>shooting</b> in the summer will be aired. It wont [...] It is a non-broadcast pilot. <b>We</b> will <b>shoot</b> the whole series before anything is aired. We're not sure how many eps episodes we will record (probably 6) and not sure when the series will air." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Farm," [...] he answered. [...] "Farming is {{our daily}} occupation. Then for {{amusement}} <b>we</b> hunt, <b>shoot,</b> and fish. The seasons pass {{before we know}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't fire! We've shown {{them that}} <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> straight. It's jest as well at present that they shouldn't {{know how far}} our rifles will carry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> {{him in the}} street, for an example?" [...] said Pearson to Cromwell; while Everard endeavoured to stop Wildrake {{from giving}} further offence.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{and from}} the look of the country, water must be scarce. However, as long as <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> lizards and birds, we can drink their blood." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For Electric Horseman, I {{literally}} {{ended up}} writing half of every night before <b>we</b> would <b>shoot.</b> <b>We</b> make jokes now about my saying, 'Let's pick the longest location cause I {{have time to}} write the scene {{by the time we}} get there.' And that's literally true. There were yellow pads all over the place; we're writing out to work in the morning." [...] —Sydney Pollack, describing script troubles.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> we {{must make}} every shot tell," [...] said his father. [...] "And keep the {{cartridges}} where we can get at them quickly. How many left, Dave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What if it is?" [...] cried Dick, {{their success}} having made him very bold. [...] "Wasn't it watched to-night, and didn't <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> the Hoxie well {{in spite of}} them all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and if you}} can get a gun {{and some}} {{ammunition}} thrown into the bargain, Alexis, it will be most useful, for we may have to depend upon what <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> sometimes." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{shot for}} four days. You shoot 288 arrows over four days, 72 arrows a day. When we {{finished}} the third day, I {{had a pretty}} good lead. The Russians were second and third, and once again I totally freaked out laughs. You know, I might win this thing. But once <b>we</b> started <b>shooting</b> in the morning - 50 meters was the middle distance, {{and it was one of}} my better distances - once <b>we</b> started <b>shooting</b> 50 meters I kind of knew. Something bad would have to happen for me not to win." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if he is}} there, you bet we are {{not going}} to run away from him!" [...] {{declared}} Phil. [...] "Come on, let's see if <b>we</b> can't <b>shoot</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kennicott observed, [...] "There's {{that old}} crank <b>Wes</b> Brannigan <b>shooting</b> off his mouth again. Gosh, but {{he loves to}} hear himself talk! They ought to run that fellow out of town!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O heavens, Mr. Felton!" [...] whispered Rose, [...] "why should <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> these men, or they us? {{they look}} kind, if homely. Each {{of them has}} a mother and sisters, I suppose, just like our men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is good news," [...] the miner said. [...] "It will {{be lucky}} {{if we can}} lay in a supply of deer flesh here. The less <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> after we get through the pass the better. Shall we go with you, chief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a look {{of blank}} horror, and then a burst of {{laughter}} from Dick Varley. [...] "Well, well," [...] cried he, [...] "we've got lots o' tea an' sugar, an' some flour; we can git on wi' that till <b>we</b> <b>shoot</b> another buffalo, or a-ha!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Producers Watts and Linde commended {{the enthusiasm}} of the cast; they said of the shoot, [...] "The South Australian desert {{environment}} can be a tough one to work in, particularly for those coming from a Northern Hemisphere winter but both {{the cast and crew}} have thrown themselves into the <b>shoot.</b> <b>We</b> are <b>shooting</b> {{in some of the most}} haunting and stunning landscapes in the world, and are fortunate to have such an exceptional cast and a truly talented crew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital, Dick! {{that would}} be just the thing; don't you think so, Dunlop? If they haven't got the shield, <b>we</b> can <b>shoot</b> them down, so either way we may as well make a sortie." ...|$|R
