5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The animal is a capable swimmer and <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E
5|$|Self-managed work teams (also {{referred}} to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine how they will accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route they <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process. They also select their own members and evaluate the members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} two families, {{one in each}} {{half-hour of}} the episode, preparing their family recipe while the professional chefs cook a restaurant {{version of the same}} meal. The family begins by revealing the dish they have selected to cook to the chefs as well as how longer they think it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> prepare it. The chefs are then given {{the same amount of time}} to create their own version. Once the first cook-off is complete, the second family is brought out, and the procedure is repeated with their own meal. After the second cook-off, the judges reveal the winning dish from each round. If the family's home cooked meal beats the chefs' professional version, the family wins $25,000; if the chefs win, the family receives $1,000 worth of kitchen supplies.|$|E

50|$|The {{critical}} response time, {{sometimes called}} the flyback time, is the time it <b>takes</b> <b>to</b> queue a new ready task and restore {{the state of the}} highest priority task to running.

In some fields, however, the big O notation (number 2 in the lists above) would be used more commonly than the Big Theta notation (bullets number 3 in the lists above). For example, if T(n) represents the running time of a newly developed algorithm for input size n, the inventors and users of the algorithm might {{be more inclined to}} put an upper asymptotic bound on how long it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> run without making an explicit statement about the lower asymptotic bound.|$|E

The 2009-2011 terminal renovation did not include a customs facility, nor did US Customs & Border Protection open an office at the airport until 2014. However, construction is now underway for a passenger customs facility that will be linked to Gate A9 via a walkway. This facility is scheduled to open in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Software {{development}} is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain how long it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up {{a significant portion of}} its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.|$|E

Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.|$|E
25|$|These ants are {{not hard}} to control, and most ant killers will solve problems, {{especially}} if controlled {{as soon as the}} problem is noticed. At this point, they could be put under control in just a few days. However, the longer someone waits, the larger the population is and the longer it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> control the situation, possibly a few weeks. Standing water should be eliminated, as odorous house ants are attracted to moisture. Plants should be trimmed back so they cannot be used to get inside. Cracks, holes and joints should be sealed with polyurethane foam or caulk, especially those that are near the ground. Firewood, rocks and other materials should not be stored next to a home because it encourages nest building. People should {{be on the lookout for}} these ants in late winter and early spring (particularly after rain), as this is when they most commonly appear.|$|E

In {{order to reduce}} production costs, a new game was also introduced to replace the roulette wheel, which is called [...] "The Vortex". In this game, the last contestant remaining must predict how long a ball <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> descend a 'mini velodrome'. If a contestant wins, {{he or she will}} receive a rolling jackpot starting at £500,000. This increases by £500,000 for the next show if the jackpot is not won.

500|$|Forensic chemists {{rely on a}} {{multitude}} of instruments to identify unknown substances found at a scene. [...] Different methods {{can be used to}} determine the identity of the same substance, and {{it is up to the}} examiner to determine which method will produce the best results. [...] Factors that forensic chemists might consider when performing an examination are the length of time a specific instrument <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> examine a substance and the destructive nature of that instrument. They prefer using nondestructive methods first, to preserve the evidence for further examination. [...] Nondestructive techniques can also be used to narrow down the possibilities, making it more likely that the correct method will be used the first time when a destructive method is used.|$|E
500|$|For most {{applications}} of hashing, {{it is necessary}} to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed, rather than once when its object is created. In such applications, random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values, because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes. And cryptographic hash functions (which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables. Instead, other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised. These methods compute the hash function quickly, and can be proven to work well with linear probing. In particular, linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of -independent hashing, a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any -tuple of distinct keys to any -tuple of indexes. The parameter [...] {{can be thought of as}} a measure of hash function quality: the larger [...] is, the more time it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions.|$|E

AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> them like a fish to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility you get from Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E
