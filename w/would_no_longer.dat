5|$|In 1965, Richard Bellman {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} a database to solve chess and checkers endgames using retrograde analysis. Instead of analyzing forward from the position currently on the board, the database would analyze backward from positions where one player was checkmated or stalemated. Thus, a chess computer <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> need to analyze endgame positions during the game because they were solved beforehand. It <b>would</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> make mistakes because the tablebase always played the best possible move.|$|E
