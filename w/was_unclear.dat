5|$|In late June 2006, before Booker took office, New Jersey {{investigators}} foiled a plot {{to assassinate}} Booker led by Bloods gang leaders inside four New Jersey state prisons. The motive for the plot <b>was</b> <b>unclear,</b> but was described variously {{as a response to}} the acrimonious campaign and to Booker's campaign promises to take a harder line on crime.|$|E
5|$|Parents of {{children}} with Asperger syndrome can typically trace differences in their children's development to as early as 30 months of age. Developmental screening during a routine check-up by a general practitioner or pediatrician may identify signs that warrant further investigation. The United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there are no concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Columbia {{report also}} found a failure in journalistic {{standards}} by either not making contact with the people they were publishing derogatory information about, or when they did, by not providing enough context {{for people to be}} able to offer a meaningful response. The report also states that the article misled readers with quotes where attribution <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> and used pseudonyms inappropriately as a way to address these shortcomings.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} anti–tumor {{necrosis}} factor medications such as infliximab and etanercept <b>are</b> <b>unclear</b> and possibly harmful. Evidence <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> for pentoxifylline. Propylthiouracil {{may result in}} harm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{etymology}} of Salwick <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b> The [...] "wick" [...] {{may come}} from Old English wic, meaning an earlier Romano-British settlement specialised in farming; but the [...] "Sal(w)" [...] element <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of laxatives for constipation in those receiving palliative care <b>is</b> <b>unclear,</b> {{as it has}} not been sufficiently studied. The comparative {{effectiveness of}} different laxatives in this group also <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> as of 2015.|$|R
5|$|The amended Constitution of Singapore also {{provided}} for a Council of Ministers {{appointed by the}} Governor upon {{the recommendation of the}} Chief Minister, consisting of three unelected Official Members and six Elected Members. As the Constitution <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> on the powers of the ministers, the discretion to make crucial decisions and formulate policies was understood to reside in the Governor and the Official Members.|$|E
5|$|A heavy chick {{mortality}} at a {{large and}} important colony of the magnificent frigatebird, located on Île du Grand Connétable off French Guiana, was recorded in summer 2005. Chicks showed nodular skin lesions, feather loss and corneal changes, with around half the year's progeny perishing across the colony. An alphaherpesvirus was isolated and provisionally named Fregata magnificens herpesvirus, though it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether it caused the outbreak or affected birds already suffering malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> how old the actor playing the new Doctor would be.|$|E
50|$|Child {{pornography}} {{is considered a}} trafficking crime in Syria, but <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> if this includes simple possession. The penalties for child pornography are also unknown and it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> if anyone <b>was</b> ever prosecuted for child pornography.|$|R
5000|$|The exact date of Young's death <b>is</b> <b>unclear,</b> though presumably {{after the}} {{publication}} date of her memoir in 1993. (The memoir ends with the Hiss Case, circa 1950; it <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> as to when she wrote it.) ...|$|R
30|$|T in {{rhesus monkey}} <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> how big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Canavan {{became the}} acting {{laboratory}} director at Boston Psychopathic after his death. In 1925 she published Elmer Ernest Southard and His Parents: A Brain Study, following the postmortem dissections of Southard's brain {{and those of}} his parents. Canavan undertook the study to examine hereditary links in brain structure. Southard had a prominent frontal lobe, which she associated with his planning ability. Canavan noted small olfactory tracts, and said that Southard had difficulty detecting certain smells. The arteries {{at the base of}} his brain were small, but the significance of this finding <b>was</b> <b>unclear.</b> The distinctive features of Southard's brain did not appear in those of his mother or father.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} Biikebrennen <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{future of}} the {{lighthouse}} <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b> Though it <b>was</b> agreed upon that access to the historic lighthouse would continue, the Department of Defence, the agency governing the site, originally fenced it and access was limited. It <b>is</b> <b>unclear</b> what the exact restrictions are at this point. The structures on the location were put on sale, and {{the outcome of this}} <b>is</b> also <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} these coins <b>is</b> <b>unclear.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, the area's legal and {{political}} status was disputed. The Treaty of Paris, which ended the American Revolutionary War in 1783, had defined the northern border between the United States and Canada based on the inaccurate Mitchell Map. Ownership of the area between Lake of the Woods and Lake Superior <b>was</b> <b>unclear,</b> with the United States claiming the border was further north at the Kaministiquia River and Canada claiming it was further south beginning at the Saint Louis River. In 1842, the Webster–Ashburton Treaty clarified {{the border between the}} United States and Canada using the old trading route running along the Pigeon River and Rainy River (today the BWCAW's northern border).|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} of turmoil, it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> who {{actually}} governed the colonies: Joseph I, the shadow government representing Ferdinand VII, the colonial officials, or revolutionaries in each province. The Mexican War of Independence began in 1810 at the instigation of Miguel Hidalgo. Fearing that the revolution would reach colonial Texas, governor Manuel María de Salcedo ordered the Texas borders closed to all foreigners. He was soon reversed by his uncle, the Commandant General. Revolutionaries soon overthrew and imprisoned Salcedo, and a new government was established in Texas. Salcedo persuaded Ignacio Elizondo (his jailer) {{to return to the}} royalist cause and the two organized a counter-coup. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which {{determined the}} conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, or Music City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position <b>was</b> <b>unclear,</b> and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> if Beth Israel, {{which had}} already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of their Psychoville, writers Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith were commissioned to produce two series for the BBC by controllers Janice Hadlow and Cheryl Taylor, partially in response to Sky beginning to produce comedy. At the time, it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether this would be two series of Inside No. 9, then known by the working title Happy Endings, or a series of Inside No. 9 {{and a series of}} some other programme. Inside No. 9 was to be produced by a BBC team, which was later revealed to be David Kerr (director), Jon Plowman (executive producer) and Adam Tandy (producer).|$|E
5|$|In January 1531, Campeggio was {{dismissed}} as cardinal protector, {{although it did}} not become public knowledge until May. At first it <b>was</b> <b>unclear</b> whether Henry VIII intended to appoint a successor, with Giovanni Domenico de Cupis emerging as an active candidate in March 1532. The king favoured Alessandro Farnese (future Pope Paul III), and instructed his ambassadors on 21 March to offer it to Farnese, and then de Cupis or Giovanni del Monte (future Pope Julius III) {{in the event that}} Farnese declined or was not approved.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections <b>was</b> <b>unclear,</b> McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
