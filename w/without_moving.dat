5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> the gun, a lengthy process {{particularly if the}} gun then needed to be re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E

During the three-day docking, the Russian, Canadian, and American crew transferred supplies and equipment between Atlantis and Mir, moved several long-term experiments, and upgraded the station with new equipment, particularly during {{the installation of the}} docking module.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game were not significantly developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E

5|$|Detective Mode, {{allowing}} {{the investigation of}} crimes, was not considered an improvement by Kotaku and GameSpot; while they considered it a good idea, its execution was minimal since a player simply looks for the next highlighted piece of evidence rather than solving a puzzle. Game Informer liked it, {{saying that they were}} complicated and showed how Batman analyzes a crime scene. The combat system received mixed reviews. The shock gloves were criticized as overpowered and making fights too easy, allowing Batman unblockable attacks (instantly disabling most opponents) and removing the need for tactics. Reviewers said that changes to combat punished more than challenged; greater enemy numbers and variety made sustaining an attack difficult, and (combined with an array of gadgets which hindered—rather than damaged—enemies) made encounters long and repetitive. Joystiq noted that the game emphasized combat over stealth. Kotaku called the combat rating system distracting screen clutter which broke the player's concentration, but GameFront said that the system was positive reinforcement for successful fights. The stealth sections were considered of similar quality to previous installments; their unchanged function left the methods of obtaining victory the same, making for a rote experience. The Remote Claw was criticized for making stealth sections too easy, allowing multiple enemies to be disabled <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> from the player's starting position.|$|E

25|$|Because {{keyboards}} {{have only}} a limited number of keys, English keyboards do not have keys for accented characters. The concept of dead key, a key that modified the meaning of the next key press, was developed to overcome this problem. This acute accent key was already present on typewriters where it typed the accent <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> the carriage, so a normal letter could be written on the same place.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, {{artists like}} Me'shell Ndegeocello and the (predominantly UK-based) acid jazz {{movement}} including artists and bands such as Jamiroquai, Incognito, Galliano, Omar, Los Tetas and the Brand New Heavies carried on with strong elements of funk. However, they never {{came close to}} reaching the commercial success of funk in its heyday, {{with the exception of}} Jamiroquai whose album Travelling <b>Without</b> <b>Moving</b> sold about 11.5 million units worldwide. Meanwhile, in Australia and New Zealand, bands playing the pub circuit, such as Supergroove, Skunkhour and the Truth, preserved a more instrumental form of funk.|$|E
25|$|Since {{there are}} no {{punctuation}} marks in Classical Chinese, {{it can be difficult}} to conclusively determine where one sentence ends and the next begins. Moving a full-stop a few words forward or back or inserting a comma can profoundly alter the meaning of many passages, and such divisions and meanings must be determined by the translator. Some editors and translators argue that the received text is so corrupted (from originally being written on one-line bamboo strips linked with silk threads) that it is impossible to understand some chapters <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> sequences of characters from one place to another.|$|E

25|$|For much of {{the last}} quarter century, the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale {{convection}} currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere. This theory was launched by Arthur Holmes and some forerunners in the 1930s and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of Alfred Wegener {{in the early years of}} the century. However, despite its acceptance, it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static Earth <b>without</b> <b>moving</b> continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.|$|E
25|$|TSA rules {{state that}} if you move your fire demon next to an {{opposing}} fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it <b>without</b> <b>moving)</b> is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.|$|E
25|$|Braille {{was based}} on a tactile {{military}} code called night writing, developed by Charles Barbier in response to Napoleon's demand for a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source. In Barbier's system, sets of 12 embossed dots encoded 36 different sounds. It proved to be too difficult for soldiers to recognize by touch and was rejected by the military. In 1821 Barbier visited the Royal Institute for the Blind in Paris, where he met Louis Braille. Braille identified two major defects of the code: first, by representing only sounds, the code was unable to render the orthography of the words; second, the human finger could not encompass the whole 12-dot symbol <b>without</b> <b>moving,</b> and so could not move rapidly from one symbol to another. Braille's solution was to use 6-dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet.|$|E
