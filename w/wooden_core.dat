5|$|The <b>wooden</b> <b>core</b> {{gives the}} bow its shape and {{dimensional}} stability. It is often made of multiple pieces, joined with animal glue in V-splices, so the wood must accept glue well. Pieced construction allows the sharp bends that many designs require, {{and the use}} of woods with different mechanical properties for the bending and nonbending sections.|$|E

25|$|In the Romanesque period {{free-standing}} statues, typically {{about half}} life-size, of the enthroned Madonna and Child were an original Western development, since monumental sculpture was forbidden by Orthodoxy. The Golden Madonna of Essen of c. 980 {{is one of}} the earliest of these, made of gold applied to a <b>wooden</b> <b>core,</b> and still the subject of considerable local veneration, as is the 12th century Virgin of Montserrat in Catalonia, a more developed treatment.|$|E
25|$|We know Charlemagne had {{a life-size}} {{crucifix}} with {{the figure of}} Christ in precious metal in his Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and many such objects, all now vanished, are recorded in large Anglo-Saxon churches and elsewhere. The Golden Madonna of Essen and a few smaller reliquary figures are now all that remain of this spectacular tradition, completely outside Byzantine norms. Like the Essen figure, these were presumably all made of thin sheets of gold or silver supported by a <b>wooden</b> <b>core.</b>|$|E

50|$|Ultrasonic systems cannot work on wooden-hulled vessels, or vessels {{made from}} ferro-cement. Vessels with foam or <b>wooden</b> <b>cored</b> {{composite}} hulls will require modification to the hull {{in the specific}} locations that the transducers are to be installed. Ultrasonic systems will work with reduced effectiveness on vibration isolated fittings, such as sterndrives. This is because the hull must pass the ultrasound waves from the transducer located inside the hull through to the water, and these materials act to dampen the amplitude of ultrasonic waves.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{production}} of skis with <b>wooden</b> <b>cores</b> has increased due to changes in customer awareness concerning ecological issues and rising raw material costs for mineral oil resources. The preparation of ski surfaces {{is one of the}} main expense factors in {{the production}} of skis. Thus, one perspective of the AMER SPORTS CORPORATION is to treat wood surfaces with laser beams to develop new aesthetic possibilities in ski design. This study deals with different laser treatments for samples from various wood species: beech, ash, lime, and spruce. The parameters investigated are laser beam intensity and number of laser points on the surface. To evaluate the aesthetic changes, the CIELab color measurements were applied. Changes in the main wood components were observed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) using an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) unit. The results show that the laser treatments on wood surfaces have an influence on wood color and the chemical composition. Especially the intensity of laser beams affects the color changes in different patterns for the parameters observed. These findings will be useful to develop innovative design possibilities of wood surfaces for ski cores as well as for further product design applications (e. g., mass customization) ...|$|R
25|$|Timpani are {{typically}} struck {{with a special}} type of drum stick called a timpani stick or timpani mallet. Timpani sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from hardwood or bamboo but may also be made from aluminum or carbon fiber. The head can be constructed {{from a number of}} different materials, though felt wrapped around a <b>wooden</b> <b>core</b> is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other wrap materials include chamois. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|The statue {{measures}} 74 centimetres (29inches) in height; {{the pedestal}} is 27 centimetres (10.6inches) in width. The {{core of the}} sculpture was carved from {{a single piece of}} wood, most likely from a poplar tree, though earlier art historians have assumed it to be pear, plum or lime. The sculpture’s surface is entirely covered with sheets of gold leaf less than 0.25 millimetres (0.01in) thick, which are held in place by minute golden bolts. The size of the individual gold leaves varies to suit the surface texture. The faces of both mother and child are pounded out of one single leaf each. The coloured eyes of the figures are made of cloisonné enamel. While the eyes of the mother are inset into carved fittings, those of the child are merely pasted on the <b>wooden</b> <b>core.</b> The child’s hand is made of cast silver and was added only in the 14th century; the original right hand is lost. There are traces of original tenth century adornments on the orb in the Virgin's right hand, on the right back leg of the stool, {{as well as on the}} child's book and halo. The agrafe showing an eagle and seemingly pinning Mary’s cloak is an early thirteenth century addition; the fibula beneath has Gothic features and is dated to the fourteenth century.|$|E

40|$|The {{complex of}} buildings, {{located at the}} church of St Primoz above Kamnik, was {{inspected}} to discover wooden constructions suitable for dendrochronological investigation. Wooden constructions {{that were part of}} the church of Sts Primoz. and Felicijan church and its west tower, the separately standing bell tower, the beadle's house, and the church of St Peter were investigated. Timber from the Marian chapel and the storehouse was unsuitable for dendrochronology. The investigations were made on <b>wooden</b> <b>cores</b> taken from the constructions and processed in accordance with standard dendrochronological methods. The roof construction of the main nave of Sts Primoz. and Felicijan is made of silver fir and dates from 1848. The Norway spruce from the outer wall of the beadle. s house dates from 1760. The larch wood from the tower near the Sts Primoz and Felicijan church dates from 1494. The spruce from the roof construction of St Peter's dates from 1499. The timber from the bell tower remained undated. The results of dendrochronological dating were compared to reports on the time of possible construction and reconstructions of the buildings. The dates of the timber construction of the Sts Primoz and Felicijan church and the nearby tower were not men - tioned in any of the studied sources.

40|$|Tannin-based rigid foams {{were shown}} to be good thermal {{insulating}} materials {{for use in the}} cavity of hollow-core wooden doors and other wooden cavities. Their thermal insulation capacity is comparable to that of totally synthetic, oil-derived foams, such as polyurethanes, but with the advantage that they do not burn and thus do not emit toxic gases on burning. Exposure to the weather of <b>wooden</b> hollow <b>core</b> structures filled with tannin-based foams confirm that the wood in contact with the foam is not affected by the acidity of the foam due to the already previously demonstrated incorporation of the acid hardener used by coreaction with the hardened polymer network...|$|R

500|$|A {{composite}} bow is {{a traditional}} bow made from horn, wood, and sinew laminated together, cf., laminated bow. The horn is on the belly, facing the archer, and sinew on the outer side of a <b>wooden</b> <b>core.</b> When the bow is drawn, the sinew (stretched on the outside) and horn (compressed on the inside) store more energy than wood for the same length of bow. The strength can be made {{similar to that of}} all-wood [...] "self" [...] bows, with similar draw-length and therefore a similar amount of energy delivered to the arrow from a much shorter bow. However, making a composite bow requires more varieties of material than a self bow, its construction takes much more time, and the finished bow is more sensitive to moisture.|$|E
500|$|Stigand was {{probably}} the most lavish clerical donor of his period, when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale. He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely, and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely, St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, and to his cathedral church at Winchester. The crucifixes given to Ely, Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life-size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and John the Evangelist, as is recorded in the monastic histories, and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere. These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a <b>wooden</b> <b>core.</b> No comparably early rood crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive, though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like the German Gero Cross of around 980, and the Volto Santo of Lucca (renewed with a later figure) which is known to have inspired Leofstan, Abbot of Bury (d. 1065) to create a similar figure, perhaps covered in precious metal, on his return from a visit to Rome. To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar, and a chasuble embroidered in gold [...] "of such inestimable workmanship and worth, that none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable". Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome, there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage. A 12th-century life of Saint Willibrord, written at the Abbey of Echternach in what is now Luxembourg, records that [...] "to this place also came Stigand, the eminent archbishop of the English". In the work, Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints.|$|E

50|$|Its wooden framed, two spar, {{rectangular}} plan wings had {{the same}} airfoil section along the span; {{the upper and lower}} planes {{had the same}} span and chord. They formed an unstaggered, 3.5 m interplane gap, two bay structure braced with two parallel pairs of vertical interplane struts on each side. These struts had <b>wooden</b> box <b>cores</b> and were enclosed in duralumin sheet, airfoil section fairings. The E-5 had a 6.4 m span centre section without dihedral and outer sections with about 2° of dihedral. Inverted V-struts braced the centre of the upper wing to the upper fuselage and the engine mounting frames joined the upper and lower wings at the ends of the centre sections. Ailerons were fitted only on the upper wing and occupied about one third of the span.|$|R
50|$|Cumdachs {{are to be}} {{distinguished}} from the metalwork treasure bindings that probably covered most grand liturgical books of the period—the theft and loss of that covering the Book of Kells (if {{it was not a}} cumdach alone) is recorded. However the designs may well have been very similar; the best surviving Insular example, the lower cover of the Lindau Gospels in the Morgan Library in New York, is also centred on a large cross, surrounded by interlace panels. Treasure bindings were metalwork assemblies tacked onto the wooden boards of a conventional bookbinding, so essentially the same technically as the faces of many cumdachs, which are also attached with tacks to a <b>core</b> <b>wooden</b> box.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In {{this study}} the {{suitability}} of using core veneer made from renewable natural fiber i. e. Non-oven jute felt, which {{is the second most}} widely used natural fiber for manufacturing of plywood was investigated to minimize the gap between demand and supply of wood veneer. The renewable natural hard jute fibre was impregnated with phenolic resin and was used for the manufacture of plywood. Plywood of 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm thick were manufactured by using phenolic resin impregnated jute felt having thickness 16 mm of 1850 GSM (approx.) as a core in place of the natural wood veneer. From the study, it can be inferred that PF Resin impregnated Non oven jute felt as a natural fibre can suitably replace the <b>wooden</b> glue <b>core</b> veneer to manufacture ply board up to 80 % as an alternative substitute of wood. The physico-mechanical properties such as surface roughness, moisture content, density, water absorption, swelling, compressive strength, tensile strength, static bending strength, glue shear strength, of the plywood manufactured by using jute felt as core veneer with different resin dilution have been studied. Data revels that most of the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood showed satisfactory results meeting the requirement of different grades of plywood tested as per IS: 1734 - 1983. The accelerated study of the glued core after impregnation with jute felt have been carried out for three months before plywood manufacture after storing it in proper temperature and humidity. The data revealed that there is no appreciable change in bond quality and mechanical properties of the plyboard manufactured after storing the veneer up to 30 days. The study concluded that wood substituted jute composites could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves where utilization of renewable resources will be beneficiary for plywood industries to meet the challenges during scarcity of veneer by reducing the cost of imported veneer...|$|R
2500|$|Hand {{planes are}} ancient, {{originating}} {{thousands of years}} ago. Early planes were made from wood with a rectangular slot or mortise cut across {{the center of the}} body. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge. The wedge was tapped into the mortise and adjusted with a small mallet, a piece of scrap wood or with the heel of the user's hand. Planes of this type have been found in excavations of old sites as well as drawings of woodworking from medieval Europe and Asia. The earliest known examples of the woodworking plane have been found in Pompeii although other Roman examples have been unearthed in Britain and Germany. The Roman planes resemble modern planes in essential function, most having iron wrapping a <b>wooden</b> <b>core</b> top, bottom, front and rear and an iron blade secured with a wedge. [...] One example found in Cologne has a body made entirely of bronze without a <b>wooden</b> <b>core.</b> [...] A Roman plane iron used for cutting moldings was found in Newstead, England. Histories prior to these examples are not clear although furniture pieces and other woodwork found in Egyptian tombs show surfaces carefully smoothed with some manner of cutting edge or scraping tool. [...] There are suggestions that the earliest planes were simply wooden blocks fastened to the soles of adzes to effect greater control of the cutting action.|$|E
2500|$|The hammer {{heads in}} Cristofori's mature pianos (A) {{are made of}} paper, curled into a {{circular}} coil and secured with glue, and surmounted by a strip of leather at the contact point with the string. According to harpsichord maker and scholar Denzil Wraight, such hammers {{have their origin in}} [...] "15th-century paper organ pipe technology". The purpose of the leather is presumably to make the hammers softer, thus emphasizing the lower harmonics of string vibration by maintaining a broad area of contact at impact. The same goal of softness was achieved in later 18th-century pianos by covering the wooden hammers with soft leather, and in mid-19th-century and later instruments by covering a <b>wooden</b> <b>core</b> with a thick layer of compressed felt.|$|E
2500|$|According to Goscelin, while Spearhafoc {{was working}} on metal figures at St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, he lost a {{valuable}} ring given him by Edward's queen, and Godwin's daughter, Edith of Wessex, presumably as materials to use in his project. [...] In his distress, he prayed to Saint Letard, buried in the church, after which the ring was found. [...] In gratitude, he adorned Letard's tomb with [...] "statues of enormous size and beauty" [...] of the saint and Queen Bertha of Kent, whose chaplain Letard had been. [...] From other mentions it would seem such a description would mean the statues were at least approaching life-size. [...] The miracle clearly added to his fame, and may have made him seem a more suitable candidate for elevation as bishop. [...] For the art historian, {{it is one of}} a handful of references to large metal statues, other than on crucifixes, in Anglo-Saxon England, and the only one which associates them with a tomb or reliquary. [...] One of the other mentions says that a different figure was made of thin gold and silver sheets supported by a <b>wooden</b> <b>core,</b> presumably in a similar fashion to the Golden Madonna of Essen, and some other Continental survivals.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, the {{lighthouse}} continued to burn, despite the most strenuous efforts made to save it.

But, indeed, even if this had been effected, the efforts that could have been made with the small fire-engines at that time in use, would have been utterly useless. The fire gradually descended to the different courses of solid timber, the well-hole of the staircase assisting the draught, and the outside timbers and inside mast, or <b>wooden</b> <b>core,</b> forming a double connecting link whereby the devouring element was carried to the very bottom of the building, with a heat so intense that the courses of Cornish moor-stone were made red hot.|$|E
