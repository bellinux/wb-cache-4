5|$|The {{rediscovery of}} Gregor Mendel's laws of {{inheritance}} in 1900 ignited a fierce debate between two camps of biologists. In one camp were the Mendelians, who {{were focused on}} discrete variations {{and the laws of}} inheritance. They were led by William Bateson (<b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> word genetics) and Hugo de Vries (<b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> word mutation). Their opponents were the biometricians, who were interested in the continuous variation of characteristics within populations. Their leaders, Karl Pearson and Walter Frank Raphael Weldon, followed in the tradition of Francis Galton, who had focused on measurement and statistical analysis of variation within a population. The biometricians rejected Mendelian genetics on the basis that discrete units of heredity, such as genes, could not explain the continuous range of variation seen in real populations. Weldon's work with crabs and snails provided evidence that selection pressure from the environment could shift the range of variation in wild populations, but the Mendelians maintained that the variations measured by biometricians were too insignificant to account for the evolution of new species.|$|E
5|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), {{where he was}} befriended by the eminent mathematician Norbert Wiener (<b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term cybernetics). He began writing science fiction at age 18 and sold his first stories quickly. From January 1930 to June 1931, Amazing published six of his short stories, one novel, and six letters. Thus he was a well-known pulp writer at 21 – but he had failed German and MIT had dismissed him. After one year at Duke University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics in 1932.|$|E
5|$|The higher-level {{classification}} of millipedes is presented below, based on Shear, 2011, and Shear & Edgecombe, 2010 (extinct groups). Recent cladistic and molecular studies have challenged the traditional classification schemes above, {{and in particular}} the position of the orders Siphoniulida and Polyzoniida is not yet well established. The placement and positions of extinct groups (†) known only from fossils is tentative and not fully resolved.

5|$|In {{the course}} of the few centuries up until the current version of 1957, the coat of arms has {{undergone}} some distinctly visible changes. While some 15th-century portrayals already show a child figure instead of the monk, the monk in representations onwards began to lose its serious disposition, with curly hair and a more youthful-looking face. By the 18th century and especially the 19th century, the monk had been minimised into the Münchner Kindl, Bavarian for Munich Child, a reference to the figure first documented in 1727, although it is not clear when it appeared on the coat of arms for the first time or <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term. The transformation was brought about by artists such as sculptors and painters as well as copper and seal engravers, as opposed to a legal order.|$|E

25|$|Based on {{features}} such as the double row of pterygoid ("flanged") teeth on the palate, the loosely hinged jaw, modified/reduced limbs and probable methods of locomotion, many researchers believe that snakes share a common marine ancestry with mosasaurs, a suggestion advanced in 1869 by Edward Drinker Cope, <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term Pythonomorpha to unite them. The idea lay dormant {{for more than a}} century, to be revived in the 1990s. Recently, the discovery of Najash rionegrina, a fossorial snake from South America, cast doubt on the marine origin hypothesis.|$|E

25|$|Oscar Montelius, <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> {{term used}} for the period, divided it into six {{distinct}} sub-periods in his piece Om tidsbestämning inom bronsåldern med särskilt avseende på Skandinavien ("On Bronze Age dating with particular focus on Scandinavia") published in 1885, which is still in wide use. His absolute chronology has held up well against radiocarbon dating, with the exception that the period's start is closer to 1700 BC than 1800 BC, as Montelius suggested. For Central Europe a different system developed by Paul Reinecke is commonly used, as each area has its own artifact types and archaeological periods.|$|E
25|$|As {{circumscribed}} {{within the}} Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system Asparagales {{is the largest}} order within the monocotyledons, with 14 families, 1,122 genera and about 25,000–42,000 species, thus accounting for about 50% of all monocots and 10–15% of the flowering plants (angiosperms). The attribution of botanical authority for the name Asparagales belongs to Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link (1767 – 1851) <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> word 'Asparaginae' in 1829 for a higher order taxon that included Asparagus although Adanson and Jussieau had also done so earlier (see History). Earlier circumscriptions of Asparagales attributed the name to Bromhead (1838), {{who had been the}} first to use the term 'Asparagales'.|$|E
25|$|In 1902, {{a series}} of {{philosophical}} papers was published in Germany by Dr. Heinrich Pudor, under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term Nacktkultur. In 1906 {{he went on to}} write a three volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing. Richard Ungewitter (Nacktheit, 1906, Nackt, 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view. Major promoters of these ideas included Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.|$|E

25|$|It was Huxley <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> {{terms the}} new {{synthesis}} and evolutionary synthesis; he also invented the term cline in 1938 {{to refer to}} species whose members fall {{into a series of}} sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area. The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull Larus round the Arctic zone. This cline {{is an example of a}} ring species.Some of Huxley's last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics. He noted how surprisingly widespread polymorphism is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs, brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.|$|E
25|$|A {{much larger}} number of firestorms, in the thousands, was the initial {{assumption}} of the computer modelers <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term in the 1980s. These were speculated to be a possible result of any large scale employment of counter-value airbursting nuclear weapon use during an American-Soviet total war. This {{larger number of}} firestorms, which are not in themselves modeled, are presented as causing nuclear winter conditions {{as a result of}} the smoke inputted into various climate models, with the depths of severe cooling lasting for as long as a decade. During this period, summer drops in average temperature could be up to 20°C (36°F) in core agricultural regions of the US, Europe, and China, and as much as 35°C (63°F) in Russia. This cooling would be produced due to a 99% reduction in the natural solar radiation reaching the surface of the planet in the first few years, gradually clearing over the course of several decades.|$|E
25|$|Stochastic {{processes}} {{may be used}} {{in music}} to compose a fixed piece or may be produced in performance. Stochastic music was pioneered by Iannis Xenakis, <b>who</b> <b>coined</b> <b>the</b> term stochastic music. Specific examples of mathematics, statistics, and physics applied to music composition are the use of the statistical mechanics of gases in Pithoprakta, statistical distribution of points on a plane in Diamorphoses, minimal constraints in Achorripsis, the normal distribution in ST/10 and Atrées, Markov chains in Analogiques, game theory in Duel and Stratégie, group theory in Nomos Alpha (for Siegfried Palm), set theory in Herma and Eonta, and Brownian motion in N'Shima. Xenakis frequently used computers to produce his scores, such as the ST series including Morsima-Amorsima and Atrées, and founded CEMAMu. Earlier, John Cage and others had composed aleatoric or indeterminate music, which is created by chance processes but does not have the strict mathematical basis (Cage's Music of Changes, for example, uses a system of charts based on the I-Ching). Lejaren Hiller and Leonard Issacson used generative grammars and Markov chains in their 1957 Illiac Suite. See: Generative music.|$|E
