And strange stories began to fly about like night-birds; you will not search for a missing woman without rousing them. Why had she gone off to London without telling anyone? Had Corp concocted that story about her father to blind them? Had she really been as far as London? Have you seen Sandys?--he's back.

60|$|In the old times, the {{painters}} of these legendary scenes and subjects could always reckon securely on certain associations and certain sympathies {{in the minds}} of the spectators. We have outgrown these associations, we repudiate these sympathies. We have taken these works from their consecrated localities, in which they once held each their dedicated place, and we have hung them in our drawing-rooms and our dressing-rooms, over our pianos and our sideboards, and now <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> to us? That Magdalene weeping amid her hair, who once spoke comfort to the soul of the fallen sinner,--that Sebastian, arrow-pierced, whose upward ardent glance, spoke of courage and hope to the tyrant-ridden serf--that poor tortured slave to whose aid St. Mark comes sweeping down from above--can they speak to us of nothing save flowing lines, and correct drawing, and gorgeous colour? Must we be told that one is a Titian, the other a Guido, the third a Tintoret, before we dare to melt into compassion or admiration? or the moment we refer to their ancient religious signification and influence, must it be with disdain or with pity? This, as it appears to me, is to take not a rational, but rather a most irrational, as well as a most irreverent, view of the question: it is to confine the pleasure and improvement to be derived from works of art within very narrow bounds; it is to seal up a fountain of the richest poetry, and to shut out a thousand ennobling and inspiring thoughts. Happily there is a growing appreciation of these larger principles of criticism as applied to the study of art. People look at the pictures which hang round their walls, and have an awakening suspicion that there is more in them than meets the eye--more than mere connoisseurship can interpret; and that they have another, a deeper significance than has been dreamed of by picture dealers and picture collectors, or even picture critics.--Introd. xxiii.|$|E
6000|$|He is the Word of God--by Him God {{has spoken}} to man in all ages. He taught Adam,--He spoke to Abraham as a man speaketh with his friend. It was He Jehovah, whom we call Jesus, whom Moses and the seventy elders saw--saw with their bodily eyes on Mount Sinai, who spoke to them with human voice from amid the {{lightning}} and the rainbow. It must have been only He, the Word, by whom God the Father utters Himself to man, for no man hath seen God at any time; only the Word, the only-begotten Son, {{who is in the}} bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him. And who put into the mouth of David those glorious Psalms--the songs in which all true men for three thousand years have found the very things they longed to speak themselves and could not? Who but Christ the Word of God, the Lord, as David calls Him, put a new song into the mouth of His holy poet,--the sweet singer of Israel? Who spake by the prophets, again? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> themselves?--"The Word of the Lord came to me, saying." [...] And then, when the Spirit of God stirred them up, the Word of God gave them speech, and they said the sayings which shall never pass away till all be fulfilled.

And who since then, do you think, has it been who has given to all wise and holy poets, philosophers, and preachers, the power to speak and write the wonderful truths which, by God's grace, they thought out for themselves and for all mankind,--who gave them utterance?--who but Christ, the Lord of men's spirits, the Word of God, who promised to give to all His true disciples a mouth and wisdom, which their enemies should not be able to gainsay or resist? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} find it the same in any State or Territory of the American corner of heaven you choose to go to. I have shot along, a whole week on a stretch, and gone {{millions}} and millions of miles, through perfect swarms of angels, without ever seeing a single white one, or hearing a word I could understand. You see, America was occupied a billion years and more, by Injuns and Aztecs, and that sort of folks, before a white man ever set his foot in it. During the first three hundred years after Columbus's discovery, there wasn't ever more than one good lecture audience of white people, all put together, in America--I mean the whole thing, British Possessions and all; in the beginning of our century there were only 6,000,000 or 7,000,000--say seven; 12,000,000 or 14,000,000 in 1825; say 23,000,000 in 1850; 40,000,000 in 1875. Our death-rate has always been 20 in 1000 per annum. Well, 140,000 died {{the first year of the}} century; 280,000 the twenty-fifth year; 500,000 the fiftieth year; about a million the seventy-fifth year. Now I am going to be liberal about this thing, and consider that fifty million whites have died in America from the beginning up to to-day--make it sixty, if you want to; make it a hundred million-- it's no difference about a few millions one way or t'other. Well, now, you can see, yourself, that when you come to spread a little dab of people like that over these hundreds of billions of miles of American territory here in heaven, it is like scattering a ten-cent box of homoeopathic pills over the Great Sahara and expecting to find them again. You can't expect us to amount to anything in heaven, and we DON'T--now that is the simple fact, and we have got to do the best we can with it. The learned men from other planets and other systems come here and hang around a while, when they are touring around the Kingdom, and then go back to their own section of heaven and write a book of travels, and they give America about five lines in it. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> about us? They say this wilderness is populated with a scattering few hundred thousand billions of red angels, with now and then a curiously complected DISEASED one. You see, they think we whites and the occasional nigger are Injuns that have been bleached out or blackened by some leprous disease or other--for some peculiarly rascally SIN, mind you. It is a mighty sour pill for us all, my friend--even the modestest of us, let alone the other kind, that think they are going to be received like a long-lost government bond, and hug Abraham into the bargain. I haven't asked you any of the particulars, Captain, but I judge it goes without saying--if my experience is worth anything--that there wasn't much of a hooraw made over you when you arrived--now was there?" ...|$|E

The flowing tide of African nationalism sweeps everything before it and constitutes {{a challenge to the}} colonial powers to make a just restitution for the years of injustice and crime committed against our continent.But Africa does not seek vengeance. It is against her very nature to harbor malice. Over two million of our people cry out with one voice of tremendous power. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>say?</b> We do not ask for death for our oppressors; we do not pronounce wishes of ill-fate for our slave-masters; we make an assertion of a just and positive demand; our voice booms across the oceans and mountains, over the hills and valleys, in the desert places and through the vast expanse of mankind’s inhabitations, and it calls out for the freedom of Africa. Africa wants her freedom. Africa must be free. It is a simple call, but it’s also a signal lighting a red warning to those who would tend to ignore it.|$|E
5000|$|Gail Stephens (Kinard), a “wealthy Detroit sportswoman” {{whose father}} was lumber baron Henry Stephens, hired Keyes to build “a {{magnificent}} lodge named ‘The Acorns’ in the quiescent hills of Metamora, far from {{the hustle and bustle}} of the motor city.” Described as a “costly Norwegian hunting lodge,” “an elaborate rural retreat” and a “palatial country estate,” the building is constructed of large logs on the main floor and timber framing with board-and-batten exterior on the upper floor. Ornate murals reference the 19th-century Great Camps and Swiss chalet style of architecture. A massive stone fireplace has an inscription that reads: “They say— <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>say?</b> Who cares what they say?” (Gail Stephens Kinard achieved much notoriety when she reunited with her childhood sweetheart, Dr. Kerwin Kinard, whom she first met as a student in Berlin and hadn’t seen for twenty-five years, and suddenly married shortly thereafter—for which she was served a one-million dollar “alienation of affections” suit in 1932 from Dr. Kinard’s estranged wife, and was “dropped from Detroit's social register of 1933.”) ...|$|E
