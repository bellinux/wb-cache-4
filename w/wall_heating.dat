5000|$|For heating purposes, a floor {{register}} is preferred. This {{is because}} hot air rises, {{and as it}} cools it falls. This creates good air circulation in a room, and helps to maintain a more even temperature as hot and cold air is mixed more thoroughly. Floor registers generally have a grille strong enough for a human being to walk on without damaging the grille. It is rare to find a floor register installed less than 6 in {{from the corner of}} a room. When a floor register is not practical or desired, a wall register is used. The correct placement of <b>wall</b> <b>heating</b> registers is critical. Generally, the heating register will be directly across from an exterior window. The hot air from the register will mix with the cold air coming off the window, cool, and drop to the floor—creating good air circulation. However, the hot air must be pushed from the register with enough force (or [...] "throw") so that it will cross the room and reach the window. If there is too little throw, the hot air will stop moving partway across the room, the cold air from the window will not be heated (creating the feeling of a cool draft), and air circulation will suffer.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} study {{of the effect of}} <b>wall</b> <b>heating</b> or cooling on the linear, transient and secondary growth of instability in channel flow is conducted. The effect of viscosity stratification, heat diffusivity and of buoyancy are estimated separately, with some unexpected results. From linear stability results, it has been accepted that heat diffusivity does not affect stability. However, we show that realistic Prandtl numbers cause a transient growth of disturbances that is an order of magnitude higher than at zero Prandtl number. Buoyancy, even at fairly low levels, gives rise to high levels of subcritical energy growth. Unusually for transient growth, both of these are spanwise-independent and not in the form of streamwise vortices. At moderate Grashof numbers, exponential growth dominates, with distinct Rayleigh-Benard and Poiseuille modes for Grashof numbers upto ∼ 25000, which merge thereafter. <b>Wall</b> <b>heating</b> has a converse effect on the secondary instability compared to the primary, destabilising significantly when viscosity decreases towards the wall.
