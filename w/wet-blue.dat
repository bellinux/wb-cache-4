40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to {{illustrating}} the potential application of enzymes for recycling <b>wet-blue</b> shavings. Two approaches were made in parallel. To recycle <b>wet-blue</b> shavings, the classical method uses grinding, followed by agglomeration and drying.

Practically no chromium was released to the aqueous medium. The agglomerate proved to be useful in shoemaking. The second approach made use of an alkaline protease which completely digested the <b>wet-blue</b> shavings and separated the chromium from the leather. The chromium could then be removed and the protein hydrolysate used as a replacement product for hide finishing. Pilot assays demonstrated the viability of this technology for the leather industry.

40|$|In {{the leather}} {{industry}} fungicides {{are often used}} {{for the protection of}} <b>wet-blue</b> leather. These fungicides are usually only sparingly soluble and are therefore formulated together with surfactants in order to increase their solubility and to ensure an even distribution over the surface of the hide after treatment. Solutions containing both fungicides and surfactant are complex. The nature of these solutions was investigated. By means of UV/Vis spectroscopy and viscometry it was shown that the surfactant and fungicides form micelles and mixed micelles in solution. The nature of these micelles and mixed micelles was dependent on the solution temperature {{as well as on the}} concentrations of the surfactant and fungicides. At the higher temperatures and concentrations transition to large, possibly rod-shaped, mixed micelles occurred. The interaction between the selected fungicides 2 -(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole and n-octyl- 4 -isothiazol- 3 -one with bovine skin collagen in the form of both limed and lightly chromed hide powder in the presence of the non ionic surfactant Triton X - 100 was investigated. Fungicide uptake was determined by difference measurements on the float solutions at regular intervals during treatment. Binding was rapid with equilibrium being established within the first six hours even for the solutions with the highest surfactant concentration. Binding failed to follow a normal mass-action binding-type isotherm approaching a saturation limit, but increased continuously indicating a co-operative effect whereby binding site affinity actually increased with the amount of ligand bound. Binding was accompanied by a drop in the free surfactant in the solution at the higher biocide levels indicating the formation of complex mixed micelles which bind to the collagen fibres. The uptake and antifungal activity of commercial fomulations of the fungicides on chrome-tanned <b>wet-blue</b> leather was investigated at various treatment temperatures. At lower fungicide treatment concentrations, binding tended to follow a typical mass-action type binding isotherm, increasing slightly with temperature. At higher float concentrations, an inflexion point was apparent beyond which uptake showed a marked increase with concentration. This inflexion point, signifying a change in binding characteristics, occurred at progressively lower concentrations with increasing temperature. Antifungal activity in terms of storage periods to onset of fungal growth was determined on the <b>wet-blue</b> leather cuttings immediately after treatment and drainage and also on sample discs after exhaustive extraction of free fungicide using dichloromethane. Storage performance testing of the various treated <b>wet-blue</b> leathers was carried out by different methods. Residual protective periods showed a curvilinear increase with dosage offer and surface uptake. In the low dosage range treatment temperature had only a relatively slight effect in promoting uptake and improving storage protection. At higher dosages, the influence of temperature on uptake and storage protection was greater due to the increase in surface binding of the fungicides at the elevated temperatures. Only a portion of the fungicide uptake was recovered by direct solvent extraction of the treated <b>wet-blue</b> leather. Solvent extraction reduced storage margins. The storage response in relation to fungicide content was, however comparable after extraction, indicating that both irreversibly bound and physically associated fungicide offered effective protection. Results of the study provide further insight into the mode of interaction of fungicide emulsion dispersion with bovine skin collagen, and the importance of the emulsion dispersions and its stability in determining the uptake of fungicide...|$|E

It encompasses a wide palette of applications, from footwear and clothing to upholsteries and different types of furniture [1], [2], [3]. The main constituent of animal skins is collagen, a supramolecular fibrillar protein in the form of a triple helix. This form endows leather with elasticity, good mechanical properties and softness. A major disadvantage resides in the inapplicability of raw animal hides, due to their microbiological instability and decay through rotting. Microbiological stability is obtained through the tanning process, characterized by protein crosslinking and drying afterwards. After tanning the leather exhibits the required properties for the desired specific applications in terms of aspect, availability and sustainability [4], [5]. The study aims to elucidate the thermal decomposition process of chrome-free tanned bovine hide (wet-white) using a new product based on titanium and aluminium salts compared with the same hide tanned by chromium salts (<b>wet-blue).</b> The thermal behavior was studied by dynamic thermogravimetry in nitrogen atmosphere, up to 700 oC.

A polimerização foi conduzida pelo processo em massa, usando CuBr/PMDETA como sistema catalítico e EBP como iniciador. O desempenho destes polímeros sintetizados e um poli(ácido acrílico) obtido via radicalar (comercial, polidisperso) foi avaliado, nos couros <b>wet-blue</b> recurtidos, por meio de testes físico-mecânicos, TGA/DSC, grau de distribuição de acrílicos no couro e MEV. Todos os polímeros aumentaram a estabilidade térmica do couro. O polímero parcialmente hidrolisado apresentou a pior ação recurtente quando comparado com o polímero de mesma massa molar, mas totalmente hidrolisado. O poli(acrilato de sódio) com maior massa molar (Mn = 66. 000 g/mol) desenvolveu os piores resultados em propriedades físicas e penetração nas fibras do couro, enquanto que aquele com menor massa molar (Mn = 6. 100 g/mol) resultou nas melhores propriedades de maciez e resistência física. Os testes relativos ao estudo à oferta de polímero ao couro indicaram uma possibilidade de redução de resíduos nos efluentes quando do uso de poliacrilatos monodispersos, se comparado com os polidispersos.

Actualmente, 80 a 90 % das peles, em todo o mundo, são curtidas com crómio (wet blue), é do interesse de todos a busca por um processo isento de crómio, de forma a obter um couro mais ecológico, o wet white. A pele é formada por uma rede complexa de fibras de colagénio que são estabilizadas através da formação de cross-links inter e intramoleculares, que lhe confere as propriedades físicas. Quando aquecidas em água essas fibras encolhem, devido ao processo de desnaturação, a temperatura à qual ocorre é designada por temperatura de encolhimento (Ts). O curtume vai criar ligações que conferem maior estabilidade às fibras elevando a sua Ts. Uma das vantagens do crómio como agente de curtume é a elevada estabilidade hidrotérmica que confere ao couro, obtendo Ts {{superior}} a 100 ºC. Foram desenvolvidos processos com diferentes agentes de curtume, de forma a encontrar alternativas ao crómio. Efectuaram-se ensaios de curtume mineral, com crómio, zircónio e silicatos; curtume vegetal, com extracto de mimosa, quebracho e genipina; curtume sintético, com tanino sintético, resina acrílica e gluteraldeído; e finalmente curtumes mistos, combinando processos dos curtumes anteriores. Foi avaliada a estabilidade hidrotérmica das peles processadas pelos métodos desenvolvidos pela determinação das Ts (norma ISO 3380 e banho termostatizado). Usou-se a calorimetria diferencial de varrimento (DSC), de forma a determinar a variação de entalpia associada à desnaturação do colagénio. Para um estudo mais detalhado foi realizada a análise dos espectros FTIR-ATR permitindo identificar alterações na estrutura da pele, quer na sequência do processo de curtume, quer após o encolhimento da pele. Os resultados obtidos que permitem propor processos alternativos ao crómio, com elevadas Ts e menos poluentes, um dos quais já com implementação na indústria. The {{environmental concerns}} {{generated by the}} tanning industry focuses on chrome tanning, {{one of the most}} polluting parts of the process. Currently, 80 to 90 % of the hides worldwide are tanned using chrome (<b>wet-blue).</b> The effort to produce chrome-free leather, a wet white, in order to obtain a more ecological leather is increasing. The fibrous structure of hide is formed by a complex matrix of collagen fibers that stabilizes through inter- and intra-molecular cross-links, which gives them physical properties. Shrinkage temperature (Ts), or denaturation, is one aspect of hydrothermal stability that is the response of leather to heat in the presence of water. Tanning process gives fiber higher stability which results on an increasing of the leather Ts. One of the advantages of chrome tanned leather is the high shrinkage temperature, typically above 100 ºC. Other tanning agents were used to develop new ways of finding alternative chromiumfree leather processes. Mineral tanning agents, as chromium, zirconium and silicates; vegetal tanning agents, as genipin, mimosa and quebracho; syntans, acrylic resin, gluteraldehyde and also different combinations of the previous agents were used. The hydrothermal stability of the leather samples was evaluated by measuring the Ts (through ISO 3380 and water bath) and by differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements, allowing the study of enthalpy changes, which are associated with the denaturation of collagen. For a more detailed study a FTIR-ATR spectra analysis were performed to verify changes in the hide structure, resulting from tanning processes as well as of denaturation process. The results of this work showed that other tanning agents, with lower environmental impact, can be effective at increasing the thermal stability of leather. One of the developed processes is already being implemented in the industry...|$|E
40|$|Type I {{collagen}} {{materials are}} used {{in a wide range}} of industrial applications. Some examples include leather for shoes and upholstery, acellular dermal matrix (ADM) materials for surgical applications, and bovine pericardium for the fabrication of heart valve replacements. The structure of these materials is based on a matrix of collagen fibrils, largely responsible for the physical properties and strength of the materials. How the collagen fibrils themselves contribute to the overall bulk properties of these materials is not fully understood. The first part of this work investigates a collagen structure defect in leather, known as looseness. Looseness occurs in around 5 - 10 % of bovine leather, and is a result of the collagen fibril layers separating during processing from raw skin to leather. A greater understanding of why looseness develops in leather and a method of detecting looseness early in processing is needed to save tanners a significant amount on wasted processing time and costs. In addition, an environmentally safe method of disposing of defect and waste leather is sort after since the current method of disposing to landfill is causing environmental concern due to the possibility of chromium leaching from leather into the soil as it biodegrades. Synchrotron based small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) revealed that loose leather has a more aligned and layered collagen fibril arrangement, meaning there is less fibril overlap, particularly in the grain-corium boundary region. This results in larger gaps in the internal structure of loose leather compared with tight. These gaps could be detected using ultrasonic imaging in partially processed pickle and <b>wet-blue</b> hides as well as leather. Incorporating an ultrasound system into the leather processing line could be a viable method for identifying hides deemed to develop looseness earlier in processing, and these could be diverted down a separate processing line or removed. Disposing of waste leather by first forming biochar prior to land fill proved to be an effective way of reducing chromium from leaching into the environment. XAS revealed that heating leather to temperatures above 600 °C in the absence of oxygen formed a char where chromium was bound in the stable form of chromium carbide. The stability of this structure makes chromium less available to form the toxic hexavalent form in the environment and presents a possible alternative option for environmentally safe disposal of leather. The second part to this work looks at the correlation between collagen fibril structure in a range of biomaterials in relation to material strength. Leather, ADM and pericardium are three type I collagen based materials which rely on sufficient strength to carry out their industrial and medical applications. These three materials were studied to try and identify collagen fibril characteristics that relate to high material strength. SAXS on a range of leather samples from various species revealed that collagen fibril diameter had only a small influence over material strength in bovine leather, and no correlation to strength in leather from other species. Therefore it can be said that the influence of fibril orientation on leather strength takes precedence over that of fibril diameter. Fibril diameter, d-spacing and orientation were studied in pericardium using SAXS while simultaneously applying strain. It was revealed collagen materials undergo two distinct stages of deformation when strain is applied and incrementally increased. The first stage, at low strain, involves a re-orientation of fibrils to become more aligned. When strain is increased further, the fibrils themselves take up the strain, causing fibrils to stretch and decrease in diameter. The Poisson ratio of the collagen fibrils was calculated to be 2. 1 ± 0. 7. This high Poisson's ratio indicates the fibrils decrease in diameter at a faster rate than they elongate with strain, and as a result the volume of the fibrils decreases. This feature of collagen could help explain some of the unique behaviours and strength of collagen based materials and could be useful for optimizing industrial applications of collagen materials. ADM materials, derived from human, porcine and bovine skin was the third collagen material studied. SAXS revealed that each species of ADM material had a slightly different collagen fibril arrangement when viewing the samples perpendicular to the surface. Human ADM was highly isotropic in arrangement, porcine was largely anisotropic, and bovine was somewhere in between the two. Bovine has a more layered fibril arrangement edge on and was the strongest material, followed by human ADM, and porcine was significantly weaker. Bovine was also the most porous material of the three. The discovery of the variations in strength, porosity and fibril arrangement between the three types of ADM materials may help medical professionals select the most suitable material for specific surgical procedures and could lead to a greater number of successful surgeries taking place...|$|E

Occurrence of toxic metals in pond and river water affects the lives of local people that depend upon these water sources for their daily requirements. Chromium is one of the toxic heavy metals, which is released into environment in effluents generated from tanneries and other industries. Conventional chemical methods for removal of toxic metals are ineffective when levels of metals in wastewaters are very low (between 10 - 100 ppm). Therefore, use of low cost, natural resources for removal of metal is being preferred over other conventional methods. Many plants have been known to accumulate heavy metals and other nutrients from contaminated waters and can be exploited for polishing of wastewaters. Aquatic macrophytes have been used during the last two decades for water metal removal competing with other secondary treatments, being the principal mechanism for metal uptake adsorption trough roots. As an alternative method, constructed wetlands have emerged as a viable option for addressing a wide range of water quality problems, especially in treating wastewater effluent. In tropical and subtropical regions, because of its abundance and the large biomass produced, the water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) has been studied especially for this purpose. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate two constructed wetland in greenhouse for treating of tannery wastewater effluent, using two autochthonous floating macrophytes Eicchornia crassipes and Salvinia auriculata in order to remediate the contaminated industrial effluent, under natural conditions. The amount of wastewater generated by a tannery industry is ranged 30 - 50 L per kg of processed animal skins. Around of 10 % of all wastewater effluent correspond to initial stage of animal skin processing into leather and 90 % corresponding to intermediate and final process such as washing, neutralization and tinged. This work was performed at a 48 -m 2 greenhouse constructed in the Toledo Campus of the West ParanÃ State University, using wastewater effluents from a Tannery industry located in Toledo County. The experiences were carried out for three different hydraulic removal time: 4, 6 and 8 days. At each collection time, physic-chemical parameters such as Oxygen Chemical Demand (OCD), Inorganic Phosphorus and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN), pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) were determined according to chemical standard methods, and Chromium, Sulfur, Aluminium and Iron total concentrations were calculated by PIXE technique.

40|$|Several imaging {{techniques}} {{are used for}} material inspection such as X-ray radiography, ultrasound imaging or 'normal' image acquisition {{in the range of}} visible light. Thermography uses cameras and sensors for the range of 'therma' infrared radiation delivering thermal images which represent the radiation density emitted from a surface. A surface of a homogeneous solid body cooling down from a state of homogeneous temperature shows homogeneous thermal images. Any inhomogeneities in density, moisture content, thermal conductivity, surface properties or also internal delaminations etc. have an influence on the local heat flux. They appear in the thermal images as cold spots, hot spots or as a pattern corresponding to internal structures. If the samples come homogeneously heated from an industrial process then "passive" thermographic inspection can be performed. Examples are · board products leaving a coating press - detection of foil coating defects · particle streams leaving a dryer - detection of overdried particles for fire protection · raw particle boards - monitoring the density distribution "Active" thermography means that the samples receive a heat pulse before passing the IR camera. This heat pulse may be short (from flashlights) or long (from an IR line source or using hot steam or heating plates) {{but it has to be}} more or less homogeneous. The heat flux from the warm surface goes into the depth of the material as well as (by radiation and convection) to the surrounding. Especially delaminations can be detected like e. g. · Bonding defects in laminate floor panels of composite products made from several layers · Internal defects in structural parts like rotor blades of wind power plants Thermography is an imaging technique and can be used for a quick overview as well as for deeper inspections where several other techniques do no work for certain reasons. Cameras available today are so sensitive that even small temperature differences in the range of 15 mK can be detected. A specific evaluation technique is pulse phase thermography (PPT) : An images series of the cooling phase is acquired so that the intensity as a function of time is obtained for every pixel. The image series is then transferred from the time domain to the frequency domain by pixelwise Fourier transformation. In such a way the contributions from objects in different depths of the material to the surface temperature pattern can be distinguished. WKI has gathered experiences with thermographic material inspection since approx. 10 years. Together with the Research Institute of Leather and Plastic Sheeting (FILK), Freiberg, and the Society for the Promotion of Applied Computer Science (GFaI), Berlin, WKI works in a research project with the objective to develop methods to localize hidden defects in natural materials. Leather and wood may show growth features which are not all visible from the surface and where inspection techniques using infrared radiation and visible light can be combined. Especially for leather it is important to detect defects at the beginning of the value added chain to reject defective material. Therefore, initial investigations were focussed on leather in the "wet " state. Leather samples in different states (raw; wet blue; wet blue but dried; crust) were investigated with active thermography using several methods: · Excitation of stationary samples with a short thermal pulse from a flashlight, · excitation of the samples moving on a conveyor with a continuous line IR source (quartz or carbon lamp), · contact heating with hot plates in a laboratory press. Leather has good thermal insulation properties. Therefore, the surface temperatures of the samples after excitation are in the range of 30 °C L 80 °C, and the cooling periods to be observed are 10 s [...] 100 s, depending on the method of excitation and the sample properties. Thermal image series were acquired using a high-performance or a medium-performance infrared camera and evaluated with the software "FTS Viewer" developed by WKI. Thermal images of <b>wet-blue</b> or dry leather samples acquired during the cooling period show hidden structures which are scarcely or not at all visible by the eye. Depending on the method of excitation, structures closer to the surface (using a flash light) or deeper in the cross section (using a continuous IR source or contact heating) are reflected in the thermal images, but also folds and borders due to the angle of incidence of the thermal radiation. More excitation techniques (contact heating in press devices, steaming) have been tested, new results will be reported in the presentation. For moist leather better results cannot be expected because thermal equilibrium is reached very soon after excitation and therefore no contrasts caused by material anomalies appear in thermal images. For dry leather products, however, the conditions are much better. Further investigations are scheduled for finished products. More findings regarding on-line measurements in a later project phase can be expected if the detection results are correlated with visual defect...|$|E
