500|$|In 2002, Project 86 {{teamed with}} Slayer {{producer}} Matt Hyde {{to record their}} next album. The record was envisioned as a critique of post-9/11 America and the music industry. Formatted as a concept album, it {{told the story of}} a character attempting to find fulfillment in modern culture. [...] "Songs were written and assembled with a certain ebb and flow in mind," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I approached the album like writing chapters in a book." [...] The group spent over 14 months recording demos for Atlantic, which invested nearly $1,000,000 in the project <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> said and done. [...] Because of the pressure to produce radio singles, the sound of the album was quite different from its previous releases, as was Schwab's cryptic lyrics, which represented the frustrations of being stifled creatively and feeling powerless in the process.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} night, the group {{performed}} {{a mix of}} new and older material for {{the third and fourth}} shows. [...] The contrast {{between the first and second}} nights has been noted by Hendrix biographers. [...] Based on interviews with Cox and Miles, concert reviews, and film footage, McDermott and Shadwick conclude that Hendrix was less animated during the third and fourth shows, when he stood mostly in place until the final encores, seemingly concentrating on recording. [...] In frequent interviews and in his autobiography, Bill Graham claimed that his criticism of Hendrix for playing to the audience (although he seems to confuse which shows) spurred him on. However, according to McDermott, Hendrix was already determined to deliver suitable performances to finally settle the bitter legal dispute with Ed Chalpin. [...] All of the six songs that were chosen for Band of Gypsys were recorded during these two shows. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> done, Hendrix cut loose for his last encores with [...] "Wild Thing", [...] "Hey Joe", and [...] "Purple Haze".|$|E
500|$|In 1930, {{there were}} still many who {{questioned}} {{the quality of the}} professional game, claiming the college [...] "amateurs" [...] played with more intensity. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds {{to raise money for the}} unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the superiority of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1930 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win. But from the beginning it was a one way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score, and New York played its backups in the second half. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> over, Coach Rockne told his team, [...] "That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt." [...] The game raised $115,183 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game.*, hapmoran.org, accessed February 14, 2011.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by noted horror author Stephen King. King {{initially}} approached series co-star David Duchovny and {{informed him that}} he loved the show and desired to write an episode. Eventually, he called series creator Chris Carter and expressed his desire to write an episode of Millennium instead. Carter agreed, but once more, King {{changed his mind and}} it was decided that he would write an episode of The X-Files. King sent various drafts to Carter from his home in Maine; the two individuals never actually met one another. King's original story had some issues that Carter rewrote. Carter explained, [...] "Stephen wasn't used to writing for Mulder and Scully [...] the Mulder-and-Scully story in his original draft didn't quite work". Carter separated Mulder and Scully in the finalized draft and helped to finalize the script, hence their dual writing credit on the episode. Kim Manners, the director for the episode, later said, [...] "I was very excited to be able to direct a Stephen King piece, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> said and done, there was very little Stephen King left in it. The nuts and bolts were his, but that was really one of Chris' scripts."

500|$|The New Directions set {{of three}} Jackson family numbers was favorably {{reviewed}} by most critics, though they didn't necessarily agree on which songs were most effective. Bell couldn't decide whether she enjoyed these three songs or the Troubletones mash-up more, and West felt the [...] "choreography on {{the whole thing was}} stellar", and graded it an [...] "A+". Votta singled out [...] "ABC", which demonstrated [...] "what a lovely singer Tina is", and Kubicek said he enjoyed it [...] "mostly because Tina deserves more singing time, and I love the fact that Mike is now an actual singer who gets his own solos". Chaney called it [...] "a solid performance" [...] and gave it a B+, while Futterman wrote that it [...] "felt like a flashback to the New Directions' group performances of yesteryear, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> about an over-the-top, feel-good attitude". The dancing in [...] "Control" [...] was highlighted in many reviews: Hyman and Slezak were complimentary, but Chaney wrote that the [...] "choreography seemed a little awkward and occasionally out of synch", that it was [...] "the least effective of the three Jackson numbers" [...] and added that for her [...] "this felt dated when it could have been retro-fresh"; she graded the song a [...] "C". However, Futterman made mention of the [...] "slick dance moves", and Votta noted that the [...] "jazz band guys" [...] were [...] "holding their own with the background dancing through the whole number". However, for Kubicek, the song [...] "definitely brought down the energy at the middle of their performance". Bell characterized the final song as [...] "an amazing 'Man in the Mirror' cover", and Chaney said it was [...] "the best of their three songs", and gave it an [...] "A−". However, Slezak wrote that it [...] "proved to be a tonally jarring ending to the performance".|$|E

2500|$|The second {{reference}} was excised {{from the}} final version but is of interest {{in that it is}} a rare reference to his father; Beckett’s writing is generally matricentric. The writing breaks down following this sentimental passage where C recalls a fishing trip with his father: “Bring me back to the hot summer evening out in the Bay with my father in the little rowboat, fishing for mackerel with a spinner. To the time <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> still time. ‘Do you remember what they look like?’ ‘Yes, father, all blue and silver.’” When Beckett discussed this with James Knowlson in 1989 he used the exact turn of phrase, “‘fishing for mackerel with a spinner’ … that he had used over thirty years before in his rejected play fragment.” Even accounting for Beckett’s astounding memory this was an exceptionally clear and vivid recollection. In more typical Beckett fashion the image resurfaced in Texts for Nothing: “Yes, I’m here forever, with the spinners and the dead flies, dancing to the tremor of their meshed wings…” ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite former {{guards and}} park rangers {{revealing}} their paranormal experiences at Alcatraz, officials for Alcatraz have publicly dismissed {{the reports of}} ghosts at Alcatraz as nonsense and deny their existence; an official for Alcatraz said in 1994, [...] "These ridiculous ghost stories will stop tourists from visiting. And how can these people say they heard canaries? We don't have any birds in here." [...] Mary Forgione of the Los Angeles Times also stated that [...] "The National Park Service, which operates the island as a tourist site, pooh-poohs this, calling it Hollywood hype." [...] Alcatraz, run by the National Park Service, therefore does not operate an [...] "official ghost tour" [...] for tourists, but such tours, organized by independent parties, are permitted in the prison.

[...] Writing about the performance, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound concluded that [...] "Someone like You", [...] "highlighted the power a bare-bones, booming performance can have in netting people's attention. Simple {{is not a bad}} word, pop music." [...] Giving the performance an A+, Lindsey Ward of Jam! said: [...] "When I learned British chart-topper Adele would be performing at Sunday's awards I thought, 'Whew – at least we're guaranteed five solid, meaningful minutes of quality music television'. I was right; her frill-free performance of breakup ballad Someone Like You was just that." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the performance calling it [...] "one of the best performances of the show." [...] Another writer of the same publication gave the performance a grade of A+ and wrote: [...] "It takes a real super power to make the seizure-inducing lasers stop, and that power's name is Adele. The broadcast temporarily abandoned its frantic mission of nonstop overstimulation, bowing to the 23-year-old English soulstress's soaring, nearly a cappella (well done, subtle piano man) rendition of her heart-wrecking ballad [...] "Someone Like You."
