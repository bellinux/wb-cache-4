50|$|Although {{rare and}} not {{formally}} recognized, a condition known as Amphetamine <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>Psychosis</b> (AWP) may occur upon cessation of substituted amphetamine use and, {{as the name}} implies, involves psychosis that appears on withdrawal from substituted amphetamines. However, unlike similar disorders, in AWP, substituted amphetamines reduce rather than increase symptoms, and the psychosis or mania resolves with resumption of the previous dosing schedule.|$|E

An upregulation of the dopamine D 2 receptor caused by antipsychotic(s) {{is involved in}} the development of DSP. The present study explored the potential roles of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK 6) and β-arrestin 2 (ARRB 2) that are involved in the trafficking of DRD 2 in patients with DSP. Methods: We conducted a genetic association study of GRK 6 /ARRB 2 between the patients with DSP episodes [DSP(+) group: N= 108] and the patients without DSP(-) episodes [DSP(-) group: N= 169] from the total group of patients (N= 333). Based on the patients’ treatment history, a DSP episode was defined as <b>withdrawal</b> <b>psychosis,</b> developed tolerance to antipsychotic effect, and tardive dyskinesia (the remaining 56 patients were excluded due to insufficient information). Results: The results revealed that none of the allelic or genotyping distributions of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of GRK 6 and three SNPs of ARRB 2 showed any significant difference between the DSP(+) and DSP(-) groups. Conclusion: The results suggest that the SNP analyses of these two molecules fail to classify patients into the potential clinical subtype of DSP(+) or DSP(-) group. However, since GRK 6 and ARRB 2 are surely involved in dopamine D 2 receptor metabolism, further studies based on prospective observations of the onset of DSP under specific antipsychotic treatments are needed.

40|$|Synthetic cannabinoids are {{functionally}} {{similar to}} delta 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive principle of cannabis, and bind {{to the same}} cannabinoid {{receptors in the brain}} and peripheral organs. From 2008, synthetic cannabinoids were detected in herbal smoking mixtures sold on websites and in "head shops" under the brand name of Spice Gold, Yucatan Fire, Aroma, and others. Although these products (also known as "Spice drugs" or "legal highs") do not contain tobacco or cannabis, when smoked they produce effects similar to THC. Intoxication, <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>psychosis,</b> and death have been recently reported after consumption, posing difficult social, political, and health challenges. More than 140 different Spice products have been identified to date. The ability to induce strong cannabis-like psychoactive effects, along with {{the fact that they are}} readily available on the Internet, still legal in many countries, marketed as natural safe substances, and undetectable by conventional drug screening tests, has rendered these drugs very popular and particularly appealing to young and drug-naive individuals seeking new experiences. An escalating number of compounds with cannabinoid receptor activity are currently being found as ingredients of Spice, of which almost nothing is known in terms of pharmacology, toxicology, and safety. Since legislation started to control the synthetic cannabinoids identified in these herbal mixtures, many new analogs have appeared on the market. New cannabimimetic compounds are likely to be synthesized in the near future to replace banned synthetic cannabinoids, leading to a "dog chasing its tail" situation. Spice smokers are exposed to drugs that are extremely variable in composition and potency, and are at risk of serious, if not lethal, outcomes. Social and health professionals should maintain a high degree of alertness for Spice use and its possible psychiatric effects in vulnerable people...|$|E

50|$|Approximately 3 {{percent of}} people who are alcohol {{dependent}} experience psychosis during acute intoxication or <b>withdrawal.</b> Alcohol-related <b>psychosis</b> may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism.

25|$|Abrupt or over-rapid {{withdrawal}} from clonazepam {{may result in}} the development of the benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome, causing <b>psychosis</b> characterised by dysphoric manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. Sudden withdrawal may also induce the potentially life-threatening condition, status epilepticus. Anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam in particular, should be reduced in dose slowly and gradually when discontinuing the drug to mitigate withdrawal effects. Carbamazepine has been tested in the treatment of clonazepam withdrawal but was found to be ineffective in preventing clonazepam withdrawal-induced status epilepticus from occurring.|$|R
25|$|Approximately {{three percent}} of people who are {{suffering}} from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or <b>withdrawal.</b> Alcohol related <b>psychosis</b> may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism.

The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as causing psychosocial impairments.|$|R
2500|$|Complications of {{benzodiazepine}} abuse include drug-related deaths due to overdose {{especially in}} combination with other depressant drugs such as opioids. Other complications include: [...] blackouts and memory loss, [...] paranoia, violence and criminal behaviour, risk-taking sexual behaviour, foetal and neonatal risks if taken in pregnancy, [...] dependence, <b>withdrawal</b> seizures and <b>psychosis.</b> Injection of the drug carries risk of: thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, deep and superficial abscesses, pulmonary microembolism, rhabdomyolysis, tissue necrosis, gangrene requiring amputation, hepatitis B and C, [...] as well as blood borne infections such as HIV infection (caused by sharing injecting equipment). Long-term use of benzodiazepines can worsen pre-existing depression and anxiety and may potentially also cause dementia with impairments in recent and remote memory functions.|$|R
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and <b>psychosis.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|R
25|$|Like all benzodiazepines, {{clonazepam}} is a GABA-positive allosteric modulator. One-third {{of individuals}} treated with benzodiazepines {{for longer than}} four weeks develop a dependence on the drug and experience a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. High dosage and long-term use increase the risk and severity of dependence and withdrawal symptoms. <b>Withdrawal</b> seizures and <b>psychosis</b> can occur in severe cases of withdrawal, and anxiety and insomnia can occur in less severe cases of withdrawal. A gradual reduction in dosage reduces {{the severity of the}} benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Due to the risks of tolerance and withdrawal seizures, clonazepam is generally not recommended for the long-term management of epilepsies. Increasing the dose can overcome the effects of tolerance, but tolerance to the higher dose may occur and adverse effects may intensify. The mechanism of tolerance includes receptor desensitization, down regulation, receptor decoupling, and alterations in subunit composition and in gene transcription coding.|$|R
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that alcohol {{dependence}} relates directly to cravings and irritability. Another study has shown that alcohol use is a significant predisposing factor towards antisocial behavior in children. Depression, anxiety and panic disorder are disorders commonly reported by alcohol dependent people. Alcoholism is associated with dampened activation in brain networks responsible for emotional processing (e.g. the amygdala and hippocampus). Evidence that the mental health disorders are often induced by alcohol misuse via distortion of brain neurochemistry is indicated by the improvement or disappearance of symptoms that occurs after prolonged abstinence, although problems may worsen in early withdrawal and recovery periods. Psychosis is secondary to several alcohol-related conditions including acute intoxication and withdrawal after significant exposure. Chronic alcohol misuse can cause psychotic type symptoms to develop, more so than with other drugs of abuse. Alcohol abuse {{has been shown to}} cause an 800% increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a 300% increased risk of psychotic disorders in women which are not related to pre-existing psychiatric disorders. This is significantly higher than the increased risk of psychotic disorders seen from cannabis use making alcohol abuse a very significant cause of psychotic disorders. Approximately 3 percent of people who are alcohol dependent experience psychosis during acute intoxication or <b>withdrawal.</b> Alcohol-related <b>psychosis</b> may manifest itself through a kindling mechanism. The mechanism of alcohol-related psychosis is due to distortions to neuronal membranes, gene expression, as well as thiamin deficiency. It is possible in some cases that alcohol abuse via a kindling mechanism can cause the development of a chronic substance-induced psychotic disorder, i.e. schizophrenia. The effects of an alcohol-related psychosis include an increased risk of depression and suicide as well as psychosocial impairments. However, moderate wine drinking has been shown to lower the risk for depression.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{prevalence}} and nature of presentation of unipolar depression in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). Design/methodology/approach – The PRISMA (2009) checklist for systematic review was followed where possible. Findings – Eight studies were included in the qualitative synthesis from a total of 634 records identified. The quality of the studies was then assessed: the studies all scored either 5 or 6 out of 6. The incidence of depression ranged between studies from 5 to 13 per cent. It was found that depression is more common in DS than the general intellectual disability population; this on a background of mental ill health of all causes being less common in DS. It was suggested that, excluding organic disorders, depression is the most common psychiatric problem in DS. In terms of the nature of depression, the evidence was less clear. Various “vegetative” and biological symptoms were observed, with no fixed pattern. There was evidence for <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms and <b>psychosis.</b> Research limitations/implications – The small number of studies included in this review, and their heterogeneity, highlights the need for further original research in this field. Practical implications – An increased awareness of the frequency of depression in individuals with DS will aid in a timely diagnosis, therefore reduce psychiatric morbidity. Clinicians should be aware of the varied presentation, with no clear clinical picture, in order to maintain a high index of suspicion in an individual presenting with “atypical” symptoms. Originality/value – This review has provided preliminary evidence that depression may be the most commonly experienced psychiatric disorder in DS...|$|R
50|$|Delirium {{has been}} noted from {{discontinuation}} from clorazepate A benzodiazepine dependence occurs in approximately one third of patients who take benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which is characterised by a withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. When used for seizure control, tolerance may manifest itself with an increased rate of seizures as well {{an increased risk of}} withdrawal seizures. In humans, tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clorazepate occurs frequently with regular use. Due to the development of tolerance, benzodiazepines are, in general, not considered appropriate for the long-term management of epilepsy; increasing the dose may result only in the developing of tolerance to the higher dose combined with worsened adverse effects. Cross-tolerance occurs between benzodiazepines, meaning that, if individuals are tolerant to one benzodiazepine, they will display a tolerance to equivalent doses of other benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines include a worsening of pre-existing symptoms as well as the appearance of new symptoms that were not pre-existing. The withdrawal symptoms may range from mild anxiety and insomnia to severe withdrawal symptoms such as seizures and <b>psychosis.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms can be difficult in some cases to differentiate between pre-existing symptoms and withdrawal symptoms. Use of high doses, long-term use and abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal increases increase the severity of withdrawal syndrome. However, tolerance to the active metabolite of clorazepate may occur more slowly than with other benzodiazepines. Regular use of benzodiazepines causes the development of dependence characterised by tolerance to the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines and the development of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome including symptoms such as anxiety, apprehension, tremor, insomnia, nausea, and vomiting upon cessation of benzodiazepine use. Withdrawal from benzodiazepines should be gradual as abrupt withdrawal from high doses of benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. Abrupt withdrawal from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|R
