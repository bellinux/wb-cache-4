5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII {{left to the}} nation, {{there was also a}} heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E

50|$|According to Ryle, mental {{processes}} are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental {{processes that are}} distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> represented by intelligent acts, {{they are the same}} as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues to hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.|$|R
5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> against the clergy {{and the power}} of Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay in negotiations with the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
5|$|In these epochs, she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> {{applying}} {{ideas and}} methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E
5|$|Major {{restoration}} {{work was}} carried out by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 1860s, funded by the rector, Charles Kemble. The work included the installation of fan vaulting in the nave, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a fanciful aesthetic addition but a completion of the original design. Oliver King had arranged for the vaulting of the choir, to a design by William and Robert Vertue. There are clues in the stonework that King intended the vaulting to continue into the nave, but that this plan was abandoned, probably for reasons of cost. In addition a stone screen between the choir and nave was removed. Scott's work was completed by his pupil Thomas Graham Jackson in the 1890s including work on the west front.|$|E

5|$|Once Pope struck, Cibber {{became an}} easy target for other satirists. He was {{attacked}} as the epitome of morally and aesthetically bad writing, largely for the sins of his autobiography. In the Apology, Cibber speaks daringly in the first person and in his own praise. Although the major figures of the day were jealous of their fame, self-promotion of such an overt sort was shocking, and Cibber offended Christian humility as well as gentlemanly modesty. Additionally, Cibber consistently fails to see fault in his own character, praises his vices, and makes no apology for his misdeeds; so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> the fact of the autobiography, but the manner of it that shocked contemporaries. His diffuse and chatty writing style, conventional in poetry and sometimes incoherent in prose, was bound to look even worse in contrast to stylists like Pope. Henry Fielding satirically tried Cibber for murder of the English language in the 17 May 1740 issue of The Champion. The Tory wits were altogether so successful in their satire of Cibber that the historical image of the man himself was almost obliterated, and it was as the King of Dunces that he came down to posterity.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Æthelberht's {{granting}} {{of freedom of}} worship to his wife, the choice of Kent was probably dictated {{by a number of}} other factors. Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain. Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592, Æthelberht was the leading Anglo-Saxon ruler; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium (overlordship) south of the River Humber. Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht's kingdom was well established, and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle, as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks. Lastly, Kent's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area. There is some evidence, including Gregory's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission, that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time. The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship, if Bertha's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting {{as a representative of the}} Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen. Frankish influence <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> political; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well.|$|E

25|$|To see Wilberforce in {{the full}} glory of his social status and reputation, it is perhaps enough to recall that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> Bishop of Oxford (a grand enough post in the nineteenth century) but Lord Bishop of Oxford, {{a member of the}} House of Lords and a Fellow of the Royal Society.

He conceived archetypes to be the mediators of the unus mundus, organizing not only ideas in the psyche, but also the fundamental principles of matter and energy in the physical world.|$|E

Nearly two centuries later, these anti-arms laws continue to be strictly enforced, resulting in a society relatively free from firearms-related criminal offences.|$|E

During Cassiodorus's lifetime, theological study was on the decline and classical writings were disappearing.

Cassiodorus's programme helped ensure that both classical and sacred literature were preserved through the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th century, {{a revival}} of Ukrainian {{self-identification}} manifested in the literary classes of both Russian-Empire Dnieper Ukraine and Austrian Galicia.

Many writers published works in the Romantic tradition of Europe demonstrating that Ukrainian <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a language of the village but suitable for literary pursuits.|$|E
