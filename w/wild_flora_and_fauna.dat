5|$|Wilderness is {{generally}} defined as {{areas that have}} not been significantly modified by human activity. Wilderness areas can be found in preserves, estates, farms, conservation preserves, ranches, , national parks, and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches, or otherwise undeveloped areas. Wilderness areas and protected parks are considered important for the survival of certain species, ecological studies, conservation, solitude, and recreation. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity, and some ecologists consider wilderness areas to {{be an integral part of}} the Earth's self-sustaining natural ecosystem (the biosphere). They may also preserve historic genetic traits and that they provide habitat for <b>wild</b> <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums, or laboratories.|$|E

The rest {{is part of the}} Federal Zone of the Ex-Basin of Texcoco. The municipality is flat with only one elevation reading 1,220 meters above sea level. The Los Remedios and a brand of the Churubusco River run through here. At the far northeast is a remnant of Lake Texcoco and an artificial lake was built here as part of the Parque del Puebla to serve as an ecological reserve. The climate is temperate with a fairly cold winter and rain mostly falling between June and October. Average temperature is about 15C with temperatures as high as 34C and as low as −5C. The area has little to no native <b>wild</b> <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> {{due to the fact that}} it was underwater until the 20th century and the area is nearly completely urbanized. However, in winter a number of bird species such as cranes and storks pass through.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>flora</b> <b>and</b> <b>fauna</b> greatly {{varied at}} La Venta and mostly {{consisted}} of seafood, deer, {{and a variety}} of small animals, as well as many wild plants. The only animals domesticated by the Olmec were dogs and, therefore, La Venta and surrounding areas largely depended on wild game. However, the rich, alluvial soil along the river banks allowed for multiple harvests every year and the land, in general, was quite bountiful. “Evidence has been found for corn (Zea mais) of teosinte size associated with ceramic material dated to 1750 BCE.” [...] Maize was the primary domesticated food source and Seinfeld’s (2007) study of feasting at the nearby sub-city of San Andres uncovered likely maize use in beverages, as well as cocoa.|$|E

VandegriftForests {{are most}} often defined as {{ecosystems}} {{with a minimum of}} 10 % crown cover of trees and/or bamboo, generally associated with <b>wild</b> <b>flora,</b> <b>fauna</b> <b>and</b> natural soil conditions and not subject to agricultural practices. 1 The changing area of the world’s forests, including natural forests and forest plantations, was estimated to be 3, 454 million hectares in 1995, or about onefourth of the land area of the Earth. (see Chart 1) About 55 % of these are located in developing countries. 2 (see Chart 2) While tropical forests occupy less than 7 % of the earth’s terrestrial surface, they are home to as many as 30 million species of plants and animals, or {{more than half of all}} life forms on our planet. 3 Their importance is thus undeniable. For example, of the roughly 3, 000 plants identified as having cancer-fighting properties, 70 % grow in the rainforest. In addition, a single acre of tropical rainforest supports between 60 and 80 tree species. 4 Of these forests, the Brazilian Amazon is the largest contiguous region of tropical forest in the world, making it an extremely important global resource, which is sensitive to land-use changes and destruction. The rate and future course of these land-use changes, or forest clearing, in the Brazilian Amazon is closely linked to human-use systems that replace the vegetation...|$|R

The aim of this declaration was ΄΄...the preservation in perpetuity of the natural environment of the region, i.e. of <b>wild</b> <b>flora,</b> <b>fauna</b> <b>and</b> natural landscape, as well as its cultural and other values...΄΄. In addition the declaration has aimed promoting scientific research along with environmental education for the public and tourist development in the region. Specific laws prohibit all forms of exploitation on {{the eastern side of the}} mountain in an area of about 4,000 hectares, that is the core of the Park. A wider region, around this core, has been designated ΄΄peripheral zone of the National Park΄΄, so that its managing and exploitation to be done so as not to adversely affect the core's protection. At present, the park has been expanded to 24,000 hectares. Administratively it belongs to Pieria's and Larissa's Prefectures and specifically to the municipalities Diou-Olympou and Katerinis (Pieria) and Τempon and Elassonas (Larissa). Its lowest altitude is 600 metres and its peak, Mytikas, at 2,918 metres. In 1981 UNESCO proclaimed Olympus ΄΄Biosphere Reserve΄΄. European Union has listed Olympus in the ΄΄Significant for Birdlife Regions of European Union΄΄.
