5|$|The Mets {{finished}} the 1999 season tied with the Cincinnati Reds for the National League <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> playoff berth. In a one-game tie-breaker, the Mets defeated the Reds 5–0 {{to win the}} <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5|$|The tie-breaker {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} win–loss records of 91–71 and thus tied for the second <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> position in the AL. The Rangers were awarded home field for the game, as they won the regular season series against the Rays, 4–3. The game was televised on TBS. It was the fourth tie-breaker in MLB history for a <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> spot, although {{it was the first}} since MLB adopted its current format of two <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> teams playing in a <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game in 2012. The tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular season game for both teams, with all events in the game added to regular season statistics.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the 2012 season, MLB altered its rules to double the number of <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> teams {{admitted}} into the playoffs to two per league. The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one-game playoffs between the <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> teams in each league.|$|E
30|$|Some use <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as {{a synonym}} for weak signals. Hiltunen however, defines <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as events with a huge impact whereas weak signals are signs of events or {{emerging}} issues, such as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [1]. Whether or not one considers these two terms as synonyms, depends on how one defines weak signals. If one accepts that weak signals can be both events and signs of events, then <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and weak signals can be used interchangeably. However, if one maintains that weak signals are not events in themselves but indications of them, <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and weak signals are not synonyms. Instead, it can be perceived that weak signals precede <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> Thus, weak signals can be employed {{as a means to}} anticipate <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> [1, 30].|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "set" [...] is a {{group of}} cards of the same value (i.e. all 8s) or a {{combination}} of same valued <b>cards</b> and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as defined by the round. A set may consist of all <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> or combinations of the same <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and other <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> as long as the requirements of the round are satisfied.|$|R

5|$|If {{there is}} a tie for the final <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> position, the non-winner that {{advances}} {{will be based on}} the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the <b>wild</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 1, 2013, the Pirates {{hosted the}} Cincinnati Reds in the 2013 National League <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game. This {{marked the first}} time a playoff game was played at PNC Park. The Pirates won 6-2, their first postseason victory since 1992, in front of a record crowd of 40,629. The 2014 and 2015 National League <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> games were also played at PNC Park.|$|E
5|$|The 2013 American League <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> tie-breaker {{game was}} a one-game {{extension}} to Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2013 regular season, played between the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays {{to determine the}} second participant in the 2013 American League (AL) <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game. It was played at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington on September 30, 2013. The Rays defeated the Rangers, 5–2, and advanced to the AL <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game against the Cleveland Indians at Progressive Field, which they won 4–0; the Rangers failed {{to qualify for the}} postseason.|$|E
50|$|A meld must {{consist of}} at least two natural cards, and can never have more <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> than natural cards (and {{therefore}} more than three <b>wild</b> <b>cards).</b> Examples: 5-5-2 and 9-9-9-2-2-Joker are legal melds. 5-2-2 is not a legal meld as it contains only one natural card. 9-9-2-2-2-Joker is not legal as it contains more <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> than natural cards.|$|R
30|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>cards</b> {{have been}} part of futures {{research}} and scenario building since the 1960 s. However, it was only in 1996 that an approach to study <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> came about as John L. Petersen’s book Out of the Blue: How to Anticipate Big Future Surprises was published. [29]. <b>Wild</b> <b>cards</b> are generally defined as rapid, surprising events with huge disastrous, destructive, catastrophic or anomalous consequences. It should not be forgotten, however, that <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> can also be beneficial events, whose potential {{we want to be able}} to exploit. Usually these events take place so rapidly that normal, planned management processes cannot respond, making the organisations highly vulnerable [27, 30, 31]. Petersen and Steinmüller argue that in the complex and interconnected world of today, it is now more relevant than ever to study <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> so that we could prepare for them, prevent them or in some cases even deliberately provoke them [29]. Furthermore, <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> can be seen as a heuristic to articulate uncertainty [32].|$|R
30|$|None of the <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> can {{be linked}} to {{opportunities}} related to aspects of market restructuring and industries transformation. Thus, identified <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> would not support the disappearance of traditional borders in the transport market, European product quality or adaptability to Asian markets. One reason might be the rather technological or political focus of Wild Cards—while economy related <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> were not mentioned by the experts.|$|R
5|$|Although {{other teams}} {{including}} the Kansas City Royals, Baltimore Orioles, and New York Yankees had vied for a <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> spot, the Indians, Rangers, and Rays all remained in contention {{until the end}} of the season. Entering the final day of the scheduled regular season, on which all three teams played, the Indians had a 91–70 record while both the Rangers and Rays had 90–71 records. These were the best non-division-leading records in the American League. Thus, the possibility existed (had the Indians lost and the Rays and Rangers won) for a three-way tie for the two <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> spots, which would have required several tie-breaker games to settle. However, all three teams won, leaving the Indians definitively in the <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game at 92–70 and the Rays and Rangers tied at 91–71 for the second spot.|$|E
5|$|In the National League <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game {{against the}} San Francisco Giants on October 5, Granderson made an {{incredible}} catch to save several runs from scoring {{late in the}} close game.|$|E
5|$|MLB {{expanded}} its postseason {{to include the}} League Championship Series (LCS) in 1969, the League Division Series (LDS) in 1995, and the <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> round in 2012. The <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> round is a one-game playoff, the LDS follows a best-of-five playoff format, and the LCS and World Series follow a best-of-seven playoff format. The most recent World Series champions are the Chicago Cubs, who won in the 2016 World Series. Jon Lester is the most recent recipient of the Babe Ruth Award.|$|E

He has published nine novels, and more than 20 short stories and 6 comic book scripts. He also wrote GURPS <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards,</b> a supplement for the GURPS role-playing system published in 1989, and two <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> world books and histories from Green Ronin.http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/Roleplayer/Roleplayer16/WildCards.html ...|$|R
30|$|The {{character}} of <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> results in specific uncertainties which {{have to be}} dealt with when using <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> to create a future perspective. Being disruptive low-likelihood high-impact events, <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> oppose or contradict established forecasts and trends that are perceived as “likely”. They represent by definition conflicts that challenge current knowledge about existing trends and likely developments. Moreover, their impacts on competition can be conflicting and ambiguous—positive or negative.|$|R
30|$|The main {{observations}} from the detailed {{results of the}} survey can be summarized as follows. All the studied <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> {{were found to be}} relevant by the experts in terms of their potential impact on the transport industries, the breadth of their effect and the vulnerability of the various industry segments. Based on the median of the experts’ responses, 12 <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> will have “high” or “very high” impact on at least one industry segment, if they occur. For only two <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> the fullest impact, on at least one industry segment, is “medium”. The time by which the full impact is reached varies among the <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Cardinals {{finished}} the 2001 {{season with a}} 93–69 record and advanced to the playoffs as a <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> team. The team won the NL <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> round and advanced to the NL Division Series (NLDS). In Game 2 on October 10, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run home run against Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson in a 4–1 victory. The Cardinals, however, were eliminated in five games, and Pujols had just two hits in 18 at-bats.|$|E
5|$|The Orioles {{reached the}} playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1997, {{claiming}} one of the AL <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> spots and defeating the Rangers in the 2012 AL <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game. In Game 2 of the 2012 AL Division Series (ALDS) against the Yankees, Davis had a two-run single against Andy Pettitte in the Orioles' 32 victory. Those were his only RBI of the series; he had four hits in 20 at bats as the Yankees defeated the Orioles in five games.|$|E
5|$|Blue Wing Blitz {{was officially}} {{announced}} on March 8, 2001, and was Square's second original title for Bandai's Japan-exclusive handheld console WonderSwan Color, after <b>Wild</b> <b>Card.</b> A trailer {{of the game}} was featured in the bonus DVD included in the Japanese release of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>cards</b> (jokers and twos) can {{normally}} {{be used in}} melds as substitutes for cards of the appropriate rank. For example, Q-Q-Q-2 or 8-8-8-8-2-joker would be valid (dirty) melds. There must always be more natural <b>cards</b> than <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> in the meld at any time with a maximum of three <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> in any one meld. For example, a meld of 6-6-2-2 would not be allowed. Threes cannot be melded at any time.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variation}} of dou dizhu is the edition with <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> Like the original settings, after {{the determination of}} the landlord, four-of-a-kind will be randomly selected as <b>wild</b> <b>cards.</b> Those can be used to stand for any other cards, except jokers.|$|R
30|$|Some <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards,</b> such as Superfast Ground Transport or Europe-Wide Traffic-Control System were {{considered}} as likely if harmonization of technical standards in Europe is given. For many <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> ambiguous impact was stated. The occurrence and impact {{will depend on}} frame conditions. In this context some key aspects were identified: political decisions, market development and especially user reaction, behavior and acceptance. These aspects need to be further observed when searching for new business opportunities to strengthen competitiveness. From a methodological point of view, linking the identified <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> with the “human factor”, e.g., by field experiments or in living labs, could provide further information {{to fill the gap}} of knowledge concerning the direction of impact of certain <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Major League Baseball the {{two teams}} with {{the best record in}} each league who do not win a {{division}} play in the <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game. A number of teams were in competition for these <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> spots, along with their divisional competition. The Rangers spent over 80 days leading the American League West and shared the lead as late as September 4. The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East, but held a share of the lead as late as August 24. The Cleveland Indians did not lead the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges, so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the <b>Wild</b> <b>Card,</b> which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the <b>Wild</b> <b>Card,</b> individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E
5|$|On October 5 at Citi Field, in a 3-0 {{win over}} the {{defending}} National League Champion New York Mets in the NL <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Game, Bumgarner pitched his third career postseason complete game four-hit shutout {{to give him the}} most career complete game shutouts {{in the history of the}} <b>Wild</b> <b>Card</b> Era with two. In other words, he set the Major League record for most career complete game shutout wins in winner-take-all-games, the first and only pitcher to have more than one. Bumgarner's third career postseason shutout ties him for second all-time behind Christy Mathewson's four. He also tied Tom Glavine's Major League record with six career scoreless postseason starts and lowered his Major League career postseason road record to a microscopic 0.50 ERA.|$|E
30|$|Weak {{signals and}} <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> {{are used to}} scan the {{environment}} and make systems more sensitive to emerging changes. In this paper, the applicability of weak signals and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> is experimented {{in a case of}} a highly reliable and conservative sector, water and sanitation services. The aim is to explore an approach suitable for water utilities. The paper discusses different theoretical and methodological approaches to weak signals and <b>wild</b> <b>cards,</b> and reflects these in relation to the chosen approach. It is argued that the process of weak signals and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> can serve as a communication and reflection exercise for an organisation like a water utility. Furthermore, incorporating weak signals and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> can be an essential part in futures thinking, challenge prevailing mental models, and make systems more open to sense and learn from their environment. It is recommended for water utilities to apply a loose approach on weak signals and <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> and embed it as a part of their organisational culture. However, it should be remembered that the approach should always be chosen to match the overall objectives and context.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{variation}} {{calls for}} all piles {{to be built}} up to the King, and Jokers are used as <b>wild</b> <b>cards</b> (<b>Wild</b> represents all <b>cards</b> besides A, 2, 7, J) ...|$|R
30|$|Growing {{interest}} in <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> and weak signals has been reflected, for example, by the EU FP 7 project “iKNOW”, {{probably the first}} publicly-funded international project that was entirely dedicated to <b>Wild</b> <b>Cards</b> and weak signals 1 including several ones related to transportation.|$|R
5|$|The Flames rebounded to {{make the}} playoffs in the 2016-17 season as the conference's first <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> seed, but they were swept by the Ducks {{in the first round of}} the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox {{finished}} 95-67 {{and with}} the same record as the New York Yankees, but since the Yankees had won the season series between the two teams, they won the American League East and the Red Sox {{had to settle for}} the American League <b>Wild</b> <b>Card.</b>|$|E
5|$|If none of {{the contestants}} in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a {{positive}} score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional <b>wild</b> <b>card</b> contestant advances instead.
