A television advert and music video for [...] "River of Light" [...] were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith appeared {{on the cover of}} April's Classic FM Magazine. More promotional appearances in {{the weeks leading up to}} the release of Faryl included Loose Women, The Paul O'Grady Show, BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and BBC Breakfast.

500|$|The Make-Up's gospel {{attitude}} {{was related to}} utilization of the audience as a group member, which Svenonius likened {{to the rise of}} the 90s dance music scene: [...] "We're not interested in countering it. It makes sense to me that techno, rave and dance music should go over in the face of rock and roll because it's democratic for everybody to express themselves. [...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form to sort of breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster". [...] Svenonius would often interact with the audience in a number of ways, including call and response lyrics, direct address, and leaving the stage and going out into the crowd.|$|E
500|$|Promotion {{began in}} January, with {{performances}} by Smith at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and appearances at {{the debut of}} the Oliver! 2009 revival. Smith also {{took part in a}} photoshoot for publicity and cover photos. According to writers for the Daily Mail, the cover photo was modified to give Smith [...] "a smile worthy of a model from a Colgate advert", due to her [...] "gappy teeth". Though generally critical of the move, the report conceded that it was better for Smith's teeth to be digitally straightened, rather than forcing her [...] "to endure a battery of dental surgery". A television advert and music video for [...] "River of Light" [...] were recorded to further publicise the release, and Smith also appeared on the cover of April's Classic FM Magazine. Further promotion in {{the weeks leading up to}} the release of Faryl included Smith appearing on Loose Women, The Paul O'Grady Show, BBC Radio 4, Radio Five Live and BBC Breakfast.

500|$|To {{help fund}} the future works, the church {{announced}} plans in January 2008 to sell [...] of undeveloped, wooded property it owns on Hampton Lane to Shelter Development Corp. {{for construction of}} a senior citizen housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County officials to allow sixteen residential units per acre (current zoning limits density to two residential units per acre) {{for a total of}} 80100beds. The Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighboring Hampton, Maryland residents, said they [...] "...oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down". Then-pastor David Cooney told the Baltimore Sun, [...] "We entered into this with Shelter, believing this is a good use for the land [...] that this is a good company and a needed service". In the face of community objections, however, Shelter and the church subsequently announced on March 3, 2008, that the development plans had been dropped. A Shelter official said that his company and Towson United Methodist Church had jointly {{come to the conclusion that}} [...] "this is not something we are going to pursue". Pastor Cooney said, [...] "It had become clear that we weren't going to be able to reach a compromise and we certainly don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> war with our neighbors". In the wake of the plan's shelving, the president of the Hampton Improvement Association told the Towson Times that his group wishes to work with Towson United Methodist Church to find an alternative use for the land besides commercial development, as they [...] "don't want to preclude the church from trying to get some money out of it." [...] In April 2008, Dr. Cooney said that the church [...] "did not set out to sell this land; the proposal came to us, and we have no other plans to sell or develop the land".|$|E

50|$|During the deliberations, Aubrey asks Joelle if she {{honestly}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>at</b> the ranch. Joelle equivocates {{and never}} directly replies to the question.

The teachers also expressed wariness of potential divides that might arise between students who held different degrees of passion towards STEM, but they also saw this as a potential opportunity to create a diverse community of learners.|$|R
