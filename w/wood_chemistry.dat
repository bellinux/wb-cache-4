40|$|A {{study of}} the effects that wood {{extractive}} composition has on pitch deposition was conducted using model solutions comprised of a resin acid, fatty acid and triglyceride. The deposition behaviour was investigated under various conditions of pH and temperature. Statistical pitch deposition models were developed {{through the use of}} general multiple linear regression analysis techniques to relate total pitch deposited to the interaction of the various components present in the pitch before deposition. These statistical models were used to predict suitable control strategies for various pH and temperature conditions. Three of the classes of chemical compounds found in wet end and <b>wood</b> extractive <b>chemistry</b> were investigated in this study. The results and deposition models developed help to explain why strategies to control wood pitch deposition have and/or have not worked. Mechanisms of the interaction between components are proposed, based on evidence from this work and corroboration of papers from the literature.

40|$|Sustainable use is {{essential}} to guarantee future availability of wood. Structural and chemical mapping can contribute to fit-for-purpose usage, as accurate and detailed knowledge of the material enables guided utilization and optimal performance of wood. The platform presented in this paper, illustrated on poplar disks for early selection, collects data in the NIR, visual and X-ray spectrum in maximum 30 min per wood disk. Flatbed scanning proves to be a cheap and fast technique to evaluate basic physical properties such as cross-sectional area and wood density. X-ray CT scanning is used for density mapping adding information on density variation between and within disks. Chemometric modeling of infrared spectra is used to map density, tension wood and lignin content. X-ray- and NIR-based density mapping showed good correlation, although NIR-based maps do not show {{the same level of}} detail as X-ray images do due to lower resolution. Results of NIR-based hyperspectral mapping illustrate that tension wood zones were denser and contained less lignin which corresponds with the existence of the G-layer described in the literature. In all, the combination of high-end tools together with simple tools such as flatbed scanning allows for high-throughput and high-resolution quantitative mapping of some of the main properties of poplar wood. Furthermore, infrared scanning can be used to map density, tension <b>wood</b> and <b>chemistry</b> without the need for more complex, expensive and/or time-consuming methods, yet with less accuracy and lower resolution, thus being applicable as single tool for breeding selection...|$|R
40|$|Introduction : Tree {{breeding}} {{is giving}} an increasing attention to wood properties {{in order to}} better fit the requirements of the saw, board, pulp and paper industries. In particular, {{it has been reported that}} lignin and cellulose content display moderate to high heritabilities making them prime candidates for genetic improvement of <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Moreover, these traits have been shown to be negatively correlated at both phenotypic and genetic levels. However, they have generally been evaluated against a narrow genetic background, and little is known about their correlations with mandatory selection criteria such as growth and straightness. *Materials and methods : In this study, we first investigated the performance of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with a non-destructive sampling method to assess chemical properties of wood in maritime pine. We afterwards estimated genetic parameters of growth, stem form and <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> traits across a large genetic background in a progeny trial and clonally replicated progenies. *Results : Our results showed that removal of extractives prior to NIR spectra acquisition is highly recommended for achieving high accuracy in NIRS-PLSR prediction for <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> traits in maritime pine. We further observed moderate heritabilities (0. 15 – 0. 55) for the studied traits. <b>Wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> traits were genetically inter-correlated (e. g., negatively between lignin and cellulose), whereas correlations with growth were not significant, indicating that growth and chemical properties could be improved independently...|$|E

40|$|Near {{infrared}} reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy {{can be used}} to reliably predict both the physical and chemical wood properties of Eucalyptus. However, studies have been based on ground wood, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain. Predicting wood traits from NIR spectral data taken from solid wood would greatly increase the speed and cost-effectiveness of this procedure. Existing ground wood calibrations were evaluated for the prediction of <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> from NIR spectral data taken from solid wood. Extractives, acid-soluble lignin, and Klason lignin contents were poorly predicted. Total lignin and cellulose contents showed moderate relationships between laboratory values and the NIR predicted values. NIR calibrations were further developed specifically for predicting <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> from solid wood. All calibrations had high R 2 values from 0. 72 to 0. 88, and standard errors of calibration were less than 1. 37 %. Calibration validation produced high correlation coefficients between predicted and laboratory values for extractives, Klason lignin, total lignin, and cellulose contents with R 2 values ranging from 0. 67 to 0. 87. Acid-soluble lignin content was poorly predicted. This study showed that NIR analysis on solid wood of E. globulus could be reliably used to predict extractives, lignin, and cellulose contents. It also determined that existing ground wood calibrations, although they could give crude estimates of the <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> values, would need to be re-developed for accurate predictions from solid wood...|$|E
40|$|The {{changes in}} surface chemistry, wettability, and {{adhesion}} of inactivated wood surfaces, including yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) and southern pine (Pinus taeda), were studied. Surface inactivation, which is induced {{by exposure to}} high temperature, causes poor adhesion. The comparative characterization of the surface was done by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), sessile drop wettability, and fracture toughness of adhesive bonds. Additionally, several chemical treatments were utilized to improve wettability and adhesion of inactivated wood surfaces. The results showed that wood drying caused modification in <b>wood</b> surface <b>chemistry.</b> The oxygen to carbon ratio (O/C) decreased and the C 1 /C 2 ratio increased with drying temperature. A low O/C ratio and a high C 1 /C 2 ratio reflected {{a high concentration of}} extractives and lignin on the wood surface. Contact angle decreased with time and increased with the temperature of exposure. A dependence of wood species was evident. The southern pine was most susceptible to inactivation particularly when bonded with PF adhesive. Yellow-poplar surfaces showed little inactivation when exposed to drying temperatures up to 187 °C. The chemical treatments improved the wettability of inactivated wood surfaces, but an improvement in adhesion was not evident for specimens bonded with PVA. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was the most effective in restoring bonding ability of inactivated wood surfaces bonded with PF adhesive. The maximum strain energy release rate (Gmax) of specimens treated with NaOH increased by a factor of three when compared with inactivated specimens...|$|R

40|$|Summary Potassium {{and calcium}} are {{essential}} for tree me-tabolism and various physiological processes related to growth. In recent years, special interest was therefore accorded {{to the effect of}} both cations on cambial activity and xylem de-velopment. Various studies revealed a distinct correlation be-tween potassium as well as calcium nutrition and wood formation. When poplar trees were grown under low K+ or Ca 2 + regimes, the cambial activity as well as the seasonal rate of wood increment and the vessel size were significantly re-duced. Molecular, biochemical and electrophysiological in-vestigations indicate (i) a strong involvement of specific K+ channels in the regulation of xylem cell expansion and (ii) a significant influence of Ca 2 + on the onset of cambial reactiva-tion after winter dormancy as well as on <b>wood</b> structure and <b>chemistry.</b> These studies highlight the important role of potas-sium as well as calcium in xylogenesis. Based on that knowl-edge, further research will be directed towards {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms governing K+- as well as Ca 2 +-dependent wood formation...|$|R

30|$|The wood {{selection}} {{mechanism is}} also known {{to be affected by}} <b>wood</b> <b>chemistry</b> [26] and the wood’s nutritional value [27]. Wood is primarily composed of three major components: cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, with various other components such as organic extractives and minerals. Extractives are responsible for the color, smell, and durability of the wood [28]. In Sitka Spruce, the heartwood contained about 70  % more extractives than the sapwood [29]. Therefore, nest-site selection in the sapwood may be determined by the extractive content.|$|E
40|$|The {{economics}} of kraft pulping {{are influenced by}} variation in <b>wood</b> density and <b>chemistry,</b> or their product, pulp productivity. The ability to predict basic density, pulp yield or pulp productivity before harvest would provide an economic advantage to the grower or processor. Acoustic velocity in green wood is correlated with both basic density and pulp yield, offering potential for rapid screening. We explored relationships between acoustic velocity, density, pulp yield and fibre length using data from Eucalyptus dunnii plantations in northern NSW, Australia. Acoustic velocity measured on logs accounted for 27 % {{of the variation in}} pulp yield and 50 % of variation in pulp productivity. The strong relationship between fibre length and pulp yield is proposed as a possible causal mechanism. A threshold acoustic velocity of 3. 65 km s– 1 was defined as the point at which logs would produce at least 250 kg of dry pulp per cubic metre of green wood. Removal of the worst 25 % of logs, based on velocity, would give a 2. 2 % gain in pulp productivity which equates, in turn, to an additional 6. 2 kg of pulp produced from every cubic metre of green wood.

40|$|Wood {{anatomical}} characteristics, {{content of}} phenolic extractives, and topochemistry of two lesser known and underutilised hardwood species, Bombax ceiba and Bombax insigne were studied. Heartwood and sapwood material {{was obtained from}} logs originating from natural forests of Pyinmana District, Myanmar. The basic qualitative anatomical features agreed with descriptions reported for the species in other regions (e. g. India, Bangladesh, Southeast Asia). However, there were some light differences in the quantitative wood anatomical data among the regions due {{to the influence of}} environmental conditions. The amount of phenolic extractives obtained by gradual extraction with acetone-water was almost the same in heartwood and sapwood (about 1. 2 %) in B. insigne, while heartwood showed a higher amount (2. 8 %) than sapwood (2. 5 %) in B. ceiba. Topochemical distribution of lignin and phenolic deposits in heartwood tissues investigated by scanning UV microspectrophotometry (UMSP) revealed that B. insigne is more highly lignified than B. ceiba. For both species, a lower UV-absorbance by the fiber and ray cell wall as compared to that of the cell wall of vessels was observed. Also, phenolic compounds were mostly deposited in the lumina of parenchyma cells and vessels rather than in cell walls.

40|$|Background Plantations of Populus spp, Salix spp. or Eucalyptus spp. are {{established}} to produce wood in a reduced {{space and a}} short time. Poplars are cultivated with cycles of 15 - 18 years to obtain saw timber and peeler logs, and when grown for biomass production as short-rotation coppice (SRC), cutting back/coppicing cycles are reduced to 2 ? 5 -years intervals. Syllepsis is among the valuable traits that can be targeted to enhance biomass yield of SRCs. Syllepsis, i. e. the outgrowth of lateral buds into branches the same season in which they form without an intervening rest period, increases carbon fixation and allocation in the shoot and hence the general growth of the tree. A high degree of sylleptic branching {{is known to be}} positively correlated with biomass yield when these plantations are grown under optimal conditions [1]. In 2012 we established in Madrid (Spain) a SRC field trial with genetically engineered poplars, previously shown to develop sylleptic branches when cultivated in growth chambers, under optimal conditions [2]. The aim of starting up this field trial was to test whether a plastic trait as syllepsis was maintained over time under natural conditions and eventually resulted in an enhanced biomass production Methods In vitro culture rooted cuttings were initially potted in 3. 5 L containers with blond peat and grown in the greenhouse as previously described [2]. The field trial was established in July 2012 in the experimental plot, and included five groups of hybrid poplar Populus tremula x P. alba INRA clone 717 1 B, the wild-type genotype as control, transgenic events # 37 and # 60 carrying the 35 S:: 3 xHA:CsRAV 1 cassette (3 xHA:CsRAV 1 OX), and events # 1 and # 22 carrying the 35 S::PtaRAV 1 -hpiRNA cassette (PtaRAV 1 & 2 KD). 30 individuals per group were planted into three blocks of 10 plants each. The experimental plot area was 204 m 2, and the plantation density 10000 trees/ha. It consisted of 12 x 17 rows with a tree spacing 2 x 0. 5 m. The border rows were occupied by P. x euramericana clone I- 214 individuals, planted as 25 cm-long cuttings. Irrigation and weed/pests control were applied, and the first coppicing cycle was done after the second growing season [3]. Several productivity determinants (stem height and diameter, syllepsis and phenology) were monitored, <b>wood</b> anatomy and <b>chemistry</b> analyzed, and aerial biomass yield and calorific value determined. Results and Conclusions CsRAV 1 over-expressing event # 60 showed an advantageous performance in the field regarding stem diameter and biomass production after the first coppicing cycle. In this event, sylleptic branches grew from the main shoot during the first growing seasons, after the plantation establishment and after coppicing. None of the other traits under study such as phenology, <b>wood</b> anatomy and <b>chemistry</b> were noticeably altered when compared to the wild type genotype. These results show that in woody species RAV 1 is a highly valuable target gene that can be used as biotechnological tool to enhance biomass yield of poplar SRC plantations without detrimental side-effects in tree development and characteristics...|$|R
