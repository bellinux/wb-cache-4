This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable retainer and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E
25|$|The RAF's {{airborne}} systems {{moved the}} antennas {{by moving the}} entire aircraft. In the case of GL, the bearing angle was already movable {{through the use of}} the rotating cabin. One solution to moving the elevation angle <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the vertical pole tilt, but for reasons that are not recorded in the references, this solution was not used. Instead, the upper antenna of the vertical pair was able to be moved up and down the ladder-like extension.|$|E
25|$|A better {{approach}} {{seemed to}} be to offer carrots instead of sticks. In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them {{a certain percentage of}} missing troops, without consequences for their payment. Also, in some cases the nominal strength of companies was lowered intentionally, at the same time keeping the amount of payments constant, thereby giving the troops a pay rise in the bargain. But the best approach <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the government take over the entrepreneurial risks of the captain. However, this did only happen in the Republic in the reforms of William III after 1672.|$|E

The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs of the disease and the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin AIDS was never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
25|$|With {{the failure}} to {{establish}} a political consensus after the January 1910 general election, the Liberals called a second general election in December. The Conservative leadership decided that a good test of {{the popularity of the}} tariff reform programme <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a prominent tariff reformer stand for election in a disputed seat. They considered Law a prime candidate, and after debating it for a month he guardedly agreed, enthusiastic about the idea but worried about the effect of a defeat on the Party. Law was selected as the candidate for Manchester North West, and became drawn into party debates about how strong a tariff reform policy should be put in their manifesto. Law personally felt that duties on foodstuffs should be excluded, something agreed to by Alexander Acland-Hood, Edward Carson and others {{at a meeting of the}} Constitutional Club on 8 November 1910, but they failed to reach a consensus and the idea of including or excluding food duties continued to be something that divided the party.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{familial}} DNA database searches {{argue that}} the technique is an invasion of an individual's 4th Amendment rights. Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a population-wide DNA database. Some scholars {{have pointed out that}} the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques, and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States v. Pool (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator. Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.|$|E

500|$|In March, 2015 the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S854) was {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate. Its was intended establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) which would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local,and tribal governments which would be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non-operating reactors and other [...] "emergency" [...] deliveries (called “priority waste”). The goal <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other “non-priority waste” available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nation’s initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from that fund any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by annual appropriations or authorizations.|$|E

500|$|The BX {{arrived in}} South Fort George on June 24, to {{a warm welcome}} from the local populace. The steamer landing on the Fraser had been there since 1909 and was already used by the Charlotte, Chilco and Quesnel. Nevertheless, local {{residents}} had been anticipating {{the day of the}} BX's arrival to see where the company would choose to have its landing and where it would build its office and warehouse. Many local business decisions were going to be based on this, as it was widely and correctly assumed that the BX would be bringing up the bulk of the passengers and landseekers from the south. One businessman, hotelier Al Johnson, was waiting for this information so he would know where to build Fort George's first licensed hotel, the Hotel Northern. [...] The promoters of South Fort George were well aware of the huge benefit it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the landing at their town-site, so the day after the BX arrived they offered the BC Express Company free lots of their choice in South Fort George. The company accepted the offer and construction on the facilities was begun. This would be a huge disappointment to South Fort George's rival town-site, Central Fort George on the Nechako River, which had hoped for the BC Express's landing and offices for itself. George Hammond, the promoter for Central, made the best he could out of a bad situation and hired a representative for the Central town-site and had him travel on the BX and promote Central to the passengers before they arrived in South Fort George.|$|E

I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 there was nothing to do but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E

2500|$|A digital single-lens {{reflex camera}} (also called a digital SLR or DSLR) is {{a digital camera}} that {{combines}} the optics and the mechanisms of a single-lens reflex camera with a digital imaging sensor, as opposed to photographic film. The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design, light travels through the lens, then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either the viewfinder or the image sensor. The traditional alternative <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a viewfinder with its own lens, hence the term [...] "single lens" [...] for this design. By using only one lens, the viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera's sensor. A DSLR differs from non-reflex single-lens digital cameras in that the viewfinder presents a direct optical view through the lens, rather than being captured by the camera's image sensor and displayed by a digital screen.|$|E

[...] Originally, planners considered Governors Island, Central Park, and Liberty State Park in Jersey City as possible locations for the track. However, these sites were not chosen since a Governors Island track would have been too costly; a Central Park track would have required demolishing trees; and Liberty State Park was outside the city limits. New York City deputy mayor Alicia Glen visited Paris in May 2016. After attending the ePrix, she lent her support to the New York City race with backing from the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
