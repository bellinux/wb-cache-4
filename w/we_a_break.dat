This complex task requires the assignment of several breaks per shift, satisfying various constraints reflecting labour rules, staffing requirements and ergonomic criteria. To solve this problem <b>we</b> propose <b>a</b> memetic algorithm combining a genetic algorithm and a local search procedure. We evaluate the presented memetic algorithm on publicly available benchmark instances and compare the obtained results to an existing min-conflicts based algorithm. The memetic algorithm is able to return competitive results and for half of the regarded instances it computes solutions of improved quality. ...|$|R

We present {{here the}} {{combined}} radio spectrum from the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) of type-IIb SN 1993 J (age 11 years) and a type-Ic SN 2003 bg (age 1 year). In SN 1993 J, <b>we</b> find <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in the spectrum at 4 GHz and {{associate it with}} Synchrotron cooling break. Hence, we determine the magnetic field independent of equipartition assumption between relativistic electrons and magnetic energy. <b>We</b> also see <b>a</b> hint of <b>break</b> in the spectrum of SN 2003 bg between 22 - 40 GHz. The spectrum of SN 2003 bg is well described by the synchrotron self absorption model. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ultrashort laser pulses at high {{repetition}} {{rates may}} overcome {{the problems of}} conventional bonding methods. While focusing in transparent materials, the laser energy is deposited locally in the focal volume due to nonlinear absorption processes. Heat accumulation of successive laser pulses at high repetition rates leads to localized melting of the material. If the focus is set at the interface of two transparent samples, the subsequent resolidification finally yields strong and robust bonds. Using optimized processing parameters, <b>we</b> achieved <b>a</b> <b>breaking</b> strength, which {{is comparable to the}} bulk material...|$|R

40|$|Social {{movements}} {{have been largely}} understood within western civilizational models emphasizing collective identity and a civic conception of action. This article explores two emerging forms of movement, the contemporary anti-globalization movement and the qigong movement that emerged in China over the 1980 s. The qigong movement involves forms of embodiment and intensified personhood rather than collective identity. In the anti-globalization movement <b>we</b> encounter <b>a</b> <b>break</b> with representation, grammars of presence/absence rather than &# 039;we-ness&# 039;, and embodied communication. These movements underline singularity and experiences of oneself as another, suggesting a shift from &# 039;social movement&# 039; to &# 039;experience movement&# 039;...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits the {{relationship}} between energy prices and the Canadian dollar, using an equation first developed by Amano and van Norden (1995). They found evidence of a negative relationship between these two variables, such that higher real energy prices led to a depreciation of the Canadian dollar. Based on structural <b>break</b> tests, <b>we</b> find <b>a</b> <b>break</b> point in the sign of this relationship, which changes from negative to positive in the early 1990 s. The timing of the break is consistent with major changes in Canada's energy policies and in energy-related cross-border trade and investment. ...|$|R
