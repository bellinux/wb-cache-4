25|$|Investigating <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> is {{a summer}} program for teens from the DC {{metropolitan}} area. Students spend four weeks in teams equipped with cameras, and sketchbooks {{to discover the}} local communities. Students are given an introduction to photography and then investigate neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. Documenting history, landmarks, and residential areas, students assemble the community's identity. The original photographs and writings are incorporated into an exhibition at the Museum. Since 1996, more than 500 students have participated in learning about different communities within the District of Columbia.|$|E

500|$|Pernick and Wilder explain that, in the 1970s, clean {{technology}} was considered “alternative,” {{the province of}} back-to-the-land lifestyle advocates, altruistic environmentalists, and lab scientists on research grants. [...] Such technology was in {{an early stage of}} development, was too expensive, it did not have widespread political support, and very few large, established companies were embracing the sector. Even {{at the start of the}} 21st century, the term clean tech was not yet in the financial or business community’s vocabulary. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is [...] "the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe." ...|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars began {{recording}} {{their third}} studio album This Is War in August 2008. To produce the record, the band worked with Flood and Steve Lillywhite. Thirty Seconds to Mars {{had attempted to}} sign with a new label after the A Beautiful Lie tour, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin) to file a lawsuit for $30 million. EMI claimed that the band had failed to produce {{three of the five}} records they were obligated to deliver under their 1999 contract, which Virgin entered into with the now-defunct Immortal Records. Jared Leto responded to some of the claims in the suit stating [...] "under California law, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> and signed our deal, one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years." [...] Thirty Seconds to Mars had been contracted for nine years, so the band decided to exercise their [...] "legal right to terminate our old, out-of-date contract, which, according to the law is null and void." ...|$|E
500|$|Partially in {{an effort}} to counter-act {{negative}} publicity from oil sands-related issues—for example, the March 2009 edition of National Geographic Magazine contained a 20-page article portraying Alberta's oil sands operations as being highly environmentally damaging—in 2009 Stelmach's government spent $25million on a rebranding campaign for the province. Among other things, it replaced the [...] "Alberta Advantage" [...] slogan that had long been in use with [...] "Alberta: Freedom to create. [...] Spirit to achieve." [...] The campaign became the subject of some ridicule when the Edmonton Journal revealed that one of the photos used in it was not taken in Alberta, but at a North Sea beach in Northumberland. While the government initially claimed that it had intentionally used a foreign image to represent Alberta's engagement with the world, it later admitted that this was not the case, and that the photo had been used in error. [...] Stelmach responded to the image, which showed two children running along a beach, by saying that [...] "children, no matter where they are around the world, they are the next generation. And air quality, water quality, no matter <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> on this big globe, we're all responsible, and that's the message we're trying to portray." ...|$|E

60|$|My dear child, who can tell? One {{can only}} tell that, by remembering {{something}} which happened <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> before; and as we remember nothing, we know nothing about it; and no book, and no man, can ever tell us certainly.|$|R
2500|$|Verbal prefixes {{are used}} {{only in the}} {{independent}} order, although some forms of the independent order lack a prefix. There are three of them: /n-/ (first person), /k-/ (second person), and /w-/ (third person). If a stem has an underlying initial vowel, a /t/ is inserted after the prefix, and before this and other stem-initial consonants a /ə/ is inserted. Sometimes, this /ə/ contracts with a stem-initial /wə/ to /o·/ except when the /o·/ would be phonetically shortened via rule U-4a. Examples include: /ntá·mwi/ ("I get up from lying") versus /á·mwi·(w)/ ("he gets up"). Two roots with initial /t/ extend the syllable with /-ən/ when adding prefixes; these roots are /tal-/ ("there") and /tax-/ ("so many"), e.g. náni ntəntala·wsí·ne·n ("that is <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> [...] ") from the animate intransitive stem /tala·wəsi·/.|$|E

[...] Flea stated he can no longer surf there or take his daughter to the beach further saying [...] "Some kid in the hood who made a mistake selling drugs will go to jail and have his life ruined but you, you evil lying scumbags will get away with a paltry fine that means nothing to you.
