5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and <b>wrenched</b> shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled bricks and other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While {{crossing}} a street {{a couple of blocks}} from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely <b>wrenched</b> and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries were never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.|$|E
5|$|The online mode of the game, {{which is}} only {{available}} in the Japanese version, also introduces {{a group called the}} Restrictors, the former leaders of Deepground before Weiss took over. The Restrictors' leader had implanted microchips into the brainstems of all Deepground soldiers so as to ensure they never turn against the group. However, Weiss was able to overcome this control method, and the Tsviets <b>wrenched</b> control from the Restrictors. Although Weiss was successful in overthrowing the Restrictors, however, the leader of the Restrictors was able to implant a virus into Weiss' bloodstream.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} <b>wrenched</b> Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Auschwitz, the SS {{forcibly}} separated {{the men from}} the women and children, and Otto Frank was <b>wrenched</b> from his family. Those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labour were immediately killed. Of the 1,019 passengers, 549—including all children younger than 15—were sent directly to the gas chambers. Anne Frank, who had turned 15 three months earlier, was one of the youngest people spared from her transport. She was soon made aware that most people were gassed upon arrival and never learned that the entire group from the Achterhuis had survived this selection. She reasoned that her father, in his mid-fifties and not particularly robust, had been killed immediately after they were separated.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Plymouth, Lord Clyde was paid off {{and a new}} engine was built for her at Devonport Dockyard. In addition, her {{four-bladed}} propeller {{was replaced by a}} lighter, two-bladed propeller with less drag and the ship was rearmed. She remained in reserve until 1871 when she recommissioned under the command of Captain John Bythesea, an officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Crimean War of 1854–55. Lord Clyde rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet; six months after her arrival, she ran aground herself whilst attempting to rescue a British steamship that had gone aground off the island of Pantellaria. Attempts to lighten the ship enough to float her off were futile and she remained stuck fast taking damage from wave action that strained her back and <b>wrenched</b> off her sternpost, rudder post and rudder. Lord Warden was able to pull her off and tow her to be repaired at Malta where the dockyard estimated repairs would take six months. Bythesea and his navigator were convicted during their court-martial and neither ever served at sea again.|$|E
50|$|A power <b>wrench</b> is type of <b>wrench</b> that {{is powered}} by other means than human force. A typical power source is {{compressed}} air. There are two main types of power wrenches: impact <b>wrenches</b> and air ratchet <b>wrenches</b> or pneumatic ratchet <b>wrenches.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{ease with}} which this {{valuable}} province was <b>wrenched</b> from the Byzantine Empire {{appears to have been}} due to the treachery of the governor of Egypt, Cyrus, Melchite (i.e., Byzantine/Chalcedonian Orthodox, not Coptic) Patriarch of Alexandria, and the incompetence of the generals of the Byzantine forces, as well as due to the loss of most of the Byzantine troops in Syria against the Rashidun army. Cyrus had persecuted the local Coptic Christians. He is {{one of the authors of}} monothelism, a seventh-century heresy, and some supposed him to have been a secret convert to Islam.|$|E

25|$|In 262, {{the mint}} in Alexandria started to again issue coins for Gallienus, demonstrating that Egypt had {{returned}} to his control after suppressing the revolt of the Macriani. In spring of 262, the city was <b>wrenched</b> by civil unrest {{as a result of}} a new revolt. The rebel this time was the prefect of Egypt, Lucius Mussius Aemilianus, who had already given support to the revolt of the Macriani.

With the sound of water entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E

25|$|After {{defeating}} Anthony Macias, Sakuraba was matched against Royler Gracie, who {{had previously}} conquered Sakuraba's stablemate Yuhi Sano.

Royler, unable to score a takedown or strike effectively from a standing position, remained {{on the ground in}} an effort to bait Sakuraba into a grappling-oriented contest, while Sakuraba, standing, landed punishing kicks to Royler's legs, thighs and head. Eventually, with less than two minutes remaining, Sakuraba finally engaged Royler on the ground and instantly caught him in a Kimura lock. As Sakuraba <b>wrenched</b> on the submission, the referee intervened with 1 minute and 44 seconds remaining on the clock, ending the contest and awarding Sakuraba the win by TKO.|$|E
25|$|Heraclius' {{inability}} {{to rule the}} Empire as his death neared did Byzantium no favors. After Heraclius' death in 641, the former Empress Martina declared herself, her son, Heracleonas, and her stepson, Constantine, co-emperors of the Byzantine Empire. However, the citizens of Constantinople refused to accept this. And so, when Constantine III died sometime between May 24 and May 26, 641 (considered {{by the majority of}} the Byzantines to have been done by Martina's hand), Heracleonas and his mother were deposed the following summer. Heraclonas' nose was slit and Martina's tongue was <b>wrenched</b> out. These acts ensured that Heraclonas could never become Basileus (Emperor) – the physical deformation would have made it impossible. However, as suspects of committing regicide, their exile to the island of Rhodes was a light punishment.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the twelve}} {{passengers}} who suffered major injuries, nine suffered the injuries from the impact and three suffered the injuries from the evacuation.

The Captain sustained back and head injuries during {{the impact of the}} crash when his seat was <b>wrenched</b> out of place by the force of the impact, causing him to hit his head against the overhead controls. Minor injuries included twisted ankles, sore necks, bruises and effects from smoke inhalation. A total of 33 persons were taken to various hospitals within and outside Toronto for treatment, of which 21 were treated for minor injuries and released. The York-Finch campus of the Humber River Regional Hospital treated seven people for smoke inhalation. William Osler Health Centre, Etobicoke General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital were additional nearby hospitals that had admitted victims of the crash.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there were}} {{occasional}} challenges to {{his position as}} Liverpool's number 1, Grobbelaar was a virtual ever-present from Clemence's departure {{to the start of}} the 1990s which coincided with the end of the club's dominance. He was an ever-present in his first five league campaigns at Anfield, when Liverpool were champions four times and runners-up on the other occasion. However, in 1988–89, injuries and illness restricted his first team opportunities and he played 21 times in the league, with Mike Hooper taking his place on the other 17 occasions. However, he was fit to face Everton in the 3–2 FA Cup win on 20 May 1989, though six days later he conceded a last minute goal to Arsenal midfielder Michael Thomas on the final day of the league season as the league title was <b>wrenched</b> from Liverpool's grasp and headed to Highbury instead. A month earlier, he played in the FA Cup semi-final win over Nottingham Forest which was played at Old Trafford after the original match at Hillsborough was cancelled due to the tragedy that led to 96 fans dying on terracing just behind Grobbelaar's goal.

He was placed in charge of the newly created office of military service of Satsuma in October 1847. In 1848, Narioki appointed Hisamitsu steward of Chosa District, with the responsibility of acting on behalf of the daimyō in all military matters in the area. At about the same time, Hisamitsu was given the highly respected post of han councilor, a rank which, according to the instructions accompanying the appointment, placed him {{at the top of the}} social scale. At ceremonial occasions, Hisamitsu was ordered by his father to sit at a place higher than that of the deputy in charge of the daimyō of Satsuma’s castle. Narioki even went so far as to place Hisamitsu in charge of all of Satsuma whenever the daimyō chose to leave Satsuma for any reason, business or pleasure. It was apparent that Hisamitsu was being groomed to become the next daimyō, completely disregarding the fact that, by primogeniture, Nariakira was supposed to be the heir-apparent.|$|E

40|$|Bond {{strength}} {{is one of}} the most important factors that affect the performance of the joint under various loading conditions. The flexural bond strength of a joint can be measured using a bond <b>wrench.</b> The first of the bond <b>wrenches</b> was developed in 1980 s in the Australian laboratories. Former TAMU students had built a lightweight Indian unbalanced and balanced bond <b>wrench.</b> An Australian bond <b>wrench</b> was manufactured in 2011 and subsequently in 2012 an ASTM C 1072 Bond <b>Wrench</b> was developed. Previous researchers have found out that no unacceptable bias existed in the flexural strength values forecasted using the Indian balanced and unbalanced <b>wrench.</b> The studies have also shown that there exists a bias between American Bond <b>Wrench</b> and Australian Bond <b>wrenches.</b> The Australian <b>wrench</b> values were significantly higher than the American bond <b>wrenches</b> for similar types of samples. Hence it was recommended that the tests be carried out by replacing the cement with Portland cement. This experimental research uses Portland cement and a total of 50 prisms was built in two sets. Each prism comprised of six bricks with five joints, and all the bricks used were Texan bricks. The mortar used here was 1 : 1 : 6. The samples were cured for a period of 28 days, and all the experiments swere carried out under same weather conditions The first set prisms was tested using Australian and the American bond <b>wrench.,</b> the second set of prims was tested using the other two <b>wrenches.</b> A Student?s t-Test analysis was run between the flexural strength values of the four <b>wrenches.</b> From the plots, it can be inferred that the mean value of the American <b>wrench</b> was low when compared with the mean values of the other three <b>wrenches.</b> The plots of Australian bond <b>wrench</b> and Indian unbalanced were quite similar. It can be concluded that the values forecasted using the American bond <b>wrench</b> were statistically different from the other three <b>wrenches,</b> and the reason can be noted as the difficulty in using the American bond <b>wrench.</b> Further research is recommended using the Texas red brick...|$|R
