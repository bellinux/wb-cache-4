5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

However, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> these are only anecdotal reports, and robust scientific evidence {{for the use of}} marijuana is lacking... at present, the epilepsy community does not know if marijuana is a safe and effective treatment, nor do they know the long-term effects that marijuana will have on learning, memory and behavior, especially in infants and young children.|$|E
2500|$|As President of the Victoria Institute, Stokes wrote: [...] "We all {{admit that}} the book of Nature and the book of Revelation come alike from God, and that {{consequently}} {{there can be no}} real discrepancy between the two if rightly interpreted. [...] The provisions of Science and Revelation are, for the most part, so distinct that there is little chance of collision. [...] But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other. [...] For however firmly convinced we may be of the truth of revelation, we must admit our liability to err as to the extent or interpretation of what is revealed; and however strong the scientific evidence in favour of a theory may be, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> we are dealing with evidence which, in its nature, is probable only, and it is conceivable that wider scientific knowledge might lead us to alter our opinion".|$|E

2500|$|In February 2003, Michael {{unexpectedly}} recorded {{another song}} in {{protest against the}} looming Iraq war, Don McLean's [...] "The Grave". The original was written by McLean in 1971 and was a protest against the Vietnam War. Michael performed the song on numerous TV shows including Top of the Pops and So Graham Norton. His performance of the song on Top of the Pops on 7 March 2003 was his first studio appearance on the programme since 1986. He ran into conflict with the show's producers for an anti-war, anti Blair T-shirt worn by some members of his band. In response, Don McLean issued a statement, through his website, praising Michael's recording: [...] "I am proud of George Michael for standing up for life and sanity. I am delighted that he chose a song of mine to express these feelings. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the Wizard is really a cowardly old man hiding behind a curtain with a loud microphone. It takes courage and a song to pull the curtain open and expose him. Good Luck George." ...|$|E

It is true that European officials respected and supported Ramtonoo, but among his own countrymen he was despised and shunned. However, he continued his career, undisturbed by friend and foe… Later in life he was attracted to the new Brahmo Samaj and became a close friend of Keshub Chunder Sen… While cultivating his little garden he was found lost in devotion at the sight of full-blown rose and while singing a hymn in adoration of God, his whole countenance seemed to beam with heavenly light… When his end approached, his old friend Debendranath Tagore went to take leave of him, and when he left, he cried, ‘Now that the gates of heaven are open to you, and the Gods are waiting with their outstretched arms to receive you to the glorious region.’” ...|$|E

5000|$|Staff-weapons in Medieval or Renaissance England were lumped {{together}} under the generic term [...] "staves" [...] but when dealing with them in detail {{we are faced with}} terminological difficulty. There never {{seems to have been a}} clear definition of what was what; there were apparently far fewer staff-weapons in use than there were names to call them by; and contemporary writers up to the seventeenth century use these names with abandon, calling different weapons by the same name and similar weapons by different names. To add to this, we have various nineteenth century terminologies used by scholars. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> too <b>that</b> any particular weapon ... had everywhere a different name.|$|R

2500|$|At Marquette University, {{philosophy}} department chairman James South ordered {{graduate student}} Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed Dave Barry {{quote from the}} door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive.

I refer, of course, to the federal government.") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down.

The people of this continent were builders of pyramids, a fact reflected in the activities of the lost continent’s last survivors, the Mayas, Egyptians, and, of course, the Japanese. We might thus conclude that Mahikari’s teachings comprise a collection of esoteric knowledge of various origin, some from published material and some from Okada’s earlier experiences as leader in another religious group, the Sekai Kyuseikyo (Church of World Messianity), whose cosmology and rituals bear many resemblances to Mahikari’s." ...|$|R
