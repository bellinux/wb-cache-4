In this paper, we assume the load share rule is unknown and derive methods for statistical inference on load-share parameters. We consider components with (individual) constant failure rates in two environments: (1) the system load is distributed evenly among the working components, and (2) only assume the load for each <b>working</b> <b>component</b> increases when other components in the system fail.

40|$|International audienceRATIONALE:The {{ventricular}} conduction system {{controls the}} propagation of electric activity through the heart to coordinate cardiac contraction. This system is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes organized in defined structures including central components and a peripheral Purkinje fiber network. How the mammalian ventricular conduction system is established during development remains controversial. OBJECTIVE:To define the lineage relationship between cells of the murine ventricular conduction system and surrounding working myocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS:A retrospective clonal analysis using the alpha-cardiac actin(nlaacZ/+) mouse line {{was carried out in}} three week old hearts. Clusters of clonally related myocytes were screened for conductive cells using connexin 40 -driven enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. Two classes of clusters containing conductive cells were obtained. Mixed clusters, composed of conductive and working myocytes, reveal that both cell types develop from common progenitor cells, whereas smaller unmixed clusters, composed exclusively of conductive cells, show that proliferation continues after lineage restriction to the conduction system lineage. Differences in the <b>working</b> <b>component</b> of mixed clusters between the right and left ventricles reveal distinct progenitor cell histories in these cardiac compartments. These results are supported by genetic fate mapping using Cre recombinase revealing progressive restriction of connexin 40 -positive myocytes to a conductive fate.

Cannibalizations also can create unnecessary mechanical problems for maintenance personnel. With the exception of the Navy, the services do not consistently track the specific reasons for cannibalizations. In the broadest sense, cannibalizations are done because of pressures to meet readiness and operational needs and the shortcomings of the supply system. In addition, a Navy study found that cannibalizations are sometimes done because mechanics are not trained well enough to diagnose problems or because testing equipment is either not available or not working. Although the services have undertaken some initiatives to reduce cannibalizations, none of them have developed a specific strategy to reduce the maintenance hours associated with cannibalizations.

40|$|To {{create an}} energy {{efficient}} vehicle {{there are a}} number of aspects that need to be optimized, namely; the drive train of the vehicle and energy source, aerodynamics and weight. Focusing on weight reduction, while still maintaining the desired performance and structural strength, many manufacturers are turning to advanced composites due to their superior strength to weight characteristics. Solar car racing provides a research platform that drives this innovation through technology development and efficiency. A lightweight vehicle suspension system design is being presented, together with an introduction into future testing. A suspension system is made up of a number of critical components which are dynamically loaded during standard operation due to undulating forces imposed by the road surface. Unidirectional cross-wound carbon fiber tubing is used for suspension and steering arms. The tubing is interfaced with small steel inserts and pivoting arm tie rod ends. Concerns within the design are the adhesive bonding of the carbon tubing to the steel inserts, and what type of tensile loading the interface can withstand. Due to forces imposed on the system during cornering and shock loading the components are required to withstand a minimum of 1. 2 times the weight of the overall vehicle, i. e. 258 kg. Tensile test results show that the mechanical properties of the adhesive joints rely somewhat on the surface characteristics and bond preparation. The target load of 258 kg was successfully obtained under static loading for two types of sample sets. The first based on the standard for describing the lap shear strength of adhesively bonded carbon fiber to aluminum, and the second based on the <b>working</b> <b>component</b> itself...|$|E

Land use and biodiversity are agricultural and ecological challenges presently facing Nigeria in her efforts at addressing the issue of agro-ecosystem transformation and sustainable land productivity. This study employed secondary sources of information to assess land reform act in Nigeria, the methodological framework to analyze the linkages between land use change and biodiversity, effects of land use on biodiversity, status of biodiversity and suggests ways to solving land use problems and biodiversity loss. Findings revealed climate change, invasive species, land conversion due to ignorance and high level of poverty as some of the drivers of biodiversity loss in Nigeria. Nigerians are altering the natural environment through continuing agricultural expansion and practices (conversion of forests to cultivated areas) although with the introduction of government-led Presidential Initiative Afforestation programme nationwide for regeneration. While competing land uses for agriculture and human settlements, rising demand for fuel wood and charcoal are contributing to the decline of forest and woodland areas; over-harvesting of resources and unregulated burning are also contributing to the decline of many species in the wild. In order to effectively implement many agreements, Nigeria had signed treaties with other international communities on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity that conservation should be integrated into all forms of land use to promote cross-sectional cooperation among land users. It is imperative to check the pressures on protected areas in order to stem the tide of biodiversity loss.

During the 1990 s, both the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) created congenital heart surgery outcomes databases. Beginning in 1998, the EACTS and STS collaborated {{in the work of the}} International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project. By 2000, a common congenital heart surgery nomenclature, along with a common core minimal data set, were adopted by the EACTS and the STS and published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery. In 2000, the International Nomenclature Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease was established; this committee eventually evolved into the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (ISNPCHD). The <b>working</b> <b>component</b> of ISNPCHD is the International Working Group for Mapping and Coding of Nomenclatures for Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, also known as the Nomenclature Working Group (NWG). By 2005, the NWG cross-mapped the EACTS-STS nomenclature with the European Paediatric Cardiac Code of the Association for European Paediatric Cardiology and created the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC) (www. IPCCC. NET). This common nomenclature (IPCCC), and the common minimum database data set created by the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, are now utilized by both EACTS and STS; since 1998, this nomenclature and database have been used by both the STS and EACTS to analyze outcomes of more than 75, 000 patients. Two major multi-institutional efforts have attempted to measure case complexity; the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery- 1 and the Aristotle Complexity Score. Efforts to unify these two scoring systems are in their early stages but are encouraging. Collaborative efforts involving the EACTS and STS are under way to develop mechanisms to verify data completeness and accuracy. Further collaborative efforts are also ongoing between pediatric and congenital heart surgeons and other subspecialties, including pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists (via the Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society), pediatric cardiac intensivists (via the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society), and pediatric cardiologists (via the Joint Council on Congenital Heart Disease).

40|$|Bioaerosols {{in animal}} stables {{represent}} a complex mixture of diverse airborne materials of organic origin, {{which can cause}} health impairments to humans and animals in stables due to their infectious, allergy and inflammation triggering potency. In this case endotoxins as a cell wall component of gramnegative bacteria represent the most important proinflammatoric actively <b>working</b> <b>component</b> of bioaerosols, {{which was to be}} characterized in this thesis more precisely. Aim of this study was on the one hand the differentiation between endotoxic and non-endotoxic proinflammatoric activity of bioaerosol samples from animal stables {{and on the other hand}} the analysis how the endotoxic and proinflammatoric active substances are distributed depending on the aerodynamic diameter of the dust particles. For this a semiquantitative human whole blood test was used with which the proinflammatoric potential of the analysed bioaerosol particles (inhalable dust, PM 10 -dust) was identified by immunological standard techniques (ELISA). The samples in the whole blood assay were tested with and without addition of Polymyxin B, a potent endotoxin inhibitor. For comparison a Limulus-Amoebocyte-Lysate (LAL) -test was used to determine the concentration of endotoxins in the bioaerosol samples. The investigations showed that by addition of Polymyxin B the proinflammatoric activity of the bioaerosol samples and potential sources of bioaerosol origins, like excrement, feed and litter, was reduced by 85 % on the average. Endotoxins consequently represent the qualitative as well as quantitative most important proinflammatoric active bioaerosol component. A significant correlation between the endotoxic activity in the LAL-test and the total proinflammatoric activity in the whole blood test (r= 0, 817, α= 0, 01) proved that the LAL-test, although it only records endotoxins, can also be used for the characterization of the total proinflammatoric potential of bioaerosol samples from animal stables. Thus the LAL-test in consideration of time, work and material expenditure represents the faster and simpler method in comparison to the whole blood test at the moment to describe the amount of proinflammatoric substances in the air of animal stables. For the application of both test systems standardized conditions, like collecting-method (defined measuring instruments, measuring time, filter size etc.) and the performance of the test under defined, repeatable conditions are most important. There also was found a relationship between the concentration of dust and endotoxin in the bioaerosol samples (r= 0, 949, α= 0, 01). That means, the higher the dust concentration of the analysed samples, the higher was the respective endotoxin concentration. Endotoxins seem to be mainly bound to particles in the air of animal stables, which was confirmed in literature for several times. Concerning the distribution of the proinflammatoric and endotoxic activity depending on the aerodynamic diameter of the dust particles it was established that the proinflammatoric substances and the endotoxins were constantly distributed in both tested dust fractions (inhalable dust, PM 10 dust). It should be analysed in future experiments how the endotoxins are distributed in further dust fractions from animal stables, like PM 2. 5 and PM 1. 0. An investigation of potential bioaerosol sources, like excrement, feed and litter, suggest that the animal’s excrement represent one of the highest sources for airborne endotoxins. Measures for the reduction of emissions which reduce aerosol formation from excrement containing substances in animal stables, like flushing of the excrement pile or excrement belt with the exhaust air stream, further measures of binding dust in the stable air (for instance water- or oil spraying systems) and an optimized ventilation control provide an effective contribution for improvement of the air quality in animal stables...|$|E
40|$|This review {{discusses}} the historical aspects, {{current state of}} the art, and potential future advances in the areas of nomenclature and databases for the analysis Of Outcomes of treatments for patients with congenitally malformed hearts. We will consider the current state of analysis of outcomes, lay out some principles which might make it possible to achieve life-long monitoring and follow-up using our databases, and describe the next steps those involved in the care of these patients need to take in order to achieve these objectives. In order to perform meaningful multi-institutional analyses, we suggest that any database must incorporate the following six essential elements: use of a common language and nomenclature, use of an established uniform core dataset for collection of information, incorporation of a mechanism of evaluating case complexity, availability of a mechanism to assure and verify the completeness and accuracy of the data collected, collaboration between medical and Surgical subspecialties, and standardised protocols for life-long follow-up. During the 1990 s, both The European Association for CardIo-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons created databases to assess the outcomes of congenital cardiac surgery. Beginning in 1998, these two organizations collaborated to create the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project. By 2000, a common nomenclature, along with a common core minimal dataset, were adopted by The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and published in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery. In 2000, The International Nomenclature Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease was established. This committee eventually evolved into the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease. The <b>working</b> <b>component</b> of this international nomenclature society has been The International Working Group for Mapping and Coding of Nomenclatures for Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, also known as the Nomenclature Working Group. By 2005, the Nomenclature Working Group crossmapped the nomenclature of the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project of The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons with the European Paediatric Cardiac Code of the Association for European Paediatric Cardiology, and therefore created the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code, which is available for free download from the internet at [[URL] This common nomenclature, the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code, and the common minimum database data set created by the International Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project, are now utilized by both The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Between 1998 and 2007 inclusive, this nomenclature and database was used by both of these two organizations to analyze outcomes of over 150, 000 operations involving patients undergoing surgical treatment for congenital cardiac disease. Two major multi-institutional efforts that have attempted to measure the complexity of congenital heart Surgery are the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery- 1 system, and the Aristotle Complexity Score. Current efforts to unify the Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery- 1 system and the Aristotle Complexity Score are in their early stages, but encouraging. Collaborative efforts involving The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons are under way to develop mechanisms to verify the completeness and accuracy of the data in the databases. Under the leadership of The MultiSocietal Database Committee for Pediatric and Congenital Heart Disease, further collaborative efforts are ongoing between congenital and paediatric cardiac surgeons and other subspecialties, including paediatric cardiac anaesthesiologists, via The Congenital Cardiac Anesthesia Society, paediatric cardiac intensivists, via The Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society, and paediatric cardiologists, via the joint Council on Congenital Heart Disease and The Association for European Paediatric Cardiology. In finalising our review, we emphasise that analysis of outcomes must move beyond mortality, and encompass longer term follow-up, including cardiac and non cardiac morbidities, and importantly, those morbidities impacting health related quality of life. Methodologies must be implemented in these databases to allow uniform, protocol driven, and meaningful, long term follow-up...|$|E

In contrast, despite there being a significant observed relationship between phonological loop and timed and untimed calculation, there was no significant genetic or environmental covariance between the phonological loop and timed or untimed calculation skills. Further analyses indicated that genetic overlap between the visuo-spatial sketchpad and math story problem solving and math fluency was distinct from general genetic factors, whereas g, phonological loop, and mathematics shared generalist genes. Thus, although each <b>working</b> memory <b>component</b> was related to mathematics, the etiology of their relationships may be distinct...|$|R
