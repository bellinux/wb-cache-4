Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late. It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.|$|E
5|$|During March and April, U.S. {{military}} intelligence began to detect {{elements of the}} PAVN 2nd Division moving towards Khâm Đức, but their opponent's true intentions were largely unknown. In response to <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> major attack, General William Westmoreland decided {{to build up the}} defenses of the Khâm Đức Special Forces, by sending in U.S. Army engineers to upgrade the local airstrip for sustained use by large transport aircraft, as well as airlifting weapons and ammunition for the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. Australian-led 11th Mobile Strike Force (MSF) Company was ordered to take up positions in Ngok Tavak (Ngok Ta Vak), an outpost serving Khâm Đức, to boost allied intelligence-gathering capabilities in the area. However, unbeknownst to the United States and other allied forces, the Viet Cong (VC) 1st Regiment had been watching the build-up around Khâm Đức for some time, and were preparing to initiate the assault by taking out Ngok Tavak.|$|E

500|$|By late February 1942, the Soviet winter counter-offensive, {{had pushed}} German forces from Moscow {{on a broad}} front and then ended in mutual exhaustion. Stalin was {{convinced}} that the Germans were finished and would collapse by the spring or summer 1942, as he said in his speech of 7 November 1941. Stalin decided to exploit this perceived weakness on the Eastern Front by launching a new offensive in the spring.

Tom Price of TeamXbox said that gamers have been waiting {{a long time for}} a console RTS [...] "to get it right", and Halo Wars did so; reviewers for Official Xbox Magazine credited Ensemble with creating a strategy game that felt [...] "absolutely at home on the console", rather than a [...] "poorly shoehorned ... port" [...] of a PC game with clumsy controls. 1UP's Thierry Nguyen was neutral about whether it was a good RTS game or Halo title, but called it a [...] "solid beginning towards <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> really good console RTS". Digital Trends' Scott Steinberg said that, while not perfect, Halo Wars made a strong case for the viability of RTS on consoles; [...] "There's certainly the potential to have PC holdouts seriously reconsidering hoisting the controller." [...] Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle offered a dismissive summation of the game as [...] "a remedial game—real-time strategy for dummies", and stated that the game offered relatively little innovation when compared to other Halo titles.|$|E

Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com stated, [...] "Not the most passionate kiss, but satisfying enough, given {{that most of the}} episode was devoted to showcasing the big event." [...] The kiss represented a change in American culture. Stephen Tropiano of PopMatters said, [...] "In perhaps <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> step in the right direction, daytime television has at last included the first on-screen kiss between a same-sex couple." [...] Tropiano, however, criticized shows treating same-sex kisses as [...] "big events". He stated, [...] "Over the years, television has repeatedly made the same point by treating a kiss exchanged between two members of the same sex as something out-of-the-ordinary and unnatural. It's the network brass more than television series writers and producers who have reinforced society's negative attitudes toward public displays of affection between gay and lesbian couples by treating same-sex kissing as a taboo subject." [...] Tropiano wondered now that Lena and Bianca had kissed if they would kiss again or go beyond that in regards to physical intimacy; he felt that it was not likely until society, or at least, television, began to regard a same-sex kiss as just a kiss.|$|E
