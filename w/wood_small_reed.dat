50|$|One {{important}} {{quality of}} the switch is its sensitivity, the amount of magnetic field necessary to actuate it. Sensitivity is measured in units of Ampere-turns (AT), corresponding to the current in a test coil multiplied {{by the number of}} turns in the test coil. Typical pull-in sensitivities for commercial devices are in the 10 to 60 AT range. The lower the AT, the more sensitive the <b>reed</b> switch. Also, <b>smaller</b> <b>reed</b> switches, which have smaller parts, are more sensitive to magnetic fields, so the <b>smaller</b> the <b>reed</b> switch's glass envelope is, the more sensitive it is.|$|R
