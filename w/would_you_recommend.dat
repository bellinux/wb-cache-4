[...] "He is a most active young officer, and his {{knowledge}} of so many languages is of immense advantage. I would gladly give him an independent command, but as there are so many midshipmen senior to him, I could not do so. You know the coast of Anatolia probably better than anyone else here. Which harbour <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> as the most suitable for the entry of a large fleet? It must be well sheltered, and the shore should offer facilities for heeling the vessels over as far as possible in order to clean them.

60|$|From {{the great}} {{knowledge}} which you possess of British art, {{looking to the}} most eminent painters, sculptors, and architects at this time, should {{you say that the}} number of the Royal Academy is sufficient fully to represent them, or <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> an increase in the present number of Academicians?--I have not considered in what proportion the Academicianships at present exist. That is rather a question bearing upon the degree of dignity which one would be glad to confer. I should like the highest dignity to be limited, but I should like the inferior dignity corresponding to the Associateship to be given, as the degrees are given in the universities, without any limitation of number, to those possessing positive attainments and skill. I should think a very limited number of Academicianships would always meet all the requirements of the highest intellect of the country.|$|E
60|$|<b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>recommend</b> {{that some}} person should follow {{him through the}} {{building}} to explain the details?--No; but I would especially recommend that our institutions should be calculated for the help of persons whose minds are languid with labor. I find that with ordinary constitutions, the labor of a day in England oppresses a man, and breaks him down, {{and it is not}} refreshment to him to use his mind after that, but it would be refreshment to him to have anything read to him, or any amusing thing told him, or to have perfect rest; he likes to lie back in his chair at his own fireside, and smoke his pipe, rather than enter into a political debate, and what we want is an extension of our art institutions, with interesting things, teaching a man and amusing him at the same time; above all, large printed explanations under every print and every picture; and the subjects of the pictures such as they can enjoy.|$|E
