5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signal</b> #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under the <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> On January4, all signals, except in Eastern Samar, were lifted as Auring recurved and {{moved away from the}} Philippines.

5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
40|$|A Lane Departure Warning (LDW) {{system for}} trucks was {{developed}} and evaluated in an iterative design process. As the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> used {{by the majority of}} LDW systems are disliked by drivers, most effort was put in the design of haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The iterative design process resulted in two different haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> displayed through vibration motors in the seat: a 2 ̆ 2 blinking 2 ̆ 2 signal for Medium Criticality departures and a continuously vibrating signal for High Criticality departures. In addition, the iterative design process also resulted in small modifications in the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The effectiveness and user acceptance of the haptic and auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were evaluated in an experiment with a driving simulator with 20 participants and in a road test with a truck with 5 participants. It was found that the haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were as effective as the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in dealing with lane departures, both in normal driving situations and in a driving + secondary task situation. In addition, the participants clearly preferred the haptic signals over the auditory <b>warning</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Catastrophic {{and sudden}} collapses of {{ecosystems}} are sometimes preceded by early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> that potentially {{could be used}} to predict and prevent a forthcoming catastrophe. Universality of these early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> has been proposed, but no formal proof has been provided. Here, we show that in relatively simple ecological models the most commonly used early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> for a catastrophic collapse can be silent. We underpin the mathematical reason for this phenomenon, which involves the direction of the eigenvectors of the system. Our results demonstrate that claims on the universality of early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> are not correct, and that catastrophic collapses can occur without prior warning. In order to correctly predict a collapse and determine whether early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> precede the collapse, detailed knowledge of the mathematical structure of the approaching bifurcation is necessary. Unfortunately, such knowledge is often only obtained after the collapse has already occurred...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{description}} of potentially generic early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> is a promising development {{that may help}} conservationists to anticipate a population's collapse prior to its occurrence. So far, the majority of such <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> documented have been in highly controlled laboratory systems or theoretical models. Data from wild populations, however, are typically restricted both temporally and spatially due to limited monitoring resources and intrinsic ecological heterogeneity – limitations that may affect the detectability of generic early <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> as they add additional stochasticity to population abundance estimates. Consequently, spatial and temporal subsampling may serve either to muffle or magnify early <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Using a combination of theoretical models and analysis of experimental data, we evaluate {{the extent to which}} statistical warning signs are robust to data corruption...|$|R
5|$|Aposematism is {{exploited}} in Müllerian mimicry, where {{species with}} strong defences evolve to resemble one another. By mimicking similarly coloured species, the <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> to predators is shared, {{causing them to}} learn more quickly at less of a cost {{to each of the}} species.|$|E
5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce a roaring sound.|$|E

40|$|Objective: A driving {{simulator}} {{study was conducted}} in order to assess the relative utility of unimodal auditory, unimodal vibrotactile, and combined audiotactile (i. e., multisensory) in-car <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to alert and inform drivers of likely front-to-rear-end collision events in a situation modeled on real-world driving. Background: The implementation of non visual in-car <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> may have important safety implications in lessening any visual overload during driving. Multisensory integration can provide synergistic facilitation effects. Method: The participants drove along a rural road in a car-following scenario in either {{the presence or absence of}} a radio program in the background. The brake light signals of the lead vehicle were also unpredictably either enabled or disabled on a trial-by-trial basis. Results: The results showed that the participants initiated their braking responses significantly more rapidly following the presentation of audiotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> than following the presentation of either unimodal auditory or unimodal vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> Conclusion: Multisensory <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> offer a particularly effective means of capturing driver attention in demanding situations such as driving. Application: The potential value of such multisensory in-car <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> is explained with reference to recent cognitive neuroscience research.

5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} <b>warning</b> <b>signal.</b> If the species was already unpalatable, predators might learn to avoid the cluster, protecting gregarious individuals with the new aposematic trait. Gregariousness would assist predators to learn to avoid unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E
5|$|Once aposematic {{individuals}} reach {{a certain}} threshold population, for whatever reason, the predator learning process would be {{spread out over}} {{a larger number of}} individuals and therefore is less likely to wipe out the trait for warning colouration completely. If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} three {{experiments}} was designed to investigate whether the presentation of moving tactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> that are presented in a particular spatiotemporal configuration may be particularly effective in terms of facilitating a driver's response to a target event. In the experiments reported here, participants' visual attention was manipulated such that they were either attending to the frontal object that might occasionally approach them on a collision course, or else they were distracted by a color discrimination task presented from behind. We measured how rapidly participants were able to initiate a braking response to a looming visual target following the onset of vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> presented from around their waist. The vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> consisted of single, double, and triple upward moving cues (Experiment 1), triple upward and downward moving cues (Experiment 2), and triple random cues (Experiment 3). The results demonstrated a significant performance advantage following the presentation of dynamic triple cues over the static single tactile cues, regardless of the specific configuration of the triple cues. These findings point to {{the potential benefits of}} embedding dynamic information in <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> for dynamic target events. These findings have important implications for the design of future vibrotactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen growing {{interest}} {{in the design of}} tactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> to direct driver attention to potentially dangerous road situations (e. g. an impending crash) so that they can initiate an avoidance maneuver in a timely manner. In this review, we highlight the potential uses of such <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> for future collision warning systems and compare them with more traditional visual and auditory warnings. Basic tactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> are capable of promoting driver alertness, which has been demonstrated to be beneficial for forward collision avoidance (when compared to a no warning baseline condition). However, beyond their basic alerting function, directional tactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> are now increasingly being utilized to shift the attention of the driver toward locations of interest, and thus to further facilitate their speeded responses to potential collision events. Currently, many researchers are focusing their efforts on the development of meaningful (iconic) tactile <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> For instance, dynamic tactile warnings (varying in their intensity and/or location) can potentially be used to convey meaningful information to drivers. Finally, we highlight the future research that will be needed in order to explore how to present multiple directional warnings using dynamic tactile cues, thus forming an integrated collision avoidance system for future in-vehicle use...|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Babs {{entered the}} PAGASA area of responsibility, {{government}} workers began closely tracking {{the storm and}} warned residents to be prepared. PAGASA issued a Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signal</b> #4 for Catanduanes, with lower warnings issued throughout Luzon and the Visayas. Metro Manila was placed under Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signal</b> #3 on October22. In Catanduanes, evacuees utilized public schools as an emergency shelter, although many rode out the storm in their homes. The storm halted ferry service throughout the region, stranding thousands. Many residents in Samar slept in buses and cars for two days due to the cancellations. Bus service to the region was also halted. The stock and currency exchanges were closed during the storm. Officials advised residents in Metro Manila to remain indoors; government buildings and schools were closed, while Ninoy Aquino International Airport halted all domestic flights. In addition, 14international flights were canceled. Manila South Harbor also kept all boats at port. Across the Philippines, Babs forced about 400,000people to leave their houses. Many families waited to evacuate until the onslaught of the strongest winds, resulting in additional casualties.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (<b>warning)</b> <b>signal,</b> {{given that}} females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to bright yellow, red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{suggestions}} that leaf shedding {{may be a}} response that provides protection against diseases and certain kinds of pests such as leaf miners and gall forming insects. Other responses such as the change of leaf colors prior to fall have also been suggested as adaptations that may help undermine the camouflage of herbivores. Autumn leaf color has also been suggested {{to act as an}} honest <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> of defensive commitment towards insect pests that migrate to the trees in autumn.|$|E
40|$|Warning {{signals are}} often very simple and {{monotone}} sounds. This paper focuses on taking a more musical {{approach to the}} design of warnings and alarms than has been the case in the past. We present an experimental pilot study in which we explore the possibilities of using short musical pieces as <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> in a vehicle cab. In the study, 18 experienced drivers experienced five different driving scenarios with different levels of urgency. Each scenario was presented together with an auditory icon, a traditional abstract warning sound, and a musical warning sound designed in collaboration with a composer. The test was carried out in an ``audio-only'' environment. Drivers were required to rate the perceived urgency, annoyance and appropriateness for every sound. They also {{had a chance to talk}} freely about the different <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> The results indicate interestingly that drivers may be able to understand the intended meaning of musical <b>warning</b> <b>signals.</b> It seems like the musical <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> may prove useful primarily in situations of low and medium levels of urgency...|$|R
40|$|Using the haptic {{modality}} {{to transfer}} {{information to the}} driver is recognized as a promising possibility in many in-vehicle applications. In the field of lane departure warning systems, several haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> were presented in the last years. The application of synthetic steering wheel torque or vibration informs the driver of an imminent lane departure. In this paper, an approach to classify the existing signals is provided. The examination of the literature reveals diversity in type and parameterization of the <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> as well as methodical differences, complicating comparability. While the general effectiveness of haptic <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> at the steering wheel could be proven, there still is room for improvement. Based on the findings, the authors derive hy- potheses concerning requirements from a user’s point of view...|$|R

5|$|Warning signals do not {{necessarily}} require that a species actually possesses chemical or physical defences to deter predators. Mimics such as the nonvenomous California mountain kingsnake (Lampropeltis zonata), which has yellow, red, and black bands {{similar to those of}} highly venomous coral snake species, have essentially piggybacked on the successful aposematism of the model. The evolution of a <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> by a mimicking species that resembles a species that possesses strong defences is known as Batesian mimicry.|$|E
5|$|Further, birds {{recall and}} avoid {{objects that are}} both {{conspicuous}} and foul-tasting longer than objects that are equally foul-tasting but cryptically coloured. This suggests that Wallace's original view, that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured, was correct. However, some birds (inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects, as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps, with dull green controls. This implies that warning coloration works {{at least in part}} by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal's meaning.|$|E

Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm. In Hong Kong, public <b>warning</b> <b>signal</b> number one was raised for nearly 24hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June20.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> perform when tested on climate systems thought to exhibit future tipping point behaviour. A tipping {{point in a}} dynamical system is a large and sudden change {{to the state of}} the system, usually caused by changes in external forcing. This is due to the state the system occupies becoming unstable, causing the system to settle to a new stable state. In many cases, there is a degree of irreversibility once the tipping point has been passed, preventing the system from reverting back to its original state without a large reversal in forcing. Passing tipping points in climate systems, such as the Amazon rainforest or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, is particularly dangerous as the effects of this will be globally felt. Fortunately there is potential for early <b>warning</b> <b>signals,</b> designed to warn that the system is approaching a tipping point. Generally, these early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> are based on analysis of the time series of the system, such as searching for ‘critical slowing down’, usually estimated by an increasing lag- 1 autocorrelation (AR(1)). The idea here is that as a system’s state becomes less stable, it will start to react more sluggishly to short term perturbations. While early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> have been tested extensively in simple models and on palaeoclimate data, there has been very little research into how these behave in complex models and observed data. Here, early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> are tested on climate systems that show tipping point behaviour in general circulation models. Furthermore, it examines why early <b>warning</b> <b>signals</b> might fail in certain cases and provides prospect for more ‘system specific indicators’ based on properties of individual tipping elements. The thesis also {{examines how}} slowing down in a system might affect ecosystems that are being driven by it...|$|R
5|$|As Linfa (locally {{known as}} Egay) {{approached}} {{closer to the}} Philippine island of Luzon, PAGASA issued Public Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>Signal</b> (PSWS) #2, expecting gale force-winds in Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, northern Isabela, Kalinga, and Quirino, including the offshore Babuyan and Calayan islands. A lower PSWS was issued for other portions of Luzon. Ahead of the storm, 45,336people evacuated in the Philippines, utilizing 31government shelters and assisted by police officers. Restricted travel by boat stranded 1,147people during the storm's passage. Due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon by the storm, all ships in the Port of Manila were ordered to remain in harbor, and 20flights were cancelled in northern Luzon. La Union province {{declared a state of}} calamity on July6 because of the storm. Road-clearing teams were prepared ahead of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a <b>warning</b> <b>signal)</b> in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|Before Imbudo struck, {{officials}} evacuated over 14,000people to {{at least}} 60shelters. Government offices were closed along the typhoon's path, and schools were closed in the capital, Manila. PAGASA issued a number 4 <b>warning</b> <b>signal,</b> the highest level, for three northern provinces, indicating the imminent threat of a powerful storm. Despite the warning, a post-storm survey in Isabela province indicated that 34% were unaware of the storm's arrival, while others believed the typhoon {{would not be as}} strong. In Manila, four flights were canceled at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and the Manila Light Rail Transit System was shut down for two hours. Travel by ship and bus were halted in some areas. On July22 before the storm struck, the Philippine military was put on red alert, increasing security at the presidential palace. The military stated it was due to the typhoon, although newspapers suggested it was to prevent a coup attempt; a failed coup ultimately did occur on July27 in what would become known as the Oakwood mutiny.|$|E
