A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe starling was a starling, but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
5|$|The Stresemann's bushcrow was {{described}} by Edgardo Moltoni in 1938. This species has been placed in several bird families since its description. It has long been considered {{a member of the}} crow family Corvidae; however, several atypical features, such as its lice being from the suborder Mallophaga, its bare facial skin being capable of movement, and the structure of its palate, have suggested that it may belong in another family. Some authors placed the species within the starling family Sturnidae due to the bushcrow's similarities in behavior and size with the <b>wattled</b> <b>starling.</b> Other authors have placed it in its own monotypic family, Zavattariornithidae. DNA-sequencing analysis supports its placement in the corvids, with its closest relatives being the ground jays, magpies, and the piapiac. It has been suggested that the bushcrow is a surviving relict ancestor to several of these relatives. However, its taxonomic situation is still considered to be in flux.|$|E

40|$|While egg {{destruction}} by brood parasites is {{a relatively}} well-known phenomenon, such destruction by non-brood-parasitic heterospecifics is less common. Here, we provide the first evidence of egg destruction by <b>Wattled</b> <b>Starlings</b> Creatophora cinerea on Pied Babblers Turdoides bicolor. We find that the incubation success of Pied Babblers decreases significantly following the arrival of <b>Wattled</b> <b>Starlings</b> at the study site, and we provide video evidence of <b>Wattled</b> <b>Starlings</b> destroying Pied Babbler eggs. This behaviour is costly to Pied Babblers, whose current reproductive attempt is abandoned, with subsequent reproductive attempts delayed by several weeks. We {{found no evidence that}} egg destruction occurred for nutritional benefit: <b>Wattled</b> <b>Starlings</b> never consumed the eggs they destroyed. Rather, this behaviour appears to represent a form of resource competition, since <b>Wattled</b> <b>Starlings</b> only predate babbler nests in habitats where the starlings also build their nests. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Kori {{bustards}} {{are prominent}} while chestnut-backed sparrow-larks and <b>wattled</b> <b>starlings</b> are nomadic, {{but may be}} abundant. Temminck's coursers and ground hornbills may also be seen in this habitat, as will a number of swallows.|$|R
50|$|Like other {{starling}}s, Fischer's starling is an omnivore, {{and sometimes}} takes fruit and berries, but its diet is mainly insects, {{taken from the}} ground. It normally forages alone or in pairs, but will form mixed flocks with <b>wattled</b> <b>starlings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> (Creatophora cinerea) is a nomadic {{resident}} in {{eastern and southern}} Africa. It is a species of grassland, open woodland and cultivation.|$|E

5000|$|Like other starlings, the <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> is an omnivore, {{taking a}} wide range of {{invertebrates}} seeds and berries, but its diet is mainly insects including many locusts, leading to the local name [...] "locust bird".|$|E
50|$|The pied {{starling}} is gregarious {{and when}} not breeding will form large flocks, sometimes numbering more than 1000 birds. Its roosts may {{be shared by}} lesser kestrels or <b>wattled</b> <b>starlings.</b> It will feed with European starlings, but they rarely roost together.|$|R
500|$|Also dewlap; lappet; palearia. Specialized type: rictal wattle. A type of , the wattle is a flap or lobe of flesh, {{often of}} a vivid colour, that {{hangs from the}} head of some birds, often from the chin or throat. When found {{at the corner of the}} mouth, they may be called rictal wattles, such as in masked lapwings. Birds with wattles include turkeys and guineafowls, and many others, such as {{northern}} cassowaries, black-faced ibises, North Island kōkakos, <b>wattled</b> <b>starlings</b> (males, when in [...] ) and male bearded bellbirds, with the last having startling, beard-like wattles.|$|R
50|$|Mynas are not {{a natural}} group; instead, the term myna is used for any {{starling}} in the Indian subcontinent, regardless of their relationships. This range was colonized twice during the evolution of starlings, first by rather ancestral starlings related to the coleto and Aplonis lineages, and millions of years later by birds related to the common <b>starling</b> and <b>wattled</b> <b>starling's</b> ancestors. These two groups of mynas can be distinguished in the more terrestrial adaptions of the latter, which usually also have less glossy plumage except on the heads and longer tails. The Bali myna which is nearly extinct in the wild is highly distinctive.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other two}} would better {{be dealt with}} by resurrecting Agropsar, either as {{distinct}} genus or as subgenus of Gracupica which otherwise includes the black-collared starling ("Sturnus" [...] nigricollis) and pied myna ("Sturnus" [...] contra); these four form a robust and ancient group of two sister species that is perhaps even closer to the <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> (Creatophpora cinerea) than to the actual Sturnus. Their similarity to Sturnia proper is probably simply a symplesiomorphy.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> is 21 cm long, {{with a short}} {{tail and}} pointed wings. It has mainly grey plumage except for a white rump, and black flight {{feathers}} and tail. The breeding male has a white shoulder patch and a distinctive head pattern, with unfeathered yellow skin, and black forehead and throat wattles. The {{extent to which these}} seasonal features develop increases with the age of the bird, and some old females may show a weaker version of this plumage.|$|E
50|$|The Cape {{starling}} is a {{gregarious bird}} and forms large flocks in the non-breeding season. It usually feeds {{on the ground}} often foraging alongside other species of starlings such as the pied starling, the common starling, the greater blue-eared starling, the lesser blue-eared starling, the <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> and Burchell's starling. It is habituated to humans and its diet includes fruit, insects and nectar. It sometimes feeds on ectoparasites that it picks off the backs of animals and it sometimes visits bird tables for scraps.|$|E
50|$|Three {{species of}} bat {{are the only}} native mammals: two large fruit bats (Samoa flying fox and white-naped flying fox) and a small insectivore, the Pacific sheath-tailed bat. They serve an {{important}} role in pollinating the island's plants. The sheath-tailed bat was nearly eliminated by Cyclone Val in 1991. Native reptiles include the pelagic gecko, Polynesian gecko, mourning gecko, stump-toed gecko, Pacific boa and seven skink species.A major role for the park is to control and eradicate invasive plant and animal species such as feral pigs, which threaten the park's ecosystem. There are several bird species, the most predominant being the <b>wattled</b> honeyeater, Samoan <b>starling,</b> and Pacific pigeon. Other unusual birds include the Tahiti petrel, the spotless crake, and the rare (in this locality) many-coloured fruit dove.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> is {{a colonial}} breeder, and may share its colonies with the Cape weaver. It always nests in trees or bushes, {{including}} acacias and eucalyptus at between 1 and 10 m above the ground. The globular nest {{is made from}} twigs and lined with grass or feathers. The two to five, usually three or four, eggs are pale blue, immaculate or with some brown spots, and are laid before {{the dome of the}} nest is completed. Both sexes build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the young.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Four {{new species}} of feather mites {{belonging}} to three different genera of the family Pteronyssidae are described from passerine birds of South Africa: Pteroherpus africanus sp. n. from the garden bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus (Desfontaines) (Pycnonotidae), Pteroherpus cysticolae sp. n. from the wing-snapped cisticola Cisticola ayresii Hartlaub (Sylviidae), Pteronyssoides promeropis sp. n. from the Gurney’s sugarbird Promerops gurneyi Verreaux (Promeropidae), and Sturnotrogus creatophorae sp. n. from the <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> Creatophora cinerea Menschen (Sturnidae). A brief review of recent publications on the taxonomy of the family Pteronyssidae is given. The present paper continues the series of our publications dedicated to feather mites associated with South African passerines (Mironov and Kopij 1966 a, b, 1997, 2000) and includes descriptions of four new feather mite species of the family Pteronyssidae Oudemans, 1941. The family Pteronyssidae currently includes 18 genera and about 130 described species. The representatives of this family are mostly associated with different bird families of Piciformes and Passeri-formes and only one genus, Cleyastobius Gaud, 1981, occurs on the wooden hoopoes Phoeniculidae (Coracii-formes). A detailed generic revision of the family Pteronyssidae (considered in a status of subfamily) {{was carried out by}} Faccini and Atyeo (1981).

40|$|A new Isospora (Apicomplexa: Eimeriidae) {{species is}} {{described}} {{from a single}} red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis) (subspecies N. temporalis temporalis), {{that was part of}} a captive population in Western Australia. Sporulated oocysts of this isolate are spherical, 18. 3 (18. 2 - 18. 9) × 18. 2 (18. 2 - 18. 6) μm, with a shape index (length/width) of 1. 0; and a smooth and bilayered oocyst wall, 1. 2 μm thick (outer layer 0. 9 μm, inner 0. 3 μm). A polar granule is present, but the oocyst residuum and a micropyle are absent. The sporocysts are ovoid-shaped, 13. 3 (9. 5 - 16. 4) × 8. 6 (6. 8 - 10. 0) μm, with a shape index of 1. 5. An indistinct Stieda body is present, but the substieda body is absent. A sporocyst residuum is present and composed of numerous granules of different size scattered among the sporozoites. Morphologically, the oocysts from this isolate are different from those of all known valid Isospora spp. Molecular analysis was conducted at 4 loci; the 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (COI) gene and the heat shock protein 70 (hsp 70) gene. At the 18 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 9 %, 99. 8 %, 99. 7 %, and 99. 5 % similarity to I. sp. MAH- 2013 a from a superb starling (Lamprotornis superbus), I. MS- 2003 from a Southern cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), I. sp. Tokyo from a domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica) and I. MS- 2003 from a Surinam crested oropendula (Psarocolius decumanus). At the 28 S locus, this new isolate exhibited 99. 7 % similarity to both an Isospora sp (MS- 2003) from a Northern house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and an Isospora sp. (MS- 2003) from a Southern cape sparrow. At the COI locus, this new isolate exhibited 98. 9 % similarity to an Isospora sp. ex Apodemus flavicollis. At the hsp 70 locus, this new isolate exhibited 99 % similarity to isolate MS- 2003 (. AY 283879) from a <b>wattled</b> <b>starling</b> (Creatophora cinerea). Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of Isospora, which is named Isospora neochmiae n. sp. after its host, the red-browed finch (Neochmia temporalis) ...|$|E
