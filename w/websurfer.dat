Random <b>Websurfer</b> clicks on a button that {{promises}} dancing pigs {{on his computer}} monitor, and instead gets a hortatory message describing the potential dangers of the applet — he's going to choose dancing pigs over computer security any day. If the computer prompts him with a warning screen like: [...] "The applet DANCING PIGS could contain malicious code that might do permanent damage to your computer, steal your life's savings, and impair your ability to have children," [...] he'll click OK without even reading it. Thirty seconds later he won't even remember that the warning screen even existed.|$|E
50|$|Although through 2010 {{less than}} 23 percent of Nepal's {{population}} used the Internet, {{use of the}} Internet in Nepal is growing rapidly. This {{is the result of}} a competitive Internet service provider (ISP) market. Thirty-one private ISPs offer Internet access to businesses and consumers, through few, Worldlink, Subisu, <b>Websurfer</b> and Mercantile, dominate the market with a combined share of more than 70 percent. Cyber cafés are important sources of Internet access for Nepalis; the country is believed to have the highest concentration of cybercafés in the world. Much of Nepal's Internet access is concentrated in the more-developed Kathmandu Valley region, as the mountainous terrain and low income in remote regions of the country make access more difficult. However, one effort to bring Internet access to rural populations—the Nepal Wireless Networking Project—has already wirelessly connected seven remote mountain villages to the Internet, with plans to network twenty-one villages in all. With recent availability of the state-owned Nepal Telecom's nationwide WiMAX based WiFi hotspot services, the reach of Internet has widen with marginal success.|$|E

5000|$|Partido da Imprensa Golpista (PiG, Pro-coup Press Party) is a {{term used}} by left-wing Brazilian <b>websurfers</b> since 2007 to {{characterize}} an alleged attitude of the Brazilian mass media towards President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva during the 2006 presidential election. The term was popularized by journalist Paulo Henrique Amorim in his blog. Whenever he uses the term, Amorim writes it with an [...] "i" [...] in lowercase as a pun {{with the name of}} the web portal [...] where he was a journalist before he was dismissed on March 18, 2008, which he describes as a process of [...] "ideological cleansing".|$|R
5000|$|Some game {{reviewer}}s {{take issue}} with the way Metacritic assigns scores. When a reviewer gives a rating of [...] "A", Metacritic assigns it a value of 100, and for [...] "F" [...] a value of zero; some think a score of 50 would be more appropriate. For a [...] "B", Metacritic assigns a value of 67, yet some publishers, developers, and <b>websurfers</b> believe it should be closer to 80, according to a conventional linear scale. Joe Dodson, former editor at Game Revolution, criticized Metacritic and similar sites, for turning reviews into scores that are too low. However, Doyle responded: [...] "I feel that ANY scale simply needs to be converted directly with its lowest possible grade equating to 0, and the highest to 100." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} 4 FM stations from Kathmandu {{have their}} relay broadcast stations in Pokhara, making {{a total of}} 22 FM stations. Among them there are six Community radio Stations, They are Himchuli FM - 92.2 MHz, Gorkhali Radio -106 MHz, Samudayik, Radio Sunaulo F.M - 107.2 MHz and Radio Gandaki 90.2 MHZ, Radio Hemja 88.5 MHz. There are four local television stations: GoldenEye Television, Pokhara Television, Gandaki Television and fewa television. Approximately 14 national daily newspapers, in Nepali are published in the city along with several other weekly and monthly news magazines. All major national newspapers published in Kathmandu have distributions in Pokhara. A number of online news portals are also updated from Pokhara. Recentfusion.com, Safalnews.com, Citypokhara.com, Mainkhabar.com, Ganthan.com, Peacepokhara.com, Barahinews.com, Pokharanews.com are some of them. Some entertainment-based websites are also based in Pokhara. Popular technology based web-magazine TechSansar also started from Pokhara city. Pokhara has got 4G network of Nepal Telecom and 3G network of Ncell. Majority {{of the people in}} the city access internet through mobiles, numerous cyber cafes and local wireless ISPs. Most tourist restaurants and hotels also provide WiFi services. Wi-Fi hotspot by Nepal Telecom using Wi-MAX technology, started in Feb. 2014, is accessible in most parts of the city for a fee. Subscriber based internet is provided by several private ISP providers in Pokhara namely Worldlink, Pokhara Internet, Subisu, <b>Websurfer,</b> Radius Communication.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{distributed}} mechanism for finding websurfing strategies that {{is inspired by}} the StumbleUpon recommendation engine. Each day, a <b>websurfer</b> visits a sequence of websites recommended by our mechanism, and selects one that matches her daily interests. We formally show that even with this minimal feedback from the surfer—the selected website— our mechanism finds a websurfing strategy that matches the surfer’s interests optimally. The surfer {{does not need to}} know—or declare—what her daily interests are before she is presented with content she likes. Moreover, our mechanism is content-agnostic: it is oblivious {{to the nature of the}} content the surfer selects. In addition, we study how the performance of this mechanism can be improved if surfers with similar interests share their feedback. Such surfers can be found indirectly, e. g., if they are all registered as friends in a social networking application. Our analysis characterizes the improvement in the mechanism’s accuracy, based on the size of the group and the degree of similarity between the surfers ’ interests. In particular, we show that sharing feedback can significantly accelerate the convergence of our mechanism. Our results are derived analytically using stochastic approximation techniques, but are also validated through a numerical study. I...|$|E
50|$|In 2004 {{the third}} album saw the daylight. The Exploder {{is a lot}} more {{experimental}} than the other albums by Mannhai. The third album has influences significantly from progressive metal and from the seventies heavy metal, but even from blues with Maria Hänninen singing the backing vocals on some of the tracks, and Esa Kuloniemi from Honey B and the T-bones playing slide guitar on some others. The record being something else than its predecessors it is also more complicated and scattered, including only few straightforward rock and roll songs. The progressive sound {{has a lot to do}} with keyboards, played by Kasper Mårtenson (ex-Amoprhis). When The Exploder came out Mannhai made a practical joke: The web address www.mattivanhanen.com directed <b>websurfers</b> not to the web pages of then Prime Minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen but to the website of Mannhai.|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] An experiment (N= 40) was conducted on the effects of two Internet motives - prepurchase search vs. Web-surfing on responses to banner ads. Pre-purchase searchers paid more attention to and had greater memory for online ads than Web-surfers. An interaction was found between user motive and ad-motive relevance. For ads that matched the purchase goal, pre-purchase searchers had more favorable attitude, greater intent to click on the ad, and perceived the ad of more usefulness than Web-surfers did. For ads that were not relevant to the purchase motivation, pre-purchase searchers had less favorable attitude, less intent to click on the ad, and perceived the ad of less usefulness than <b>Websurfers</b> did...|$|R
40|$|Trust is {{a concept}} used in {{everyday}} life, both in off-line interactions and increas-ingly often in on-line interactions. On-line trust appears in e-commerce, as most transactions leave a party vulnerable at some point (the buyer {{when there is an}} advance payment, and the seller if there is no advance payment). On-line trust appears in the cloud, as clients need to trust providers not to destroy, lose or snoop into the data. In public key infrastructures, <b>websurfers</b> need to trust certifiers to be honest and not to be compromised, especially since even a (Dutch) governmental certifier “DigiNotar ” {{turned out not to be}} trustworthy. Furthermore, on-line trust appears when users provide private information to third parties, who may or may not be trusted to respect the privacy of their users. In computer security, the goal is typically to remove the necessity of trust in on-line communication. Often, cryptographic commitments, signatures or encryptions can be used to guarantee a satisfactory outcome of an interaction. In some cases, however, there are no known techniques to remove the need for trust altogether, and sometimes the need for trust is shifted from one party to another party;...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a general}} class of PageRank {{optimization}} problems which consist in finding an optimal outlink strategy for {{a web site}} subject to design constraints. We consider both a continuous problem, in which one can choose the intensity of a link, and a discrete one, in which in each page, there are obligatory links, facultative links and forbidden links. We show that the continuous problem, {{as well as its}} discrete variant when there are no constraints coupling different pages, can both be modeled by constrained Markov decision processes with ergodic reward, in which the webmaster determines the transition probabilities of <b>websurfers.</b> Although the number of actions turns out to be exponential, we show that an associated polytope of transition measures has a concise representation, from which we deduce that the continuous problem is solvable in polynomial time, and that {{the same is true for}} the discrete problem when there are no coupling constraints. We also provide efficient algorithms, adapted to very large networks. Then, we investigate the qualitative features of optimal outlink strategies, and identify in particular assumptions under which there exists a "master" page to which all controlled pages should point. We report numerical results on fragments of the real web graph. Comment: 39 page...|$|R
