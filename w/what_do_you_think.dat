500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and {{it is impossible to}} deliver national music on request." ...|$|E
500|$|Other critics found {{religious}} {{parallels between}} E.T. and Jesus. Andrew Nigels described E.T.'s story as [...] "crucifixion by military science" [...] and [...] "resurrection by love and faith". According to Spielberg biographer Joseph McBride, Universal Pictures appealed {{directly to the}} Christian market, with a poster reminiscent of Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam and a logo reading [...] "Peace". Spielberg answered {{that he did not}} intend the film to be a religious parable, joking, [...] "If I ever went to my mother and said, 'Mom, I've made this movie that's a Christian parable,' <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> she'd say? She has a Kosher restaurant on Pico and Doheny in Los Angeles." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> Is this what you were looking for? He was so open".|$|E
500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E

500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I {{got a call from}} John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Prokofiev and {{his family}} settled {{permanently}} in Moscow, after shifting {{back and forth between}} Moscow and Paris for the previous four years. That year he composed one of his most famous works, Peter and the Wolf, for Natalya Sats's Central Children's Theatre. Sats also persuaded Prokofiev to write two songs for children, [...] "Sweet Song", and [...] "Chatterbox"; they were eventually joined by [...] "The Little Pigs" [...] and published as Three Children's Songs, Op. 68. Prokofiev also composed the gigantic Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution, originally intended for performance during the anniversary year but effectively blocked by Kerzhentsev, who demanded at the work's audition before the Committee on Arts Affairs, [...] "Just <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you're doing, Sergey Sergeyevich, taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to such incomprehensible music?" [...] The Cantata had to wait until 5 April 1966 for a partial premiere, just over 13 years after the composer's death.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{oral history}} interview, Singh {{said that one}} of the murder trials that he had presided over, the [...] "Body in the Box" [...] case, led to the {{abolition}} of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases. Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed into a box, Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that in the jury room a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell {{was the only way to}} get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E
500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What do you think about all of this? What's going on? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of that, old girl?" [...] asked Peter Pax of Tottie, on issuing {{from the}} Literary Message-Boys' Hall, after having {{performed}} his duties there.|$|R
500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> would happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E
