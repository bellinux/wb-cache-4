5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} the mechanics. In 1969 the hammer tips <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model was added to the range.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, {{the borders}} of Clwyd <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to cover the {{remainder}} of Conwy (which had previously been part of Gwynedd), {{which was part of}} a Wales-wide re-organisation of the preserved counties, so that boundaries of the preserved counties would contain whole current principal areas only.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} how many {{geographical}} names <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> under the ordinance.

30|$|How, then, {{can such}} a good and {{basically}} functional organization <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> into an excellent one which is prepared {{to take on the}} challenges of the sixth Kondratieff wave? Perhaps we should consider first how it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> It cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by telling people that they must change their behaviour. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> with training or guidance or by altering structures or organizational models. Nor can it <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by avoiding conflict or by forcing the organization to innovate. And, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> by launching a grandiose (and expensive) programme for changing organizational culture.|$|R

5|$|Most of {{the tracks}} in Wipeout 64 feature {{mirrored}} layouts of circuits from select tracks in Wipeout and Wipeout 2097, set in different locations.

The original R 1 in the top-left position <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> to an interpolated R_ 1, while the interpolated R_ 4 [...] in the bottom-right position <b>is</b> <b>changed</b> to the original R 4. The other color channels follow a similar pattern. The changed characteristics of color samples are important clues for detecting altered images.|$|R

5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: because so much time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects <b>were</b> <b>changed,</b> and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements <b>were</b> <b>changed,</b> the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France and from there to the Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and family names <b>were</b> <b>changed,</b> and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins <b>were</b> <b>changed</b> in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
