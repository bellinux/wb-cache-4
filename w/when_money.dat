5|$|In early March 1947, Formidable steamed {{north to}} Rosyth {{for a brief}} refit before being reduced to reserve. She was paid off on 12 August and a later survey {{revealed}} that her wartime damage and poor material shape meant the ship was beyond economical repair at a time <b>when</b> <b>money</b> was very tight. She was towed to Spithead in mid-1949 and then to Portsmouth Royal Dockyard in November 1952. Formidable was sold for scrap in January 1953 and towed to Inverkeithing where she was broken up.|$|E
5|$|A {{decreased}} budget led to Nokomis {{losing its}} Saturday operating hours in 2004. The Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, Thrivent Financial for Lutherans, {{and members of}} the community subsequently put funds towards keeping the library open on Saturdays until in mid-2005 <b>when</b> <b>money</b> was reallocated in the budget for continued Saturday operation. Further budget woes continued to plague the Minneapolis Public Libraries as of early 2007, by which point the system had had to temporarily close three different branches in part due to a loss of local government aid. A merger with the Hennepin County Libraries was approved by both systems' boards along with the Minneapolis City Council and Nokomis reopened at 10 am on January 2, 2008, as a Hennepin County Library. It remained the only building in the newly expanded 41-library system to be named for a fictional character.|$|E
5|$|At the Norman conquest, most English cathedrals {{were already}} richly endowed, and as major centres of Norman power {{they were then}} able to acquire further lands {{formerly}} held by dispossessed English landowners. Furthermore, the development of tithe as a compulsory tax on agricultural production resulted in greatly increased incomes for incumbent clergy. Although all cathedrals gathered donations from worshippers and pilgrims; in practice major building campaigns were largely, or entirely, funded from the accumulated wealth of the bishop and the chapter clergy. The availability of finance largely determined the speed of construction for major projects. <b>When</b> <b>money</b> was readily available, cathedral works could proceed with great speed. At Winchester, during the Norman period, an entire cathedral of unprecedented size was built from scratch in less than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Both the High Court and the Charities Commission are {{authorised}} {{to establish}} schemes administering charities. These can come about <b>when</b> <b>money</b> {{has been left}} for a charitable purpose which is not specified, or with no suggestion as to {{how it should be}} administered. The scheme may be used to appoint new trustees, except when the trustee's identity is crucial to the intentions of the testator, as in Re Lysaght. Schemes may also be used to fix administrative difficulties caused by uncertainty, as in Re Gott, or even to completely defeat the gift. Schemes can also be used, on the application of trustees, to extend powers of investment or consolidate funds. The trustees may apply to change the core purpose of the trust, which while enacted through a scheme, follows the doctrine of Cy-près.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension <b>when</b> <b>money</b> would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E

The unique equilibrium achieves the first-best outcome and eliminates bank runs without having resort to any government intervention. private money, fiat money, bank runs...|$|R
