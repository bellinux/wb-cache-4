5|$|The Churchill Machine Tool Co was {{put into}} members' {{voluntary}} liquidation on 25 October 1973 with several other companies in the Herbert group. The company's name resurfaced only {{to be put into}} voluntary liquidation again on 15 March 1985. The <b>winding-up</b> resolutions on both these occasions occurred at meetings held at Canal Road, Coventry, although the appointed people were different.|$|E
5|$|Aron {{was sentenced}} to 2 years in prison by the District Court of Reykjavík for {{committing}} fraud in real estate dealings. Aron was made to pay a total of 160–162 million ISK with interest to Arion Bank, Glitnir's <b>winding-up</b> board and Íslandsbanki {{in addition to all}} legal costs. The 96–97 million ISK profit of the fraud held by Aron's real estate company, AK fasteignafélag, was confiscated. The Supreme Court of Iceland increased his sentence to 2 {{and a half years in}} prison.|$|E
5|$|Going into 2015, the Football League {{made public}} their {{concerns}} over Yeung's attempts to impose {{his choice of}} directors on the BIHL board despite his conviction disqualifying him from exerting influence over a club. Relationships became increasingly factional, {{as illustrated by the}} failure of three directors, including the club's de facto chief executive Panos Pavlakis, to gain re-election, followed the next day by their reinstatement. On 17 February, the board voluntarily appointed receivers from accountants Ernst & Young to take over management of the company. Their statement stressed that no <b>winding-up</b> petition had been issued and the company was not in liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{was formed}} as Newton Heath L F.C. in 1878 by {{the workers in}} the Carriage and Wagon Works of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Newton Heath depot. In 1901, the club was in over £2,500 of debt and facing a <b>winding-up</b> order; however, they were saved by local brewer John Henry Davies, who changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After Davies' death in 1927, the club fell into {{financial}} difficulties once again, but James W. Gibson stepped in as a new financial benefactor in 1931. Gibson himself died in 1951, but while ownership of the club passed to his widow, Violet, control of the club passed to director and former player Harold Hardman.|$|E
5|$|The long {{investigation}} {{time span}} was causing {{problems for the}} prosecutors as {{an increasing number of}} the counts were meeting their statutes of limitations. The police announced in September 1973 that they were working on indictments towards Tjøntveit and two of the creditors who placed their representatives on the board after the company was insolvent. The police investigation was concluded in May 1975. By then, the statutes of limitations for the accounting issues had passed, and the police focused on the more serious charge of debt manipulation. Tjøntveit and two board members were indicted in 1976. The managing committee for the <b>winding-up</b> released its report in November 1977; the report concluded that although the company's books showed assets of NOK8.6 million, in reality it only had fifty Norwegian krone. The committee further criticized the company for having too low a share capital, lack of qualified management and insufficient competence in operation and management of large aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Penfold {{returned}} to the FCO in 1987, where he was appointed to {{a position in the}} West Indian and Atlantic Department, which was responsible for the Caribbean and South Atlantic. The department was divided between British Dependent Territories (for which Penfold was responsible) and independent nations. In the years before and during Penfold's tenure, the British dependencies had been the subject of several diplomatic incidents and were causing problems for the British government, to whom the international community looked to resolve problems with its dependent territories. The FCO had struggled to find new governors for the territories since the <b>winding-up</b> of the Colonial Service—which had historically provided most governors and many civil servants—in the 1960s. Thus, Penfold recommended in a policy paper that the Diplomatic Service be considered as a recruiting pool, and that governors be recruited earlier in their career rather than at the end. He also identified several posts which could be used for training potential governors, including the one he occupied and deputy governor posts such as that in Bermuda.|$|E
25|$|Having {{wound-up}} the company's affairs, the liquidator {{must call}} a final {{meeting of the}} members (if it is a members' voluntary <b>winding-up),</b> creditors (if it is a compulsory <b>winding-up)</b> or both (if it is a creditors' voluntary <b>winding-up).</b> The liquidator is then usually required to send final accounts to the Registrar and to notify the court. The company is then dissolved.|$|E

25|$|If {{the company}} is solvent, and the members have made a {{statutory}} declaration of solvency, the liquidation will proceed as a members' voluntary <b>winding-up.</b> In that case the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors' voluntary <b>winding-up,</b> and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company's affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors' voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed.|$|E
25|$|On 7 November 2012, Hearts {{were issued}} with a <b>winding-up</b> order by the Court of Session in Edinburgh {{after failing to}} pay a tax bill on time.|$|E

25|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that the club had failed to pay the players for the second consecutive month, and on the 31st it {{was announced}} player's wages would again be paid late, on 5 January 2010. According to common football contracts, the players then had the right to terminate their contracts and leave the club without any compensation for the club, upon giving two weeks' notice. Despite the financial difficulties, Grant's time as manager was initially successful. He gained two wins (against Burnley and Liverpool) and a draw away at Sunderland from his first five games. The only losses inflicted on Portsmouth in this period were by eventual double winners Chelsea and the previous season's champions, Manchester United. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) filed a <b>winding-up</b> petition against Portsmouth at the High Court of Justice in London on 23 December 2009. In March 2010, this <b>winding-up</b> petition was dropped, leaving Portsmouth with a nine-point penalty for entering administration.|$|E
25|$|Hereford were {{expelled}} from the Conference on 10 June 2014 due to financial irregularities. It was revealed a week later that the club's debts could total as much as £1.3million. The club was accepted into the Southern League Premier Division for the 2014–15 season on 19 June 2014. However, financial worries continued, including a <b>winding-up</b> petition started by Martin Foyle, who resigned as manager in March 2014. Hearings of the <b>winding-up</b> petition were adjourned a number of times, including on 7 July 2014. A number of other creditors attached themselves to the Foyle petition, including Andy Porter, former assistant manager, and HMRC. A CVA was proposed {{by the board of}} directors of the company, but was rejected by creditors. Many Hereford fans chose to boycott the club due to clashes between fans and the board. Many fans felt anger over the board's choice not to pay a bond to remain in the Conference Premier and other management choices that the fans felt were not in the club's best interests.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, {{the company}} may elect to simply be struck off the Register as a cheaper {{alternative}} to a formal <b>winding-up</b> and dissolution. In such cases an application is made to the Registrar, who may strike off the company if there is reasonable cause {{to believe that the}} company is not carrying on business or has been wound-up and, after enquiry, no case is shown why the company should not be struck off.|$|E
25|$|On 24September2009, {{the club}} was officially wound up at the High Court in London, with debts of around £120,000 to HM Revenue and Customs. Over the {{following}} few days, major efforts by club officials, supporters and players, which included a bucket collection at a Manchester City Premier League match, raised sufficient funds {{to lodge an appeal}} against the High Court decision. This was heard on 30September2009, and the original <b>winding-up</b> order was rescinded.|$|E
25|$|In late 1944, the Air Ministry {{announced}} the <b>winding-up</b> of the plan, since the Commonwealth air forces had {{long had a}} surplus of air crews.

25|$|In United Kingdom and United States law and business, {{liquidation}} is {{the process}} by which a company (or part of a company) is brought to an end, and the assets and property of the company are redistributed. Liquidation is also sometimes referred to as <b>winding-up</b> or dissolution, although dissolution technically refers to the last stage of liquidation. The process of liquidation also arises when customs, an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting and safeguarding customs duties, determines the final computation or ascertainment of the duties or drawback accruing on an entry.|$|E
25|$|The poor {{performance}} lost {{the confidence of}} investors, leading to the <b>winding-up</b> of the Saloon Ship Company in 1876. The ship remained in dock at Dover until being sold for scrap in 1879. When the ship was broken up, its designer Reed had the Saloon cabin moved to his home, Hextable House, Swanley, where it {{was used as a}} billiard room. When the house later became a women's college, Swanley Agricultural College, the Saloon was used as a lecture hall, but was destroyed by a direct hit when the college was bombed in World War II.|$|E

A petition for the <b>winding-up</b> of the Globe New Patent Iron and Steel Co, Ltd. in 1875 shows that by that date the partnership comprised John Galloway snr, John Galloway Jnr, Charles John Galloway and Edward Napier Galloway. Edward was another son of John senior, who married a Miss Lewis in 1827 and they had four sons and a daughter.|$|E
25|$|It has {{subsequently}} {{become known}} that the best book of Northern Rock's mortgage business, comprising mortgages worth £47 billion – some 40% of the company's assets – had been transferred to a Channel Islands based company called Granite, together with an ongoing obligation to continue to supply business. Failure to maintain the arrangement could cost a reported £5 billion. As is common practice in bank securitisations, Granite was set up as a charitable trust with any residue on <b>winding-up</b> to benefit a small charity, Down's Syndrome North East. Despite having assets worth an estimated £45 billion, Granite has never made a donation to the charity, because it remains in business.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} {{for individuals to}} be discharged from debt in bankruptcy proceedings and the awfulness of debtors prison made the introduction of modern companies legislation, and general availability of limited liability, all the more urgent. The first step was the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, which allowed companies to be created through registration rather than a Royal Charter. It was accompanied by the Joint Stock Companies <b>Winding-Up</b> Act 1844, which envisaged a separate procedure to bring a company {{to an end and}} liquidate the assets. Companies had legal personality separate from its incorporators, but only with the Limited Liability Act 1855 would a company's investors be generally protected from extra debts upon a company's insolvency. The 1855 Act limited investors' liability to the amount they had invested, so if someone bought shares in a company that ran up massive debts in insolvency, the shareholder could not be asked for more than he had already paid in. Thus, the risk of debtors' prison was reduced. Soon after, reforms were made for all indebted people. The Bankruptcy Act 1861 was passed allowing all people, not just traders, to file for bankruptcy. The Debtors Act 1869 finally abolished imprisonment for debt altogether. So the legislative scheme of this period came to roughly resemble the modern law. While the general principle remained pari passu among the insolvent company's creditors, the claims of liquidators expenses and wages of workers were given statutory priority over other unsecured creditors. However, any creditor who had contracted for a security interest would be first in the priority queue. Completion of insolvency protection followed UK company law's leading case, Salomon v A Salomon & Co Ltd. Here a Whitechapel bootmaker had incorporated his business, but because of economic struggles, he had been forced into insolvency. The Companies Act 1862 required a minimum of seven shareholders, so he had registered his wife and children as nominal shareholders, even though they played little or no part in the business. The liquidator of Mr Salomon's company sued him to personally pay the outstanding debts of his company, arguing that he should lose the protection of limited liability given that the other shareholders were not genuine investors. Salomon's creditors were particularly aggrieved because Salomon himself had taken a floating charge, over all the company's present and future assets, and so his claims for debt against the company had ranked in priority to theirs. The House of Lords held that, even though the company was a one-man venture in substance, anybody who duly registered would have the protection of the Companies Acts in the event of insolvency. Salomon's case effectively completed the process 19th century reforms because any person, even the smallest business, could have protection from destitution following business insolvency.|$|E

Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the debenture holders petitioned for the company's compulsory <b>winding-up.</b> In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping.

Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, the team finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title.
