25|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} For Your Eyes Only (1981), the twelfth spy {{film in the}} James Bond series, {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow photographed from behind in a bikini bottom with half of her buttocks exposed. Morgan Kane, the photographer, achieved the skimpy look bay making model <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> bikini bottom backwards. The poster caused some furor—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times edited out everything above the knee, while the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to identity of the model with three models claimed the thighs in question – Nancy Stafford, Jane Sumner and Joyce Bartle – before photographer Morgan Kane identified the model to be Bartle, though the arm holding a crossbow belongs to Sumner.|$|E
500|$|Brian Hyland's novelty-song hit [...] "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" [...] {{became a}} Billboard No. 1 hit {{during the summer}} of 1960: the song tells a story about a young girl who is too shy to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> new bikini on the beach, {{thinking}} it too risqué.

Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that [...] "it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [...] it's not going to look like Rapunzel.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Marcos strategists took {{advantage}} of [...] Imelda's exceptional charm and youth by incorporating these and her other striking qualities into the presidential candidate's overall tone for the Marcos-led Nacionalista campaign. They {{were able to use}} her by attracting normal folk from their daily activities to attend a Marcos rally to see the [...] "beautiful wife of Marcos" [...] themselves. The mere mention of Imelda attending a rally would make people attend the rally and scamper for a place near the stage, not to listen to the speeches, but rather just to see the lovely wife of Ferdinand Marcos. She was asked by the Marcos aides to always appear in public at all times at her best regardless of the [...] type of audience. An integral part of their strategy was for Imelda to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> standard ternos as part of the campaign design.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> clothes, we would talk on the phone until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup. (laughs) You like [...] friends when you're a grownup, but you don't need to sleep in the same bed with them and talk to them on the phone until 5 a.m. every night.|$|E
500|$|The 1917 Medal of Honor Board deleted 911 awards, {{but only}} 910 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll, {{including}} awards to Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, William F.

None of the 910 [...] "deleted" [...] recipients were ordered to return their medals, although {{on the question of whether}} the recipients could continue to wear their medals, the Judge Advocate General advised the Medal of Honor Board the Army was not obligated to police the matter. Walker continued to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> medal until her death. President Jimmy Carter formally restored her medal posthumously in 1977.

500|$|The Saudi Arabian Olympic Committee {{chose not}} to promote Shahrkhani's participation. They also {{required}} that she [...] "dress modestly, {{be accompanied by a}} male guardian and not mix with men" [...] while in London for the 2012 Games. [...] Additionally, her competition clothing had to comply with Sharia law. On 30 July 2012, Shahrkhani said that she would withdraw from the event if she was not permitted to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> hijab during bouts. Her father (who often speaks for her, partially because she does not know English) clarified that he wanted his daughter to compete, and that they wanted to make [...] "new history for Saudi's women", but that she would not participate without a hijab. The next day the IOC and the International Judo Federation announced that agreement had been reached on a hijab that she could wear. The design agreed upon was a tight-fitting, cap-style covering, rather than the more common headscarf which drapes around the neck and under the chin. Despite this, she was still labeled a prostitute by religious clerics inside in the country.|$|E
500|$|Ross, {{hoping for}} a reunion with Marcel, looks {{for him on the}} movie set. [...] Joey meanwhile, sucks up to the {{production}} assistant to land a part in the movie. While on set, Chandler meets his old childhood friend Susie [...] "Underpants" [...] Moss (Julia Roberts) working on the production, with whom he has a colored history; when they were in elementary school, Chandler pulled up Susie's skirt when she was on stage, revealing her underwear to the entire school. They arrange a date, Chandler unsuspecting that it is a plot to get revenge. [...] After convincing him to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> panties, Susie leaves him wearing nothing but the panties in a bathroom stall in the restaurant where they were having dinner. Meanwhile, Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel meet the movie's star Jean-Claude Van Damme, and compete for his attention. This creates tension between them, as they both argue over who should get to date him. [...] They both dump him when he tries to convince them to have a threesome with Drew Barrymore. Ross finally reunites with Marcel and Joey lands a small role in the movie, but loses his solitary line after overacting.|$|E
500|$|Mileena {{appeared}} in the 1999 episode [...] "Shadow of a Doubt" [...] of the television series , {{in which she had}} no direct relation to Kitana and was here depicted as an initially very repulsive and aggressive Outworld warrior sent by Shao Kahn to assassinate the weakened Kung Lao, with a magic spell placed over her to give her Kitana's look (for a while, he even called her his [...] "new daughter"). Mileena, wearing a green costume, succeeded in seducing Kung Lao, but could not bring herself to kill him during their night of passion and was also explicitly warned by Shang Tsung to not do it. She makes excuses for Kahn and later fights an inconclusive duel against Kitana, broken by Shao Kahn. As punishment for her taking too much time in her mission, Kahn allows Mileena to keep her beauty with the exception of making her teeth exaggeratedly pointed. She then starts to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> signature mask, which Kahn gives her before banishing her from his sight. In Konquest, Mileena was portrayed by Meg Brown and Audie England played Mileena pretending to be Kitana. Brown said she liked her sexy Mileena costume so much that she asked to be let [...] "wear the outfit home for her boyfriend." ...|$|E

She finds it difficult to handle Michael's criticism and Kevin's sexual advances, and spends {{the rest of the}} day without her glasses, reducing her productivity. [...] Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) comes to Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, and after a talk with Toby, Ryan tells Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that he is giving him an official warning about his job performance. Ryan denies that his action is motivated by Jim's previous complaints to David Wallace, saying he thrives on constructive criticism (while Toby's comments to the documentary crew indicate he is not upset about the warning, owing to his envy of Jim's relationship with Pam). [...] Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is selling his 2001 Nissan Xterra for $8,700, and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) pressures him into selling it for $1,500 less than the asking price, because according to Dwight, [...] " [...] car is crap". Dwight assures Andy that he will only use it as a wagon and dragged by a mule on Dwight's beet farm. Andy then sells it to Dwight, who, in a passive-aggressive method of getting back at him for dating Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), washes it and posts a sign asking for $9,995 for the vehicle, which upsets Andy when he finds Dwight's advertisement posted on the cabinet in the office kitchen. Dwight declares that it is already on Ebay which he claims is the subject of a three-way bidding war.|$|E
500|$|Following Jessie's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Hit the Road" [...] Head of Household competition. Due to the Coup d'État being used, all of the HouseGuests were able to compete. For this competition, HouseGuests faced off {{two at a time}} and were asked {{questions}} about past competitions played this season; the winner of each round would select the next two HouseGuests to face off, with the last HouseGuest remaining being the winner. Michele was the winner. On Day 41, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Chaosserole" [...] Have-Not competition. For this competition, HouseGuests competed in pairs and had to find matching casseroles and place them on a podium labeled with a certain day of the week or luxury prize; if the HouseGuests had put a correct pair on the podium, they would earn food for that day of the week. The HouseGuests earned food for everyday of the week except for Monday. Though the house was split, the HouseGuests were unsure of which side Michele would choose to stay with; she later aligned herself with Jeff, Jordan, and Russell, and stated she hoped to see Chima evicted. Later that day, Michele chose to nominate Chima and Natalie for eviction. Though she had often disregarded the rules for the show, Chima began to break rules more consistently following Jessie's eviction, including covering up cameras, refusing to go to the Diary Room, and not wearing her microphone. Early on Day 42, Chima broke further rules when she refused to <b>wear</b> <b>her</b> microphone and later threw it into the jacuzzi when Kevin brought her microphone to her. Following this, Chima refused to take an exchange microphone from the storage room. Following further refusal to enter the Diary Room, producer Allison Grodner later spoke through the intercom and convinced Chima to come to the Diary Room. Hours later, the remaining HouseGuests learned that Chima had been expelled from the game. On Day 43, the HouseGuests learned that Michele's duty as Head of Household had been fulfilled as Chima was one of Michele's nominations, and that a new Head of Household competition would take place later that day.|$|E
