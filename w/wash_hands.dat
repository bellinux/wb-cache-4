40|$|In Victoria, <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations. The food safety standards introduced in January 2001 replace existing state, territory {{and local government}} food hygiene regulations {{and the provision of}} a <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin is no longer prescribed (Australia and New Zealand Food Authority 2001). The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora on hands. Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with hands free basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and hands free hand basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, Hands free mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or <b>hands</b> free <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of <b>hand</b> <b>washing,</b> types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basins available for the study. Education regarding the need to maintain the temperature of the <b>wash</b> <b>hand</b> basin water between 22 - 40 °C should also be investigated among food retailers as well as strategies for the correct <b>washing</b> of <b>hands...</b>|$|R

25|$|Before {{touching}} the contact lens or the eye, {{it is important}} to <b>wash</b> <b>hands</b> thoroughly with soap and rinse well. Soaps containing moisturizers or allergens should be avoided as these can cause eye irritation. Drying of hands using towels or tissues prior to handling contact lenses can transfer lint (fluff) to the hands and, subsequently, to the lenses, causing irritation upon insertion. Towels, unless freshly laundered on high temperature wash, are frequently contaminated with large quantities of bacteria and, as such, should be avoided when handling lenses. Dust, lint and other debris may collect on the outside of contact lenses. Again, hand contact with this material, prior to handling contact lenses, may transfer it to the lenses themselves. Rinsing the case under a source of clean running water, prior to opening it, can help alleviate this problem. Next the lens should be removed from its case and inspected for defects (e.g. splits, folds, lint). A 'gritty' or rough appearance to the lens surface may indicate that a considerable quantity of proteins, lipids and debris has built up on it and that additional cleaning is required; this is often accompanied and felt by unusually high irritation upon insertion.|$|E

40|$|University {{students}} may be at increased risk of infection because of {{living and working in}} close proximity to one another. <b>Hand</b> <b>washing</b> is widely considered the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious illness. Exploring the determinants of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> is vital to the development of interventions to increase this behaviour. A survey based on Social Norms Theory assessed <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and perceptions of peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> in 255 students at a Scottish University. Participants reported their own <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency and rate, and how often they thought their peers <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> in particular circumstances, to determine whether misperceptions around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> exist in a UK student population, and whether these influence the behaviour of individuals. Gender was found to be a significant determinant of <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency as females reported <b>washing</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more often than males. Participants also believed they <b>washed</b> their <b>hands</b> significantly more frequently than their peers. Perceived peer <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> frequency was significantly correlated with participants’ own behaviour. This effect was seen in overall <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> and in food, waste and illness-related <b>hand</b> <b>washing.</b> These results suggest perceived social norms around <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> have a consistent and robust association with individual behaviour. An intervention based on Social Norms Theory may, therefore, be effective in increasing <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> in a student population, reducing infection spread and illness rates within this group. Future research might test the effectiveness of a social norms intervention in other settings which carry an increased risk of infection spread, for example schools, hospitals and care homes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of the regular use of a <b>hand</b> cream after <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> on skin hydration and skin roughness. Methods Twenty-five subjects <b>washed</b> <b>hands</b> and forearms with a neutral soap four times per day, for 2 minutes each time, for a total of two weeks. One part of them used a hand cream after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash,</b> the others did not (cross over design after a wash out period of two weeks). Skin roughness and skin hydration were determined on the forearms on days 2, 7, 9 and 14. For skin roughness, twelve silicon imprint per subject and time point were taken from the stratum corneum and assessed with a 3 D skin analyzer for depth of the skin relief. For skin hydration, five measurements per subject and time point were taken with a corneometer. Results <b>Washing</b> <b>hands</b> lead to a gradual increase of skin roughness from 100 (baseline) to a maximum of 108. 5 after 9 days. Use of a hand cream after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> entailed a decrease of skin roughness which the lowest means after 2 (94. 5) and 14 days (94. 8). Skin hydration was gradually decreased after <b>washing</b> <b>hands</b> from 79 (baseline) to 65. 5 after 14 days. The <b>hand</b> <b>wash,</b> followed by use of a hand cream, still decreased skin hydration after 2 days (76. 1). Over the next 12 days, however, skin hydration did not change significantly (75. 6 after 14 days). Conclusion Repetitive and frequent <b>hand</b> <b>washing</b> increases skin dryness and roughness. Use of a hand cream immediately after each <b>hand</b> <b>wash</b> can confine both skin dryness and skin roughness. Regular use of skin care preparations should therefore help to prevent both dry and rough skin among healthcare workers in clinical practice. </p...|$|R
