5|$|After the Norman Invasion, Edgar the Ætheling (the {{successor}} to Harold Godwinson) surrendered to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. William created the manor of Berkhamsted, and bestowed it on Robert, Count of Mortain, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> half-brother. From Robert's son William de Mortain it passed to King Henry I, {{and is still}} owned by the Royal Family. Henry held court there in 1123.|$|E
5|$|John de Vere was {{a trusted}} captain of Edward III in the king's wars in Scotland and France, and {{took part in}} both the Battle of Crécy and the Battle of Poitiers. He died campaigning in France in 1360. Throughout his career he was closely {{associated}} with William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{began to}} plan his revenge. With {{the help of}} Pembroke, the King formed a small {{coalition}} of his half-brothers, {{a few of the}} earls and some of the senior clergy, and prepared for war. Edward started with Bartholomew of Badlesmere, and Isabella was sent to Bartholomew's stronghold, Leeds Castle, to deliberately create a casus belli. Bartholomew's wife, Margaret, took the bait and her men killed several of Isabella's retinue, giving Edward an excuse to intervene. Lancaster refused to help Bartholomew, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> personal enemy, and Edward quickly regained control of south-east England. Alarmed, Lancaster now mobilised his own army in the north of England, and Edward mustered his own forces in the south-west. The Despensers returned from exile and were pardoned by the royal council.|$|E

5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (<b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> wife's sister-in-law).|$|E
5|$|Joaquim José Inácio {{was born}} in Lisbon, Kingdom of Portugal. Although the date on his birth {{certificate}} was 30 July 1808, his mother claimed that the correct birthdate was two days later, on 1 August. He personally affirmed that the later date was accurate, as did his younger brother, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> biographer. Regardless, some biographers, including Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Carlos Guilherme Haring, have persisted in citing the date mistakenly entered on the birth certificate.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus was {{the elder}} son of Stephen V, son of Béla IV of Hungary, and Stephen's wife Elizabeth the Cuman. Elizabeth was the {{daughter}} of a chieftain of the Cumans who had settled in Hungary. She was born as a pagan and was baptized before her marriage to Stephen. Ladislaus was born under the sign of Mars in 1262, according to Simon of Kéza, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> chaplain in the 1270s.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also {{found it difficult to}} function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E
5|$|Patricius {{was praised}} {{in the third}} preface of the Justinian Digest (Tanta-Dedoken) as a {{distinguished}} professor of the Beirut law school. Archaeological excavations done in Beirut {{at the turn of}} the 20th century revealed a funerary monument believed to have belonged to Patricius. The son of Eudoxius, Leontius was described by ecclesiastical historian Zacharias Rhetor, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> first-year student in 487 or 488, to have a great reputation in the legal field. He was raised to the office of Praetorian prefect of the East under Emperor Anastasius I between 503 and 504, and became Magister militum in 528. Leontius was also involved as a commissioner in the preparation of the first codex of Justinian. His contemporary, Amblichus, wrote a commentary on Ulpian's Libri ad Edictum.|$|E

5|$|The {{family was}} {{connected}} {{in some way}} with the de Lacy family, as the younger Geoffrey named Gilbert de Lacy as his relative. According to David Crouch, Agnes was Gilbert de Lacy's aunt, which if true would make de Lacy and Talbot first cousins. He was also a relative of Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> heiress. He probably served as a household knight for Robert, the Earl of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{was founded}} by Merek Lama Lodre Gyamsto in 1680-81 {{at the behest of}} the 5th Dalai Lama, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> contemporary. When Merek Lama was {{experiencing}} difficulties in building the monastery at the chosen location of Tsosum, the ancient name for Tawang, the 5th Dalai Lama issued directives to the people of the area to provide him all help. To fix the perimeter of the Dzong, the Dalai Lama had also given a ball of yarn, the length of which was to form the limit of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{also saw}} service at Guadeloupe (12 April) the same year. He was colonel {{of his old}} regiment, the 21st Foot, from 1794 to 1803. While with them {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant-general on 26 January 1797 and to full general on 29 April 1802. Hamilton died on his estate in Scotland on 27 July 1803.

5|$|When {{he learned}} of the complaint, Arafiles spoke with the sheriff of Winkler County, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> friend {{and one of his}} patients. Arafiles alleged that the nurses' reports to the medical board {{constituted}} harassment. The sheriff investigated and obtained the TMB complaint, which provided enough information about Mitchell and Galle to make them identifiable. Galle and Mitchell were terminated from the hospital and faced criminal charges of misuse of official information. Galle's charges were dropped before trial and Mitchell was acquitted by a jury. In the aftermath of Mitchell's trial, Arafiles, several county officials and a hospital administrator all faced jail time for their roles in the retaliation against the nurses.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} {{marriage}} Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband's junior, {{turned out to be}} a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especiallywhich was represented by the earldom of Warwickfilled them with pride. Ambrose's childlessness deeply concerned the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen's displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester's estateand debtspassed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother's illegitimate teenage son Robert, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick's death.|$|E
5|$|Diego Velázquez, the {{governor}} of Cuba, was enthused by Hernández de Córdoba's report of gold in Yucatán. He organised a new expedition consisting of four ships and 260 men. He placed his nephew Juan de Grijalva in command. Francisco de Montejo, who would eventually conquer much of the peninsula, was captain {{of one of the}} ships,; Pedro de Alvarado and Alonso d'Avila captained the other ships. Bernal Díaz del Castillo served on the crew; he was able to secure a place on the expedition as a favour from {{the governor}}, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> kinsman. Antón de Alaminos once again served as pilot. Governor Velázquez provided all four ships, in an attempt to protect his claim over the peninsula. The small fleet was stocked with crossbows, muskets, barter goods, salted pork and cassava bread. Grijalva also took one of the captured Indians from the Hernández expedition.|$|E

5|$|His {{allegiance}} to the Lancastrian regime remained strong {{enough for him to}} take arms against the House of York, and eventually cost him his life. Commanding the central battle of the king's army he fell, with the duke of Buckingham and Lord Egremont whilst forming a human shield in defence of the king, against the victorious Yorkists in the battle of Northampton on 10 July 1460. Even though the king had fallen into Yorkist hands, Beaumont was not attainted, and his son was allowed to enter into his inheritance. Presumably in an attempt to reconcile his family to the new regime. This failed, and Beaumont's second son (but <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> heir) – the by now second Viscount fought against the victorious army of the Yorkist king, Edward IV at the battle of Towton in April the next year.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Harries left Granada {{and moved}} into {{freelance}} producing and directing. He directed the documentary series Africa in 1984 before beginning a collaboration with Paul Yule, with whom he made four films in Peru between 1985 and 1989—Martin Chambi and the Heirs of the Incas, Our God the Condor, Iquitos, and Mario Vargas Llosa: The Novelist Who Would Be President—and working on editions of The South Bank Show and Arena. While directing a corporate video for BT he met Jonathan Ross, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> assistant for the day. Ross invited Harries to direct a pilot for a chat show he and Alan Marke had developed {{that was based on}} Late Night with David Letterman. The pilot was a success and Ross found a television audience with The Last Resort with Jonathan Ross, which first aired in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After {{being diagnosed with}} a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted for surgery, which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks. Bertuzzi was {{in the last year of}} his contract with no guarantee he would re-sign with Florida in the off-season.|$|E
