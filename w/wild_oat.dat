25|$|The wild {{ancestor}} of Avena sativa and the closely related minor crop, A. byzantina, is the hexaploid <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> A. sterilis. Genetic evidence shows the ancestral forms of A. sterilis {{grew in the}} Fertile Crescent of the Near East. Domesticated oats appear relatively late, and far from the Near East, in Bronze Age Europe. Oats, like rye, are usually considered a secondary crop, i.e., derived from a weed of the primary cereal domesticates wheat and barley. As these cereals spread westwards into cooler, wetter areas, this may have favored the oat weed component, and have led to its domestication.|$|E

2500|$|Hundreds {{of years}} ago, the San Joaquin flowed freely through a grass and marsh-dominated region {{variously}} {{known as the}} [...] "California prairie", [...] "California annual grassland", or [...] "Central Valley grasslands". It is widely believed that the dominant grass species throughout the San Joaquin River valley and Tulare Basin, {{as well as the}} Sacramento Valley, the Sierra foothills and Coast Ranges, was Nassella pulchra, a type of bunchgrass more commonly known as purple needlegrass. Today, this vegetation community exists only in isolated pockets because of development of the valley for agriculture, and in much of the remnant open areas where it once thrived, now grows introduced flora such as annual rye and <b>wild</b> <b>oat.</b> The vegetation communities created by the introduced grasses are sometimes referred to as [...] "valley grassland", which is highly seasonal but is spread throughout the Central Valley from near Redding to south of Bakersfield. These grasses all thrive in the Mediterranean climate that dominates much of the San Joaquin Valley.|$|E

60|$|This {{island is}} {{volcanic}} in origin and structure, and its great caves {{have been made}} by blow-holes in hot lava. Erosion has weathered slope and wall and crag.

On the uplands the herbage was short and dry and the plants stiff and woody, but in the swales the <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> shook its quivers of barbed and twisted arrows, and the crow's foot, tall and sere, bowed softly under the feet of the wind, while everywhere, in the {{lowlands}} {{as well as on the}} ridges, the bleaching white antlers of by-gone herbivora lay scattered, testifying to [...] "the herds of deer and buffalo" [...] which once fed there.

6000|$|The Catholic {{opponents of}} Knox {{naturally}} told scandalous anecdotes concerning his youth. These are destitute of evidence: about his youth we know nothing. It is a characteristic trait in him, and a fact {{much to his}} credit, that, though he is fond of expatiating about himself, he never makes confessions as to his earlier adventures. On his own years of the <b>wild</b> <b>oat</b> St. Augustine dilates in a style which still has charm: but Knox, if he sowed wild oats, is silent as the tomb. If he has anything to repent, {{it is not to}} the world that he confesses. About the days when he was [...] "one of Baal's shaven sort," [...] in his own phrase; when he was himself an [...] "idolater," [...] and a priest of the altar: about the details of his conversion, Knox is mute. It is probable that, as a priest, he examined Lutheran books which were brought in with other merchandise from Holland; read the Bible for himself; and failed to find Purgatory, the Mass, the intercession of Saints, pardons, pilgrimages, and other accessories of mediaeval religion in the Scriptures. {7} Knox had only to keep his eyes and ears open, to observe the clerical ignorance and corruption which resulted in great part from the Scottish habit of securing wealthy Church offices for ignorant, brutal, and licentious younger sons and bastards of noble families. This practice in Scotland was as odious to good Catholics, like Quentin Kennedy, Ninian Winzet, and, rather earlier, to Ferrerius, as to Knox himself. The prevalent anarchy caused by the long minorities of the Stuart kings, and by the interminable wars with England, and the difficulty of communications with Rome, had enabled the nobles thus to rob and deprave the Church, and so to provide themselves with moral reasons good for robbing her again; as a punishment for the iniquities which they had themselves introduced! ...|$|E
