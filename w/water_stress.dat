5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} during high winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into <b>water</b> <b>stress,</b> which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E
5|$|Climate can {{influence}} bat distribution, movements and biogeography, access to food resources, timing of reproduction and emergence {{and rate of}} energy expenditure. In combination with other factors, including ongoing loss and degradation of habitat, global climate change or global warming presents a serious and increasing threat to bats and other fauna. The affinity of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat for riparian zones in arid and semi-arid environments renders it potentially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> and extreme weather events. Ecological factors that qualify the bristle-faced free-tailed bat as being at increased risk of the potential impacts of global climate change include habitat (species that rely on riparian habitats in <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> prone environments), foraging type (aerial hawking insectivore), roost type (tree hollow specialist), biogeography (species with limited dispersal ability, limited ranging behaviour) and extreme weather (species that occur in regions where there is an increasing risk of extreme temperature events or changes in rainfall patterns).|$|E
5|$|Marasmius rotula is a {{saprobic}} {{species and}} as such obtains nutrients by decomposing dead organic matter. It grows in deciduous forests and fruits in groups or clusters on dead wood (especially beech), woody debris such as twigs or sticks, and occasionally on rotting leaves. The fruit bodies, which are easily overlooked because of their diminutive size, are often present in abundance after rains. The species is relatively intolerant of low water potentials, and will grow poorly {{or not at all}} under <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> conditions. It is unable to degrade leaf litter until it becomes more fragmented and more compacted so that the water-holding capacity increases in the deeper layers of the soil. The magnolia warbler has been noted to line its nests with the fruit bodies' stems.|$|E

40|$|Drought and <b>water</b> logging <b>stress</b> are {{the most}} {{critical}} environmental factors that affect tree seedling survival and growth in the field. In this study, 12 populations of white jabon (Neolamarckia cadamba (Roxb.) Bosser) were evaluated to determine the genetic variability among populations and correlation among morpho-physiological seedling characters under drought and <b>water</b> logging <b>stresses.</b> Two research units were {{carried out by the}} randomized complete design with 2 x 12 factorial arrangements, i. e. (1) drought stress (2 treatments) and population (12 populations), and (2) <b>water</b> logging <b>stress</b> (2 treatments) and population (12 populations). Results showed that the responses of seedling traits were varied among populations under drought and <b>water</b> logging <b>stresses.</b> White Jabon seedling has higher adaptation to <b>water</b> logging <b>stress</b> than to drought stress. Kampar and Gowa populations have better adaptation to <b>water</b> logging <b>stress.</b> In drought stress, Gowa population had better adaptation followed by Nusa Kambangan population. Seedling height, total biomass and proline content characters based on value of broad sense heritability and correlation among characters, could be considered as important indicators for improvement programs for drought tolerance, while in the <b>water</b> logging <b>stress,</b> height, total biomass, root length and leaf area could be considered as important indicators for improvement program of white Jabon for tolerance on waterlogged sites...|$|R

5|$|Trials in Western Australia and Hawaii {{have shown}} B. aemula to be {{resistant}} to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. It requires a well drained slightly acid (pH 5.5–6.5) soil, preferably fairly sandy and a sunny aspect. Summer watering is also prudent, {{as it does}} not suffer <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> well. Slow-growing, the plant takes four to six years to flower from seed. It is less commonly grown than Banksia serrata. An investigation into optimum temperatures for germination found a nighttime temperature of 20–28°C, and a daytime of 24–33°C gave best results, and recommended summer planting times.|$|E
5|$|Vascular land plants make lignin, a polymer used to {{strengthen}} the secondary cell walls of xylem tracheids and vessels {{to keep them from}} collapsing when a plant sucks water through them under <b>water</b> <b>stress.</b> Lignin is also used in other cell types like sclerenchyma fibres that provide structural support for a plant and is a major constituent of wood. Sporopollenin is a chemically resistant polymer found in the outer cell walls of spores and pollen of land plants responsible for the survival of early land plant spores and the pollen of seed plants in the fossil record. It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.|$|E
5|$|Traditional desert farming {{systems have}} long been {{established}} in North Africa, irrigation being {{the key to success}} in an area where <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> is a limiting factor to growth. Techniques that can be used include drip irrigation, the use of organic residues or animal manures as fertilisers and other traditional agricultural management practises. Once fertility has been built up, further crop production preserves the soil from destruction by wind and other forms of erosion. It has been found that plant growth-promoting bacteria play a role in increasing the resistance of plants to stress conditions and these rhizobacterial suspensions could be inoculated into the soil {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. A study of these microbes found that desert farming hampers desertification by establishing islands of fertility allowing farmers to achieve increased yields despite the adverse environmental conditions. A field trial in the Sonoran Desert which exposed the roots of different species of tree to rhizobacteria and the nitrogen fixing bacterium Azospirillum brasilense with the aim of restoring degraded lands was only partially successful.|$|E
40|$|Seventy-two {{pearl millet}} genotypes were <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> at panicle {{development}} and grain filling stages. Neither grain yields, yield components, protein percent nor total protein {{per unit area}} were affected by water deficit during panicle development but protein content per grain was increased. When plants were <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> during grain filling, grain yield, grains per unit area and 1000 grain weight were reduced, but grain protein percentage increased. Total protein per unit area was reduced primarily due to lower grain yield. The protein content per grain was unaffected by stress, suggesting that the apparent increase in protein percentage is due to reduced carbohydrate accumulation under stress...|$|R
40|$|Anatomical and {{morphological}} aspects {{are integral}} part of drought resistance studies. The yield of a crop under <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> situation is combined effect of anatomical, physiological and bio-chemical processes, which are controlled by genetic make up of plant and prevailing environment. Stem {{plays a major role}} as storage organ of food material for plants, which is useful in abiotic stress situation like drought. Substantial variation in stem girth (2. 0 to 4. 3 cm), number of xylem vessels per stem cross section (33 to 110), secondary phloem width (252 - 882 μm) was observed. Comparative dry matter production in leaf, stem and roots was studied in <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> conditions. Present investigation aimed at highlighting stem anatomical and morphological aspects, which plays major role in imparting drought resistance...|$|R
40|$|Sunflower {{seedlings}} (Helianthus annuus cv. Licia Stella) {{reached a}} mild, moderate and severe level of <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> after 5, 8 and 11 days of soil water depletion, respectively. At a moderate level of <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress,</b> an elestic adjustment occurred. At the same time, {{in response to}} a minor osmotic potential and an intermediate rate of water potential decrease, glutathione level increased and enzyme activities related to the ascorbate/glutathione cycle were induced. At severe <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress,</b> the efficiency of this defence mechanism fell, oxidative processes intensified and soluble protein content decreased further. The results of the present experiment suggest that during <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> the <b>water</b> status of the plants {{plays a key role in}} the activation of defence mechanisms...|$|R
5|$|The {{structure}} of the root system, comprising a vertical tap root and multiple horizontal laterals, develops in the seedling's first year. Thereafter, the sinker and laterals continue to lengthen, and new laterals appear. There are only three to five laterals at first, but this number typically increases to eight to ten within ten years. During the first winter, {{there is a great}} deal of root system development, especially elongation of the sinker root, but almost no shoot growth. By summer, the sinker root has generally almost reached the water table, and shoot growth increases substantially. Around February, the shoot forms a resting bud, and growth then ceases until October. On resumption of shoot growth, the shoots grow rapidly for a short time, while the plant is under little water stress; then, with the onset of <b>water</b> <b>stress,</b> the plants settles into a long period of slower shoot growth. This pattern of summer-only shoot growth is maintained throughout the life of the plant, except that in mature plants, seasonal shoot growth may cease with the formation of a terminal inflorescence rather than a resting bud. Inflorescence development continues after shoot growth ceases, and flowering commences in February or March. March and April are the peak months for flowering, which ends in July or August.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> {{describes}} the physiological states that grapevines experience {{when they are}} deprived of water. When a grapevine goes into <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> one of its first functions {{is to reduce the}} growth of new plant shoots which compete with the grape clusters for nutrients and resources. The lack of water also keeps the individual grape berries down to a smaller size which increase its skin to juice ratio. As the skin is filled with color phenols, tannin and aroma compounds, the increase in skin-to-juice ratio is desirable for the potential added complexity the wine may have. While there is disagreement over exactly how much <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> is beneficial in development grapes for quality wine production, most viticulturist agree that some <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> can be beneficial. The grapevines in many Mediterranean climates such as Tuscany in Italy and the Rhone Valley in France experience natural <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> due to the reduced rainfall that occurs during the summer growing season.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> {{is an area}} of continuing research in viticulture. Of particular focus is the connection between yield size and the potential benefits of <b>water</b> <b>stress.</b> Since the act of stressing the vine does contribute to reduce photosynthesis-and by extension, reduce ripening since the sugars produced by photosynthesis is needed for grape development-it is possible that a stressed vine with high yields will only produce lots of under ripe grapes. Another interest of study is the potential impact on white grape varieties with enologists and viticulturists such as Cornelius Van Leeuwen and Catherine Peyrot Des Gachons contending that white grape varieties lose some of their aromatic qualities when subjugated to even mild forms of <b>water</b> <b>stress.</b>|$|E
40|$|Southwest China s Yunnan {{province}} {{has been}} affected throughout history by climate-induced <b>water</b> <b>stresses,</b> with the 2009 drought {{as a recent}} example. To deal with such stresses, mountain farmers have developed many local coping strategies. This paper provides case studies of these coping mechanisms in three mountain communities in Baoshan Municipality, Yunnan province. To minimize water-related environmental and economic vulnerabilities, our results show that upland farmers employ strategies both individually and collectively, which vary according to agroecological zone, economics, and historical period. Climate change is also emerging as an ongoing environmental challenge. We explore China s options for introducing and implementing adaptation policies that link with farmer strategies to respond more effectively to <b>water</b> <b>stresses</b> induced by climate change and other forces...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{effects of}} nutrients foliar application on agrophysiological characteristics of maize hybrid �KSC 704 � <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> conditions, an experiment was {{arranged in a}} split plot factorial based on a randomized complete block design with four replications to the Research Station of Islamic Azad University-Arak Branch, Iran in 2007 - 2008. Main factors studied were four irrigation levels including irrigation equal to crop water requirement, <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> at eight-leaf stage (V 8), blister stage (R 2) and filling grain stage (R 4) in the main plot. Combined levels of selenium treatment (without and with application 20 gha- 1) and micronutrients (without and with application 2 lha- 1) were situated in sub plots. Results showed that <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> decreased grain yield 19. 7 % in blister stage as compared with control. Using selenium increased relative content water at R 2 and R 4 stages significantly. Using selenium in <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> condition increased measured traits except plant height as compared with treatment without selenium. A negative antagonistic interaction was found between selenium and micronutrients on some measured traits. Between treatments of <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress,</b> highest grain yield equal 6799. 52 and 6736. 97 kgha- 1 was obtained from combined treatments of <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> at eight-leaf stage+without selenium+without micronutrients and <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> at eight-leaf stage+selenium+without micronutrients respectively which compared with treatment of irrigation equal to crop water requirement+selenium+microelements did not differ significant.

Experimental design was a randomized complete block in factorial arrangement with three replications. Experimental factors were water deficit levels (unstressed (control) and 70 % available water depletion from soil (<b>water</b> deficit <b>stress),</b> chitosan concentrations (0, 0. 05, 0. 1 %, all dissolved in 1 % acetic acid) along with an additional treatment of distilled water and foliar application times (before and during stem elongation). The results showed that <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> reduced plant height, leaf area, shoot and root dry weight, root height and volume. Whereas, foliar application of chitosan increased mentioned traits. In addition, <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> decreased chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll concentration and relative water content.

40|$|Water {{resources}} {{are becoming increasingly}} stressed {{under the influence of}} climate change and population growth in the Haihe River Basin, Northern China. Assessing the temporal and spatial variability of <b>water</b> supply <b>stress</b> is urgently needed to mitigate water crisis caused by water resource reallocation. Water supply and use data were compiled for the time period of 1998 - 2003 in this synthesis study. The <b>Water</b> Supply <b>Stress</b> Index (WSSI) as defined as Water Demand/Water Supply was used to quantitate whether water supply could meet the demand of human activities across the study region. We found a large spatial gradient of <b>water</b> supply <b>stress</b> in the study region, being much higher in the eastern subbasins (ranging from 2. 56 to 4. 31) than the west subbasins (ranging from 0. 56 to 1. 92). The eastern plain region not only suffered more serious <b>water</b> supply <b>stress</b> but also had a much higher interannual variability than the western hilly region. The uneven spatial distribution of <b>water</b> supply <b>stress</b> might result from the distribution of land use, population, and climate.

25|$|In {{very dry}} climates that receive little rainfall, {{irrigation}} is considered essential to any viticultural prospects. Many New World wine regions such as Australia and California regularly practice irrigation {{in areas that}} couldn't otherwise support viticulture. Advances and research in these wine regions (as well as some Old World wine regions such as Israel), have shown that potential wine quality could increase in areas where irrigation is {{kept to a minimum}} and managed. The main principle behind this is controlled <b>water</b> <b>stress,</b> where the vine receives sufficient water during the budding and flowering period, but irrigation is then scaled back during the ripening period so that the vine then responds by funneling more of its limited resources into developing the grape clusters instead of excess foliage. If the vine receives too much <b>water</b> <b>stress,</b> then photosynthesis and other important processes such as nutrient storage could be impacted with the vine essentially shutting down. The availability of irrigation means that if drought conditions emerge, sufficient water can be provided for the plant so that the balance between <b>water</b> <b>stress</b> and development is kept to optimal levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{complexity}} of the impulse breakdown of liquid water is reflected by the dependency of pre-breakdown processes on the polarity, rise-time and wave-shape of the applied impulses {{as well as on}} physical properties, such as electrical conductivity of water itself. Further understanding of the mechanisms of formation and propagation of impulse discharges in water and water solutions is therefore required to enable the development of pulsed power and plasma technologies. The paper presents a study of the dielectric behaviour of <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> with high voltage impulses in a point-plane electrode topology. Water with different conductivities including distilled water, tap water and a water based ionic solution was investigated. The volt-time breakdown characteristic of water is discussed and the prebreakdown time and nominal breakdown velocity have been obtained for both positive and negative polarity impulses. Potential breakdown mechanisms which can explain the observed polarity effects in the transient pre-breakdown processes in liquid <b>water</b> <b>stressed</b> with high voltage impulses are discussed...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> on the germination, emergence and seedling growth of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.)

Five sorghum cultivars (Jigurti, Gambella 1107, Meko, 76 T 1 # 23 and P 9403) were evaluated under three <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> treatments (0,- 0. 20 and- 0. 85 MPa) using PEG as an osmoticum (Experiment I) and under four varying growing media water contents (100, 60, 40 and 20 % of field capacity) using sand (Experiment II). In both experiments, <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> significantly reduced the rate and percentage of germination and emergence and early seedlings growth. Coleoptile, mesocotyl, radicle, and seedling shoot and root lengths, as well as root area were adversely affected by <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress.</b> Cultivars differed in the rate and percentage of germination, and emergence and seedling growth. Gambella 1107, Meko and P 9403 had significantly (P< 0. 01) higher rates and percentages of germination and emergence. The rate of germination and emergence, the growth of the coleoptile, mesocotyl, and radicle and the shoot and root length and root area were found important traits to identify cultivars tolerant to <b>water</b> deficit <b>stress</b> at germination...|$|R
