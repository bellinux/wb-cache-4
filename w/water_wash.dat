When he was 90 years old, he asked his brother monks to bury him alive. His last words were: [...] "I do not fear death. I would like you to not be afraid also. Never fear anything, but God alone. Let anyone who has fear come to me. Pour water at the burial stone, drink the <b>water,</b> <b>wash</b> your face, chest, arms and legs. Then break the vessel that contained the water. Fear will then abandon you." [...] To this day people come to the monk's grave to perform this ritual, leaving broken pieces of glass scattered all about.|$|E

Both geochemical discoveries and laboratory experiments suggested that one of the main chemical effects of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> is the removal of the more water-soluble components of petroleum, especially low molecular weight (LMW) aromatic compounds (Palmer 1984; Lafargue and Barker 1988; Kuo 1994; Lafargue and Le Thiez 1996; Hemptinne et al. 2001). Terpane and sterane biomarkers are little affected by <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> (Palmer 1984). The effect of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> can be readily illustrated by laboratory experiments. However, it is a little difficult to assess the extent of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> for natural oils because it is often associated with biodegradation (Huang et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Background/purpose: Presently, skin-cleaning {{agents that}} claim to be removed by water or wiping alone are commercially {{available}} and {{have been used for}} the purpose of bed baths. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on how <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> and wiping differently affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> and wiping on skin physiological functions and ceramide content. Methods: Three kinds of the cleaning agents with different removal techniques (ie, <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> and wiping) were used in this study. Skin physiological functions (ie, transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, and skin pH) and skin ceramide content were measured before and after seven consecutive days of the application of each cleaning agent. Results: No significant differences in skin physiological functions or ceramide content were observed between <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> and wiping. Conclusion: Cleaning agents {{that claim to}} be removed by <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> or wiping do not affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content by either removal method. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. in Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to <b>water</b> <b>wash,</b> sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|E
2500|$|Once {{absorbed into}} blood through the skin, it reacts with blood calcium and may cause cardiac arrest. Burns with areas larger than 160cm2 (25 square inches) have the {{potential}} to cause serious systemic toxicity from interference with blood and tissue calcium levels. [...] In the body, hydrofluoric acid reacts with the ubiquitous biologically important ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. Formation of insoluble calcium fluoride is proposed as the etiology for both precipitous fall in serum calcium and the severe pain associated with tissue toxicity. In some cases, exposures can lead to hypocalcemia. Thus, hydrofluoric acid exposure is often treated with calcium gluconate, a source of Ca2+ that sequesters the fluoride ions. HF chemical burns can be treated with a <b>water</b> <b>wash</b> and 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. However, because it is absorbed, medical treatment is necessary; rinsing off is not enough. Intra-arterial infusions of calcium chloride have also shown great effectiveness in treating burns.|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> technology for recycling an organic composite solvent consisting of hexane and pentane (4 : 1; TU-A solvent) was investigated for extracting total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) from contaminated soil. The effects of water volume, <b>water</b> temperature, <b>washing</b> time and initial concentration of solvent were evaluated using orthogonal experiments followed by single factor experiments. Our {{results showed that}} the water volume was a statistically significant factor influencing greatly the <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> efficiency. Although less important, the other three factors have all increased the efficacy of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> treatment. Based on a treatment of 20 g of contaminated soil with a TPH concentration of 140 mgg(- 1), optimal conditions were found to be at 40 °C, 100 mL <b>water,</b> 5 min <b>washing</b> time and 660 mgg(- 1) solvent.

40|$|Oil is {{produced}} in the Austrian sector of the Alpine Foreland Basin from Eocene and Cenomanian reservoirs. Apart from petroleum, the basin hosts a significant geothermal potential, {{which is based on}} the regional flow of meteoric water through Malmian (Upper Jurassic) carbonate rocks. Oils are predominantly composed of n-alkanes, while some samples are progressively depleted in light aromatic components. The depletion in aromatic components relative to abundant n-alkanes is an effect of <b>water</b> <b>washing.</b> <b>Waters</b> coproduced with oils that are affected by <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> show a progressive reduction in salinity and depletion in 2 H and 18 O isotopes, indicating that the degree of <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> is mainly controlled by the inflow of meteoric water from the Malmian aquifer. In some fields with Cenomanian reservoir rocks, a hydraulic connectivity with the Malmian aquifer is evident. However, <b>water</b> <b>washing</b> is also recognized in Eocene reservoirs and in areas where the Malmian aquifer is missing. This shows that existing flow models for the regional Malmian aquifer have to be modified. Therefore, the results emphasize the importance of combining data from the petroleum and geothermal industry, which are often handled separately...|$|R
