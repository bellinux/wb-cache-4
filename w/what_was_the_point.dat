500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

But is there seriously a difference between the noble and the ignoble? Milton, the stars, death, and himself--himself. The soul, the body; the higher and the lower nature. Perhaps there was something in it, after all. Milton had a god on his side and righteousness. What had he? Nothing, nothing whatever. There were only Doris's little breasts. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of it all? Milton, the stars, death, and Emily in her grave, Doris and himself--always himself....|$|E

Teyma mildly asked them <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> in question, but not a soul could tell, until Grabantak, starting up with furious energy, manufactured a [...] "point," [...] and then explained it in language so intricate, yet so clear, that the whole council stood amazed at their never having seen it before in that light, and then said, more or less emphatically, [...] "There, that's what we thought exactly, only we could not state it so well as the great Grabantak!" ...|$|E

He implicitly disagreed with Baldwin, calling attention to the RAF's success in preventing the Gotha bombers breaking through after May 1918. In April 1934 he took up the matter with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, pressing for the RAF to be built up to parity with other countries. He also suggested that six aircraft carriers would be sufficient to protect the Royal Navy against air attack throughout the world.|$|E
