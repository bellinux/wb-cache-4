2500|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the fourth dollar, the problems were not eliminated, and the economy continued to be almost completely dollarised. In his first budget, the Zimbabwe finance minister, Tendai Biti, stated [...] "the death of the Zimbabwe dollar is a reality <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with. Since October 2008 our national currency has become moribund". In late January 2009, acting Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced that all Zimbabweans would be allowed to conduct business with any currency, {{as a response to the}} hyperinflation crisis. On 12 April 2009, media outlets reported that economic planning minister Elton Mangoma had announced the suspension of the local currency [...] "for at least a year", effectively terminating the fourth dollar.|$|E

Also in July, Zach Galifianakis stated {{in an interview with}} Latino Review that the film will be set in Thailand, [...] "Well, I think we're going to Thailand. The problem with Hangover 2 is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> up to what we did which is very difficult. So we get, I think, kind of kidnapped.

2500|$|Meanwhile, on 1 March, {{five people}} who were {{picketing}} next to the Federation Council building against the invasion of Ukraine were arrested. The next day about 200 people protested at {{the building of the}} Russian Ministry of Defence in Moscow against Russian military involvement. About 500 people also gathered to protest on the Manezhnaya Square in Moscow and the same number of people on the Saint Isaac's Square in Saint Petersburg. On 2 March, about eleven protesters demonstrated in Yekaterinburg against Russian involvement, with some wrapped in the Ukrainian flag. Protests were also held in Chelyabinsk on the same day. The opposition to the military intervention was also expressed by rock musician Andrey Makarevich, who wrote in particular: [...] "You want war with Ukraine? It will not be the way it was with Abkhazia: the folks on the Maidan have been hardened and know what they are fighting for – for their country, their independence. [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with them. Still neighborly. And preferably in friendship. But it's up to them how they want to live". The Professor of the Department of Philosophy at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations Andrey Zubov was fired for his article in Vedomosti, criticising Russian military intervention.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, after {{receiving}} a letter from Cosima Wagner telling {{him that he had}} to read Gobineau's Essai sur l'inégalité des races humaines, Chamberlain, who was fluent in French, duly complied with her request. Chamberlain accepted Gobineau's belief in an Aryan master-race, but rejected his pessimism, writing that Gobineau's philosophy was [...] "the grave of every attempt to deal practically with the race question and left only one honorable solution, that we at once put a bullet through our heads". Chamberlain's time in Vienna shaped his anti-Semitism and Pan-Germanism. Despite living in Vienna from 1889 to 1909 when he moved to Bayreuth, Chamberlain had nothing but contempt for the multi-ethnic, multi-religious Habsburg empire, taking the viewpoint that the best thing that could happen to the Austrian empire would be for it to be annexed by Germany to end the Völkerchaos (chaos of the peoples). Vienna had a large Jewish population (until 1938, Vienna was about [...] 10% Jewish), and Chamberlain's time in Vienna marked the only time in his life when he actually encountered Jews. Chamberlain's letters from Vienna constantly complain about how he was having to meet and deal with Jews, every one of whom he detested. In 1894 after visiting a spa, Chamberlain wrote: [...] "Unfortunately like everything else...it has fallen {{into the hands of the}} Jews, which includes two consequences: every individual is bled to the utmost and systematically, and there is neither order nor cleanliness". In 1895, he wrote: However, we shall have to move soon anyway, for our house having been sold to a Jew...it will soon be impossible for decent people to live in it...Already the house being almost quite full of Jews, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in a state of continual warfare with the vermin which is a constant and invariable follower of this chosen people even in the most well-to-do classes. In another letter of 1895, Chamberlain wrote he was still influenced by French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's critique of the Jews as mindlessly materialistic, writing that Proudhon was [...] "one of the most acute minds of the century" [...] and [...] "I find many points of contact between the Wagner-Schiller mode of thought and the anarchism of Proudhon." [...] At the same time, Chamberlain's marriage to Anna began to fall apart as his wife was frequently sick and though she assisted her husband with his writings, he did not find her very intellectually stimulating. Chamberlain started to complain more and more that his wife's frequent illnesses forced him to tend to her and were holding back his career.|$|E
