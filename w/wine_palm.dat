As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E

25|$|Early European {{visitors}} to Easter Island recorded the local oral traditions about the original settlers. In these traditions, Easter Islanders claimed that a chief Hotu Matu'a {{arrived on the}} island {{in one or two}} large canoes with his wife and extended family. They are believed to have been Polynesian. There is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of this legend as well as the date of settlement. Published literature suggests the island was settled around 300–400 CE, or at about the time of the arrival of the earliest settlers in Hawaii. Some scientists say that Easter Island was not inhabited until 700–800 CE. This date range is based on glottochronological calculations and on three radiocarbon dates from charcoal that appears to have been produced during forest clearance activities. Moreover, a recent study which included radiocarbon dates from what is thought to be very early material suggests that the island was settled as recently as 1200 CE. This seems to be supported by a 2006 study of the island's deforestation, which could have started around the same time. A large now extinct palm, Paschalococos disperta, related to the Chilean <b>wine</b> <b>palm</b> (Jubaea chilensis), was one of the dominant trees as attested by fossil evidence; this species, whose sole occurrence was Easter Island, became extinct due to deforestation by the early settlers.|$|E

[...] The [...] "Geology," [...] by Mr. Charles Konig, of the British Museum, is based upon very scanty materials. The folio must not be severely criticized; had the writers lived, they might have worked up their unfinished logs into interesting and instructive matter. But evidently they had not prepared themselves for the work; no one knew the periods of rain at the equator; there was no linguist to avoid mistakes in the vocabulary; moreover, Professor Smith's notes, being kept in small and ill-formed Danish characters, caused such misprints as [...] "poppies" [...] for papaws. Some few of the mistakes should be noticed for the benefit of students. The expedition appears to have confused São Salvador, the capital, with St. Antonio placed seven days from the river mouth (p. 277).

40|$|Some methods {{employed}} in tapping <b>wine</b> from <b>palm</b> trees {{may affect the}} life span of the palm tree. This study investigated the methods of tapping <b>wine</b> from <b>palm</b> trees (Elaesis guineensis) among the Idoma and Tiv ethnic groups of Benue State. The aim was to examine the implication of the <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> tapping methods on the conservation of the palm trees in the study area. Applying a multi-stage sampling technique, 150 respondents were sampled and interviewed using semi- structured questionnaire to generate data. This was backed up with field observations of various <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> tapping methods to gather the required information. The result identified three <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> tapping methods namely inflorescent flower, terminal budding and felling of palm trees. The inflorescent flower method practiced in Idoma areas had all the trees tapped surviving while none of the trees tapped using felling the tree method in both communities survived. The inflorescent flower tapping method adopted by majority of tappers in the Idoma ethnic group was found to be more sustainable for <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> tapping as it ensures survival of trees tapped, providing for the <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> needs of today and future generations. However, terminal budding method of <b>palm</b> <b>wine</b> tapping associated with Tiv ethnic group is destructive because only a fraction of one quarter palm trees survived after tapping. Creating awareness on palm tree-friendly tapping methods and conservation strategies among the tapping community in these ethnic groups will improve the availability of living palm trees for continuity of use...|$|R
