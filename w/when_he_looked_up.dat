500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and said, 'please sir, if you are determined to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost always go to write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the servant brought out silver, gold, and {{garments}} for Rebekah and presents for {{her brother and}} her mother. Then the servant and his party ate, drank, and spent the night. The next morning, the servant asked leave to return to Abraham, but Laban and her mother asked that Rebekah remain a period of time. The servant persisted, so they called Rebekah to ask for her reply, and she agreed to go. So they blessed Rebekah — wishing that her children be thousands of myriads and seize the gates of their foes — and they sent off Rebekah and her nurse with the servant. Isaac had {{just come back from}} the vicinity of Beer-lahai-roi to his home in the Negeb and was out walking in the field toward evening <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and saw camels approaching. Raising her eyes, Rebekah saw Isaac, alighted from the camel, and asked the servant who the man was. The servant said that Isaac was his master, so she covered herself with her veil. The servant told Isaac everything that had happened, and Isaac brought her into Sarah's tent and took her as his wife. Isaac loved Rebekah, and found comfort after his mother's death. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the long first open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here with the end of chapter ...|$|E

2500|$|From Eusebius, two {{accounts}} of the battle survive. The first, shorter one in the Ecclesiastical History promotes the belief that God helped Constantine but does not mention any vision. In his later Life of Constantine, Eusebius gives {{a detailed account of}} a vision and stresses that he had heard the story from the Emperor himself. According to this version, Constantine with his army was marching (Eusebius does not specify the actual location of the event, but it clearly is not in the camp at Rome), <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to the sun and saw a cross of light above it, and with it the Greek words [...] "Εν Τούτῳ Νίκα", En toutō níka, usually translated into Latin as [...] "in hoc signo vinces". The literal meaning of the phrase in Greek is [...] "in this (sign), conquer" [...] while in Latin it's [...] "in this sign, you shall conquer"; a more free translation would be [...] "Through this sign [...] conquer". At first he was unsure of the meaning of the apparition, but in the following night he had a dream in which Christ explained to him that he should use the sign against his enemies. Eusebius then continues to describe the labarum, the military standard used by Constantine in his later wars against Licinius, showing the Chi-Rho sign.|$|E

50|$|At {{several points}} in the film Marie (his {{secretary}} who says she had twin children {{who would have been}} Abe's age but died) turns up in unexpected places and talks with him, often to discourage him from pursuing a relationship with Miranda or to take him away.

60|$|It was {{evening before}} {{the subject was}} again {{referred}} to {{and then it was}} raised by Jack himself. He had been sitting, curled in a large chair, reading, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and addressed his father.|$|R

5000|$|Graham {{considers}} a hypothetical Blub programmer. When the programmer {{looks down the}} [...] "power continuum", he considers the lower languages to be less powerful because they miss some feature that a Blub programmer is used to. But <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> <b>he</b> fails to realise that <b>he</b> is <b>looking</b> up: <b>he</b> merely sees [...] "weird languages" [...] with unnecessary features and assumes they are equivalent in power, but with [...] "other hairy stuff thrown in as well". When Graham considers {{the point of view}} of a programmer using a language higher than Blub, he describes that programmer as looking down on Blub and noting its [...] "missing" [...] features from {{the point of view of}} the higher language.|$|R

50|$|Two years later, Dr. Daniels {{is giving}} {{a lecture on}} Rachael's mind and how {{he wrote a book}} about her. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> from {{speaking}} with a student, he sees Rachael, who has not died after all; she indirectly reveals that she killed Starkman's last assistant, Elizabeth McGuire, and stole her identity to get into Quantico. She allows Dr. Daniels to know because she believes {{there is no point in}} committing the perfect crime if no one knows about it and that she is proud of his success. The body that was in the car was the real Rachael. As she walks out of his class, Dr. Daniels is obviously disturbed and rattled.|$|R
