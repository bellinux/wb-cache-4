25|$|Main Street, U.S.A. is {{reminiscent}} of the Victorian period of America with the train station, town square, movie theater, city hall, firehouse complete with a steam-powered pump engine, emporium, shops, arcades, double-decker bus, horse-drawn streetcar, jitneys and other bits of memorabilia. Main Street is also home to the Disney Art Gallery and the Opera House which showcases Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, a show featuring an Audio-Animatronic version of the president. There are many specialty stores on Main Street including: a candy store, jewelry and watch shop, a silhouette station, a store that sells Disney collectible items created by various artists, and a hat shop <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> option of creating your own ear hat along with a personalized embroidery. At the far end of Main Street, U.S.A. is Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Partners statue, and the Central Plaza (also known as the Hub), which is a portal to most of the themed lands: the entrance to Fantasyland is by way of a drawbridge across a moat and through the castle. Adventureland, Frontierland, and Tomorrowland are arrayed {{on both sides of the}} castle. Several lands are not directly connected to the Central Plaza—namely, New Orleans Square, Critter Country and Mickey's Toontown.|$|E

Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just {{get on with it}} and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E

Mr. Hastings does not remember; Mr. Larkins does not tell; they can learn nothing about it.

"SEPTEMBER, 1750, Konig, his well-meant {{visit to}} Berlin proving so futile, had left Maupertuis in the humor we saw;--pirouetting round his Apartment, in tempests of rage at such contradiction of sinners on his sublime Law of Thrift; and {{fulminating}} permission to Konig: 'No {{time to read}} your Paper of Contradictions; publish it in Leipzig, in Jericho; anywhere in the Earth, in Heaven, in the Other Place, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity!' Konig, returning on these terms, had nothing for it but to publish his Paper; and did publish it, in the Leipzig--Acta Eruditorum--for March, 1751. There it stands, legible to this day: and {{if any of the}} human species should again think of reading it, I believe it will be found a reasonable, solid and decisive Paper; of steadfast, openly articulate, by no means insolent, tone; considerably modifying Maupertuis's Law of Thrift, or Minimum of Action;--fatal to the claim of its being a 'Sublime Discovery,' or indeed, so far as TRUE, any discovery at all. [In--Acta Eruditorum--(Lipsiae, 1751):--"De universali Principio AEquilibrii et Motus."--By no means uncivil to Maupertuis; though obliged to controvert him.

6000|$|Two {{or three}} days after the dinner at General Oglethorpe's, Goldsmith met Johnson again at the table of General Paoli, the hero of Corsica. Martinelli, of Florence, author of an Italian History of England, was among the guests; as was Boswell, to whom we are indebted for minutes of the {{conversation}} which took place. The question was debated whether Martinelli should continue his history down to that day. [...] "To be sure he should," [...] said Goldsmith. [...] "No, sir;" [...] cried Johnson, [...] "it would give great offense. He would have to tell of almost all the living great what they did not wish told." [...] Goldsmith.--"It may, perhaps, be necessary for a native to be more cautious; but a foreigner, who comes among us without prejudice, may be considered as holding the place of a judge, and may speak his mind freely." [...] Johnson.--"Sir, a foreigner, when he sends a work from the press, ought to be on his guard against catching the error and mistaken enthusiasm of the people among whom he happens to be." [...] Goldsmith.--"Sir, he wants only to sell his history, and to tell truth; one an honest, the other a laudable motive." [...] Johnson.--"Sir, they are both laudable motives. It is laudable in a man to wish to live by his labors; but he should write so as he may live by them, not so as he may be knocked on the head. I would advise him to be at Calais before he publishes his history of the present age. A foreigner who attaches himself to a political party in this country is in the worst state that can be imagined; he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler. A native may do it from interest." [...] Boswell.--"Or principle." [...] Goldsmith.--"There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day, and are not hurt by it. Surely, then, one may tell truth with perfect safety." [...] Johnson.--"Why, sir, in the first place, he who tells a hundred lies has disarmed the force of his lies. But, besides, a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him than one truth which he does not wish to be told." [...] Goldsmith.--"For my part, I'd tell the truth, and shame the devil." [...] Johnson.--"Yes, sir, but the devil will be angry. I wish to shame the devil as much as you do, but I should choose {{to be out of the}} reach of his claws."
