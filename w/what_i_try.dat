25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|Michele bases Rachel {{on herself}} {{when she was}} younger, and also draws {{inspiration}} from the film Election, and the Gossip Girl character Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester). She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that it shows you how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be. And in four years, high school will be over and all of that crap won't matter anyway." ...|$|E

Today's fads, trends, shortsightedness, ignorance can {{disguise}} a deeper understanding of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to get through to the minds. [...] This is natural. For generations to come it is common sense what is hard to fathom today for many. In my life I have reached a significant number of people compared to the masses I will teach after I am gone for decades to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lupe Fiasco was {{supposedly}} {{going to release}} a triple album, titled LupE.N.D. as his third and final record, but his contract with Atlantic Records prevented him from doing so. From then he postponed LupE.N.D. indefinitely and intended on releasing an album tentatively titled The Great American Rap Album in June 2009. Instead, the album was also postponed and he announced that a new album was in the works, originally titled We Are Lasers and then changed to Lasers. [...] "Lasers" [...] is a backronym for [...] "Love Always Shines Everytime, Remember 2 Smile". Referring to {{the title of the}} album, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I've always had that word in my head, I'm a word guy. And I thought 'lasers' would be a dope name for an album, so when I came up with it I just put it in my 'think-tank' and let it evolve and came up with different meanings for it. That’s why I made it an acronym [...] to give it a new mould, a new understanding, but still playing off the idea that it's bringing light to different circumstances which is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> and do - bringing understanding and light and awareness to different projects that are going on in the world, and 'L.A.S.E.R.S' is no different.|$|E

60|$|They {{who have}} never seen the {{daylight}} peer Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain, And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear And worshipped body risen, they for certain Will never know of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to sing, How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well to run down the men who make these things," [...] he cried, [...] "but there's a {{something}}--there's a haughty, indefinable something about that figure. It's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> for in my 'Empress Eugénie,'" [...] he added, with a sigh.|$|R
60|$|You cannot in {{the least}} tell what a help you are to me, in caring so much for my things and seeing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to do in them.

Yes, that second column is rather nicely touched, though I say it, for hands and eyes of sixty-two; but when once the wind stops I hope to do a bit of primrosey ground that will be richer.|$|E

I was less his choice than his father's; and, though I thought {{we should have been}} very happy, {{it does not seem to}} be the leading of Heaven. I am so far his inferior in cleverness, and everything attractive, and have been made so like his elder sister, that it might not have been best for him. I want him to feel that, in beginning afresh, he is doing me no injury; and then in time, whenever I come home, it may be such a friendship as there was between our elders. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to look forward to,--no, I don't think I look forward to anything. Good night, Aunt Melicent--I am so glad you like him!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 34. In {{this and}} the two next {{following}} lectures, I shall endeavour therefore {{to show you the}} grave relations of human art, in these three functions, to human life. I can do this but roughly, as you may well suppose--since each of these subjects would require for its right treatment years instead of hours. Only, remember, I have already given years, not a few, to each of them; and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to tell you now will be only so much as is absolutely necessary to set our work on a clear foundation. You may not, at present, see the necessity for any foundation, and may think that I ought to put pencil and paper in your hands at once. On that point I must simply answer, [...] "Trust me a little while," [...] asking you however also to remember, that--irrespectively of any consideration of last or first--my true function here is not that of your master in painting, or sculpture, or pottery; but to show you what it is that makes any of these arts fine, or the contrary of fine: essentially good, or essentially base. You need not fear my not being practical enough for you; all the industry you choose to give me, I will take; but far the better part of what you may gain by such industry would be lost, if I did not first lead you to see what every form of art-industry intends, and why some of it is justly called right, and some wrong.|$|E

5000|$|Francis Poulenc {{literally}} sang her praises, considering her {{an equal}} to Paul Éluard and Max Jacob, {{found in her}} writing [...] "a sort of sensitive impertinence, libertinage, and an appetite which, carried on into song is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to express in my extreme youth with Marie Laurencin in Les Biches."

2500|$|Harvard {{economist}} and former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers explains Hayek's place in modern economics: [...] "What's {{the single most}} important thing to learn from an economics course today? <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to leave my students with is the view that the invisible hand is more powerful than the hidden hand. Things will happen in well-organized efforts without direction, controls, plans. That's the consensus among economists. That's the Hayek legacy." ...|$|R
