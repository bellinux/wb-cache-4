Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} typically seeks invertebrate food on tree trunks, starting {{near the}} tree base and <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up using its stiff tail feathers for support. Unlike a nuthatch, {{it does not}} come down trees head first, but flies {{to the base of}} another nearby tree. It uses its long thin bill to extract insects and spiders from crevices in the bark. Although normally found on trees, it will occasionally hunt prey items on walls, bare ground, or amongst fallen pine needles, and may add some conifer seeds to its diet in the colder months.|$|E

A remarkable musical departure from their previous work, Kids on the Street was primarily a showcase of the ska influences which had gradually become {{a major part of}} the Daddies' live sound, forgoing their usual brassy funk and swing-based eclecticism in favor of guitar-driven ska, rock and punk. Distributed by noted indie label Caroline Records, Kids on the Street wound up becoming the Daddies' then-most successful release, remaining on The Rockets Retail Sales Top Twenty for over seven months and eventually <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> onto Rolling Stones Alternative Charts.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} minimum range {{continued}} to be raised, <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> through the Air Ministry and eventually to Harold Lardner, head of what was then known as the Stanmore Research Centre. Rowe and his deputy Bennett Lewis were called to meet with Lardner to discuss the issue. Apparently without informing Lardner of Bowen and Hanbury Brown's potential solution, {{or the fact that}} they could not work on it due to the ongoing installations, they agreed to have Lewis investigate the matter. Lewis then sent a contract to EMI to see what they could do. According to both Bowen and Hanbury Brown, Rowe and Lewis instigated these events deliberately to pull control of the AI project from the AI team.|$|E
5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E

25|$|Once female {{anthesis}} {{is nearing}} its {{end and the}} female flowers have been pollinated, the spathe will be fully open and male anthesis begins. In the beginning of male anthesis, the fertile male flowers complete the process of producing the pollen and the female flowers become unreceptive to further pollination. Additionally, the spadix moves from its 45° position and presses up flush to the spathe. Towards the end of male anthesis, the spathe begins to close from the bottom, <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up and forcing the beetles to move up and across the upper region of the spathe, where the fertile male flowers are located. In doing so, the philodendron controls when the beetles come and when they leave and forces them to rub against {{the top of the}} spadix where the pollen is located as they exit, thus ensuring they are well-coated with pollen. One would expect the beetles to stay indefinitely if they could due to the very favorable conditions the inflorescence provides. After male anthesis, the males will go off and find another philodendron undergoing female anthesis, so will pollinate the female flowers with the pollen it had collected from its previous night of mating.|$|E
25|$|However, in June 1987, the National Park Service {{reversed}} its ruling after Montgomery County {{agreed to}} build noise barriers and wildlife crossings and purchase land {{to compensate for}} the woods lost to construction of the highway. By this time, parts of the highway were under construction in Rockville and Germantown. The first segment of the highway, from Middlebrook Road south to MD 117, opened in August 1987. The second segment to open was from Darnestown Road, then part of MD 28, north to MD 124; this southern segment was open by April 1989. The coalition of civic and environmental groups filed another lawsuit in March 1988 seeking to block construction of the middle segment from MD 124 to MD 117, but the lawsuit was dismissed on appeal in April 1989. Montgomery County began construction on the middle section in 1988 while the lawsuit was <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> through the courts because they were confident of prevailing. Great Seneca Highway fully opened when the middle section was completed in June 1990. In 1999, Great Seneca Highway north of MD 28 was designated MD 119 as part of a statecounty maintenance swap in which 22 state highways were transferred to Montgomery County maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, <b>working</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E
