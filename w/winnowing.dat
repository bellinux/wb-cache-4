5|$|<b>Winnowing</b> fan: Contemporary to {{the rotary}} air {{conditioning}} fan invented by Han dynasty mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) is a pottery tomb {{model of a}} crank-operated rotary <b>winnowing</b> fan from the Han Dynasty, used for separating chaff from grain. The <b>winnowing</b> fan was first described by the Tang Dynasty writer and linguist Yan Shigu (581–645), in his commentary on the Jijiupian dictionary written earlier in 40 BC by Shi Yu; it was also mentioned in a poem by the Song Dynasty artist Mei Yaochen in about 1060. The earliest known drawn illustration of the <b>winnowing</b> fan comes from the Book of Agriculture published in 1313 by Yuan dynasty inventor and politician Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333).|$|E

5|$|A case {{somewhat}} similar to Batesian mimicry {{is that of}} mimetic weeds, which imitate agricultural crops. In weed or Vavilovian mimicry, the weed survives by having seeds which <b>winnowing</b> machinery identifies as belonging to the crop. Vavilovian mimicry is not Batesian, because man and crop are not enemies.|$|E

5|$|Vavilovian mimicry {{is found}} in weeds that come to share {{characteristics}} with a domesticated plant through artificial selection. It is named after Russian botanist and geneticist Nikolai Vavilov.

5|$|Dhumavati's outer inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The <b>winnowing</b> basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the outer illusory form from the inner reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee {{to go beyond the}} outer deceptive appearances and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{standard}} descriptions of Dhumavati's form, some relatively recent paintings deviate from it. For example, an 18th-century painting by Molaram depicts Dhumavati {{sitting on a}} chariot pulled by two black scavenger birds with curved beaks. The painting follows the usual attributes like the <b>winnowing</b> basket, boon-giving gesture, but also depicts her young and beautiful with full breasts and adorned in gold finery, {{a stark contrast to}} her usual form. An early 20th-century painting from Varanasi depicts her riding a crow, holding a trident, a sword, a <b>winnowing</b> fan, and a bowl in her four arms, dark-complexioned, with sagging breasts, wearing white clothes and with cremation flames in the background. She is again adorned in gold finery and wears a gold-hewn lower garment, unusual for a widow's dress. Another 18th century Nepali manuscript depicts a complete deviation from her traditional descriptions. She is completely nude with high breasts, wears a pearl necklace and headband, stands on a peacock with legs apart, and holds a mirror while looking at her reflection. A ring of fire surrounds her, possibly conveying cremation flames.|$|E
40|$|Littlestone's <b>Winnow</b> {{algorithm}} {{for learning}} disjunctions of Boolean attributes where most attributes are irrelevant {{is one of}} the most fundamental results in learning theory. Because of the importance of <b>Winnow,</b> it is natural to try extending <b>Winnow</b> to learn disjunctions of features (i. e., concepts). In doing so, we may generalize some earlier applications of <b>Winnow.</b> In this paper, we extend <b>Winnow</b> to learn k-disjunctions of indicator-feature pairs where each pair is a conjunction of a Boolean attribute and a feature (concept) from a certain type of feature (concept) class. (When all the Boolean attributes are always set to 1, then the concept class is the class of disjunctions of features.) Our algorithm inherits <b>Winnow's</b> capability of discounting irrelevant attributes quickly. As an application of our algorithm, we generalize an earlier Winnow-based result of Maass and Warmuth on learning boxes to learn a concave lower halfspace in the discretized domain by approximating it using [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The SNoW (Sparse Network of <b>Winnows)</b> {{architecture}} {{has recently}} been successful applied {{to a number of}} natural language processing (NLP) problems. In this paper, we propose large margin versions of the <b>Winnow</b> algorithms, which we argue can potentially enhance the performance of basic <b>Winnows</b> (and hence the SNoW architecture). We demonstrate that the resulting methods achieve performance comparable with support vector machines for text categorization applications. We also explain why both large margin <b>Winnows</b> and SVM can be suitable for NLP tasks. 1. INTRODUCTION Recently there have been considerable interests in applying machine learning techniques to problems in natural language processing. One method that has great success in many applications is the SNoW architecture [5, 12]. This architecture is based on the <b>Winnow</b> algorithm [15], which in theory is suitable for problems with many irrelevant attributes. The success of SNoW is then attributed to the argument that typical NLP tasks [...] ...|$|R

The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to <b>winnowing.</b> The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. <b>Winnowing</b> removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a <b>winnowing</b> fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
40|$|In theory, the <b>Winnow</b> multiplicative update {{has certain}} {{advantages}} over the Perceptron additive update {{when there are}} many irrelevant attributes. Recently, {{there has been much}} effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the <b>Winnow</b> algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized <b>Winnows.</b> We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic <b>Winnows</b> in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Multiplicative weight-updating {{algorithms}} such as <b>Winnow</b> {{have been}} studied extensively in the COLT literature, but only recently have people started to use them in applications. In this paper, we apply a Winnow-based algorithm to a task in natural language: context-sensitive spelling correction. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in valid words, such as substituting to for too, casual for causal, and so on. Previous approaches to this problem have been statistics-based; we compare <b>Winnow</b> {{to one of the}} more successful such approaches, which uses Bayesian classifiers. We find that: (1) When the standard (heavily-pruned) set of features is used to describe problem instances, <b>Winnow</b> performs comparably to the Bayesian method; (2) When the full (unpruned) set of features is used, <b>Winnow</b> is able to exploit the new features and convincingly outperform Bayes; and (3) When a test set is encountered that is dissimilar to the training set, <b>Winnow</b> is better than Baye [...] ...|$|R

Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a <b>winnowing</b> basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of <b>winnowing</b> machines that separated grain from chaff. The odometer cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of <b>winnowing</b> machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

CASCADE). A detailed mathematical analysis of <b>Winnow</b> is presented as well as a comparison to CASCADE in the context of practical implementations of QKD; in particular, the information overhead required for secure implementation {{is one of the most}} important criteria in the evaluation of a particular error reconciliation protocol. The increase in efficiency for <b>Winnow</b> is due largely to the reduction in authenticated public communication required for its implementation compared to CASCADE...|$|R

However in theory, <b>Winnow</b> may not converge for linearly non-separable data. To remedy this problem, we employ a generalization of the original <b>Winnow</b> method. An additional advantage of the new algorithm is that it provides reliable confidence estimates for its classification predictions. This property is required in our statistical modeling approach.

40|$|Abstract. Online multiplicative weight-update {{learning}} algorithms, such as <b>Winnow,</b> {{have proven}} to behave remarkably for learning simple disjunctions with few relevant attributes. The aim {{of this paper is}} to extend the <b>Winnow</b> algorithm to more expressive concepts characterized by DNF formulas with few relevant rules. For such problems, the convergence of <b>Winnow</b> is still fast, since the number of mistakes increases only linearly with the number of attributes. Yet, the learner is confronted with an important computational barrier: during any prediction, it must evaluate the weighted sum of an exponential number of rules. To circumvent this issue, we convert the prediction problem into a Weighted Model Counting problem. The resulting algorithm, SharpNow, is an exact simulation of <b>Winnow</b> equipped with backtracking, caching, and decomposition techniques. Experiments on static and drifting problems demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in terms of accuracy and speed. ...|$|R
