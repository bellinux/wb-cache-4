5|$|Despite the {{disadvantage}} in numbers {{as well as}} attacking a fixed position, Williams' and Macdonell's small force was driving the opposing force {{to the edge of}} the gorge on which the redan was situated, and seemed on the verge of success before the Americans were able to regroup and stand firm. The momentum of the battle turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell's mount (causing it to rear and twist around) and another shot hit him in the small of the back, causing him to fall from the horse. He was removed from the battlefield and died from his injuries early the next day. Captain Williams was laid low by a <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> the head, and Dennis by a severe <b>wound</b> <b>to</b> the thigh (although he continued to lead his detachment throughout the action). Carrying Macdonnell and the body of Brock, the British fell back through Queenston to Durham's Farm, a mile north near Vrooman's Point.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo prospectively {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} accuracy of physical examination in determining the management of stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the neck. DesignProspective study of 59 patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the neck. Patients and methodsFifty-nine stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the neck managed between December 2001 and August 2003. All patients had a physical examination and routine angiography according to a written protocol approved by the research ethics committee. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of physical examination were assessed and compared with the angiographic findings. ResultsThirteen patients with positive findings on physical examination (history of bleeding, haematoma, minimal bleeding, thrill, bruit and pulse deficit) and 10 patients without clinical signs of vascular injury had vascular injury. A sensitivity of 57 %, specificity 53 %, positive predictive value 43 % and negative predictive value of 67 % were calculated for physical examination alone in detecting vascular injury. ConclusionFindings on physical examination are not good predictors of vascular injury in stable patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the neck. Our findings question the validity of physical examination alone, as a safe and accurate assessment of patients with gunshot <b>wounds</b> <b>to</b> the neck. Arteriography or ultrasonography is needed to identify vascular injuries...|$|R
