Glamorous and talented, she gave us many {{wonderful}} moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences {{from the time she was}} a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>hope</b> will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.|$|E
500|$|On August 22, 2006, Usher {{took over}} the role of Billy Flynn in the long-running Broadway revival of the musical Chicago. Usher's opening night brought out stars Penélope Cruz, Gabrielle Union, Clive Davis, and Rosie Perez, and others. Usher played the role of Flynn for two months but a case of strep throat brought an abrupt ending to Usher's run in Chicago, which saw a spike in ticket sales after he joined the cast. The New York Post reports that Usher's absence cost the {{production}} an estimated $400,000 in refunds to disappointed ticket buyers. Producer of Chicago, Barry Weissler issued a statement sending his [...] "thoughts and best wishes to Usher for a quick and speedy recovery. Usher made a spectacular Broadway debut, bringing a great dedication, work ethic and his amazing talent to the show. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>hope</b> that he might return at some point for the many fans that were unable to see his wonderful performance as Billy Flynn. Usher has found a new home on Broadway and is welcomed back anytime." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... Orthodox {{tradition}} {{is clear and}} unwavering {{in regard to the}} central point : the Holy Virgin underwent, as did her Son, a physical death, but her body – like His – was afterwards raised from the dead and she was taken up into heaven, in her body as well as in her soul. She has passed beyond death and judgement, and lives wholly in the Age to Come. The Resurrection of the Body ... has in her case been anticipated and is already an accomplished fact. That does not mean, however, that she is dissociated from the rest of humanity and placed in a wholly different category: for <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>hope</b> to share one day in that same glory of the Resurrection of the Body which she enjoys even now." ...|$|E

60|$|The side {{tables were}} strewn with books, and the ample {{folds of the}} drab curtains, let down over the windows, shut out the rain, damp, and chill.

60|$|Although Eaglesflight {{had spoken}} so quietly, and {{concluded}} {{in a manner}} so different from what I had expected, there was a deep interest in what was now going on.
