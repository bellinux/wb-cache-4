5|$|Ownership of {{the region}} of Oltenia became a source of dispute between the Iazyges and the Roman empire. The Iazyges had {{originally}} occupied the area before the Dacians seized it; it was taken during the Second Dacian War by Trajan, who <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> constitute Dacia as a province. The land offered a much more direct connection between Moesia and the new Roman lands in Dacia, which may be why Trajan <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> keep it. The dispute led to war under Hadrian, with him invading the Iazyges. The exact terms of the peace treaty are not known, but {{it is believed that}} the Romans kept Oltenia in exchange for some form of concession, likely involving a one-time tribute payment. The Iazyges also took possession of Banat around this time, suggesting it may {{have been part of the}} treaty.|$|E
