5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mild</b> spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic effects as other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|The ship crosses an ice {{barrier and}} arrives in open sea, {{close to the}} South Pole, albeit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mild</b> climate. Here the Jane Guy comes upon a mysterious island called Tsalal, {{inhabited}} by a tribe of black, apparently friendly natives led by a chief named Too-Wit. The color white is alien to the island's inhabitants and unnerves them, because nothing that color exists there. Even the natives' teeth are black. The island {{is also home to}} many undiscovered species of flora and fauna. Even its water is different from water elsewhere, being strangely thick and exhibiting multicolored veins.|$|E
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mild</b> strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E

Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard for authority or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat. In the DLC, Shale, a sarcastic Golem <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>mild</b> ornithophobia who was a female dwarf in her prior life, is also available.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in the ankles, elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111–114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians.

Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E
