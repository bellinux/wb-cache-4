60|$|History {{also tells}} us that the field of the supernatural has rewarded its {{cultivators}} with a harvest, perhaps not less luxuriant, but of a different character. It has produced an almost infinite diversity of Religions. These, if we set aside the ethical concomitants upon which natural knowledge also has a claim, are composed of information about Supernature; they tell us of the attributes of supernatural beings, of their relations with Nature, and of the operations by which their interference with the ordinary course of events can be secured or averted. It does not appear, however, that supernaturalists have attained to any agreement about these matters or that history indicates a widening of the influence of supernaturalism on practice, with the onward flow of time. On the contrary, the various religions are, to a great extent, mutually exclusive; and their adherents delight in charging each other, not merely with error, but with criminality, deserving and ensuing punishment of infinite severity. In singular contrast with natural knowledge, again, the acquaintance of mankind with the supernatural appears the more extensive and the more exact, and the influence of supernatural doctrines upon conduct the greater, the further back <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and the lower the stage of civilisation submitted to investigation. Historically, indeed, there would seem to be an inverse relation between supernatural and natural knowledge. As the latter has widened, gained in precision and in trustworthiness, so has the former shrunk, grown vague and questionable; as the one has more and more filled the sphere of action, so has the other retreated into the region of meditation, or vanished behind the screen of mere verbal recognition.|$|E

Generally, these rates will be understated, and possibly increasingly so as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> confounding any measurement of trends.

30|$|The results {{shown in}} Figure 6 {{indicate}} that for GOPs 1 and 4, the CADF scheme without heuristics incurs higher distortion than the baseline Foschini-Miljanic algorithm.

Since one GOP takes about 1000 time slots for the chosen video, as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> forward <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> our optimization continues to use the old channel gains. Thus, {{if there is a}} substantial change in channel gains from the original values, the optimization performs sub-optimally. This is indicated by the measurements of the channel capacity variance, also shown in the same figure plotted with reference to the right-hand y-axis. For GOPs 1 and 4, we see a high variance in channel capacity. The Foschini-Miljanic algorithm, however, uses current channel conditions while determining the target SIR in the outer loop, and therefore performs better in some cases.|$|R

40|$|The {{landscape}} {{evolution of}} the southern North Sea basin is complex and has left a geographically varying record of marine, lacustrine, fluvial and glacial sedimentation and erosion. Quaternary climatic history, which importantly included glaciation, combined with tectonics gave rise to cyclic and non-cyclic changes of sedimentation and erosion patterns. Large-scale landscape reorganisations left strong imprints in the preserved record, and are important for the detail that palaeogeographical reconstructions for the North Sea area can achieve. In {{the spirit of the}} North Sea Prehistory Research and Management Framework (NSPRMF; Peeters et al., 2009), this paper provides background geological information regarding the North Sea. It summarises current stratigraphical and chronological frameworks and provides an overview of sedimentary environments. As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> the understanding of Quaternary palaeo-environmental evolution in the North Sea basin during the last 1 million years becomes decreasingly accurate, with degree of preservation and accuracy of age control equally important controls.

40|$|International audienceThe {{predictions}} {{of general relativity}} have been verified by now {{in a variety of}} different situations, setting strong constraints on any alternative theory of gravity. Nonetheless, there are strong indications that general relativity has to be regarded as an approximation of a more complete theory. Indeed theorists have long been looking for ways to connect general relativity, which describes the cosmos and the infinitely large, to quantum physics, which has been remarkably successful in explaining the infinitely small world of elementary particles. These two worlds, however, come closer and closer to each other as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> back <b>in</b> <b>time</b> {{all the way up to}} the big bang. Actually, modern cosmology has changed completely the old big bang paradigm: we now have to talk about (at least) two (big?) bangs. If we know quite something about the one closer to us, at the end of inflation, we are much more ignorant about the one that may have preceded inflation and possibly marked the beginning of time. No one doubts that quantum mechanics plays an essential role in answering these questions: unfortunately a unified theory of gravity and quantum mechanics is still under construction.

40|$|We {{present a}} quantum theory of {{distances}} along a curve, {{based on a}} linear line element that {{is equal to the}} operator square root of the quadratic metric of Riemannian geometry. Since the linear line element is an operator, we treat it according to the rules of quantum mechanics and interpret its eigenvalues as physically observable distances; the distance eigenvalues are naturally quantized. There are both positive and negative eigenvalues, which requires interpretation. Multi-element curves are defined as direct sums of line elements, and behave much like systems of spin half electrons in a magnetic field. For a curve of many elements an entropy and energy and temperature are quite naturally defined, leading via standard statistical thermodynamics to a relation between the most probable curve length and temperature. That relation may be viewed as a universal heat-shrinking property of curves. At this stage of the theory we do not include bodies or particles in the mix, do not suggest field equations for the quantum geometry, and questions of interpretation remain. The theory might conceivably be testable using observations of the early Universe, when the temperature of space was presumably quite high.

60|$|It {{results from}} the {{simplest}} methods of interpretation, that leaving out of view certain patches of metamorphosed rocks, and certain volcanic products, all that is now dry land has once been {{at the bottom of}} the waters. It is perfectly certain that, at a comparatively recent period of the world's history--the Cretaceous epoch--none of the great physical features which at present mark the surface of the globe existed. It is certain that the Rocky Mountains were not. It is certain that the Himalaya Mountains were not. It is certain that the Alps and the Pyrenees had no existence. The evidence is of the plainest possible character and is simply this:--We find raised up on the flanks of these mountains, elevated by the forces of upheaval which have given rise to them, masses of Cretaceous rock which formed the bottom of the sea before those mountains existed. It is therefore clear that the elevatory forces which gave rise to the mountains operated subsequently to the Cretaceous epoch; and that the mountains themselves are largely made up of the materials deposited in the sea which once occupied their place.

40|$|We {{thank the}} editor and an {{anonymous}} referee. Any errors are our own. 1 Using the WACC to Value Real Options We present a real option valuation using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). This is an alternative to risk-neutral real option valuation. Using the WACC involves a marginal increase in mathematical complexity, but {{it is easy to}} implement in a spreadsheet, and it is easy to present to management. Our analysis reveals, however, that because the real option valuation is immune to choices of admissible discount rates (as per Arnold and Crack 2003 a), the critical issue is correct estimation of volatility, not choice of discount rate. We also point out that the natural and conservative tendency to overestimate risk is anything but conservative in a real option valuation. 2 “As <b>we</b> <b>go</b> forward <b>in</b> <b>time</b> through the tree (binomial tree for pricing options), the outcome changes at each node. Because of this, however, the discount rate should also change. In real options, the correct discount rate is determined through the ‘risk neutral’ valuation. When I discuss real options internally, often the initial response is that it’s nothing new. Explaining why it is – because it gets the discount rate right – is not simple, yet it is clearly very important in determining the correct valuation. This problem is exacerbated because most people are given a discount rate by the Treasury group for all calculations, and in general do not question its appropriateness. ...|$|R

Among the HAE candidates constructed from our narrow-band imaging, we have confirmed membership of 27 and 36 HAEs for the respective protoclusters, with a success rate of 70 per cent of our observed targets. The large number of spectroscopically confirmed members per cluster has enabled us {{for the first time}} to reveal the detailed kinematical structures of the protoclusters at z> 2. The clusters show prominent substructures such as clumps, filaments and velocity gradients, suggesting that they are still in the midst of rapid construction to grow to rich clusters at later times. We also estimate dynamical masses of the clusters and substructures assuming their local virialization. The inferred masses (∼ 10 ^ 14 M_) of the protocluster cores are consistent with being typical progenitors of the present-day most massive class of galaxy clusters (∼ 10 ^ 15 M_) if we take into account the typical mass growth history of clusters. We then calculated the integrated star formation rates of the protocluster cores normalized by the dynamical masses, and compare these with lower redshift descendants.
