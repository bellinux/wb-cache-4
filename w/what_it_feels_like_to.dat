5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{live in a world where}} you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

500|$|Cameron {{acknowledges}} that Avatar implicitly criticizes the United States' {{role in the}} Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference {{to the use of}} the term shock and awe in the film, Cameron said, [...] "We know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] He said in later interviews, [...] "...I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled..." [...] and, [...] "The film is definitely not anti-American." ...|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|The {{event was}} {{considered}} a success {{not only did it}} set a new attendance record it also generated considerable exposure for both the Crunch and the AHL. The game was originally going to be aired just in New York by Time Warner Cable, but was picked up by the NHL Network for broadcast across Canada and the United States. The players and coaches appeared to enjoy the game as well. Crunch head coach Ross Yates stated, [...] "it was unbelievable. It's hard to describe". Liffiton described the game as [...] "a little taste of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play college football" [...] while Picard added, [...] "I’ll do that every game {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] AHL President Dave Andrews further noted that it made him proud to be a part of the league.|$|E

500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> believe that religion." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{the complex}} {{technology}} used to for the video, Robyn believed [...] "It looked like 'MacGyver' on the set." [...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She {{wanted to make a}} video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E
500|$|Two critics from Pitchfork Media {{reviewed}} [...] "I Blame Myself" [...] {{separately from}} Night Time, My Time. Jenn Pelly ranked the track as the twelfth-best song released in 2013. She spoke favorably of its lyrical content, commending the chorus lyrics [...] "How could you know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> fight the hounds of hell?" [...] and [...] "You {{think you know}} me so well" [...] for painting Ferreira as an exemplar for [...] "bullied high school weirdos", and appreciating that the lines [...] "I know it's not your fault / That you don't understand / I blame myself" [...] for acknowledging her own wrongdoings {{with the intention of}} starting anew. Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Santana (Naya Rivera), Brittany (Heather Morris), and Mercedes (Amber Riley) {{are worried}} because Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) has not left her abusive husband, Cooter (Eric Bruskotter), as she claimed. Beiste tells them that adult {{relationships}} {{are more complex}} and insists she is fine. Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass. As the episode ends, Rachel and Tina sing [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", and board the glee club's bus to Nationals.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{said that}} Americans have a [...] "moral responsibility" [...] to {{understand}} {{the impact of their}} country's recent military campaigns. [...] Commenting on the term [...] "shock and awe" [...] in the film, Cameron said: [...] "We know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> launch the missiles. [...] We don't {{know what it feels like}} for them to land on our home soil, not in America." [...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal." [...] Other reviews saw Avatar as [...] "the bubbling up of our military subconscious... the wish to be free of all the paperwork and risk aversion of the modern Army—much more fun to fly, unarmored, on a winged beast." ...|$|E

There is some point where I learnt enough about myself {{to know that}} I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, {{and then the next}} thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clements and Musker {{had agreed}} from {{very early on}} that the style they were aiming for was {{primarily}} that of Lady and the Tramp (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents [...] "the pinnacle of Disney's style". [...] "After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians– which are fantastic films as well, but there's a particular style (to 'Lady and the Tramp') that's so classically Disney." [...] Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed {{the style of the}} New Orleans scenes, while Disney's Bambi (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes. Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding [...] "Bambi painted <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be in the forest instead of the forest" [...] so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.|$|E
