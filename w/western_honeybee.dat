In a 2011 Australian ant-venom allergy study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, 265 of the 376 participants in the study reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, the majority of patients (176) reacted to M. pilosula venom and to those of several other species. In Perth, M. gratiosa was responsible for most cases of anaphylaxis due to ant stings, while M nigriscapa and M. ludlowi were responsible for two cases. The green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica) was the only ant other than Myrmecia species to cause anaphylaxis in patients. Dogs are also at risk of death from Myrmecia ants; renal failure has been recorded in dogs experiencing mass envenomation, and one dog was euthanised due to its deteriorating health despite treatment.

50|$|Alfalfa seed {{production}} requires {{the presence of}} pollinators when the fields of alfalfa are in bloom. Alfalfa pollination is somewhat problematic, however, because western honey bees, {{the most commonly used}} pollinator, are less than ideal for this purpose; the pollen-carrying keel of the alfalfa flower trips and strikes pollinating bees on the head, which helps transfer the pollen to the foraging bee. Western honey bees, however, do not like being struck in the head repeatedly and learn to defeat this action by drawing nectar {{from the side of the}} flower. The bees thus collect the nectar, but carry no pollen, so do not pollinate the next flower they visit. Because older, experienced bees do not pollinate alfalfa well, most pollination is accomplished by young bees that have not yet learned the trick of robbing the flower without tripping the head-knocking keel. When western honey bees are used to pollinate alfalfa, the beekeeper stocks the field at a very high rate to maximize the number of young bees.Western honey bee colonies may suffer protein stress when working alfalfa only, because of shortage of one of the amino acids comprising the pollen protein, isoleucine.Today, the alfalfa leafcutter bee is increasingly used to circumvent these problems.

Varroa destructor (Acari Mesostigmata Varroidae), an ectoparasitic mite, is the most devastating parasite of the <b>Western</b> <b>honeybees</b> and causes substantial losses of colonies worldwide. Currently, the control of this pest mainly relies on chemicals such as oxalic acid, pyrethroids, and organophosphates. However, the extensive and repeated use of acaricides have caused the development of resistance in V. destructor populations, causing a reduction of their efficacy and are toxic to bees. Moreover, these products may leave residues in the hive, contaminating honey and beeswax. For these reasons, the use of alternative strategies for the control of V. destructor are required.

Infections from this species have been associated with recent global declines in the populations of <b>western</b> <b>honeybees</b> (Apis mellifera). Despite the outstanding economic and ecological threat that N. ceranae may represent for honeybees worldwide, many aspects of its biology, including its mode of reproduction, propagation and ploidy, are either very unclear or unknown. In my thesis, I aimed to expand our knowledge of N. ceranae biology by sequencing the genome of 8 isolates (i. e. a population of spores isolated from one single beehive) of this species harvested from 8 geographically distant beehives, and by investigating their level of polymorphism. Consistent with previous analysis performed using single gene sequences, my analyses exposed a very high genetic diversity within each isolate, but also very little hive-specific polymorphism. My investigations on the nature, location and distribution of this variation revealed that that beehives around the globe are infected by a population of N. ceranae cells that are polyploid (4 n or more) and clonal. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses I performed using genome-wide SNP data extracted from these parasites and mitochondrial sequences from their hosts all failed to support the current geographical structure of our isolates, suggesting that the isolates we analyzed have probably spread through human intervention.

Here, we quantify and compare individual hybridisation between sympatric and allopatric honeybee populations of A. m. mellifera and A. m. carnica using microsatellitemarkers and aBayesianmodel-based approach. We had a special focus on pure breeding populations, which are a major tool in honeybee conservation. Our results dem-onstrate that subspecies are still highly differentiated, but gene flow is not prevented by the current management strategies, creating urgent demand for an improved conservation man-agement of A. m. mellifera. However, the occurrence of a high number of pure individuals might suggest that some sort of hybrid barrier acts against the complete admixture of the two subspecies...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} {{the diversity of the}} <b>western</b> <b>honeybee,</b> Apis mellifera L., in West and Central Africa, a total of 204 colonies were sampled from 44 localities in four countries – Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. 86 of these colonies, from 23 localities, were subjected to full morphometric analysis. In a principal component analysis (PCA) of the morphometric data, the colonies formed a single cluster. It also revealed that overall size of the body was the most important source of variation between the colonies. A hierarchical structure analysis, followed by a stepwise discriminant analysis, classified the colonies into three distinct morphoclusters; however, these clusters were not geographically demarcated. In another PCA carried out with the samples under investigation and reference samples of A. m. adansonii, A. m. jemenitica and A. m. scutellata, the colonies under investigation again formed one cluster which lying over and extended beyond the clusters of the reference subspecies. This is suggestive of a wider variation in size in the bees under investigation. In a stepwise DA, 94. 2...|$|E
40|$|The <b>western</b> <b>honeybee</b> Apis mellifera, with a {{medium-sized}} brain {{of about a}} million neurons, was chosen as a model to study olfactory information coding and associative memory related plasticity. We focused our attention on the primary olfactory neurophils, the antennal lobes (ALs), responsible for coding and processing the sensory information received by the olfactory receptor neurons and for delivering the encoded signals to the mushroom bodies through the projection neurons. A multiphoton microscopy set-up allowed in vivo calcium imaging recording of the antennal lobes at milliseconds resolution. Functional calcium imaging permits recording of the odour stimuli response maps of the functional units, the glomeruli. Moreover, due to the high penetration depth of the set-up, these maps, representing the spatial odour code, can now be extended to sub-surface glomeruli, so far inaccessible to functional imaging. Finally, the penetration depth of multiphoton microscopy coupled with optical clearing treatment permits high-resolution 3 D reconstruction of the whole neurophil and this will allow investigating at the cellular level the morphological changes in the glomeruli associated with olfactory memory formatio...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Western</b> <b>honeybee,</b> Apis mellifera, is an {{economically}} important insect, {{responsible for a}} large portion of global pollination services. They live in densely populated colonies, which give the optimum chance for opportunistic pathogens and parasites to spread. Honeybees, like all organisms, are subject {{to a wide range of}} threats, from viruses to parasites. The immune response of A. mellifera to these threats relies on a fast acting non-adaptive immunity, with effectors such as cellular defences and the release of antimicrobial peptides. The defence against invading pathogens and parasites is important not only for the individual bee, but for the colony as a whole. Many bee diseases have been shown as capable of causing collapse of honeybee colonies. The first section of this thesis examines the occurrence and prevalence of four honeybee viruses (Deformed wing virus, Chronic bee paralysis virus, Acute bee paralysis virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus), the microsporidian parasite Nosema, and the parasitic tracheal mite, Acarapis woodi. The results from all seasons indicated a very low prevalence of the tracheal mite, with only 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} {{of an animal}} society depends on individual interactions and how they influence the coordination of a group to respond to environmental changes. Coordinated responses to environmental changes {{are determined by the}} interactions between individuals within a particular group. Individuals that are especially influential can affect the behavioral response of other group members. Here, I tested a novel concept I call “Follow the Leader”, in which an individual influences other group members within the thermoregulatory fanning behavior in the <b>western</b> <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera L.). In response to increasing temperatures, individual honeybee workers rapidly fan their wings to circulate air through out the hive. Individuals often influence the behavior of other individuals which results in a coordinated group thermoregulatory response for proper colonial homeostasis. My results suggest that individuals have the capability to become a leader within a group by influencing other individuals to follow their fanning response to increasing temperatures. An influential individual, or “leader”, may ultimately affect the ability for a society to efficiently respond to environmental fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|The neogregarine Apicystis bombi is {{considered}} a low prevalence parasite of Bombus spp. Before our work it has only once been detected in one single specimen of the <b>Western</b> <b>honeybee</b> Apis mellifera. This contribution reports the presence of A. bombi parasitizing both A. mellifera and Bombus terrestris at a site in Northwestern Argentine Patagonia (Bariloche, close to the border with Chile) and analyses its possible absence in the Pampas region, the most important beekeeping region of the country. In Bariloche, prevalence of A. bombi in A. mellifera was 7. 6 % in 2009, and 13. 6 % in 2010, whereas in B. terrestris it was 12. 1 %. Infections were not detected in 302 bee hives periodically prospected along 3 years (almost 400 000 honeybee specimens) in the Pampas. Analysis with the probability program FreeCalc 2 suggested a possible absence of A. bombi in this area. Because of high virulence showed in several species of Bombus in the Northern hemisphere, A. bombi should be closely monitored in A. mellifera and in native Bombus species or other Apidae...|$|E
