I cannot tell how it is done.|$|E

[...] "My Daddy had open-heart surgery today. And after long hours, and lots of tears, they healed his broken heart, and mine," [...] she announced through her official Twitter account. She stated that she hoped the song would inspire her younger fans to appreciate their parents.

She had sole discretion with the early script, and eventually wrote approximately ten drafts. Realising it held [...] "a perfect three-act structure", Moggach attempted to be as faithful to the original novel as possible, calling it [...] "so beautifully shaped as a story – the ultimate romance about two {{people who think they}} hate each other but <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> passionately in love. I felt, 'If it's not broken, don't fix it.'" [...] While she could not reproduce the novel's [...] "fiercely wonderful dialogue in its entirety", she attempted to keep much of it.|$|E

And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time.

500|$|... "Poker Face" [...] {{was written}} by Gaga and RedOne, while {{production}} was handled also by RedOne. Gaga stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "Poker Face" [...] {{was written by}} her as a pop song and was a tribute to her [...] "rock 'n' roll boyfriends". She also stated that the main idea behind the song was sex and gambling. In an interview with UK's Daily Star, Gaga noted of the song, [...] "It's about a lot of different things. I gamble but I've also dated a lot of guys <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> into sex and booze and gambling, so I wanted to write a record my boyfriends would like too." [...] In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, when asked about the meaning of the line [...] "bluffin' with my muffin", Gaga explained that it really was a metaphor for her vulva.|$|E
500|$|Hole toured with Marilyn Manson on the Beautiful Monsters Tour in 1999, but {{dropped out}} of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over {{production}} costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced the open for Manson under an agreement with Interscope Records. Hole resumed touring with Imperial Teen. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and Korn's (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at 99X.FM in Atlanta: [...] "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or like me, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> messed up... and they {{do not need to be}}—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously cut themselves, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool." ...|$|E

Helms also said {{the fact that the}} story of the three characters growing closer and bonding informed the friendship between the three actors: [...] "As you spend 14hours a day together for three months, {{you see a lot of}} sides of somebody. We went through the wringer together, and that shared experience really made us genuine buddies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hakka–Chinese {{scientist}} and researcher Dr. Siu-Leung Lee {{stated in the}} book by Chung Yoon-Ngan, The Hakka Chinese: Their Origin, Folk Songs And Nursery Rhymes, that the potential Hakka origins from the northern Han and Xiongnu, {{and that of the}} indigenous southern She (畬族) and Yue (越族) tribes, [...] "are all correct, yet none alone explain the origin of the Hakka", pointing out that the problem with [...] "DNA typing" [...] on limited numbers of people within population pools cannot correctly ascertain <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> the southern Chinese, because many southern Chinese are also from northern Asia; Hakka or non-Hakka. It is known that the earliest major waves of Hakka migration began due to the attacks of the two afore-mentioned tribes during the Jin dynasty (265–420).|$|E
2500|$|Gladwell's third book, Outliers, {{published}} in 2008, examines how a person's environment, {{in conjunction with}} personal drive and motivation, affects his or her possibility and opportunity for success. Gladwell's original question revolved around lawyers: [...] "We {{take it for granted}} that there's this guy in New York who's the corporate lawyer, right? I just was curious: Why is it all the same guy?", referring to the fact that [...] "a surprising number of the most powerful and successful corporate lawyers in New York City have almost the exact same biography". In another example given in the book, Gladwell noticed that people ascribe Bill Gates's success to being [...] "really smart" [...] or [...] "really ambitious". He noted that he knew a lot of people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> smart and really ambitious, but not worth 60 billion dollars. [...] "It struck me that our understanding of success was really crude — and there was an opportunity to dig down {{and come up with a}} better set of explanations." ...|$|E

5000|$|The novel follows {{two boys}} who both {{go by the}} name Will Grayson. The first Will, whose POV always has correct capitalization, is {{described}} as trying to live his life without being noticed.

2500|$|Reviewing Saint Maybe, Jay Parini {{describes}} how Tyler’s characters {{must deal with}} “Ms. Tyler's oddball families, which any self-respecting therapist would call ‘dysfunctional’…. [...] An inexplicable centripetal force hurls these relatives upon one another, catches them in a dizzying inward spiral of obligation, affection and old-fashioned guilt—as well as an inexpressible longing for some perfect or [...] "normal" [...] family in a distant past that never really was. [...] Almost every novel by Anne Tyler begins with a loss or absence that reactivates in the family some primordial sense of itself.” Larry McMurtry wrote, [...] "...in book after book, siblings are drawn inexorably back home, as if their parents or (more often) grandparents had planted tiny magnets in them which can be activated once they have seen what the extrafamilial world is like....sooner or later a need to be with people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> familiar – their brothers and sisters – overwhelms them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} many bands from {{previous}} decades are still active, like DDT, Korol i Shut and Splean, {{due to the}} lack of new bands gaining significant attention there is a common view that Russian rock is in decline. Ilya Chert from the band Pilot said: [...] "I can see the decline of Russian rock. We are going back to the times, when those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> talanted and wise are operating in basements and clubs with the capacity of 50 people, as they don't commercialize themselves and no one commercializes them". Artemy Troitsky, the famous Russian rock critic, wrote an article called [...] "Rock died a long time ago, but the funeral was impressive", where he brought up the lack of new faces in the Russian rock scene, and accused bands like Mashina Vremeni and Garik Sukachev for [...] "selling out" [...] and not protesting against the current government. Already in 2008 MTV Russia cancelled the nomination [...] "Best Rock Project", with the resulting headlines being [...] "MTV Recognized the Death of Russian Rock".|$|E
2500|$|At first, the Twelfth Doctor {{explicitly}} {{rejected the}} idea of having a romantic relationship with his companion Clara Oswald. He implied that in his previous form, he had come to see himself as Clara's [...] "boyfriend" [...] in an attempt to avoid confronting his extreme age and alien nature. Initially it was reported that Peter Capaldi told tabloids there would be [...] "no flirting" [...] between him and Clara, likening such a potential relationship to Papa and Nicole, but the actor himself discarded that. The episode [...] "Deep Breath" [...] introduces a character named Missy who identifies the Doctor as her boyfriend. Missy is later revealed to be a female incarnation of the Master. As the character of the Twelfth Doctor evolved, so did his relationship with Clara, and subtle elements of romance began to filter back in though not to the same degree as with his predecessor. In a spring 2015 interview, Steven Moffat indicated that the Doctor had never stopped being [...] "besotted" [...] with Clara, and that he [...] "loves them (companions) more than they love him." [...] In a media roundtable interview at the 2015 San Diego Comic Con, Capaldi went further, saying the two were romantically involved, just not in the traditional sense, [...] "It's romantic in the old sense. Two people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> crazy about each other..." [...] The narrative of series nine culminated in a three-part story arc in which Clara dies and the Doctor spends the next 4.5 billion years executing a gambit to change history and save her life. Further romance for the Twelfth Doctor was implied in the 2015 Christmas special, [...] "The Husbands of River Song", in which this incarnation meets his one-time wife, River Song, for the first (and, narratively, the last) time.|$|E
