5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E

Ridley Scott had never filmed there before, but {{described}} it as [...] "quite an experience...It was kind of organized chaos... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> {{at the height of}} tourist season." [...] Within Florence, the production would visit various locations such as the Palazzo Capponi (as Dr. Fell's workplace), the Ponte Vecchio, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Pharmacy of Santa Maria Novella and the Cathedral.|$|E
500|$|In late 2004, Song {{starred in}} the Disney Channel Original Movie Stuck in the Suburbs, portraying Natasha Kwon-Schwartz. The {{television}} premiere received 3.7 million viewers. The film is about two teenage girls living in suburbia who accidentally exchange cell phones with a famous teen musician. She later said: [...] "When Stuck came out it was crazy 'cause we went to Six Flags and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> and so many kids recognized us from Stuck in the Suburbs, I'm like wow that movie must have done really well." ...|$|E

500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard {{is very difficult for}} us to do in a short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on and near the frozen Gullfoss {{waterfall}} near Reykjavík. Feeling it was a dangerous process, McCulloch said in 1993, [...] "If we had slipped there wasn't anything for hundreds of feet below us." [...] In 2001 Griffin said, [...] " [...] the sun barely appeared the whole time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> To walk, stand up, or just think seemed a massive effort." [...] Despite the danger the filming proved its worth when the British music magazine Q said in 2001, [...] "The Porcupine cover {{is the epitome of}} rock band as heroic archetype– young men on some ill-defined but glorious mission, one easily as timeless as the stars and the sea." [...] The filming was finished in December 1982 with the band performing songs from the album at their rehearsal room at The Ministry. Butt interspersed this with clips from the 1929 Russian documentary The Man With the Movie Camera and he also projected psychedelic watercolour effects onto the band. A VHS video was subsequently released by Castle Hendring in 1983 called Porcupine– An Atlas Adventure which contained the six music videos– [...] "In Bluer Skies", [...] "The Cutter", [...] "My White Devil", [...] "Porcupine", [...] "Heads Will Roll" [...] and [...] "The Back of Love".|$|E
500|$|On 13 December 2013 Choudary led a {{march in}} Brick Lane, {{organised}} by the east London-based Sharia Project, demanding {{a ban on}} alcohol being sold by Muslim establishments. An East London Mosque official, speaking of the patrols, identified The Shariah Project as [...] "strongly linked" [...] to Anjem Choudary's banned group Al-Muhajiroun. Abu Rumaysah of The Shariah Project had predicted [...] "hundreds" [...] would join the demonstration, claiming that groups of Muslims would come {{from as far away}} as the Midlands to take part. In the event, only a few dozen protesters took part in the march. Choudary afterwards explained its purpose: “What we did is we posted a notice to the shop owners saying that under Sharia and under the Koran the sale of alcohol is prohibited and if one were to also drink alcohol, that would be 40 lashes. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to teach them that just because they are living among non-Muslims is no excuse because Sharia law will be implemented in Britain, and so they should be aware that just because it is not Sharia today, they can’t just do whatever they like.” Choudary said that the Shariah Project group would be arranging many more such rallies.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in June 1968, the CTW {{conducted}} {{a series of}} seminars at Harvard and in Manhattan, which were led by Lesser. [...] These seminars became an important aspect of [...] "the CTW model", which incorporated educational pedagogy and research into TV scripts and was used to develop other educational programs and organizations all over the world. [...] The purpose of the seminars was to expose the production team and other filmmakers and illustrators involved in the creative aspects of the new show to scholars, educators, and experts, and to encourage that both groups work together to create a curriculum and goals for the new show. [...] The production team was skeptical regarding the place of research and objective analysis in the production of a television show, but Lesser's previous experience in television, his warm, informal, unpretentious, and collaborative manner, and his proficiency in leading the meetings, convinced them. [...] CTW researcher Keith Mielke stated, [...] "He was masterful at running meetings. [...] He was never stiff and formal, but casual and friendly". [...] According to producer Sam Gibbon, despite the participants' personalities, experiences, and dispositions, Lesser was the only reason the seminars were successful. [...] Lesser set the meetings' tone and agenda, and recruited the participants. [...] He stated, [...] "The message was clear; <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to work. [...] No pretension was going to be allowed".|$|E
500|$|In 1967, Redding {{performed}} at the influential Monterey Pop Festival as the closing act on Saturday night, {{the second day of}} the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter Jerry Wexler. Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences. [...] At the time, he “had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market.” But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, “his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding’s career.” [...] His act included his own song [...] "Respect" [...] and a version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Satisfaction." [...] Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the Mar-Keys horn section) opened with Cooke's [...] "Shake", after which he delivered an impulsive speech, asking the audience if they were the [...] "love crowd" [...] and looking for a big response. The ballad [...] "I've Been Loving You" [...] followed. The last song was [...] "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. [...] "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert. According to Booker T. Jones, [...] "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there?</b> With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey." [...] According to Sweet Soul Music, musicians such as Brian Jones and Jimi Hendrix were captivated by his performance; Robert Christgau wrote in Esquire, [...] "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yallop {{later said}} he had [...] "mixed emotions" [...] about the tour. [...] "Knowing now {{what it was like}} there, there were certain things they kept from us, certain things we weren't meant to see but did. But {{hindsight}} is a wonderful thing, isn't it? Certainly we enjoyed it while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> But reflecting on it, there's mixed emotions. Disappointing thing, politics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Using {{the same}} tactics they used in {{recording}} Jah Won't Pay the Bills, the band recorded its debut album 40oz. to Freedom in secrecy at the studios at California State University, Dominguez Hills. Nowell recalled, [...] "You weren't {{supposed to be}} in there after 9 p.m., but we'd go in at 9:30 and stay until 5 in the morning. We'd just hide from the security guards. They never knew <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> We managed to get $30,000 worth of studio time for free". 40oz. to Freedom was released in 1992; 60,000 copies were sold.|$|E

[...] More than that, Hurwitz says that he enjoys reaching out to [...] "nerdy" [...] younger fans because they can act as role-models to show that their best days are ahead of them: [...] "We're like a little beacon of hope for losers that are told they're gonna be cool in ten years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Miracles {{bass singer}} Pete Moore told the Cleveland Plain Dealer, [...] "It was {{a slap in}} the face, very disappointing. We are the premier group of Motown. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> before there was a Motown. We set the pace for all the other artists to come after us. We were a little older, and the other artists looked up to us. How could we not be in there?" [...] Moore later stated, [...] "When Terry Stewart [...] called and told me we were to be inducted, he was apologetic," [...] Moore said.

2500|$|In July 2005, Polanski {{successfully}} sued Vanity Fair {{magazine for}} libel after it alleged {{that he had}} tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate's funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, [...] "Of this I can be sure — of his frame of mind when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love — a love that he had lost." [...] At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, [...] "The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin Landau, who portrayed Rollin Hand in the {{original}} series, expressed his own disapproval concerning the film. In an MTV interview in October 2009, Landau stated, [...] "When {{they were working on}} an early incarnation of the first one — not the script they ultimately did — they wanted the entire team to be destroyed, done away with one at a time, and I was against that. It was basically an action-adventure movie and not Mission. Mission was a mind game. The ideal mission was getting in and getting out without anyone ever knowing <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> So the whole texture changed. Why volunteer to essentially have our characters commit suicide? I passed on it ... The script wasn't that good either!" ...|$|E

This allegation was denied by the crew, one of whom stated, [...] "The crew members, whether Filipino or Colombians or Indians, tried {{to the best of}} our ability to help passengers survive the shipwreck. Comments by some of the passengers that we were unhelpful have hurt us." [...] A third engineer officer from the ship's engine room also pointed out that [...] "Unlike the captain, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> until the end. We did all we could to avoid catastrophe." [...] Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi praised the crew and personnel, despite difficulties resulting from the apparent lack of direction from the ship's officers and problems in communication.|$|E
