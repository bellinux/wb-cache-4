From the earliest ages man's mind has found little or no difficulty {{in the idea of}} something essential to the personality, a soul or a spirit or both, existing apart from the body and continuing after the destruction of the body, and being still a person and an individual. From this it is a small step to the thought of a person existing independently of any existing or pre-existing body. That is the idea of theological Christianity, as distinguished from the Christianity of simple faith. The Triune Persons--omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent--exist for all time, superior to and independent of matter. They are supremely disembodied. One became incarnate--as a <b>wind</b> <b>eddy</b> might take up a whirl of dust. [...] . Those who profess modern religion conceive that this is an excessive abstraction of the idea of spirituality, a disembodiment of the idea of personality beyond the limits of the conceivable; nevertheless they accept the conception that a person, a spiritual individual, may be without an ordinary mortal body. [...] . They declare that God is without any specific body, that he is immaterial, that he can affect the material universe--and that means that he can only reach our sight, our hearing, our touch--through the bodies of those who believe in him and serve him.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. The study {{looks into}} the impact of {{harmonic}} distortion on power-plant equipment in general, and then focuses on the impact it has on power transformers operating near the thermal limit. The feasibility {{of the study is}} firstly evaluated and then the theory on harmonics and transformer losses is analysed. The study had been narrowed down to power transformers due to the high numbers of failures nationally and internationally attributed to unknown causes. A transformer model is then developed through theoretical considerations. Finally, a case study is done on the capability of a fully loaded transformer under harmonics conditions evaluated through transformer capability calculations and the proposed transformer model. Thereafter the transformer model developed is verified with measured results. The main impact of harmonic current distortion on power transformers is an increase in the rated power losses that results in a temperature rise inside the power transformer. The heat build-up can lead to degradation of insulation, which can shorten the transformer’s life and lead to eventual breakdown. The harmonic current distortion impacts transformer losses – namely, ohmic losses, the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses and other stray losses. All of these harmonic effects on transformer losses are verified theoretically, mathematically and practically. The harmonic impact on the transformer capability is then evaluated through a numerical example of a transformer feeding a harmonic load. The transformer capability is determined via two methods – namely, harmonic capability calculations in the standard “IEEE Recommended Practice for Establishing Transformer Capability when Supplying Nonsinusoidal Load Currents”, [11] and a proposed transformer model derived from theoretical and mathematical analysis. The results show that an increase in the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses can decrease the maximum permissible nonsinusoidal load current substantially. If the load current of the transformer is derated accordingly it translates into a loss of the output power capacity of the power transformer. The standard recommended capability calculations for <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current losses are conservative and not satisfactorily accurate. This results in a large loss of power capacity. The proposed transformer model includes a parameter that estimates the <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> current loss in the transformer that results in a smaller loss in power capacity. Furthermore, it was shown that the harmonic current distortion levels could exceed the permissible levels although the harmonic voltage distortion levels are within acceptable levels. The proposed transformer equivalent model is thereafter practically verified with experimental results of papers published by M. A. S. Masoum, E. F. Fuchs and D. J. Roesler, [19], [20] and [29]...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} deep stratification and meridional overturning circulation in an idealized single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of <b>wind,</b> <b>eddies,</b> and diapycnal mixing; predicts the deep stratification {{in terms of the}} surface forcing and other problem parameters; makes no assumption of zero residual circulation; and consistently accounts for the interaction between the circumpolar channel {{and the rest of the}} ocean. The theory shows that dynamics of the overturning circulation can be characterized by two limiting regimes, corresponding to weak and strong diapycnal mixing. The transition between the two regimes is described by a nondimensional number characterizing the strength of the diffusion-driven compared to the wind-driven overturning circulation. In the limit of weak diapycnal mixing, deep stratification throughout the ocean is produced by the effects of <b>wind</b> and <b>eddies</b> in a circumpolar channel and maintained even in the limit of vanishing diapycnal diffusivity and in a flat-bottomed ocean. The overturning circulation across the deep stratification is driven by the diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel but is sensitive, through changes in stratification, to the <b>wind</b> and <b>eddies</b> in the channel. In the limit of strong diapycnal mixing, deep stratification is primarily set by eddies in the channel and diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel, with the wind over the circumpolar channel playing a secondary role. Analytical solutions for the deep stratification and overturning circulation in the limit of weak diapycnal mixing and numerical solutions that span the regimes of weak to strong diapycnal mixing are presented. The theory is tested with a coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model configured in an idealized geometry. A series of experiments performed to examine the sensitivity of the deep stratification and the overturning circulation to variations in wind stress and diapycnal mixing compare well with predictions from the theory. 1...|$|R

40|$|The AC loss in a {{transformer}} winding is mainly {{due to the}} sum of the I 2 R losses produced by the fundamental and harmonic components of the current, recognizing that for each component, R depends on the frequency of that component. For lower-order harmonics, the frequency dependence of the winding resistance is primarily due to the proximity effect, a phenomenon that occurs in coils because the magnetic field surrounding each conductor in a coil depends on the fields produced by other conductors. The proximity effect produces greater losses than those predicted by the skin effect, which is dominant at higher frequencies. The proximity effect therefore accounts for the largest contribution to <b>winding</b> <b>eddy</b> currents under harmonic load current.

The key insight of the theory that the Southern Ocean, rather than the tropics, can serve as a pathway for transformation of dense water to light water is supported by the observed distribution of radiocarbon. However, we demonstrate that changes in forcing do more than simply scale the magnitude of the circulation up and down, producing changes in pycnocline shape and circulation geometry. In particular, the roles of buoyancy forcing and stationary eddies are more complicated than would be expected from the simple theory. Such changes must be taken into account when interpreting measurements at individual locations. 1...|$|R

It is appreciated that the computation of any component of stray losses of a transformer is intricate and involves a multitude of variables.

The governing equations have limited use when the conductor thickness is increased; this is observed when thicknesses exceed 5 mm. The analytical method, known as Rabins’ method is implemented in Mathematica to evaluate local flux density quantities. The analytical method is compared to the two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) approach. The FEM methodology {{is found to be}} robust, flexible and fast to compute flux density components. The leakage flux distribution around the circumference of concentric windings is studied.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{theoretical model}} of the meridional overturning circulation and associated deep stratification in an interhemispheric, single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of <b>wind,</b> <b>eddies,</b> and diapycnal mixing, and predicts the deep stratification and overturning streamfunction {{in terms of the}} surface forcing and other parameters of the problem. It relies on a matching among three regions: the circumpolar channel at high southern latitudes, a region of isopycnal outcrop at high northern latitudes and the ocean basin between. The theory describes both the middepth and abyssal cells of a circulation representing North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. It suggests that whereas the strength of the middepth overturning cell is primarily set by the wind stress in the circumpolar channel, mid depth stratification results from a balance between the wind-driven upwelling in the channel and deep water formation at high northern latitudes. Diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior can lead to warming and upwelling warm of deep waters. However, for parameters most representative of the present ocean mixing seems to play a minor role for the middepth cell. In contrast, the abyssal cell is intrinsically diabatic and controlled by a balance between the deep mixing-driven upwelling an...|$|R

Our approach has been to reexamine the circulation {{and structure of the}} thermosphere using the framework of the [Dickinson and Ridley, 1977], symmetric two-dimensional model. Sensitivity tests were conducted to see how large-scale <b>winds,</b> <b>eddy</b> diffusion and conduction, and strong 15 -[mu]m cooling affect day-night contrasts of densities and temperatures. The calculated densities and temperatures are compared to symmetric empirical model fields constructed from the Pioneer Venus data base. We find that the observed day-to-night variation of composition and temperatures can be derived largely by a wave-drag parameterization that gives a circulation system weaker than predicted prior to Pioneer Venus. The calculated mesospheric winds are consistent with Earth-based observations near 115 km. Our studies also suggest that eddy diffusion is only a minor contributor to the maintenance of observed day and nightside densities, and that eddy coefficients are smaller than values used by previous one-dimensional composition models.

CO 2 column amounts from differential absorption lidar are in line with those from FTIR for both paths with a mean residual of the time series of 44 and 34 ppm, respectively. This experiment is a fundamental step forward in the deployment of the differential absorption lidar prototype as a highly portable active remote sensing instrument probing vented CO 2 emissions, including volcanoes...|$|R
