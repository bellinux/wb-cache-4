5000|$|The {{concert was}} {{originally}} planned {{as part of}} a larger tour throughout India by Shankar and Jethro Tull. The Mumbai leg of the tour was originally scheduled for 29 November 2008, three days after the attacks. After they cancelled the concert, the web-based platform A Billion Hands: For a Better Tomorrow, that was founded by Web18's COO Rishi Khiani and supported by Network 18, asked Shankar and Jethro Tull if they would considering holding a benefit concert instead. A Billion Hands Concert took place on 5 December 2008 at Segrams 100 pipers in Mumbai. Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson stated in a press release that, [...] "some people might consider it disrespectful that we are having a concert but hopefully a majority will realise <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> and what it says." [...] Shankar added that: [...] "as a musician, this is how I speak, how I express the anger within me ... our entire tour has been changed by these events and even though the structure of the concert may remain the same, emotionally perhaps we are saying a lot more." [...] Farhad Wadia, CEO, Network 18, stated in response that: [...] "We are very grateful to both Jethro Tull and Ms. Shankar for agreeing to perform at this concert, in spite of the terror attacks and at their splendid contribution towards the victims of the horrific attacks in Mumbai. Though it's a much abused thought, this truly is a reflection of Mumbai's strength and character and its willingness to forge ahead.

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>about</b> Elastic rods are curve-like elastic {{bodies that}} have one {{dimension}} (length) {{much larger than}} the others (cross-section). Their elastic energy breaks down into three contributions: stretching, bending, and twisting. Stretching and bending are captured by the deformation of a space curve called the centerline, while twisting is captured by the rotation of a material frame associated to each point on the centerline. Building on the notions of framed curves, parallel transport, and holonomy, we present a smooth and a corresponding discrete theory that establishes an efficient model for simulating thin flexible rods with arbitrary cross section and undeformed configuration. To large parts, the material herein is an excerpt from [1]. Elastic energy We describe the configuration of a smooth elastic rod by an adapted framed curve Γ = {γ; t, m 1, m 2 }. Here γ(s) is an arc length parameterized space curve describing the rod’s centerline; the assignment of an orthonormal material frame {t(s), m 1 (s), m 2 (s) } to each point on the centerline contains the requisite information for measuring twist. We require the material frame to be adapted to the centerline, i. e., to satisfy t(s) = γ ′ (s). As usual, we refer to κ = t ′ as the centerline’s curvature (normal) vector and to τ = m ′ 1 · m 2 as the material frames twist measuring the rotation of the material around its centerline. The Kirchhoff model of elastic energy of inextensible (no stretching of the centerline) and isotropic (no preferred bending direction) elastic rods is given b...|$|E
