5|$|Any large {{project was}} further delayed by the Franco-Prussian War, in which Bartholdi {{served as a}} major of militia. In the war, Napoleon III was {{captured}} and deposed. Bartholdi's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians, and a more liberal republic was installed in France. As Bartholdi had been planning {{a trip to the}} United States, he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans. In June 1871, Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic, <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> of introduction signed by Laboulaye.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe study pregroup grammars <b>with</b> <b>letter</b> {{promotions}} p(m) ⇒q(n). We {{show that}} the Letter Promotion Problem for pregroups is solvable in polynomial time, if the size of p(n) is counted as |n|+ 1. In Mater and Fix (2005) [13], the problem is shown to be NP-hard, but their proof assumes the binary (or decimal, etc.) representation of n in p(n), which seems less natural for applications. We reduce the problem to a graph-theoretic problem, which is subsequently reduced to the emptiness problem for context-free languages. As a consequence, the following problems are in P: the word problem for pregroups <b>with</b> <b>letter</b> promotions and the membership problem for pregroup grammars <b>with</b> <b>letter</b> promotions. We also prove that pregroup grammars <b>with</b> <b>letter</b> promotions are equivalent to context-free grammars. At the end, we obtain similar results for <b>letter</b> promotions <b>with</b> unit...|$|R

5|$|By {{utilizing}} a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed {{to establish a}} fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, {{but that did not}} come about.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship of morality and libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E

5|$|The plot is {{traditional}} {{in regards to}} Restoration theatre and includes three female characters, three respectable males, three non-respectable males, and three side characters. Each respectable male meets their female counterpart three times, and each has a parallel incident <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> and an unmasking. The primary plot of the play deals with Wisemore and his pursuit of Lady Matchless. With {{the help of his}} friend Merital, Wisemore is able to overcome other lovers and various struggles in order to prove his worth to Matchless and win her love.|$|E
5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.|$|E
5|$|After {{signing the}} truce, Muhammad {{assembled}} an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar, {{known as the}} Battle of Khaybar. This was possibly due to housing the Banu Nadir who were inciting hostilities against Muhammad, or to regain prestige from what appeared as the inconclusive result of the truce of Hudaybiyya. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad also sent letters to many rulers, asking them to convert to Islam (the exact date is given variously in the sources). He sent messengers (<b>with</b> <b>letters)</b> to Heraclius of the Byzantine Empire (the eastern Roman Empire), Khosrau of Persia, the chief of Yemen and to some others. In the years following the truce of Hudaybiyya, Muhammad directed his forces against the Arabs on Transjordanian Byzantine soil in the Battle of Mu'tah.|$|E

5|$|An {{assistant}} of LeHand's, Grace Tully, {{took over}} as Roosevelt's secretary, but was never a companion for Roosevelt {{in the same way}} as LeHand had been. After Missy departed the White House, she never saw FDR again, though he did keep in touch <b>with</b> <b>letters,</b> phone calls and by sending gifts. In the fall of 1941, FDR rewrote his will to leave half of the annual income from his estate (which was eventually probated at more than $3 million) for LeHand's care, and half to Eleanor. The will stated that upon LeHand's death the income would go to Eleanor, with the principal eventually divided equally among his children. As LeHand died before FDR, her half reverted to Eleanor.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed these visits and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|In July 1816, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley {{toured the}} Alps and visited Chamouni (as {{it was then}} known), {{as well as the}} Mer de Glace and the Bossons Glacier. They jointly {{published}} their accounts and letters in a work entitled: History of a Six Weeks' Tour through a part of France, Switzerland, Germany, and Holland; <b>with</b> <b>Letters</b> Descriptive of a Sail Round the Lake of Geneva and of the Glaciers of Chamouni.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the medieval settings featured in previous Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy VI is set {{in what is now}} known as a steampunk environment. The structure of society parallels that of {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, with opera and the fine arts serving as recurring motifs throughout the game, and a level of technology comparable to that of the Second Industrial Revolution. Railroads and steamships are in use, and a coal mining operation is run in the northern town of Narshe. Additionally, several examples of modern engineering and weaponry (such as a chainsaw and drill) have been developed in the Kingdom of Figaro. However, communication systems have not reached significant levels of development, <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> sent by way of carrier pigeon serving as the most common means of long-distance communication.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} Rimsky-Korsakov's dismissal, a student {{production}} of his opera Kashchey the Deathless was followed {{not with the}} scheduled concert but with a political demonstration, {{which led to a}} police ban on Rimsky-Korsakov's work. Due in part to widespread press coverage of these events, an immediate wave of outrage against the ban arose throughout Russia and abroad; liberals and intellectuals deluged the composer's residence <b>with</b> <b>letters</b> of sympathy, and even peasants who had not heard a note of Rimsky-Korsakov's music sent small monetary donations. Several faculty members of the St. Petersburg Conservatory resigned in protest, including Glazunov and Lyadov. Eventually, over 300 students walked out of the Conservatory in solidarity with Rimsky-Korsakov. By December he had been reinstated under a new director, Glazunov; Rimsky-Korsakov retired from the Conservatory in 1906. The political controversy continued with his opera The Golden Cockerel. Its implied criticism of monarchy, Russian imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War gave it little chance of passing the censors. The premiere was delayed until 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death, and even then it was performed in an adapted version.|$|E
