5|$|The Beechwood estate also {{contained}} a carriage house, gatehouse, squash court (no longer extant), and a white-stucco artist's studio named Beech Twig, which {{was home to}} author John Cheever, <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> attended the school on the property. The family rented the house until they moved to Ossining. Descriptions of the building's interior closely match descriptions employed by Cheever in some short stories. Novelist Richard Yates also {{lived in the same}} house as a child, as well as other artists, writers, and composers. The estate's garage is located northeast of the mansion, and is a flat-roof, two-story concrete building dating to the early 1900s.|$|E
5|$|In November 2003, Webber {{organised}} and {{competed in}} a 10-day trek across Tasmania {{to raise funds}} for children's cancer research charities. Starting in Marrawah on the state's west coast, the trek involved 1,000km of cycling, kayaking and trekking along the southern coast and finished at Coles Bay in the east. Four teams of four competitors each started the trek, with only two teams (including Webber's) completing the entire journey. Along the way, Australian sporting stars Pat Rafter (tennis), Steve Waugh (cricket), Cathy Freeman (athletics), James Tomkins (rowing), Guy Andrews (iron man), and actor Joel Edgerton completed certain parts of the trek. The challenge concluded with a black tie dinner and auction to raise funds. Webber said he was driven to organise the event {{after the death of his}} grandfather to cancer, as well as his experiences with friends <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> had battled the disease.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured {{and held in}} a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, {{a group of women}} <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.|$|E

25|$|A Halin graph is a {{planar graph}} formed from a planar-embedded tree (with no degree-two vertices) by {{connecting}} {{the leaves of}} the tree into a cycle. Every Halin graph can be realized by a polyhedron in which this cycle forms a horizontal base face, every other face lies directly above the base face (as in the polyhedra realized through lifting), and every face has the same slope. Equivalently, the straight skeleton of the base face is combinatorially equivalent to the tree from which the Halin graph was formed. The proof of this result uses induction: any rooted tree may reduced to a smaller tree by removing the leaves from an internal node <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> are all leaves, the Halin graph formed from the smaller tree has a realization by the induction hypothesis, and it is possible to modify this realization in order to add any number of leaf children to the tree node <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> were removed.|$|E

25|$|Holle assumes {{control of}} the ship and executes the head mutineer, but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his {{piloting}} skills to land on Earth III, a cold tidally locked planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere and a red dwarf sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously: since children weigh little, many will fit on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, <b>whose</b> <b>children</b> are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely on a lake and they prepare to settle on their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to conduct a survey of the planetary system and beyond until they die.|$|E
