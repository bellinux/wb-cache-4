50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the faying surfaces of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot welding, seam welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the <b>welding</b> <b>pressure</b> that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{a study of}} mechanical properties of the wood end-grain welding of spruce wood. The shear properties of butt joints of spruce at different pressure and welding time were studied. Between all the parameters of spruce welding, the <b>welding</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is one of the}} most important in relation to the mechanical properties. Thus, a good joint strength was obtained for spruce wood at high pressure. An increase of shear strength is observed with an increase in <b>welding</b> <b>pressure.</b> It is clear that at high pressure the welded material becomes more rigid and this is also coupled to the to the more extensive condensation reaction of lignin. The defibration tendency in end-grain-to-end-grain welding indicates that wood spruce welding is possible and yields sufficient joint strength. The welded interphase in end-grain-to-end-grain spruce welding appears possible and gives a joint with an anatomical appearance of a “natural” fingerjoint. Such “natural” fingerjoints can give equivalent than glued fingerjoints. The advantages of the end-grain-to-end-grain welding are then the very short time of processing, the dispensation of preparing the fingerjoint profiles and to avoid the use of adhesives...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper gives a {{description}} of an experimental study on the ultrasonic welding of metals. In ultrasonic metal welding, high frequency vibrations are combined with pressure to join two materials together quickly and securely, without generating large amount of heat. Horn, {{a key part of}} ultrasonic welding machine, should be designed very accurately to get the natural frequencies and vibration mode required. In this study, a horn is designed and developed for ultrasonic welding of Cu sheets. The tensile strength of welded parts is investigated for evaluation of weldability.

Samples are Cu sheets of 0. 1 mm thickness.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} and experimental {{analyses of the}} friction <b>welding</b> <b>pressure</b> influence on the plastic deformation level {{and the quality of}} the friction welded joint are presented in this paper. The joint of the tempering and the High-Speed steel was realized by the friction welding. The objective was to relate the two basic process parameters - the friction and compacting pressures - to plastic deformation parameters during the friction welding of two the steels. The fact that materials are dissimilar additionally complicates the welding procedure and its analysis. The friction welding is a specific and complex process, since in the joint zone material is heated and plasticized with necessary action of the multi-step pressure to realize the joint. The total deformations in the axial and radial directions are directly dependent on the applied <b>welding</b> <b>pressure.</b> Considering that geometry and shape of the friction welded joint directly depend on the friction pressure, some welded joints' basic shapes obtained with various pressures are presented.
