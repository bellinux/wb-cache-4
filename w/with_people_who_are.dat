Those who are high in agreeableness are more likely to use conflict-avoidant tactics when in conflict with others (whereas people low in agreeableness are more likely to use coercive tactics). They are also more willing to give ground to their adversary and may lose arguments <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> less agreeable. From their perspective, they have not really lost an argument as much as maintained a congenial relationship with another person.|$|E
25|$|Thinking {{and feeling}} are the {{decision-making}} (judging) functions. The thinking and feeling functions are both {{used to make}} rational decisions, based on the data received from their information-gathering functions (sensing or intuition). Those who prefer thinking tend to decide things from a more detached standpoint, measuring the decision by what seems reasonable, logical, causal, consistent, and matching a given set of rules. Those who prefer feeling tend to come to decisions by associating or empathizing with the situation, looking at it 'from the inside' and weighing the situation to achieve, on balance, the greatest harmony, consensus and fit, considering {{the needs of the}} people involved. Thinkers usually have trouble interacting <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> inconsistent or illogical, and tend to give very direct feedback to others. They are concerned with the truth and view it as more important.|$|E

The findings provide evidence that women perceive email as more useful than men do when communicating <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> geographically distant. Aside from that difference, this study suggests that male and female college students use and perceive email and instant messaging in a similar manner. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference between men’s and women’s perceptions of email or instant messaging usefulness and frequency of use when communicating <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> geographically close.

500|$|... "Chimes of Freedom" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{performed}} by Bob Dylan and featured on his 1964 album Another Side of Bob Dylan (see 1964 in music), produced by Tom Wilson. It was written in early 1964 and {{was influenced by the}} symbolist poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. The song depicts the feelings and thoughts of the singer and his companion as they wait out a lightning storm under a doorway. The singer expresses his solidarity <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> downtrodden or otherwise treated unjustly, and believes that the thunder is tolling in sympathy for them. Music critic Paul Williams has described the song as Dylan's Sermon on the Mount. The song has been covered many times by different artists, including The Byrds, Jefferson Starship, Youssou N'Dour, Bruce Springsteen, and U2.|$|E

And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life.

The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working <b>with</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever.

Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997.

Wahabi said that the Israeli Foreign Ministry would send letters of complaint to the government of Qatar and Al Jazeera. Officials of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' Fatah party also accuse Al Jazeera of being biased in favour of Hamas, with which it is at political loggerheads, and prominent Fatah official and former Gaza strongman Mohammed Dahlan has organized a lawsuit against the broadcaster.|$|E
