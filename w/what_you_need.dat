500|$|Initially, {{the film}} was {{rejected}} by every major studio in Hollywood, mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering. Eventually Paramount agreed to finance the film, with Lucas negotiating a five-picture deal. By April 1980, Kasdan's fifth draft was produced, and production {{was getting ready to}} shoot at Elstree Studios, with Lucas trying to keep costs down. With four illustrators, Raiders of the Lost Ark was Spielberg's most storyboarded film of his career to date, further helping the film economically. He and Lucas agreed on a tight schedule to keep costs down and to follow the [...] "quick and dirty" [...] feel of the old Saturday matinée serials. Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. [...] "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> no waste", Spielberg said. [...] "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." ...|$|E

He has also noted similarities between {{the first half of}} the film, particularly in early versions of the script, to H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, [...] "not in storyline, but in dread-building mystery", and calls the finished film [...] "the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, without being a Lovecraft adaptation", due to its similarities in tone and atmosphere to Lovecraft's works. In 2009, O'Bannon said the film was [...] "strongly influenced, tone-wise, by Lovecraft, and one of the things it proved is that you can't adapt Lovecraft effectively without an extremely strong visual style ... <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> is a cinematic equivalent of Lovecraft's prose."

In the same article, Chiba recalls thinking, [...] "Okay, you're asking a lot of yourself. You're giving up a lot at once." [...] Chiba further explained that [...] "anyone who understands drug abuse knows that you use drugs to hide from your past or sedate yourself from strong, overwhelming feelings. So when you're newly clean and coming off the medications that have been masking all those feelings, that's when you're the most vulnerable."

500|$|De Fratus is {{a devout}} Roman Catholic who, {{though he was}} raised in a large Catholic family, {{struggled}} with his faith after an injury early in his career, but ultimately determined the injury was a gift from God to help him better understand his faith: [...] "I really feel that the setback was God telling me, ‘Hey you are not done. [...] You are not done yet figuring out <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to figure out, and I am {{going to give you a}} little more time.’ [...] There is a big reason why that injury happened and I feel that I used it as best as I could have." [...] He noted that he would like to take classes at a seminary to help proselytize to others. Early in his professional career, he struggled to find fellow Catholics, and noted that most of his teammates were either Protestants or not religious. Moreover, in many small towns that house minor league teams, there are no Catholic churches, so De Fratus found it easy to slide away from leading a Catholic lifestyle. However, upon realizing that there is more to life than material success, he discovered a need for God, and has thus developed his faith. Aside from his faith, he enjoys writing and recording music, and playing the guitar. He has two brothers, the older of whom, Steve, played in the minor leagues, and the younger of whom, Chris, caught a foul ball during De Fratus's major league debut.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the season, {{speculation}} intensified {{about which}} players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] In November, Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL. [...] In December, sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season. [...] Quan Cosby, who spent three years in professional baseball, was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork. [...] Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season. [...] Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said, [...] "We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible {{when it comes to the}} NFL. We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back, but if you're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect, going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to work on to improve your status." [...] Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft. [...] After the Holiday Bowl Charles said, [...] "Right now, I’m probably coming back. I didn’t think I did that good in the game. Next year maybe I’ll be up for the Heisman. I will come back." [...] From 2000–2007, the Longhorns have had sevenplayers taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft, more than any other school.|$|E

500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't really seen each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
