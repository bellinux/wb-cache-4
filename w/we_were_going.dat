5|$|The general {{opinion was}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to remain in}} the ghetto {{until the end of the}} war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then {{everything}} would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto– it was illusion.|$|E
5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E

5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So we started the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

500|$|In early 1965, Caesar and Cleo {{began calling}} {{themselves}} Sonny & Cher. Following {{the recording of}} [...] "I Got You Babe", they traveled to England in July 1965 at the Rolling Stones' advice; Cher recalled, [...] " [...] had told us... that Americans just didn't get us and that if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make it big, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to have to go}} to England." [...] According to writer Cintra Wilson, [...] "English newspaper photographers showed up when S were thrown out of the London Hilton [...] the night they arrived—literally overnight, they were stars.

500|$|Meg loves peppermints, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to call {{ourselves}} The Peppermints. But {{since our}} last name was White, {{we decided to}} call it [...] "The White Stripes".

500|$|In early 2009, Leto told Billboard that he {{was excited}} by the song {{as soon as he}} wrote it.

500|$|Henderson finally conceded his [...] "official retirement" [...] on July 13, 2007: [...] "I haven't {{submitted}} retirement {{papers to}} MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired."

500|$|One notable {{feature of}} Contact is {{its use of}} digital color correction. This {{approach}} helped solve continuity errors during the location shooting at the Very Large Array in New Mexico. [...] "The weather killed us, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> back in and changing it enough so that the skies and colors and times of day all seem roughly the same," [...] visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston commented.|$|E
500|$|..... the {{discovery}} of the Hitler diaries offered so tempting a scoop that we all wanted to believe they were genuine.

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} July 2007 in Jordan and Kuwait. Temperatures averaged [...] over the 44 days of shooting.

The producer Greg Shapiro spoke about security concerns of filming in Jordan, [...] "It was interesting telling people <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to make the movie in Jordan because the first question everybody asked was about the security situation here." ...|$|E

500|$|Shooting on {{location}} in New York City also added to Mackendrick’s anxieties. Exteriors were shot in the busiest, noisiest areas with crowds of young Tony Curtis fans occasionally breaking through police barriers. Mackendrick remembered, [...] "We started shooting in Times Square at rush hour, and we had high-powered actors and a camera crane and police help {{and all the rest}} of it, but we didn’t have any script. We knew where <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> vaguely, but that’s all".|$|E

When asked, in 2010, about giving a song to Minogue, he stated that it would be [...] "amazing".|$|E
500|$|While Juskalian {{was held}} in Nuremberg, the Americans began their {{bombardment}} of the city.

500|$|Alarmed, Kennedy {{considered}} various reactions, {{and ultimately}} {{responded to the}} installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade and presented an ultimatum to the Soviets.

Castro later admitted that [...] "I would have agreed {{to the use of}} nuclear weapons. ... we took it for granted that it would become a nuclear war anyway, and that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to disappear." ...|$|E
500|$|Anodyne was Uncle Tupelo's only {{recording}} {{to appear}} on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart. Despite the lack of a single to promote the album, sales eventually surpassed 150,000 copies. A promotional tour for the album began later that year, including a sold-out show at Tramps in New York City. Most shows on the tour sold over one thousand tickets. The success of the tour encouraged the label; according to Sire executive Bill Bentley, [...] "people here thought <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have platinum records from Uncle Tupelo." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{days later}} the All Blacks faced Newport at the city's Athletic Ground.
