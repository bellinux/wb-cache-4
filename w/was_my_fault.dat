500|$|In retrospect, Biden {{would take}} the blame for his {{mistakes}} during the campaign. [...] On one, he said, [...] "All I had to say was 'Like Kinnock.' If I'd just said those two words, 'Like Kinnock,' and I didn't. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> nobody else's fault." [...] On another, he ruefully recalled, [...] "'Hey pal, you want to compare IQs?' What an immature thing to say." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, {{he looked at me}} as if he thought it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, It was like I said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} enough, sir," [...] said the boy. [...] "Would to God you {{had left me}} where you found me![Endnote: 4] It <b>was</b> not <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that you took me from the alms-house. But it will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> if I ever eat another bit of your bread, or stay under your roof an hour longer." ...|$|R

500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and then I saw him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
500|$|In the 1985 season, {{the team}} {{improved}} further, posting an 11–5 record {{and making the}} playoffs as a wild card team. They {{went on to become}} the first team in NFL history to advance to the Super Bowl by winning three playoff games on the road, defeating the New York Jets 26–14, the Los Angeles Raiders 27–20, and the Miami Dolphins 31–14. It was the first time the Patriots had beaten the Dolphins at the Orange Bowl (Miami's then-home stadium) since 1966, Miami's first season as a franchise. The Patriots had lost to the Dolphins there 18 consecutive times, including a 30–27 loss in Week 15 of the regular season. Despite their success in the playoffs, the Patriots were heavy underdogs to the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX. They lost 46–10 in what was at the time the most lopsided defeat in Super Bowl history. [...] "We couldn't protect the quarterback, and that <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I couldn't come up with a system to handle the Bears' pass rush", Berry acknowledged.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} known more before I let him come here and {{encouraged}} you to think of him. It has <b>been</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> <b>My</b> dear, will you not forgive me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>was</b> all <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> anyway," [...] {{replied the}} girl, {{with a little}} tremor in her voice, [...] "and it <b>was</b> all <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> to-night, too. I no {{business}} to 'a' gone off an' left him that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blanche is {{a little}} odd," [...] Mannering answered. [...] "I am afraid that it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> Here <b>are</b> the Redfords. I wonder if they would join us." ...|$|R
500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she had gone with him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aberdeen is {{mentioned}} in Under the Lake, the third {{episode of the}} ninth series of the popular science fiction show Doctor Who. Looking to portray a socially acceptable level of empathy, The Doctor flips {{through a series of}} cue cards. One of the cards reads, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> I should have known you didn't live in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Father Brown; [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I just sent {{him down the}} road to {{investigate}} something--that I just thought worth investigating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None--none--none, by Heaven!--Why, thou {{suspicious}} wretch, must I swear, {{to quell}} your scruples?--On the contrary, it shall not <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault,</b> if we <b>are</b> not on decent terms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mostyn," [...] she said, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I {{do not ask}} {{for your}} forgiveness. I have behaved shamefully, but I was miserable, and I forgot. Mr. Ducaine is blameless. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> fault." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter with Nebraska {{trailing}} by 6, Coach Callahan called {{what seemed to be}} a sweep play similar to ones they had used earlier in the game. However, when running back Marlon Lucky got the pitch, he threw a [...] touchdown pass to Nate Swift. The extra point gave Nebraska a one-point lead with 4:54 left in the game. Texas safety Aaron Ross took responsibility for over-pursuing on the run; [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> The receiver did a great job pretending like he was blocking, I came down to force on the run, and they beat us deep." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged in}} May 2009 that an RAF {{commander}} destroyed {{a number of}} official documents after the loss of Nimrod XV230. The Times newspaper, 31 May 2009, reported that all documents relating to the aircraft were immediately impounded but Sqn Ldr Guy Bazalgette, commander of the Nimrod detachment in the Gulf, managed to retrieve one file. Bazalgette subsequently destroyed the document but later told the coroners inquest {{that none of the}} shredded documents were relevant to the loss of XV230. However, Bazalgette admitted: [...] "They should not have been shredded and it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> that they were." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other was}} the Davis Cup {{in the semifinals}} against Spain in Málaga, where the two top Argentine players Guillermo Coria and David Nalbandian were {{unavailable}} due to injury. An out-of-form Gaudio was called up along with Agustín Calleri, Mariano Zabaleta, and Lucas Arnold. Although Gaudio had a 4–0 singles record from the first round and quarterfinals coming into the semifinals, Spain won 3–2, with Gaudio Gaudio losing both of his singles matches. In the first rubber against Juan Carlos Ferrero, he lost 14 {{games in a row}} in a 4–6, 0–6, 0–6 defeat. In the fifth and deciding rubber against Carlos Moyà, he lost, 1–6, 4–6, 2–6, and was roundly criticised back in Argentina for these performances. [...] "When I returned to Buenos Aires after playing Davis Cup in Moscow and Málaga, you had the impression it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> and that hurt me," [...] he said. He finished the year ranked No. 34.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see it now,' she said, {{holding his}} hand between both of hers. 'It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I fostered our family pride. May God take away the sin from us both!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! yes, I see," [...] said Mrs. Lyddell, [...] "but {{you will}} soon be at home here. It shall not <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> or your cousins' if you are not,--eh, Caroline?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault</b> if I {{keep you}} here longer!" [...] he answered. [...] "We must reach a {{telephone}} and send word out. Something {{may have happened}} to your father." ...|$|R
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made of Wallace's fondness for the colour pink. Shortly after being elected, while {{referring}} to Mary Mitchell O'Connor in Dáil Éireann, he said [...] "Miss Piggy has toned it down a bit today". He accepted full responsibility and later apologised, saying [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>fault.</b> I passed the reference because of her handbag. I'm completely out of order. I don't have a leg to stand on [...] Clearly it was in bad taste." [...] He called Mitchell O'Connor to apologise and said he would write a letter of apology to her as well. In reference to his fondness for pink, Wallace dyed his hair that colour to raise awareness of cancer in February 2015. Since being elected to the Dáil {{together for the first time}} in 2011, Wallace and Dublin North TD Clare Daly have become friends and political allies, and have worked together on many campaigns, including opposition to austerity and revelations of various alleged Garda malpractices, including harassment, cancellation of penalty points in questionable circumstances and involvement of officers in the drug trade. In July 2014 they were both arrested at Shannon Airport while trying to inspect a military aircraft. Wallace said, [...] "All we wanted to do was confirm whether we are being told the truth." [...] Wallace was fined €2,000 for being in an airside area without permission, and chose not to pay. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison in default, and in December 2015 was arrested for non-payment of the fine.|$|E
