500|$|Blood {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{in the same way}} as the first two OSI albums. Matheos and Moore worked together on the album long-distance, mainly by emailing each other files. Matheos would send Moore song ideas, [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs," [...] Moore said. [...] "Then I ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> and I mess around, complete a verse and add a chorus, do editing, add some vocals, and send it back to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Once Texas {{switched}} to the zone read offense, they quickly started gaining yards and points. Charles ran for a career-high 290yards, including 216yards and threelong touchdown runs in the fourthquarter. [...] His tally also set a new record for rushing against the Cornhuskers, surpassing the old record of 247yards by Oklahoma’s Billy Simms. [...] Charles explained [...] "It was my time to show everyone <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> [...] When I saw a hole, I blasted through it." [...] Texas finished with 181yards passing and 364yards rushing; Nebraska had 315yards passing and 132yards rushing. [...] The running back was named the Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week.|$|E
500|$|Of the film's {{success with}} Western audiences, Miike {{states that he}} was not surprised, but that he had [...] "no idea {{what goes on in the}} minds of people in the West and I don't pretend to know what their tastes are. And I don't want to start {{thinking}} about that. It's nice that they liked my movie, but I'm not going to start deliberately worrying about why or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to make it happen again". Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E

500|$|Sanctus Real's main genre is {{typically}} labeled as Christian rock and alternative CCM. Their first three independent albums were described by Allmusic as power pop. Say It Loud {{was characterized by}} increased guitars and a powerful modern rock style. Their second release, Fight the Tide, was described as [...] "melodic power rock" [...] with similarities to Foo Fighters, Jimmy Eat World, Switchfoot, U2, and PFR. The band's music on The Face of Love blended the styles from their previous two albums, evolving into less of a heavier rock sound. With We Need Each Other, lead singer Matt Hammitt noted that he [...] "just pushed the limits of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> vocally" [...] during some songs, [...] "whether it be on a soft, kind of rustic sounding vocal or whether it be this overdriven, rock high-range kind of vocal." ...|$|E
500|$|For Dicen Que Soy, George picked {{songs that}} had been {{previously}} recorded by female Latin singers such as Rocío Jurado and Lupita D'Alessio, {{with a focus on}} feminist lyrics. George, India, and Shirley Marte also wrote love songs ("Dejate Amar" [...] and [...] "No Me Conviene") for the album and added India's cover of George Benson's song [...] "I Just Want to Hang Around You" [...] as a counterbalance, in case the feminist songs did not prove popular. When describing the production, India said that [...] "This is me, my flavor in a tropical way, and showing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with my voice." [...] The theme of the title track's lyrics revolves the singer being criticized by gossips without caring about their opinions. Puerto Rican singer Tito Nieves is featured on the song [...] "No Me Conviene" [...] and [...] "Vivir lo Nuestro" [...] was included as a bonus track for the album. [...] Musically, the production mixes romantic and hard salsa music along with funk and timba. The record took four months to complete.|$|E
500|$|Nutter joined Conference National side Lincoln City on a free {{transfer}} in July 2011. Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and we have to show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter would add to his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E

500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was {{one of those guys who}} could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E
2500|$|Peterson {{believed}} he was a player that a franchise could build around. In an interview with IGN following the NFL Draft, he said, [...] "I'm a player who is coming in with the determination to turn a team around. I want to help my team get to the playoffs, win...and run wild. I want to bring people to the stands. I want {{people to come to}} the game to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> next. Things like that can change the whole attitude of an organization. I want to win." [...] He later told the Star Tribune in an interview, [...] "I want to be the best player to ever play this game." [...] Nearly three months after being drafted, he was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2007. His contract was worth $40.5 million over five years, with $17 million guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)."

2500|$|At {{the close}} of my sophomore year [...] my Greek {{professor}} [...] asked me to teach the course in elementary physics in the preparatory department during the next year. To my reply that I did not know any physics at all, his answer was, [...] "Anyone who can do well in my Greek can teach physics." [...] "All right," [...] said I, [...] "you {{will have to take}} the consequences, but I will try and see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with it." [...] I at once purchased an Avery's Elements of Physics, and spent the greater part of my summer vacation of 1889 at home – trying to master the subject. [...] I doubt if I have ever taught better in my life than in my first course in physics in 1889. I was so intensely interested in keeping my knowledge ahead of that of the class that they may have caught some of my own interest and enthusiasm.|$|E
2500|$|As {{literary}} critics grew increasingly scornful of Tate, his version still remained [...] "the {{starting point for}} performances on the English-speaking stage." [...] John Philip Kemble, in 1809, even dropped some of Garrick's earlier restorations of Shakespeare, and returned several passages to Tate. The play was suppressed for several {{years prior to the}} death of King George III in 1820, as its focus on a mad king suggested an unfortunate resemblance to the situation of the reigning monarch. But in 1823, Kemble's rival, Edmund Kean (who had previously acted Tate's Lear), [...] "stimulated by Hazlitt's remonstrances and Charles Lamb's essays," [...] became the first to restore the tragic ending, though much of Tate remained in the earlier acts. [...] "The London audience," [...] Kean told his wife, [...] "have no notion of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> till they see me over the dead body of Cordelia." [...] Kean played the tragic Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as [...] "deeply affecting", and with regret, he reverted to Tate.|$|E
2500|$|In , Dean Cain {{played the}} first live-action Superman {{affected}} by the changes to the character after Crisis on Infinite Earths, and various elements on the series reference The Man of Steel mini-series, which heavily influenced the show. This is the first live-action Superman series that showed Clark Kent as his [...] "real" [...] persona and Superman as the constructed alter-ego. As he explained to Lois in the second-season episode [...] "Tempus Fugitive", [...] "Superman is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> Clark is who I am." [...] As the title implies, Clark is the primary identity with Superman making more sporadic appearances. The Lois and Clark version reverses the traditional hairstyle distinction between Clark Kent and Superman; here it is Superman who has slicked-back hair and Clark whose fringe falls more naturally. In neither mode does the character feature his trademark spitcurl, {{making it one of}} the few depictions of Superman to lack this distinctive feature. His full name was changed from the comic strip adaptations to Clark Jerome Kent.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Hill {{committed}} {{to one of}} her greatest ambitions: photocopying the Palace of Versailles. She cited four reasons for this venture: 1) she considered Versailles to be simultaneously [...] "self-centered" [...] and [...] "public-spirited"; 2) it shared connections between the United States and France, and she considered herself to be a citizen of both countries; 3) she wanted to [...] "do something big"; 4) she wanted to see what [...] "a modern device would make of something old." [...] Additionally, she explained, [...] "I conceived the idea of photocopying the château of Versailles because, among other reasons, it is so well known through painting and photography. It gives me a dramatic opportunity to show the difference between those disciplines and that of copying. The great variety of subject matter would allow full range to the copier's artistic capacity within a single framework." [...] She copied a bellpull, cobblestones, and a pear tree, roots and live worms included, all of which were pulled from Versailles. Her work with Versailles further introduced her experimentation with colored toner, frottage, and photogravure. Hill intended to have several exhibitions of her Versailles work, including shows titled Weeds, Worms, Water and Popsicle Sticks, Stone and Iron, Walls and Words, and Lace and Glass. Nevertheless, Hill insisted, [...] "I am not interested in Copy Art per se but rather in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> with a copier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
