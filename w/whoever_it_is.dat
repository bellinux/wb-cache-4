5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets up {{from his}} chair and starts leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens in}} Havana, Cuba. Keith (Enrico Colantoni) surprises a now-bearded Duncan (Teddy Dunn), who denies killing Lilly (Amanda Seyfried). At school, Veronica avoids Logan, but that night, Logan {{shows up at}} Veronica's door. Logan apologizes for owning GHB before Veronica informs him about her rape. Logan denies being her rapist, but Veronica says she'll punish <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> even if it's Logan. Veronica talks to Meg (Alona Tal) about the party, and she {{mentions}} seeing Veronica being harassed by some boys before she left. Keith returns Duncan to the Kanes before threatening Clarence Wiedman (Christopher B. Duncan). Veronica approaches Luke (Sam Huntington) about a trip to Tijuana {{to pick up some}} GHB; he admits getting the drugs, but he says that he gave them to Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen). Luke states that Madison Sinclair was seen writing [...] "slut" [...] on Veronica's car after the party. Veronica confronts Madison, who says that she defaced Veronica's car because she made out with Dick, her boyfriend. However, Veronica doesn't remember this incident due to the effects of the drugs. Veronica attempts to barge in on a fight between Keith and Alicia over Wallace's involvement in the Wiedman case, but her intervention does nothing to defuse the situation. Veronica talks to Casey, who confirms the make out sessions with Dick and Cassidy, and Veronica was also forced to make out with Shelly for the boys' amusement.|$|E

60|$|A dark figure {{crossed the}} {{compound}} diagonally {{from the beach}} gate, where <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> had been watching the vessel.|$|R
6000|$|... "Someone {{has tried}} to force this also. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> has failed {{to make his way}} in. He must have been a very poor burglar." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{the door}} opened. Shifting his eyes he {{discovered}} a dim {{shadow in the}} opening. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> stood motionless until a low, clear voice asked sharply: ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Go {{into the}} parlour, sir,’ said Agnes to her companion. ‘You will get there, before <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> {{gets to the}} top of the kitchen stairs.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Guyot's {{dying of}} fever this time, sure, his nigger said. There's no other white man within marching distance; but <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{is coming up}} the stairs!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the conductor, the chauffeur, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{that drives}} the old bus up and down. Have they run out of petrol, or broke the mainspring, or what?" ...|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA (threateningly). <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> let my enemies {{beware of}} her. Look to it, Rufio, you who dare make the Queen of Egypt a fool before Caesar.|$|R
60|$|That, I think, {{is about}} the way the film would run. When <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{finished}} I must get President Shurman, or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> to come and see it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then the murderer, or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> {{first took}} off this ring {{you call the}} nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and {{afterwards}} put the nugget ring back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] said Mrs. Blyth. [...] "The visitor {{has come}} in, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> It can't be Mr. Gimble, Valentine; he always runs up two stairs at a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton {{stood up}} and {{straightened}} himself to his full height, while his voice trembled a little as he said, [...] "Then I think <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> is going to save us yet." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> at {{the door}} is {{knocking}} now with her clenched hand against the hard wood, and it is wonderful, though she knocks so low, how the sound echoes through the empty kitchens.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better say, and be quick, too. I can't wait. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> I shan't {{tell him}} you told me. And I shan't tell Kay. So now you can go ahead. Who was it?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{companion}} turned full round, {{and glared}} at <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> who had spoken. The change in him was quite remarkable. His lips were drawn back from his teeth; he frowned; the scar on his temple had reddened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{that shot}} the arrow may return {{to try his}} fortune a second time, {{and here in the}} open his darts cannot reach us." [...] Then he set her down upon the grass and stood looking at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{your hair}} on! We mustn't {{make a fuss}} about the biznai. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> he's kept quiet or we'd have seen him," [...] said Stalky. [...] "We'll walk round and sniff about till we're sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now, this is tall talk, sir," [...] said O'Leary; [...] "the {{long and}} short of it is, what will the cove, yourself, or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that you speak for, come down for one way or another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DE LEVIS. [Looking {{from one}} to the other--with sudden anger] You seem to think--! What was I to do? Take it lying down and let <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> get clear off? I suppose it's natural to want my money back? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "S'tira said that's the way {{she knew}} you was from Willoughby Pastures. Her folks is from up that way, themselves. She says the minute she heard the name she knew it couldn't 'a' be'n you, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done it." ...|$|R
60|$|He told Mr. Robins, the City Smith, That he had procur'd him a small Job, {{and that}} <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{that put the}} Spikes on the Condemn'd-Hold was an honest Man, for a better peice of Metal, says he, I never wrought upon in my Life.|$|R
50|$|The real Jack and Jill are {{imprisoned in}} Lorton where Gary Soneji was imprisoned. A {{few days later}} {{the two of them}} are found dead due to poisoning. A flesh and blood is found under Jeanne's fingernails, meaning that they were murdered and that they fought <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{does not}} seem to notice who is waiting on him to-night, but {{inclines}} his head slightly to <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> as she takes her place {{at the back of his}} chair. LADY MARY respectfully places the menu-shell before him, and he glances at it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} about the property, sir;--although it was all my own. Nobody has lost {{anything}} but myself; and I really don't see why the thing should not die out, as I don't care about it. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> they may have it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so; but <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> {{they are}} regular troubadours, and I'm delighted. I know the gloves {{will bring us}} fun of some kind. Do you take one and I'll take the other, and see who will find the baron first. Isn't it odd that they knew our names?" ...|$|E
50|$|The High duke {{generally}} {{had his own}} principality (province, dukedom), {{which he}} had inherited within his own branch of the Piast dynasty, and left to his personal heirs within his own branch, whereas Kraków followed the seniorate (fell to the oldest of them). Kraków was a substantial addition to {{the resources of the}} incumbent, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> and was intended to put him higher in might than his vassal dukes.|$|R
6000|$|... “If {{you could}} imagine all that {{you might as well}} imagine cattle on the further bank and keep on calling them home, Mary-fashion, across the sands of Dee. Or you might change the river to the Yarrow and imagine <b>it</b> <b>was</b> on the top of you, and say you <b>were</b> Willie, or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> drowned in Yarrow.” ...|$|R
50|$|Both sides however agree that, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that {{exploded}} amidst German tanks on June 26, 1941, the pilot's motivation {{will never be}} truly known. No radio transmissions were received from the aircraft, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> most unlikely {{that it had a}} radio, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> impossible to know if the ramming of the German column was deliberate or accidental.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ecod,' muttered the orphan, 'not before it's time neither. <b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> has knocked three times, {{and each}} one loud enough to wake the--' {{he had such a}} repugnance to the idea of waking the Dead, that he stopped even then with the words upon his tongue, and said, instead, 'the Seven Sleepers.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's right too. Of {{course she}} knows there's somebody. She ain't such a fool as {{to think that}} I'm out at these hours to sing psalms {{with a lot of}} young women. She says that <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ought to speak out his mind. There;--that's what she says. And she's right. A girl has to mind herself, though she's ever so fond of a young man.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is strange, Bonchamp," [...] Cathelineau said to that officer, [...] "for I {{certainly}} did not send anyone. I never thought of defending the passage of that stream. However, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> who has commanded has done us great service, for that three hours which have been gained will make all the difference. They cannot arrive, now, until after dark, and will not attack before morning; and by that time, our force will have doubled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{him to call}} {{up again}} in ten minutes," [...] he heard her say, and the {{masculine}} pronoun caused in him a flashing twinge of jealousy. Well, he decided, <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> Burning Daylight {{would give him a}} run for his money. The marvel to him was that a girl like Dede hadn't been married long since.|$|R
60|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> who thus moved silently {{out of the}} shadows--spy {{or merely}} indiscreet listener--would pay with his life for the {{knowledge}} which he had obtained. These men here {{could no longer afford}} to take any risks. The words spoken by Stoutenburg and registered by them all could be made the stepping stones to the scaffold if strange ears had caught their purport.|$|R
60|$|This last {{came near}} home, and stirred up the minds {{that would have}} cared for little else. Just as four hundred years before, Jack Straw was an {{imaginary}} champion whose name inflamed the people to rise, so now Jack Swing, or <b>whoever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> who acted in that name, sent messages round that such and such a place should be attacked at such and such a time.|$|R
