5|$|Three men {{sought the}} Democratic {{nomination}} for governor at the 1899 party convention in LouisvilleGoebel, Wat Hardin, and William J. Stone. When Hardin {{appeared to be}} the front-runner for the nomination, Stone and Goebel agreed to work together against him. Stone's supporters <b>would</b> <b>back</b> whomever Goebel picked to preside over the convention. In exchange, half the delegates from Louisville, who were pledged to Goebel, would vote to nominate Stone for governor. Goebel would then drop out of the race, but would name many of the other officials on the ticket. As word of the plan spread, Hardin dropped out of the race, believing he would be beaten by the Stone–Goebel alliance.|$|E
5|$|In February 2000, the Turnpike Authority {{gave in to}} {{the orders}} from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to have Route 92 undergo an {{environmental}} impact study, which could go up to two years, to help see if they should award the contract for construction. Opponents of the Route 92 project hailed this decision for {{the thought that the}} environmental impact statement (EIS) <b>would</b> <b>back</b> up their beliefs. Four months later, the Army Corps of Engineers held a meeting to decide what to take into account for the impact statement and held opinions from both the supporters and opponents of the freeway. Around this time, locals sent an editorial to News 12 New Jersey to say that Middlesex County Route 522, already a four-lane freeway, should become the primary freeway across the portion of Middlesex County. However, the Turnpike Authority replied citing that Route 522 would be inadequate to handle the amount of traffic by 2015 that Route 92 was to handle. In December 2003, the Army Corps of Engineers approved the statement and although agencies still disagreed on the wetlands issues, held public hearings in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government <b>would</b> <b>back</b> Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E

He had a strip that they would place on the floor, and when he was playing the note 'F' sharp he would stand on the strip's 'F' sharp point and 'F' sharp <b>would</b> feed <b>back</b> better. He really worked this out to a fine science, and we were playing this at a terrific level in the studio, too. Tony Visconti ...|$|R

5|$|The Doctor enters Bennett's room, {{and finds}} {{things are not}} as they seem. The {{supposedly}} crippled Bennett is missing, and a tape recorder hides his absence. He finds a trap door in {{the floor of the}} cabin and follows it to a temple carved from rock where he unmasks Koquillion as Bennett. Bennett reveals he killed a crewmember on board the ship and was arrested, but the ship crashed before the crime could be radioed to Earth. It was he who killed the crash survivors and the natives of Dido to cover his crime. He has been using the Koquillion alias so that Vicki <b>would</b> <b>back</b> up his story, and had hoped the planet would be destroyed when his version of events was given. Just as Bennett is about to kill the Doctor, two surviving native Didonians arrive and force Bennett to his death over a ledge. They then stop the signal to prevent the Rescue Ship reaching their planet. With no living family and nothing left for her on Dido, Vicki is welcomed aboard the TARDIS.|$|E
5|$|The Tanzimat proved unpopular {{with large}} {{segments}} of the population and a Bedouin revolt broke out, with Transjordanian tribes launching raids against Tiberias and its countryside in the summer of 1863. Aqil was unable to stop the raids, and may {{have played a role in}} the revolt. In response, the Ottomans dispatched a 2,000-strong, artillery-backed force from Damascus and Acre to Tiberias. The presence of artillery caused the Transjordanian tribes to retreat. Aqil viewed this deployment as an attack on his jurisdiction and issued his resignation in protest, all the while hoping Kapuli Pasha <b>would</b> <b>back</b> down and reject his resignation. To that end, he had Jewish notables from Tiberias and the French consul of Beirut lobby on his behalf, but without success, as Kapuli Pasha, content to see the elimination of a local power such as Aqil, accepted his resignation.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 895 the talented general Nikephoros Phokas the Elder was summoned to Constantinople and sent against the Bulgarians {{at the head of}} a large army. While Simeon concentrated his forces along the southern border to confront Phokas, the Byzantine navy under admiral Eustathios Argyros sailed to the Danube Delta to assist the Magyars. Believing that Simeon I <b>would</b> <b>back</b> off Leo VI sent an envoy, Constantinacios, to propose peace. Simeon I, who had studied in the University of Constantinople and was familiar with the Byzantine diplomacy, was suspicious of the Byzantine rapprochement, charged Constantinacios with espionage and put him into custody. The Danube was barred with an iron chain to impede the movement of the Byzantine navy and the bulk of the army was dislocated northwards. The Byzantines, however, managed to break the chain and transported the Magyar hordes south of the river. The Magyars, led by Árpád's son Liüntika, ravaged Dobrudzha and dealt a heavy defeat on the Bulgarian army, led personally by Simeon I. Simeon sought refuge in the strong fortress of Drastar while the Magyars pillaged and looted unopposed, reaching the outskirts of the capital Preslav. Before retreating north, the Magyars sold thousands of captives to the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Schmittou {{and team}} owners arrived at terms in June 1984 to {{purchase}} the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. In order {{to prove to the}} team's Nashville banks, which <b>would</b> <b>back</b> the purchase, that the move was financially viable, Schmittou commissioned a survey to evaluate the potential turnout for a Triple-A team versus a Double-A team. Though the research proved to team owners that the move was a sensible decision, the banks were not impressed. As a result, the team switched banks and went ahead with the purchase and relocation. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team instead. Schmittou wanted to send Nashville's existing Southern League franchise to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league's disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried {{on the history of the}} Double-A team that preceded it. The Triplets' legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely-new franchise.|$|E
5|$|The group {{became a}} {{professional}} band in 1972, adding drummer Bennett Vartanian and changing their name to Wildcountry. During this time, the group accepted a position {{playing at the}} nearby Canyonland theme park. The park would bring in established stars, such as Jerry Wallace, Bobby Bare, and Narvel Felts, and the band <b>would</b> <b>back</b> them, afterwards performing a one-hour dance set. After a while, with opportunities for the band slimmed, a discouraged Cook took a government job in Anniston, Alabama. Owen was studying English at Jacksonville State University, and Cook had an electronics job. The trio shared at $56-a-month apartment in Anniston, working to keep the band afloat with night and weekend gigs. The group decided to become professional musicians in 1973, and began performing at bars throughout the Southeast. In March, the band relocated to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, performing six nights {{a week at a}} club named The Bowery for tips. They made their best money performing cover songs of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Merle Haggard. The group could not secure a record contract and began to self-finance recordings. The group borrowed $4,000 from a Fort Payne bank to record and release their own albums to sell at shows. Vartanian dropped out of the group, and following a rotation of four more drummers, they settled on Rick Scott in 1974.|$|E
