5|$|As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Periyar {{advocated}} forcefully {{throughout his}} life that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men {{and that they should}} be given good education and have the right to property. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.|$|E
5|$|True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham {{supported}} {{passage of}} the Eighteenth Amendment forbidding the import and sale of alcohol in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919, but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.|$|E
5|$|In August 1843, {{just after}} she turned 25, Stone {{traveled}} by train, steamship, and stagecoach to Oberlin College in Ohio, the country's first college to admit {{both women and}} African Americans. She entered the college believing that women should vote and assume political office, that women should study the classic professions and that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> able to speak their minds in a public forum. Oberlin College did not share all of these sentiments.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights of Woman, she extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all people should be judged on their merits, she wrote, <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> included in that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation {{is dependent on the}} virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead to sit with the women.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal <b>women,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> aware of the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially {{in the early stages}} of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E

5|$|The {{automobile}} unions {{played a}} leading role in advancing the cause of women's rights. In 1955, the United Auto Workers Union (UAW) organized the UAW Women's Department to strengthen women's role in the union and encourage participation in the union's elected bodies. In a move that was met with some hostility by Teamsters leaders, the U.S. Division of Transport Personnel had in 1943 instructed Teamsters Union officials that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed full employment as truck drivers. That proved to be only a temporary wartime measure, but a change of heart among Teamsters leadership by the mid-1950s led to the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Women in the auto industry were considered leaders in the movement for women's rights.|$|E
5|$|One of Wollstonecraft's central {{arguments}} in the Rights of Woman is that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> educated in a rational manner {{to give them the}} opportunity to contribute to society. In the 18th century, it was often assumed by both educational philosophers and conduct book writers, who wrote what one might think of as early self-help books, that women were incapable of rational or abstract thought. Women, it was believed, were too susceptible to sensibility and too fragile to be able to think clearly. Wollstonecraft, along with other female reformers such as Catharine Macaulay and Hester Chapone, maintained that women were indeed capable of rational thought and deserved to be educated. She argued this point in her own conduct book, Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), in her children's book, Original Stories from Real Life (1788), {{as well as in the}} Rights of Woman.|$|E

25|$|The {{move by the}} {{legislature}} was motivated {{by a number of}} factors, including bringing Eastern women to the territory to increase its population (it has consistently been among the least-populated states in America), to publicize the new territory, to bring more voters into the fold (both for existing political elites and again due to its small population), and by genuine concerns that <b>women</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed the vote.|$|E
