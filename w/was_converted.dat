5|$|Designed by Robert Stevenson {{and built}} by James Smith of Inverness {{the light was}} first {{exhibited}} on 15 October 1833. The oil-burning light <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to incandescent in 1906 and the lighthouse <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to automatic operation on 23 October 1980, when the last keepers were withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|As far as {{the ground}} water {{necessary}} for the conversion could penetrate, the pyrite-carbonate <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to a usable brown hematite iron ore along the outcrops and near the bedrock surface.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine test bed to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160. The first Tu-142MK <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> for an airborne laboratory role, setting several altitude-in-horizontal and time-to-altitude records in its class.|$|E

5000|$|R5P <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> into ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P, RuP) by phosphopentose isomerase. Xu5P <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> into RuP by phosphopentose epimerase.|$|R
50|$|GAs {{are usually}} {{produced}} from the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in higher plants. In this pathway, bioactive GA is produced from trans-geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP). In the MEP pathway, three classes of enzymes {{are used to}} yield GA from GGDP: 1) terpene synthases (TPSs), 2) cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), and 3) 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2ODDs). There are 8 steps in the methylerythritol phosphate pathway: - 1) GGDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-copalyl diphosphate (ent-CPD) by ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase - 2) etn-CDP <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurene by ent-kaurene synthase - 3) ent-kaurene <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenol by ent-kaurene oxidase (KO) - 4) ent-kaurenol <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenal by KO - 5) ent-kaurenal <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-kaurenoic acid by KO - 6) ent-kaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid by ent-kaurene acid oxidase (KAO) - 7) ent-7a-hydroxykaurenoic acid <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12-aldehyde by KAO- 8) GA12-aldehyde <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to GA12 by KAO. GA12 is processed to the bioactive GA4 by oxidations on C-20 and C-3, which is accomplished by 2 soluble ODDs: GA 20-oxidase and GA 3-oxidase.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of Krag-Jørgensen rifles <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> into harpoon guns, {{in the same fashion}} as Jarmann M1884s <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> to Jarmann harpoon rifles. It <b>was</b> {{realized}} that <b>converting</b> the Jarmann <b>was</b> more cost efficient than converting the Krag-Jørgensen, so further conversions was halted. It is not known how many <b>were</b> <b>converted</b> in this way.|$|R
5|$|The {{general layout}} of the home's {{interior}} has remained basically the same throughout the remodelings; the rooms on each floor are accessed via a large central hallway which ends in an elegant rotunda. However, {{some of the changes}} made in 1910 and 1911 did alter the interior appearance. The parlor <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into the library and the library <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into the dining room after an extension was added on. In the home's northwest corner a large kitchen was added, on the second-floor, the room above the kitchen became servant's quarters.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years later}} the ship was {{purchased}} by South Africa and <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into a survey ship in 1949. Protea was obsolete by the late 1950s and was placed in reserve in 1957. The ship was sold in 1962 and <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into a fishing trawler {{with the name of}} Justin. The company subsequently failed and she was scrapped in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Valiant {{was paid}} off in 1885, and she was {{assigned}} to the HMS Indus stoker training establishment in 1897, briefly losing her name, before being renamed as Indus IV in 1904. The ship <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to a kite balloon storeship in 1915, during World War I, and her name was changed to HMS Valiant III. She was offered for sale in 1922, but there were no takers so the ship <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into a floating oil tank in 1926 and towed to Hamoaze.|$|E
50|$|The machine {{house has}} <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> into a {{restaurant}} and the former company storehas <b>been</b> <b>converted</b> into the resort's offices.|$|R

40|$|When a {{hardwood}} log is sawn into lumber, over 16 {{percent of}} the volume <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to sawdust. Furthermore, 12 {{percent of the}} log <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to slabs and 17 percent <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to edging and trimming pieces, {{all of which are}} chipped. Hence, less than 55 percent of the log <b>is</b> actually <b>converted</b> to lumber (see Figure 1). Lumber mus...|$|R

5|$|A {{colonial era}} {{bungalow}} at Bukit Chandu <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> into Reflections at Bukit Chandu, an interpretative centre about the Battle of Pasir Panjang. The actions of Adnan {{and the soldiers}} from the Malay Regiment are immortalised at the centre.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to use as a caravan park the guard house <b>was</b> <b>converted</b> to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sequence}} of enzymes involved {{has been reported}} to be dirigent protein (DIR), to convert coniferyl alcohol to (+)-pinocresol, which <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> by pinocresol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR) to (-)-secoisolariciresinol, which <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> by sericoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase (SDH) to (-)-matairesinol, which <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> by CYP719A23 to (-)-pluviatolide, which <b>is</b> likely <b>converted</b> by Phex13114 (OMT1) to (-)-yatein, which <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> by Phex30848 (2-ODD) to (-)-deoxypodophyllotoxin. [...] Though not proceeding through the last step of producing podophyllotoxin itself, a combination of six genes from the mayapple enabled production of the etoposide aglycone in tobacco plants.|$|R
50|$|In the DuPont route, aniline <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> to diphenyltriazine, which <b>is</b> <b>converted</b> by acid-catalysis to 4-aminoazobenzene. Hydrogenation of {{the latter}} affords PPD.|$|R
