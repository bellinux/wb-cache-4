5|$|Linnaeus {{stayed with}} Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> house {{to return to}} Sweden. Illness and the {{kindness}} of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> university {{to play for the}} 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|Another short {{stint in}} Southeastern Championship Wrestling followed, with LeDuc being given two more reigns with the Southeastern Heavyweight title. He was put over his former partner Bob Armstrong for the belt in August 1983 {{and began a}} feud with Robert Fuller, another former partner. During {{the course of this}} feud, the belt changed hands twice. Fuller was booked to win the belt from LeDuc, but LeDuc won a {{subsequent}} match to win the title for his sixth and final reign. LeDuc held the belt until vacating the title <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> promotion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} sixteen, {{he found}} work as a factor's clerk in a {{warehouse}} at Horseley Fields, Wolverhampton, until the early 1880s <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> warehouse after failing to repay a loan. He then worked for a lock manufacturer called Osborne in Lord Street, Wolverhampton, until he was dismissed for theft in either 1884 or 1885. For the next few years, his whereabouts are not known for certain, but {{he appears to have}} lived an unsettled life in the English Midlands and Yorkshire. In 1887, he was making a living as a hawker, selling small items such as pencils and key rings on the streets of Snow Hill, Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|During the {{recording}} of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find {{the rest of the}} band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by guitarist The Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} top-tier racing {{career in the}} IndyCar Series, making his driving debut during the 2000 season for PDM Racing. Hornish began driving for Panther Racing the {{following}} season, winning eleven races and the 2001 and 2002 series championships {{over the next three}} seasons. During the 2004 season Hornish began driving for Team Penske, winning eight more races (including the 2006 Indianapolis 500) and the 2006 series championship during his time with the team. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> series after the 2007 season, he held the record for most career wins in the series (19, broken by Scott Dixon in 2009).|$|E

5|$|Nevinson {{studied at}} the Slade School of Art under Henry Tonks and {{alongside}} Stanley Spencer and Mark Gertler. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Slade, Nevinson befriended Marinetti, {{the leader of the}} Italian Futurists, and the radical writer and artist Wyndham Lewis, who founded the short-lived Rebel Art Centre. However, Nevinson fell out with Lewis and the other 'rebel' artists when he attached their names to the Futurist movement. Lewis immediately founded the Vorticists, an avant garde group of artists and writers from which Nevinson was excluded.|$|E
5|$|Seamer married Letice Dorothy Lee, {{and had two}} children, Katherine Judith and Mary. By 1948 Seamer {{had risen}} to be the {{district}} commissioner for Khartoum North. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Sudan Political Service in 1950, he returned to England and took up a teaching position at his old school, Marlborough College. In addition to teaching Latin, English and history, he became a housemaster, before his retirement in 1973. He served as mayor of Marlborough twice, and as a justice of the peace, and was awarded Freedom of the City in 2001. He died, following an illness on 16 April 2006, aged 92.|$|E
5|$|Storm and the Hurricanes {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified {{as they had been}} posted from the same {{place at the same time}} and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years later}} in 1950, he became {{prosector}} for the Zoological Society of London and remained there for twelve years. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> London Zoo in 1962, the old prosectorium that has been his office was closed, many preserved biological specimens were discarded, and the era of anatomists working at the London Zoo—starting {{from the time of}} Richard Owen—came to a close. Between 1957 and 1958, Osman Hill also acted as a visiting scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. Later in 1958, primatologist Jane Goodall studied primate behaviour under him in preparation for her studies of wild chimpanzees. In 1962, he was hired as the assistant director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Center (YNPRC) in Atlanta after being turned down for the position of director.|$|E
5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film {{in the next two}} days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
5|$|Georges, the {{youngest}} of eight children, was born on , 1887, in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques Vézina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi {{until the age of}} fourteen, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes, and used skates {{for the first time at}} age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Rather the club, known as the Saguenéens ("People from the Saguenay", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing exhibition games against a variety of clubs.|$|E

5|$|In April 1337, Montagu was {{appointed}} to a diplomatic commission to Valenciennes, to establish alliances with Flanders and the German princes. In July 1338, he accompanied the king on another mission to the continent, again providing {{the greatest number of}} soldiers, with 123 men-at-arms and 50 archers. In September of that year he was made Marshal of England. After the death of Thomas of Brotherton, Earl of Norfolk, this office had come into the hands of Norfolk's daughter Margaret. The king did not trust the office with her husband, so he decided instead to bestow it on his trusted companion, Montagu. Edward's policy of building alliances put him in great debt, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Low Countries to return to England late in 1338, Salisbury had to stay behind as surety to the king's debtors, along with the king's family and the Earl of Derby. The earl had earlier voiced concerns about the costly alliances, but he nevertheless remained loyal to the king's strategy.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the University of California at Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources {{that would have been}} put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E
5|$|Young {{remained}} an {{executive producer of}} Holby City until 2004, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> BBC to work for production company 19 TV. Former Casualty producer Johnathan Young was an executive producer {{for the duration of}} Holby first series, before joining Channel 4 in 1999. Kathleen Hutchison served alongside Mal Young as co-executive producer from 2003 to 2004, when she left the series to become executive producer of EastEnders. Hutchison was succeeded by former series producer Stokes, who remained working on Holby City until 2006, when McHale returned to the series. McHale was the first British writer ever to become the showrunner of a major prime time drama. He resigned from the position in 2009, and was succeeded by Belinda Campbell in 2010. In February 2011, it was announced that Johnathan Young would return to the BBC from March, succeeding Campbell as executive producer of both Casualty and Holby City.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr is {{the fifth}} highest non-imperial office (eighth overall), coming after the megas doux and before the megas logothetes. Its {{insignia}} of office {{were similar to those}} of the megas doux, i.e. a rich silk kabbadion tunic, a golden-red skiadion hat decorated with embroideries in the klapoton style, without veil, or a domed skaranikon hat, again in red and gold and decorated with golden wire, with a portrait of the emperor standing in front, and another of him enthroned in the rear. Only his staff of office (dikanikion) differed, with only the topmost carved knots in gold, and the rest in silver. The knobs in the staff remained gold, bordered with silver braid. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the prōtostratōr retained some functions, mostly ceremonial, echoing his origin as a stable master: he carried the emperor's sword, he led the emperor's horse <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> palace, although the actual responsibility for the emperor's horses now rested with the komēs tōn basilikōn hippōn ("count of the imperial horses"). In war, the prōtostratōr was responsible for the irregulars ("those who have neither order nor their own banner") and scouts who preceded the army.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season the Highlanders were coached by Gordon Hunter before {{he joined the}} All Blacks {{selection}} panel. Glen Ross took over in 1997, and was not reappointed for the 1998 season. Tony Gilbert was appointed for the 1998 season, and again coached the team in 1999 before being appointed co-coach for the All Blacks. Peter Sloane was appointed Gilbert's successor for the 2000 season, and also coached them in 2001 before moving to coach the Blues. Laurie Mains returned to New Zealand from South Africa to replace Sloane for the 2002 season. Mains resigned following the 2003 season after a rift between him and senior players. Greg Cooper replaced Mains and coached the team from 2003 until 2007, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> franchise {{to take up the}} assistant coaches position with the Blues. Glenn Moore coached the club from 2008 through until 2010, when he was relieved of his duties after the club posted only 10 wins against 29 losses in his three years in charge. His replacement was former All Black flanker Jamie Joseph, who coached between 2011 and 2016. Tony brown took over as head coach in 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Brindle Tails {{desperately wanted}} Clayton {{out of the}} governor's office. Conveniently, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson was a Brindle Tail, so the natural course of action {{was to try to}} get rid of Clayton and let Johnson succeed him. Clayton was well aware of their plans, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> state briefly for New York on {{business}} concerning the Holford Bonds, he informed no one. When Johnson, who was at home some distance from the capital, found out he tried to head to the capital to take control and have Clayton arrested and impeached. He arrived too late. Subsequently, after Johnson made a speech demanding changes in the administration, the Minstrels started to target Johnson. On January 30, 1871, they introduced articles of impeachment in the General Assembly against him. The chief charge was that Johnson, acting as the President of the Senate, had administered the oath of office to Joseph Brooks, who had recently been elected as state senator, and then recognized him on the floor. Although this was legitimately within his powers as the lieutenant governor to do, he escaped impeachment by only two votes. The scrutiny of the proceedings seriously damaged his reputation, even though he had done nothing wrong, and his political career never recovered.|$|E
