40|$|Total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA) is {{the most}} common and cost effective surgery used to mitigate painful end-stage knee osteoarthritis. Projections suggest that by 2030 over 3. 5 million older adults will undergo primary TKA annually in the U. S. It is estimated that a tourniquet is used by 95 % of orthopedic surgeons during TKA to create a bloodless field and to ensure proper bone implant cementing. Prior studies by our lab suggest that tourniquet use may be detrimental, potentially leading to ischemia-reperfusion injury and cell swelling acutely following surgery; however, these studies focused on the vastus lateralis muscle. To our knowledge, less is known about how tourniquet use during TKA may impact the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle, which in older adults provides greater postural control support relative to younger individuals. PURPOSE: Determine if tourniquet use during TKA alters pH and oxidative capacity in the tibialis anterior (TA) 2 weeks after surgery. METHODS: Non-invasive in-vivo 31 -phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess muscle metabolism in both the operative and non-operative TA 2 weeks ± 4 days after surgery in two groups: those who had tourniquet (T) during surgery and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not (<b>NT).</b> RESULTS: Average resting pH in the NT group operative leg (n= 2) was 7. 025 and non-operative leg was 7. 02. Average resting pH in the T group operative leg (n= 3) was 7. 01 and non-operative leg was 7. 027. Oxidative capacity in the NT group operative leg (n= 1) was. 0177 and non-operative leg (n= 1) was. 0303. Oxidative capacity in the T group operative leg (n= 2) was. 0406 while the non-operative leg (n= 1) was. 0238. CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results suggest that tourniquet use during TKA alters muscle metabolism in the TA, which may be significant because older adults rely on the TA for balance control and ambulation more than younger individuals. Alterations in TA metabolism following TKA surgery using tourniquet may impact recovery of strength and function in this population of older adults. Further analysis is required in order to determine if TKA with tourniquet alters metabolism 2 weeks post-surgery. Supported by NIH grant: R 01 AG 04640...|$|R

The paper is complementary to a paper published recently in this journal, which focused on plane problems. The theoretical framework and implementation are extended to three-dimensional problems here. In our approach the geometry of inclusions is described using NURBS surfaces.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu shots in a population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving a flu shot in 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots in 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving a flu shot in 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving a flu shot and explained 64 % of the variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. One variable, if the subject had received a flu shot in 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving a flu shot in 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot in 1999...|$|R

30|$|We {{find that}} only 26 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive {{accommodations}} at their current or most recent job are currently employed compared to 37 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. Furthermore, those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive accommodations are more {{likely to be}} in poor health and have a physical disability compared to those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. Finally, 3.2 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive workplace accommodations have had their disability since birth compared to 5.2 % of those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive accommodations. This is also reflected in the fewer number of years since onset for those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive accommodations compared to those <b>who</b> <b>do.</b> We also examine whether individual characteristics vary based on the type of workplace accommodation received (Appendix Table  7). There is some slight variation; for example, those who have a flexible schedule {{are more likely to have}} a bachelor’s degree or higher than those who receive help with transportation, have a personal care attendant or personal assistant, or receive help with child or family care.

Using consumer rejection threshold (CRT) method, this study aimed to assess whether systematic changes in the taste intensities of familiar foods would lead to earlier rejection of these products by PROP tasters than by PROP non-tasters. Subjects rated the intensity of PROP solution and were divided into tasters (Ts) and non-tasters (NTs). And Ts were further divided into medium-tasters (MTs) and super-tasters (STs). Difference thresholds and CRTs were then evaluated for caffeine in coffee, citric acid in orange juice, and for NaCl in beef soup. For each food, Ts were more sensitive to variations in tastants than NTs. Ts also rejected more bitter coffee, more sour orange juice, and less salty beef soup more readily than <b>did</b> <b>NTs.</b> Comparisons among NTs, MTs, and STs gave fewer clear differences...|$|R

40|$|Object. In a {{randomized}} controlled trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, {{more than one-third}} of patients assigned to conservative treatment underwent surgery. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether MRI at baseline could have predicted this delayed surgery. Methods. Independently evaluated qualitative and quantitative MRI findings were compared between those patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery during follow-up in the conservative care group. In addition, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess how well MRI parameters discriminated between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (0. 5 - 0. 7 poor discrimination, ≥ 0. 7 acceptable discrimination). Results. Of 142 patients assigned to receive prolonged conservative care, 55 patients (39 %) received delayed surgery. Of the 55 surgically treated patients, 71 % had definite nerve root compression at baseline compared with 72 % of conservatively treated patients (p = 0. 76). Large disc herniations (size > 50 % of spinal canal) were nearly equally distributed between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery (25 % vs 21 %, p = 0. 65). The size of the dural sac was smaller in the patients who underwent surgery (101. 2 vs 122. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01). However, the size of the dural sac discriminated poorly between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (area under ROC curve, 0. 62). Conclusions.
