5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} was that of Third <b>World</b> <b>rights</b> {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson.

5|$|When The Tower of Babble was {{released}} in April 2012, a little over {{one and a half}} years had elapsed since its author Richard Stursberg left the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), in August 2010. Stursberg had been recruited by CBC president Robert Rabinovitch, as his vice-president in charge of English services. Stursberg had previously worked in the media business, most recently as the director of Telefilm Canada (2001–2004). He entered CBC in October 2004, to replace the retiring Harold Redekopp, with the idea of changing the network's direction, away from its focus on high arts and towards popular content. Though Rabinovitch supported him, Stursberg understood how difficult that transition would be and that he would face resistance and criticism. Stursberg's vision was not supported by Rabinovitch's successor, Hubert Lacroix, who eventually replaced Stursberg with Kirstine Stewart. The 63-year-old Stursberg left CBC in August 2010 and by October 2011 publisher Douglas & McIntyre acquired the <b>world</b> <b>rights</b> to his memoir. Douglas & McIntyre's parent company, D Publishers, filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, still owing Stursberg $13,000.|$|E
