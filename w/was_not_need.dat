He read much, and smoked much,--so that as to the passing of his time there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to pity him, and he consumed a portion of his spare hours in a correspondence with his aunt, the Marchesa, and with his cousin Nina. One of his letters from each shall be given,--and also one of the letters written to each in reply.|$|E
60|$|Not {{long after}} this came another lady, with a like intent, to impose upon him; and was resolved, as she owned, to have laughed him to scorn {{if she had}} succeeded in her attempt. She had very dexterously dressed herself in her woman's habit, and her woman in her own; her footman squired the new-made lady in a very gentlemanly dress, hired {{for the purpose of}} a disguise, from Monmouth-street. The strange and unknown masqueraders entered Mr. Campbell's room with much art. The fellow was by nature of a clean make, and had a good look, and from {{following}} a genteel master when he was young, copied his gait a little, and had some appearance of a mien, and a tolerable good air about him. But this being the first time of his being so fine, and he a little vain in his temper, he over-acted his part; he strutted too much; he was as fond of his ruffles, his watch, his sword, his cane, and his snuff box, as a boy of being newly put into breeches; and viewed them all too often to be thought the possessor of any such things long. The affectation of the chambermaid was insufferable; she had the toss of the head, the jut of the bum, the sidelong leer of the eye, the imperious look upon her lady, now degraded into her woman, that she was intolerable, and a person without the gift of the second-sight would have guessed her to have been a pragmatical upstart, though it is very probable that during that time she fancied herself really better than her mistress; the mistress acted her part of maid the best; for it is easier for genteel modesty to act a low part, than for affected vanity to act a high one. She kept her distance like a servant, but would, to disguise things the better, be every now and then pert, according to their way, and give occasion to be chid. But there is an air of gentility inborn and inbred to some people; and even when they aim to be awkward a certain grace will attend all their minutest actions and gestures, and command love, respect, and veneration. I must therefore own that there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> of a man's being a conjuror to guess who ought to be the lady and who the maid; but to know who absolutely was the lady, and who was the maid did require that skill. For how many such real ladies have we that are made so from such upstarts, and how many genteel waiting-women of great descent that are born with a grace about them, and are bred to good manners. Mr. Campbell's art made him positive in the case; he took the patches {{from the face of the}} maid, and placed them on the mistress's; he pulled off her hood and scarf, and gave it the lady, and taking from the lady her riding-hood, gave it the maid in exchange; for ladies at that time of day were not entered into that fashion of cloaking themselves. Then he wrote down that he should go out, and ought to send his maid in to undress them quite, and give the mistress her own clothes and the maid hers and with a smile wrote down both their names, and commended her contrivance; but after that it was remarked by the lady that he paid her less respect than she expected, and more to her footman, who was in gentleman's habit, whom he took by his side, and told a great many fine things; whereas he would tell the lady nothing farther. The lady nettled at this, wrote to him that she had vanity enough to believe that she might be distinguished from her maid in any dress, but that he had shown his want of skill in not knowing who that gentleman was. Mr. Campbell told her her mistake in sharp terms; and begging her pardon, assured her he knew several chambermaids as genteel and as well-born as her, and many mistresses more awkward and worse born than her maid; that he did not go therefore by the rule of guess and judging what ought to be, but by the rule of certainty and the knowledge of what actually was. She, however, unsatisfied with that answer, perplexed him mightily to know who the man was. He answered, he would be a great man. The lady laughed scornfully, and said she wanted to know who he was, not what he would be. He answered again, he was her footman, but that she would have a worse. She grew warm, and desired to be informed, why, since he knew the fellow's condition, he respected her so little and him so much, and accused him of want of practising manners, if he had not want of knowledge. He answered, Madam, since you will be asking questions too far, this footman will advance himself to the degree of a gentleman, and have a woman of distinction to his wife; while you will degrade yourself by a marriage to be the wife of a footman; his ambition is laudable, your condescension, mean, therefore I give him the preference; I have given you fair warning and wholesome advice, you may avoid your lot by prudence; but his will certainly be what I tell you.|$|E

50|$|Butler {{made just}} ten as England lost their opening match of the World Cup against Australia. In the {{following}} match he was dismissed for three as England were bowled out for just 123 against New Zealand, {{to lose their}} second consecutive match. He made 24 against Scotland as England won their first match of the tournament, but pundits argued {{he should have been}} moved up the order. This sentiment was repeated after he scored a brisk unbeaten 39 against Sri Lanka. However, England were unable to defend their score and Sri Lanka won the match by nine wickets. In their must win game against Bangladesh, Buttler scored 65 but was not able to get England over the line and they were eliminated from the competition.

5000|$|Buttler had a {{generally}} poor Ashes {{series with the}} bat. In the first Test he scored 27 in the first innings but was dismissed for just seven in England's second innings. Despite this, England recorded a comfortable win. In the next Test England lost by 405 runs and Buttler failed to make an impression with the bat, scoring just 24 runs in the match. He scored nine in the first innings of the third Test and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> to bat in the second innings as England secured an eight wicket win. In the fourth Test Buttler made 12 in the first innings as England won by an innings and 78 runs. Buttler only made one in England's first innings of the final Test, but scored 42 in the his final innings of the series, which also proved to be his highest score of the series. England went on to lose the game but won the series 3-2. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It {{looks to me like}} his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket - it's pathetic." ...|$|E
40|$|Body fluid {{identification}} (BFID) forms {{a crucial}} aspect within forensic investigations. BFID {{is particularly important}} where the origin of a DNA profile is also needed e. g. sexual assaults. The aim of this work {{was to develop a}} RNA-based BFID for use in forensic casework. The test was developed in three stages: exploring co-isolation and single isolation strategies, screening and selecting RNA markers and different casework conditions e. g. low-level, non-human, degraded and mixed samples. Blood, saliva, skin, semen and vaginal material samples were collected. Samples underwent single or co-isolation (DNA, total RNA or messenger RNA), DNA quantification, cDNA synthesis and qPCR using a number of different candidate markers and reference genes for microRNA (miRNA) and messenger RNA. During the development of the test the following novel findings were observed: utilisation of complex co-isolation methods <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>need</b> for co-analysis of RNA and DNA; six highly discriminative miRNA markers were identified for miRNA analysis: blood (miR- 451 and miR- 194); saliva (miR- 205); vaginal material (miR- 224 and miR- 335) and semen (miR- 891 a). In terms of casework applications, microRNA analysis showed potential for greater sensitivity than current enzymatic methods with the use of appropriate reference gene; species specificity was observed for reference gene RNU 44; sample stability was observed in 1 -yr bloodstains with miR- 451 and RNU 44 and successful resolution of major and minor components was achieved...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{name servers}} makes the {{communication}} between tasks easier {{and the benefits}} increases {{with the growth of}} the network. Since the CES platform developed by TietoEnator AB was made for networks placed in base stations and similar products the use of a name server was desirable. Since this master thesis only involves the communication within the base station the secure message passing <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>need.</b> And we could assume that all the messages arrived at some point. This assumption was based on that the distance between the name servers was small and the frequency of update messages was high. This master thesis describes the names server that we developed for CES. A name server main task is to translate names into address points. A requirement from TietoEnator was that all the name servers in the network have all the address point stored that is available in the network. The purpose of this thesis is to find a distributed algorithm that distributes all the address point around the network. The Name server problem was divided into two parts, Name server and Multicast transport protocol. We investigated several existing name server to find out if any of them could be use for our problem but they all failed to our requirements. We also looked at some existing multicast transport protocol but all of them seemed too advanced for our project and therefore we developed a solution that is tailor-made for CES and built upon multicast. We came up with two solutions the first one turned out to be very message intensive the messages sent and received during one clock cycle increase exponential and therefore not a very efficient. The other solutions messages increase linear and therefore a much better solution. Our implemented solution were tested in a small scale but it worked very well but needs to be tested in a bigger network. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

Given psychology backgrounds, behavior and alleged acts by approaching the psychological, which is expected to expedite the task penginterogasian / examination suspects without an attitude of coercion / emphasis be a problem in this research is how the role of psychology of police in the examination of a suspect in the case of mutilation in Siak, psychological barriers to the use of police force in the examination of a suspect in the case of mutilation in Siak. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the role of psychology in helping the police to conduct examination on suspected cases of mutilation in Siak, knowing any obstacles in the use of psychology of police and the efforts made to overcome the obstacles. The research method that the author has to do is research sosiologisdisamping it also juridical sociological approach that is done by looking at the correlation between the law society, so as to reveal the effectiveness of the rule of law in society. Through research the author has done, implementation of the psychological police are still going well in practice is due to the task of psychology police have difficulty in terms of the authority to conduct the examination without any request terlabih advance of the investigating authorities, which would restrict the movement of the psychology of the police to do more to do investigative efforts that need to be done by the police are: 1. Keep their willingness dati strategically positioned from the Police so that more police psychological role in the disclosure of the case at this stage of the investigation. 2. Increasing the educational programs for the police, especially for those who are at the front dibarisan (investigator). Thus the implementation of the psychological role of the police should be improved better with socialization in order to investigations conducted in accordance with Law No. 2 of 2002 on the Indonesian National Police Article 14, paragraph 1 (h) so that the rights of suspects are protected in accordance with applicable law...|$|E
