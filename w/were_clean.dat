25|$|England {{began their}} run chase with openers Dick Barlow and WG Grace, but 'The Doctor' {{was unable to}} {{reproduce}} his usual heroics, clean bowled by the express pace of Fred Spofforth for 4. A steady succession of wickets followed with only George Ulyett (26 of 59 balls) and Maurice Read (19 off 54 balls) providing any real resistance as Spofforth's pure pace provided too much firepower for the England line-up to deal with. He collected 7 for 46 off 36.3 overs including an astonishing 18 maidens. Four of his seven dismissals <b>were</b> <b>clean</b> bowled. Despite Spofforth's excellent bowling, England had established a first-innings lead of 38, being all out for 101. Stumps were called {{at the end of}} England's first innings.|$|E

Lancashire made the touring team follow on {{for the first time}} in the season, but New Zealand salvaged a draw, and then the match with Derbyshire followed the Hampshire pattern, with a big first-innings lead whittled down by a second-innings recovery for the county, leaving the tourists with a successful run-chase to win.

25|$|Ulla {{taught that}} the Rabbis ruled {{the skin of}} dead people contaminating so as to prevent people from {{fashioning}} their parents' skin into keepsakes. Similarly, the Mishnah taught that the Sadducees mocked the Pharisees, because the Pharisees taught that the Holy Scrolls rendered unclean the hands that touched them, but the books of Homer did not. In response, Rabban Johanan ben Zakkai noted that both the Pharisees and the Sadducees taught that a donkey's bones <b>were</b> <b>clean,</b> yet the bones of Johanan the High Priest were unclean. The Sadducees replied to Rabban Johanan that the uncleanness of human bones flowed from the love for them, so that people should not make keepsakes out of their parents' bones. Rabban Johanan replied that {{the same was true}} of the Holy Scriptures, for their uncleanness flowed from the love for them.

25|$|In 1885, Briggs {{developed}} amazingly as a bowler: having scarcely bowled at all {{in previous}} seasons, he took 67 wickets for 13.74 each, and in 1886, his bowling helped England achieve a 3–0 cleansweep of the series, their last whitewash victory {{in a series of}} three or more Tests in the Ashes until 1977. His batting did not suffer: Briggs hit a career-best 186 against Surrey at Liverpool – adding a then-record 173 for the tenth wicket with Dick Pilling. In the exceptionally dry summer of 1887, Briggs took 100 wickets in a season for the first time, whilst in the appalling summer of 1888 he was consistently deadly on the treacherous pitches. His 160 wickets cost only 10.49 each, and the following year he was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He was ruthless on the matting in South Africa’s first two Test matches in 1888/9 (only canonised as such much later), taking 15 for 28 in the second Test, of which fourteen <b>were</b> <b>clean</b> bowled.|$|E
25|$|When Nintendo {{released}} the NES in the US, the design styling was deliberately {{different from that}} of other game consoles. Nintendo wanted to distinguish its product from those of competitors and to avoid the generally poor reputation that game consoles had acquired following the video game crash of 1983. One result of this philosophy was to disguise the cartridge slot design as a front-loading zero insertion force (ZIF) cartridge socket, designed to resemble the front-loading mechanism of a VCR. The newly designed connector worked quite well when both the connector and the cartridges <b>were</b> <b>clean</b> and the pins on the connector were new. Unfortunately, the ZIF connector was not truly zero insertion force. When a user inserted the cartridge into the NES, the force of pressing the cartridge down and into place bent the contact pins slightly, as well as pressing the cartridge’s ROM board back into the cartridge itself. Frequent insertion and removal of cartridges caused the pins to wear out from repeated usage over the years and the ZIF design proved more prone to interference by dirt and dust than an industry-standard card edge connector. These design issues were not alleviated by Nintendo’s choice of materials; the console slot nickel connector springs would wear due to design and the game cartridge copper connectors were also prone to tarnishing. Many players would try to alleviate issues in the game caused by this corrosion by blowing into the cartridges, then reinserting them, which actually hurt the copper connectors by speeding up the tarnishing.|$|E

Darwin carefully noted the location of the different types of coral around the reef and in the lagoon. In his diary, he described, [...] "examining the very interesting yet simple structure & origin of these islands. The water being unusually smooth, I waded in as far as the living mounds of coral on which the swell of the open sea breaks.

[...] Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. [...] In 1983 over 100canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could [...] "transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester". By 1984 two local men felt the waters <b>were</b> <b>clean</b> enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still [...] "a class 4 river– top of the pollution chart". [...] During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. [...] The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. [...] In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches {{on the side of the}} river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester's first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre [...] "mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford– the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000newjobs over the next 10years".
