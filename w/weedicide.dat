40|$|Information is an {{essential}} factor {{in the practice of}} farming and it is the foundation of extension service delivery. The modern agrochemical companies generally provide similar <b>weedicide</b> products with different brand names. Owing to this, farmers race difficulties while selecting relevant weedicides. They need appropriate information in order to select exact weedicides. In this regard, a study was conducted to find out the information utilization and <b>weedicide</b> usage among the paddy farmers in the Eravur Pattu Divisional Secretariat division of Batticaloa district Hundred number of paddy farmers were randomly selected for this study. Questionnaire survey was used as the primary data collection method. Secondary data were collected from published sources. The study reveals that, obtaining higher yield was the main reason for the usage of weedicides by the paddy farmers to control weeds in their farm land, followed by severe weed attack. Regarding the information related to <b>weedicide</b> application, paddy farmers in the Eravur Pattu area frequently got information on weedcide application rate from the Extension personnel. But, the selection of agrochemical traders to purchase <b>weedicide</b> was mainly determined by the farmers themselves.

In order to attain sustainable agriculture, there are many farming practices such as land preparation, used of fertilizers and <b>weedicides</b> among other indicators of farming practices. In particular, weed and pest control are focal points for certain crops such as cotton, rice, vegetables, and fruit with heavily applied chemical inputs which cause unsustainability in farming. Among food crops, paddy requires heavy doses of fertilizers, <b>weedicides</b> and pesticides to keep it healthy and productive. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the factors that contribute to unsustainability of paddy farming practices at field level via Paddy Farmer Sustainability Index (PFSI) based on the current 33 paddy farming practices.

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{use of chemicals}} worked as a catalyst to shift the production frontier but the most critical factor of maintaining a clean environment was totally ignored. The present study attempts to estimate the environmental efficiency of rice production by employing the translog stochastic production frontier approach. The data are collected from five major Basmati rice growing districts (Gujranwala, Sheikupura, Sialkot, Hafizabad, and Jhang) of Punjab in 2006. Chemical weedicides and nitrogen are treated as environmentally detrimental inputs. The mean technical efficiency index is sufficiently high (89 percent) but the environmental efficiency index of chemical weedicides alone is 14 percent while the joint environmental efficiency index of chemical weedicides and nitrogen is 24 percent implying that joint environmental efficiency is higher than chemical <b>weedicide</b> alone. It indicates that substantial reduction (86 percent) in chemical <b>weedicide</b> use is possible with higher level of productivity. Moreover, {{it is likely to}} contribute a considerable decrease in environmental pollution which is expected to enhance the performance of agriculture labour. The reduction in chemical weedicides will save Rs 297 per acre and Rs 1307. 3 million over all from the rice crop in Punjab, improving the profitability of rice growing farmers by the same proportion.

Low elasticities fro fertilizer and farm yard manure mainly due to their nominal use as compared to the plant nutrient requirements. Pakistani soils are generally deficiency in human content and are vastly saline/ sodic in characteristics. As a results crop response to fertilizer was low.

30|$|The third EMA measure, {{the cost}} of weeding, showed a {{reduction}} in the treatment plots due to the establishment of the bush-canopy covering the ground. A growth of herbicide-tolerant creeper weeds was observed in these plots; they needed to be removed manually from the field. However, overall weeding cost was on a downward trend in the treatment plots when compared to the control plots (refer Table 1). The weeding cost gradually dropped by 32 to 35 % in the treatment area as against the control area, from the 6 th month to the 14 th month respectively from pruning. As Channaveera et al. (2011) note, in the control plots the use of <b>weedicide</b> is not only ecologically undesirable but has also driven up the input costs of tea production. Moreover, this <b>weedicide</b> does not ideally fall on the target and becomes degraded completely to harmless compounds. They drift into the environment affecting the eco system (Chauhan and Singhal 2006). Hence, the treatment plots clearly demonstrate a notable improvement not only from an economic perspective but also from an ecological perspective. Although not quantified in this study, the use of weedicides to control undergrowth in tea estates can negatively affect local plant and animal biodiversity (Sudhi 2013).|$|E

30|$|The {{extensive}} and rapid spread of salvinia has been halted and repelled {{by the use}} of a few biological agents (Room et al. 1981; Sullivan et al. 2011) but such successes have been few and far between. Worse, none has led to any enduring solution to the salvinia problem. Mechanical removal of salvinia and use of <b>weedicide</b> have recorded even lesser success in controlling its spread. Attempts to utilize salvinia for the generation of compost, green manure or mulch (Raju and Gangwar 2004; Arthur et al. 2007; Dorahy et al. 2009), as fodder (King et al. 2004; Leterme et al. 2010), as a source of biogas (Abbasi et al. 1990; Abbasi and Nipaney 1991; Abbasi et al. 1992 a, b; Abbasi and Abbasi 2010; Ganesh et al. 2005), or for making drugs (Chantiratikul et al. 2009; Choudhary et al. 2008; Li et al. 2013; Tauseef et al. 2013), have all proved uneconomical.

40|$|Groundnut is a {{labour-intensive}} crop, {{especially for}} operations like sowing, weeding, harvesting, and drying.

The practise of manual decortication and stripping is followed by a larger number of farmers in Andhra Pradesh than in Gujarat, indicating less mechanization in the former. For weeding, though, the human labour-use in <b>weedicide</b> + bullock intercultivation + hand weeding technique is almost half of that of the bullock inter-cultivation + hand weeding, only 13 per cent of the farmers practise this labour-saving technique and hence this method should be disseminated in both the regions to reduce human-labour demand.

FISH analysis of the transgenic CRSP- 1 and CRSP- 2 demonstrated the presence of one and two copy numbers respectively. Similarly, the response of CRSP- 1 against Glyphosate @ 1900 ml/acre was far better with almost negligible necrotic spot and efficient growth after spray as compared to CRSP- 2 where some plants were found to have necrosis and negative control where the complete decay of plant was observed after seven days of spray assay.

Using our own data from a survey carried out in 2006 among 215 olive tree farmers from the Granada Province in Southern Spain regarding the adoption of soil conservation and management practices, we model the diffusion process of no tillage practices using several specifications (logistic, Gompertz and exponential). We also estimate an ordered probit model to analyse which socio-economic and institutional factors determine the adoption of no tillage.
