For the selected method of manufacture by conventional drawing, technological calculations were performed. Depending on the diameter of the blank, maximum force and other parameters, the tool and the machine were designed. The tool is a single-operation drawing tool with a blank holder and a rib around the perimeter. These functional parts, together with the drawing punch and drawing die, are made of surface-treated cementitious steel 14 220 (1. 7131). The drawing tool is clamped into a CBA 250 hydraulic press with a nominal force of 2 500 kN, where the blank holder is controlled by an additional device {{at the bottom of the}} press...|$|R
