5|$|Jellyvision Games did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> much of {{the older}} games for the 2011 version. They sought to keep {{as many of the}} old game {{question}} types, such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions, updating the games to support online play. To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles, such as Gibberish Questions that required players to type in a phrase, the developers added new features to the game, such as the Wrong Answer of the Game. The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles: they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players, and wrote several humorous titles for the in-game achievements.|$|E

25|$|An {{anonymous}} EU official {{claimed that}} the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites {{in the event of}} a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces.

25|$|In an {{interview}} in the German daily Die Welt on April 24, 2015, concerning the Fourteenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, Burke renewed his criticism on German Cardinal Walter Kasper, whose “merciful” solution for remarried divorcees who wish to receive communion was discussed at the 2014 Extraordinary Synod. “We are bound by the Magisterium. But some Synod Fathers, above all Cardinal Kasper, <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it. So I had to make myself very clear. Clashes at Synods, incidentally, are nothing unusual. Think of the early Councils, the Arian heresy, for instance, when Athanasius even became physically aggressive”, Burke recalled. He also recalled that Pope John Paul II had ruled out women’s ordination “once and for all”.|$|E
25|$|The firm helped {{multinational}} companies obtain 548 legal tax rulings in Luxembourg between 2002 and 2010. The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

500|$|As {{with its}} predecessors, Sonic 3 was {{developed}} by Sonic Team and published by Sega. Yuji Naka and Hirokazu Yasuhara were the primary creators of the Sonic 3 design document and project schedule. Sonic 3 began as a top-down, isometric game, similar to what would become Sonic 3D Blast (1996), but the concept was abandoned early as the team did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the Sonic formula too radically for a sequel. According to Sonic producer and programmer Yuji Naka, the team felt that they needed a deeper story to expand the world of Sonic, which [...] "made the project huge."
