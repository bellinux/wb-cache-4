2500|$|Tucker {{proposed}} the gradual emancipation of slaves, {{a process that}} other states, such as New York, {{began in the late}} eighteenth century, when some northern states abolished slavery altogether. Tucker's plan began with the manumission of all women born to slaves after the plan took effect; all the women's descendants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> born free. After being freed under the plan, women born to slaves <b>would</b> <b>be</b> obligated to serve their former master's family until the age of 28, after which time they would receive $20, some clothes, and two blankets. At least the first generation of the freed women's descendants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "bound to service by the overseers of the poor" [...] until age 21. Black people in Virginia <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to hold public office, nor could they own land; they <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to lease land for terms of up to 21 years.

5|$|The {{rules of}} ODIs {{have changed since}} the first Afro-Asia Cup. During the tournament, the ICC experimented with a rule called supersub – where the twelfth man <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> {{to take to the}} field in the place of one of the players and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to bat and/or bowl in his place, gaining a full cap in the process. As a result this meant there were {{generally}} 12 capped players per match instead of the regular 11, even though a player may have not participated in either batting or bowling in a match. For example, Muttiah Muralitharan bowled during the first innings of the first ODI, but was replaced by Mohammad Ashraful who batted in his place: both players are listed as having a full cap. These rules were not in place for the World Cricket Tsunami Appeal match or the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E

Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E
