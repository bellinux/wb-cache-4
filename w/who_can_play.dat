500|$|Grant's [...] "immaculate comic performance" [...] (BBC) as the trust-funded womaniser, Will Freeman, in {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of Nick Hornby's best-selling novel About a Boy received raves from critics. Almost universally praised, with an Academy Award-nominated screenplay, About a Boy (2002) {{was determined by the}} Washington Post to be [...] "that rare romantic comedy that dares to choose messiness over closure, prickly independence over fetishised coupledom, and honesty over typical Hollywood endings." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "The acid comedy of Grant's performance carries the film [...] gives this pleasing heartbreaker the touch of gravity it needs," [...] while Roger Ebert observed that [...] "the Cary Grant department is understaffed, and Hugh Grant shows here that he is more than a star, he is a resource." [...] Released a day after the blockbuster , About a Boy was a more modest box office grosser than other successful Grant films, making all of $129million globally. The film earned Grant his third Golden-Globe nomination, while the London Film Critics Circle named Grant its Best British Actor and GQ honoured him as one of the magazine's men of the year 2006. [...] "His performance {{can only be described as}} revelatory," [...] wrote critic Ann Hornaday, adding that [...] "Grant lends the shoals layer upon layer of desire, terror, ambivalence and self-awareness." [...] The New York Observer concluded: [...] " [...] gets most of its laughs from the evolved expertise of Hugh Grant in playing characters that audiences enjoy seeing taken down a peg or two as a punishment for philandering and womanising and simply being too handsome for words-and with an English accent besides. In the end, the film comes over as a messy delight, thanks to the skill, generosity and good-sport, punching-bag panache of Mr. Grant's performance." [...] About a Boy also marked a notable change in Grant's boyish look. Now 41, he had lost weight and also abandoned his trademark floppy hair. Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman took note of Grant's maturation in his review, saying he looked noticeably older and that it [...] "looked good on him." [...] He added that Grant's [...] "pillowy cheeks are flatter and a bit drawn, and the eyes that used to peer with 'love me' cuteness now betray a shark's casual cunning. Everything about him is leaner and spikier (including his hair, which has been shorn and moussed into a Eurochic bed-head mess), but it's not just his surface that's more virile; the nervousness is gone, too. Hugh Grant has grown up, holding on to his lightness and witty cynicism but losing the stuttering sherry-club mannerisms that were once his signature. In doing so, he has blossomed into the rare actor <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>play</b> a silver-tongued sleaze with a hidden inner decency." ...|$|E
