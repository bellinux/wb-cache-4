What is HSV Space? Most operating systems, image processing programs and texts treat images as collections of pixels comprised of red, green and blue values. This is very convenient for display purposes, since computer monitors output color by combining different amounts of red, green and blue. However, most users don’t think of color in these terms. They tend to think about color {{the same way they}} perceive it- in terms of hue (the English name we give colors, like “reddish ” or “greenish”), purity (pastels are “washed out”, saturated colors are “vibrant”), and brightness (a stop sign is “bright ” red, a glass of wine is “dark ” red).

There are many perceptual color spaces...|$|R
