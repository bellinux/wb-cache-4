5|$|After {{the defeat}} of Crínán, Macbeth <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> unchallenged. Marianus Scotus tells how the king made a pilgrimage to Rome in 1050, where, Marianus says, he gave money to the poor {{as if it were}} seed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Attorney General, William de Grey, {{advised that}} the {{publishers}} should again be prosecuted, Mansfield disagreed, {{saying that if}} they {{failed to respond to}} Junius, he would become bored and stop writing. Mansfield <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> correct, because other than a letter printed on 5 October 1771, Junius ceased to write at the beginning of 1772.|$|E
5|$|In 1071, {{the year}} before his grandfather's death, Domnall and an Uí Chennselaig kinsman, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair, battled for control of Leinster. Although Domnall is accorded the title King of Leinster in one mediaeval king-list, Donnchad <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> a more {{powerful}} claimant, and Domnall appears to have held the Leinster kingship in name only.|$|E
50|$|The open {{interval}} (0, 1) and {{the closed}} interval 1 <b>are</b> <b>evidently</b> non-isomorphic as topological spaces (that is, not homeomorphic). However, they are isomorphic as measurable spaces. Indeed, the closed interval <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> isomorphic to a shorter closed subinterval {{of the open}} interval. Also the open interval <b>is</b> <b>evidently</b> isomorphic to {{a part of the}} closed interval (just itself, for instance).|$|R

5|$|Sources make {{no mention}} of why Pope Gregory chose a monk to head the mission. Pope Gregory once wrote to Æthelberht complimenting Augustine's {{knowledge}} of the Bible, so Augustine <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> well educated. Other qualifications included administrative ability, for Gregory was the abbot of St Andrews {{as well as being}} pope, which left the day-to-day running of the abbey to Augustine, the prior.|$|E
5|$|The Persian strategy, on {{the other}} hand, was {{probably}} principally determined by tactical considerations. The Persian infantry <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> lightly armoured, and no match for hoplites in a head-on confrontation (as would be demonstrated at the later battles of Thermopylae and Plataea.) Since the Athenians seem to have taken up a strong defensive position at Marathon, the Persian hesitance was probably a reluctance to attack the Athenians head-on.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Book of the Dead was known {{as early as the}} Middle Ages, well before its contents could be understood. Since it was found in tombs, it <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> a document of a religious nature, and this led to the widespread misapprehension that the Book of the Dead was the equivalent of a Bible or Qur'an.|$|E

5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|Brock {{sent the}} twelve mutineers {{and the seven}} deserters to Quebec for court martial. The mutineers had planned to jail all the {{officers}} (save Sheaffe, who was to be killed) and to cross the Niagara River into the U.S. at Queenston. Seven soldiers were subsequently executed by firing squad. The mutineers testified that {{they were forced to}} such measures by the severity of Sheaffe's command. They said if they had continued under Brock's command, they would never have taken such action. Brock <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> upset by the news that the conspirators had been shot. In a botched execution, the firing squad discharged their weapons at too long a distance, so that the condemned men were not killed instantly.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position {{he is known}} to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of epistrategus of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He could have maintained contact with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> {{married before}} he became king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|Epaminondas {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an {{advisory}} capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to swing the vote in favour of battle.* Sage, Warfare in Ancient Greece, 138; Seager, The King's Peace, 183 During {{the course of the}} battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.|$|E
5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were {{transformed}} from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E

5|$|In November 1965, {{together}} with four business partners, David opened Elizabeth David Ltd, a shop selling kitchen equipment, at 46 Bourne Street, Pimlico. The partners were {{spurred on by}} the closure of a professional kitchenware shop in Soho on the retirement of its owner, and the recent success of Terence Conran's Habitat shops, which sold among much else imported kitchen equipment for which there <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> a market. Among her customers were Albert and Michel Roux, who shopped there for equipment that they would otherwise have to buy in France.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the mention of several colours, authors such as Walter Rothschild claimed that the Gelderland journal {{described}} the bird as entirely blue-grey, and it was restored this way in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds. Later examination of the journal by Julian Hume has revealed only {{a description of the}} dodo. He suggested that the distinctively drawn facial mask may represent a separate colour. The head <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> blue, and in 2007, Hume suggested the beak may have been red, {{and the rest of the}} plumage greyish or blackish, which also occurs in other members of Psittaculini.|$|E
5|$|Knap of Howar Neolithic {{farmstead}} {{is probably}} the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated {{on the island of}} Papa Westray (which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> built on the site of an even older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.|$|E

5|$|Mark Kellogg (March 31, 1831 – June 25, 1876) was a {{newspaper}} reporter killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Kellogg rode with George Armstrong Custer during the battle and <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> {{one of the first}} men killed by the Sioux and Cheyenne. His dispatches were the only press coverage of Custer and his men {{in the days leading up}} to the battle. As {{a newspaper}} stringer whose reports were picked up around the country, Kellogg is considered the first Associated Press correspondent to die in the line of duty.|$|E
5|$|The mint reopened as an assay {{office in}} 1876. Its {{machinery}} <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> damaged during the war, {{but because of}} its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, {{to report on the}} condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active minting service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed Morgan silver dollar from 1879 to 1904.|$|E
5|$|Handel {{then spent}} time in Rome, where the {{performance}} of opera was forbidden by Papal decree, and in Naples. He applied himself to the composition of cantatas and oratorios; at that time there was little difference (apart from increasing length) between cantata, oratorio and opera, all based on the alternation of secco recitative and aria da capo. Works from this period include Dixit Dominus and the dramatic cantata Aci, Galatea e Polifemo, written in Naples. While in Rome, probably through Alessandro Scarlatti, Handel had become acquainted with Cardinal Grimani, a distinguished diplomat who wrote libretti in his spare time, and acted as an unofficial theatrical agent for the Italian royal courts. He <b>was</b> <b>evidently</b> impressed by Handel {{and asked him to}} set his new libretto, Agrippina. Grimani intended to present this opera at his family-owned theatre in Venice, the Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo, as part of the 1709–10 Carnevale season.|$|E
