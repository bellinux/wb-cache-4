Fairness among agents with different preferences is taken into account by considering their marginal <b>willingnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> as virtual prices.

However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to fill up the vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} first-price sealed-bid auctions {{of standing}} timber {{organized by the}} French forest service, Office National des For�ts (ONF). A feature of these auctions {{is that they are}} held with random reserve prices. We consider an auction model with a random reserve price within the independent-private-value paradigm. After establishing the identification of the model, we estimate the underlying bidders' private-value distribution by using a simple two-step nonparametric procedure. This procedure allows the computation of the winners' informational rents as well as the optimal reserve price. We then simulate a first-price sealed-bid auction with the optimal announced reserve price. Empirical results show that the optimal reserve price allows the ONF to extract more of bidders' <b>willingnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay.</b> Moreover, our results show that, though sales do not vary much, profits for the ONF would significantly increase and less timber would be sold. © 2003 President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|R

It encompasses as particular cases several models from the sociology and economics literature. We extend previous results to the case of a general distribution of idiosyncratic preferences, called here Idiosyncratic <b>Willingnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>Pay</b> (IWP). Positive additive externalities yield a family of inverse demand curves that include the classical downward sloping ones but also new ones with non constant convexity. When j, the ratio of the social influence strength to the standard deviation of the IWP distribution, is small enough, the inverse demand is a classical monotonic (decreasing) function of the adoption rate. Even if the IWP distribution is mono-modal, there is a critical value of j above which the inverse demand is non monotonic, decreasing for small and high adoption rates, but increasing within some intermediate range. Depending on the price there are thus either one or two equilibria. Beyond this first result, we exhibit the generic properties of the boundaries limitin...|$|R
