5|$|After track {{alterations}} {{were done}} on 23 February 2010, the two fastest four-man practice times were done by Germany's Lange and the United States' Steven Holcomb. Australia withdrew its four-man team on 23 February 2010 after {{two of its}} crew members suffered concussions from crashes sustained during track practice. Australia's chef de mission Ian Chesterman stated that the decision was not taken lightly and <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the side of safety.|$|E
50|$|Much {{work has}} <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the {{reconstruction}} of Proto-Mon-Khmer in Harry L. Shorto's Mon-Khmer Comparative Dictionary. Little work has <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the Munda languages, which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon-Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.|$|R
50|$|Mini FMX is {{basically}} in between Freestyle BMX and Freestyle Motocross. A {{lot of the}} tricks that can <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the bigger Motocross bikes can also <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the smaller Pit Bikes. A lot of Freestyle Motocross riders use Pit Bikes to learn the Backflip on because they are smaller, lighter and do not cause as much injury {{if you do not}} land correctly. There are also tricks on the BMX, like the flat spin 360, which have <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> Pit Bikes.|$|R

5|$|Conversion {{planning}} {{began in}} May 1942, {{and had the}} conversion been finished, {{she would have been}} the largest German aircraft carrier, longer even than the purpose-built s. The work was canceled in November 1942, however, after design problems, including serious instability and structural weaknesses, proved to be irreconcilable. No work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the ship, which was eventually seized by the US Army and used as a troop transport following the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|For two years, from 1948–1950, work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the new {{building}} connected to the rectory by the arch. The three-story building was made of flexicore slab and the outside was made from a mixture of new and old bricks {{in the back and}} Michigan red sandstone in the front, so that the building was the same color as the buildings to which it was adjoined. The interior of the building was plastered by one of the best plasterers in the area, Dom Graziano, who {{was the son of a}} parishioner. He did all of the plastering for free.|$|E
5|$|Further work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the {{property}} in the early 18th century, providing an additional service room and bedrooms. The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 impacted on the hall, which {{was close to the}} Scottish border. In 1715, William Wybergh, the owner, was abducted by Scottish soldiers, and in 1745, shortly before the Clifton Moor Skirmish, it was occupied and looted by the rebel forces.|$|E

5|$|In 1205, the Republic of Venice invaded Dalmatia {{with the}} forces of the Fourth Crusade. Ragusa was forced to pay a tribute, {{eventually}} becoming a source of supplies for Venice, thus saving itself from being sacked like Zadar in the Siege of Zara, used as Venice's naval base in the southern Adriatic Sea. In the 14th century, after liberation from Venetian supremacy, extensive work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the walls to ensure the republic's liberty.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast in voice over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the central fifth tower.|$|E
5|$|Lobster fishing <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a {{small scale}} {{especially}} in Cardigan Bay, but was reserved almost exclusively for export. Welsh fisherman {{would be more likely}} to eat the less profitable crabs. Cockles have been harvested since Roman times and are still harvested in a traditional manner with a hand rake and scraper. Cockle picking still happens in the Gower peninsula, but due to the difficulty in getting licences and reduced yield, villages near the Carmarthen Bay no longer gather them.|$|E

Some procedures <b>are</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> both ears, but the risk of hearing loss then becomes significantly greater.|$|R
5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby. The book was initially called Gumby's Arthur Adams Specials, but was eventually published with a sticker covering Adams' {{name on the}} cover, effectively renaming the book Gumby's Spring Specials. According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> Adams' request, who {{wanted nothing to do}} with the publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E
5|$|Screen {{time was}} divided up equally between the couples {{over the course}} of an episode, though {{occasionally}} some scenes would run longer; in Series 4, Episode 3, the scenes of Karen clubbing went on for ten uninterrupted minutes. These scenes were also a rarity for location filming; usually filming in public places <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a Sunday during closing hours but the clubbing scenes in this episode were filmed during opening hours at the Music Box in Manchester. A hand-held camera was used to enhance the frenetic pace.|$|E
5|$|Since its erection, the {{building}} has undergone significant repair, renovation and conservation, including work on {{the building}} fabric, the stained glass windows, the mosaic floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children's Chapel. Major work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the interior and the spire in the 1890s and on the crypt in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|The 1620s saw the {{fragmentation}} of the west wing of the original residence. Sold {{to a number of}} owners, this part of the building was gradually distorted until only a few remnants were left. The other three wings of the building were acquired by the Huraults of Saint-Denis in 1621, and on 5 July 1637 the residence was acquired by the Bégon family. In 1644, major restoration work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the north wing under Charles Turmel. The Hôtel d'Alluye was sold by Michel Bégon de la Picardière to the Terrouanne family on 5 August 1718 for 9,000 livres.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} damage <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the lakes. Major shipwrecks {{occurred on}} all but Lake Ontario, with most happening on southern and western Lake Huron. Lake masters recounted that waves reached at least 35feet (11m) in height. Being shorter in length than waves ordinarily formed by gales, they occurred in rapid succession, with three waves frequently striking in succession. Masters {{also stated that}} the wind often blew in directions opposite to the waves below. This {{was the result of}} the storm's cyclonic motion, a phenomenon rarely seen on the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of corporate}} enterprises became {{common in the}} 11th century. Almost all arts and crafts were organised into guilds and work <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.|$|E
5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac to carry out his original orders. This <b>was</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> 16October.|$|E
