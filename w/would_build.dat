5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station. The Central Vermont and the New Haven Railroad (which had bought the Shore Line in 1870) bought {{the east end of}} the Parade from New London for the unusually low price of $15,000, with the understanding that the railroads <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a structure more suitable for the bustling city.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of an {{unforeseen}} surge in ridership, the NYCEDC and Hornblower announced in July 2017 that three of the twenty vessels would be reconfigured into 250-passenger boats. These boats would have bigger engines to accommodate the additional passengers. In September 2017, the NYCEDC ordered three new 350-passenger boats for NYC Ferry service to supplement the 20 original boats. Metal Shark <b>would</b> <b>build</b> the new boats for $7 million to $7.5 million each.|$|E
5|$|European pioneer {{farmers in}} the prairies of North America, {{where there is no}} wood for construction, often made their first home in a dug-out cave in the side of a hill or ravine, with a {{covering}} over the entrance.

5|$|Financing of {{the airport}} at Gardermoen would be done through a state loan issued to a limited company owned by the Civil Airport Administration. This company <b>would</b> <b>build</b> and operate Gardermoen, but from 1 January 1997 it also took over {{operation}} of Fornebu. After the last aircraft took off from Fornebu on 7 October 1998, 300 people spent the night transporting 500 truckloads of equipment from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The new airport opened {{on the morning of}} 8 October 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the club}} {{decided that it}} <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a new 2,400-seat stand on the eastern long side. A low {{construction}} cost was secured because the construction industry {{was going through a}} slump. The costs were covered by NOK2.5 million in national lottery grants and NOK2 million in loan, which was planned to be repaid through increased sponsor and ticket revenues from increased attendance. The upgrade also included a reconstruction of the club house to facilitate luxury boxes. They were made available for sponsors, who were allowed to bring guests. The boxes and the vestibule became an important informal meeting area for the town's political and business elite.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, State Senator Jeff Van Drew {{introduced}} {{a plan for}} an extension of Route55 into Cape May County where the South Jersey Transportation Authority <b>would</b> <b>build</b> the road. In {{order to reduce the}} impact on the environment, the freeway would have been elevated. The extension of Route55 would have been tolled. This effort followed two years of failed attempts for a feasibility study to relieve traffic on Route47.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham <b>would</b> <b>build</b> on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen {{visited the}} Soviet Union in May 1965, in which Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin warned against the {{installation}} {{and stated that}} the Soviet Union <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a counter-station. In June, the Soviet Consul in Barentsburg came on an inspection to the installation, and on 2 July a Soviet helicopter crashed at the construction site after having, presumably unintentionally, touched a mast. Soviet demands to have permanent Soviet inspectors of the facility were rejected. The Svalbard Treaty does not include any verification procedure, and as such no signatories {{have the right to}} conduct inspections.|$|E

5|$|On 27 September 1894, a {{committee}} {{was established to}} plan a branch from the Jæren Line to Ålgård. The following year, the committee recommended that a line be built branching from Orstad in Klepp, which would cost 348,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). Gjesdal Municipality offered NOK60,000 of the capital, {{on the condition that}} NSB <b>would</b> <b>build</b> and operate it. The state, on the other hand, wanted the line to be private. Private railways were often largely or entirely owned by municipalities, counties and the state, but would operate independent of NSB and the municipalities would carry the risk for operating deficits.|$|E
5|$|Speculation that Canada's Wonderland <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a new {{attraction}} for the 2014 season {{began at the}} end of July 2013 when maintenance work on the western side of Wonder Mountain was discovered. On August 8, Cedar Fair confirmed an interactive dark ride would be built at one of the company's parks. Wonderland officially announced Wonder Mountain's Guardian—a ten million dollar attraction—on August 30, 2013, on Breakfast Television, a morning news program for the Toronto area. During the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Attractions Expo 2013, the characters of the ride were revealed during president and CEO of Cedar Fair Matt Ouimet's keynote address.|$|E

Mittal Steel announced in Banja Luka on 1 December 2005 that the company <b>would</b> <b>build</b> and finance a memorial in the 'White House' but the project was later abandoned. Many Bosnian Serbs believe {{there should not be}} a memorial, while many Bosniaks believe that construction should be postponed until all the victims are found and only if the entire mine—which is in use—be allocated for the memorial site.|$|E

5|$|The {{system is}} {{split into two}} parts, with lines north of Boston having a {{terminus}} at North Station and lines south of Boston having a terminus at South Station. There is no direct {{connection between the two}} stations, but travel is made possible by transferring to the MBTA's subway system (although this requires an intermediate transfer at either Park Street or Downtown Crossing) or the 4 bus. This lack of direct connection could be alleviated by the proposed (but currently shelved) North–South Rail Link, which <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a tunnel connecting the two terminals.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} {{proposal was}} presented by Oslo Sporveier in August 1996. It {{became clear that}} Berg would not be served by the Ring Line. Many neighbours to {{the route of the}} Sognsvann Line complained about this proposal, stating that they had hoped that the section from Majorstuen to Berg would have been rebuilt as a tunnel. They also argued that it was irrational that the line was running at-grade in densely populated areas, while it would run in a tunnel through the then mostly unpopulated Nydalen. To compensate, Oslo Sporveier stated that they <b>would</b> <b>build</b> noise screens along the line. Also, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration protested to the plans, and stated that funding should be allocated to upgrading Ring 3 to six lanes before public transport investments were made in the area.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union <b>would</b> <b>build</b> a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
