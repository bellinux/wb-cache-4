30|$|Most of {{methanogen}} {{was strictly}} anaerobic {{and a small}} amount of methanogen was anoxic and aerobic. According to the laying of gravity sewer, there are manholes among the sewers. Usually, there is oxygen in gravity sewers. In this study, the methane production was less than which obtained in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers in previous research (Guisasola et al. 2008, 2009). An important reason may be that anaerobic environment in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers is more beneficial to methane production. In addition, <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers were full of sewage so that biofilm could develop on the entire surface of sewers. There is an obvious difference between gravity sewer and <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer. Gravity sewers are not full of sewage. The biofilm could not grow on the places which are not covered with sewage. This would lead to difference in microorganism amount and that affects the methane production.|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of ferrous salts is a commonly used strategy for sulfide control in sewer networks. The Fe(2 +) dosing requirement in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers which {{takes into account}} {{of the effect of}} anaerobic sewer biofilms on the dosing demand is investigated. A laboratory-scale <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer, consisting of four biofilm reactors in series and fed with real sewage, was operated for over 12 months, during which FeCl(2) was dosed at several locations and at various dosing rates. The experimental results consistently revealed that approximately 0. 7 mol of Fe(2 +) was required to precipitate sulfide formed from the reduction of 1 mol of sulfate by anaerobic sewer biofilms. This ratio is significantly lower than the ratio expected from reaction stoichiometry (molar ratio of 1 : 1), and also the Fe(2 +) to sulfide ratio (1. 07 - 1. 10 mol: 1 mol) observed in batch tests conducted with real wastewater in the absence of sewer biofilms. Biofilms adapted to Fe(2 +) addition were found to contain a substantially higher amount of elemental sulfur than biofilms not receiving Fe(2 +) dosage. This suggests Fe(2 +) addition might have altered the final product of sulfate reduction by anaerobic sewer biofilms. The study also showed that the {{addition of}} ferrous salts at the inlet of a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer can effectively control sulfide throughout the whole system despite of the presence of competing anions in wastewater.

40|$|The anoxic and {{anaerobic}} sulfur transformation pathways in a laboratory-scale sewer receiving nitrate were investigated. Four reactors {{in series}} {{were employed to}} imitate a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer. The nitrate-dosing strategy was effective in controlling sulfide, as confirmed by the long-term sulfide measurements. Anoxic sulfide oxidation occurred in two sequential steps, namely the oxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur (S(0)) and the oxidation of S(0) to sulfate (SO(4) (2 -)). The second oxidation step, which primarily occurred when {{the first step was}} completed, had a rate that is approximately 15 % of the first step. When nitrate was depleted, sulfate and elemental sulfur were reduced simultaneously to sulfide. Sulfate reduction had a substantially higher rate (5 times) than S(0) reduction. The relatively slower S(0) oxidation and reduction rates implied that S(0) was an important intermediate during anoxic and anaerobic sulfur transformation. Electron microscopic studies indicated the presence of elemental sulfur, which was at a significant level of 9. 9 and 16. 7 mg-S/g-biomass in nitrate-free and nitrate-exposed sewer biofilms, respectively. A conceptual sulfur transformation model was established to characterize predominant sulfur transformations in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers receiving nitrate dosage.

40|$|Sewers {{systems are}} dynamic in nature, with {{periodic}} variation of hydraulic flow and wastewater substrate concentrations. While various models are currently available for predicting hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) production in rising mains, they assume constant biofilm activities {{along the length}} and ignore the effect of substrate availability on biofilm development. To investigate variation in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> biofilm structure and activity, detailed {{studies were carried out}} on a Robbins device setup, which was established in parallel to a real <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> that it simulated. The changes in wastewater characteristics, as wastewater traveled through both the experimental setup and the real sewer system, were monitored. The study revealed that the biofilm activities varied significantly with locations, with biofilm corresponding {{to the start of the}} <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> capable of greater sulfide and volatile fatty acid production than biofilm downstream. Analysis of microbial community composition of these biofilms showed a difference in diversity and abundance, both with regard to general bacterial populations and sulfate reducers. These differences were hypothesized to be a consequence of varying substrate types and availability along the sewer line. The results suggest that the biofilm structure and activity may vary considerably along the length of rising mains and should be taken into consideration for improved sewer modeling and when considering the overall effect of different hydrogen sulfide management options...|$|R

40|$|Anaerobic sewer biofilm is a {{composite}} of many different microbial populations, including sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), methanogens and heterotrophic bacteria. Nitrate addition to sewers {{in an attempt to}} control hydrogen sulfide concentrations affects the behaviour of these populations, which in turn impacts on wastewater characteristics. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory reactor system simulating a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> to determine the impact of nitrate addition on the microbial activities of anaerobic sewer biofilm. Nitrate was added {{to the start of the}} <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> during sewage pump cycles at a concentration of 30 mg-N Lâ 1 for over 5 months. While it reduced sulfide levels at the outlet of the system by 66 %, nitrate was not toxic or inhibitory to SRB activity and did not affect the dominant SRB populations in the biofilm. Long-term nitrate addition in fact stimulated additional SRB activity in downstream biofilm. Nitrate addition also stimulated the activity of nitrate reducing, sulfide oxidizing bacteria that appeared to be primarily responsible for the prevention of sulfide build up in the wastewater in the presence of nitrate. A short adaptation period of three to four nitrate exposure events (approximately 10 h) was required to stimulate biological sulfide oxidation, beyond which no sulfide accumulation was observed under anoxic conditions. Nitrate addition effectively controlled methane concentrations in the wastewater. The nitrate uptake rate of the biofilm increased with repeated exposure to nitrate, which in turn increased the consumption of biodegradable COD in the wastewater. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of nitrate addition on wastewater composition and sewer biofilm microbial activities, which will facilitate optimization of nitrate dosing for effective sulfide control in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the actual}} {{consumption}} of alcohol and tobacco in the population is important for forming public health policy. For this purpose, wastewater-based epidemiology has been applied as a complementary method to estimate the overall alcohol and tobacco consumption in different communities. However, the stability of their consumption biomarkers, ethyl sulfate, ethyl glucuronide, cotinine and trans- 3 '-hydroxycotinine, in the sewer system {{has not yet been}} assessed. This study aimed to conduct such assessment using sewer reactors mimicking conditions of <b>rising</b> <b>main,</b> gravity sewer and wastewater alone, over a 12 -hour period. The results show that cotinine and trans- 3 '-hydroxycotinine are relatively stable under all sewer conditions while ethyl sulfate was only stable in wastewater alone and gradually degraded in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> and gravity sewer conditions. Ethyl glucuronide quickly degraded in all reactors. These findings suggest that cotinine and trans- 3 '-hydroxycotinine are good biomarkers to estimate tobacco consumption; ethyl sulfate may be used as a biomarker to estimate alcohol consumption but its in-sewer loss should be accounted for in the calculation of consumption estimates. Ethyl glucuronide, and probably most of glucuronide compounds, are not suitable biomarkers to be used in wastewater-based epidemiology due to their in-sewer instability...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater-based {{epidemiology}} (WBE) {{is considered}} to be a useful tool for monitoring chemical consumption in the population. However, the lack of information on potential transformation of biomarkers in the sewer system can compromise the accuracy of the consumption estimation. The present study contributes to addressing this issue by investigating the in-sewer stability of biomarkers from a number of commonly used drugs using laboratory sewer reactors that can mimic different sewer conditions. A stable and an unstable chemical (carbamazepine and caffeine) were also used as benchmarking chemicals to reflect the chemical degradation potential in different sewer conditions. The results suggested that ketamine and norketamine were unstable in gravity and <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers, ketamine was unstable in bulk liquid while norketamine was stable under the same condition. Similarly, mephedrone and methylone were unstable in sewer conditions with considerable deviation. Significant loss of buprenorphine, methadone, oxycodone and codeine was observed in the <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer. Morphine and codeine glucuronide were found to be deconjugated from their glucuronides quickly in the presence of biofilms. This study indicates that it is important to evaluate the stability of biomarkers in the sewer system before using them in WBE for estimating consumption/exposure to reduce uncertainties...|$|R

40|$|Intermittent dosing of free {{nitrous acid}} (FNA), {{with or without}} the {{simultaneous}} dosing of hydrogen peroxide, is a new strategy developed recently for the control of sulfide production in sewers. Six-month field trials have been carried out in a <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewer in Australia (150 mm in diameter and 1080 m in length) to evaluate the performance of the strategy that was previously demonstrated in laboratory studies. In each trial, FNA was dosed at a pumping station for a period of 8 or 24 h, some with simultaneous hydrogen peroxide dosing. The sulfide control effectiveness was monitored by measuring, on-line, the dissolved sulfide concentration at a downstream location of the pipeline (828 m from the pumping station) and the gaseous H 2 S concentration at the discharge manhole. Effective sulfide control was achieved in all nine consecutive trials, with sulfide production reduced by more than 80 % in 10 days following each dose. Later trials achieved better control efficiency than the first few trials possibly due to the disrupting effects of FNA on sewer biofilms. This suggests that an initial strong dose (more chemical consumption) followed by maintenance dosing (less chemical consumption) could be a very cost-effective way to achieve consistent control efficiency. It was also found that heavy rainfall slowed the recovery of sulfide production after dosing, likely due to the dilution effects and reduced retention time. Overall, intermittent dose of FNA or FNA in combination with H 2 O 2 was successfully demonstrated to be a cost-effective method for sulfide control in <b>rising</b> <b>main</b> sewers...|$|R
