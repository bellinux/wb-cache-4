500|$|Durkheim {{agrees with}} Kant that within morality, {{there is an}} element of obligation, [...] "a moral {{authority}} which, by manifesting itself in certain precepts particularly important to it, confers upon [...] an obligatory character." [...] Morality tells us how to act from a position of superiority. There exists a certain, pre-established moral norm to <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> conform. It is through this view that Durkheim makes a first critique of Kant in saying that moral duties originate in society, and are not to be found in some universal moral concept such as the categorical imperative. Durkheim also argues that morality is characterized not just by this obligation, but is also something that is desired by the individual. The individual believes that by adhering to morality, they are serving the common Good, and for this reason, the individual submits voluntarily to the moral commandment.|$|E

500|$|Bothwell and Kilbourn {{describe}} Howe's speech {{opening the}} Pipeline Debate as [...] "probably {{the best of}} his career". He told the Commons that waiting a year would be imprudent, given the worldwide shortage of steel pipe, and unfair to those who owned natural gas wells in western Canada, which were presently capped. Howe told the House he believed this to be a great project, [...] "of truly national scope, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> either launch now or see languish for years to come." [...] He completed his address by giving notice that the following day, the Government intended to invoke closure. Social Credit, with many members from Alberta, supported the bill, while the Tories and CCF engaged in weeks of bitter debate and parliamentary wrangling. This culminated on 1 June, dubbed by the Tories [...] "Black Friday", when Speaker Ren√© Beaudoin reversed a ruling he had made the previous evening which would have allowed the Opposition to continue the debate past the deadline. The Opposition accused the Speaker of yielding to Government pressure. The bill passed within the deadline, and construction on the pipeline began immediately. Howe wrote, [...] "I should not like to face a general election at this moment. Fortunately we do not have to." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{resting his}} troops, General Greene recrossed the Dan and {{returned}} to North Carolina. [...] He and Cornwallis then engaged in a military dance of sorts, where Cornwallis tried to bring Greene to battle, while Greene, awaiting the arrival of more troops, sought to avoid it. [...] Cornwallis's force was also constantly suffering food shortages, and the earl ensured that officers and soldiers shared equally in the suffering. [...] Cornwallis was unable to intercept the arriving reinforcements, and learned that Greene had taken up a position at Guilford Courthouse on March 14, apparently ready to do battle. [...] In the ensuing battle the next day, Cornwallis was victorious, but at significant cost. [...] Greene's army had numbered over 4,000 men, while Cornwallis's was only about 2,000. [...] The British successfully pushed the Americans back, but Cornwallis was several times in personal danger, and {{he was forced to}} commit his reserves early in the battle. [...] With a furious melee going on before him and the outcome of the battle appearing to hang in the balance, Cornwallis made a controversial decision. [...] He ordered his artillery to load with grape shot and fire into the melee, which included men from the elite Brigade of Guards. [...] General O'Hara protested the move, but Cornwallis said [...] "This is a necessary evil <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> endure, to arrest the impending destruction." [...] A final charge then broke the Americans, who disengaged, leaving their artillery on the field. [...] Although Cornwallis had won the battle, he had lost a quarter of his army, and the survivors were exhausted.|$|E
500|$|Bridges' view of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{was taken}} up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 {{analysis}} of Keats's poems. As Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944, Garrod believed that the problem within Keats's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem. When describing the fourth stanza of the poem, Maurice Ridley, in 1933, claimed, [...] "And so comes the stanza, with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes, one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material." [...] He later declared of the seventh stanza: [...] "And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet whiter heat, the stanza that would, I suppose, by common consent be taken, along with Kubla Khan, as offering us the distilled sorceries of 'Romanticism'". He concluded on the stanza that [...] "I {{do not believe that}} any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes, and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining, will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which, in the draft we have, it was obviously written down." [...] In 1936, F. R. Leavis wrote, [...] "One remembers the poem both as recording, and as being for the reader, an indulgence." [...] Following Leavis, Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, in a 1938 essay, saw the poem as [...] "a very rich poem. It contains some complications <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not gloss over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged." [...] Brooks would later argue in The Well-Wrought Urn (1947) that the poem was thematically unified while contradicting many of the negative criticisms lodged against the poem.|$|E

2500|$|Ratzinger defended and reaffirmed Catholic doctrine, {{including}} {{teaching on}} {{topics such as}} birth control, homosexuality and inter-religious dialogue. The theologian Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others such as Matthew Fox were censured. Other issues also prompted condemnations or revocations of rights to teach: for instance, some posthumous writings of Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello were the subject of a notification. Ratzinger and the congregation viewed many of them, particularly the later works, as having an element of religious indifferentism (i.e., Christ was [...] "one master alongside others"). In particular, Dominus Iesus, published by the congregation in the jubilee year 2000, reaffirmed many recently [...] "unpopular" [...] ideas, including the Catholic Church's position that [...] "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> be saved."

2500|$|The first {{development}} that enabled the sefirot to unite in cooperation was the interinclusion {{within each of}} them of a further subset of the 10 sefirot, bringing them {{to a total of}} 100 inter-included sefirot. In Kabbalistic interpretation, the 7 emotive sefirot similarly inter-include to form 49 (7 times 7) emotional states. So, for example, Chesed contains chesed within chesed (loving-kindness within loving-kindness), gevurah within chesed (might within loving-kindness) etc. until malchut within chesed (kingdom within loving-kindness). Likewise, there is chesed within gevurah (loving-kindness within might, typified by a restriction performed out of love, like a father punishing a child)), gevurah within gevurah (might within might), etc. until malchut within gevurah (kingdom within might) and so on, until the 49th level, malchut within malchut (kingdom within kingdom). This is the Kabbalistic interpretation of the mitzvah (Jewish observance) of Counting of the Omer between the festivals of Passover and Shavuot. Passover commemorates the exodus from Egypt (in Hebrew [...] "Mitzrayim," [...] ◊û◊¶◊®◊ô◊ù, meaning [...] "limitations"), which represents the unrectified level of the psyche, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> escape through our daily spiritual development. Shavuot commemorates the receiving of the Torah on Mt. Sinai. During this 49 day period Kabbalah teaches the benefit of focusing on the aspect of the 49 inter-included sefirot that is related to each particular day of the Omer. On each day of the Omer, a person would examine each of their spiritual qualities, as a rectification process of Teshuva (Return to God), as preparation for reliving the acceptance of the Torah on Shavuot.|$|E
2500|$|A staunch modernist might scoff {{that with}} the [...] "Night Landings" [...] of 1970 Jane Frank's art begins to [...] "go gentle into that good night" [...] (perhaps even lapsing into [...] "postmodernism"). But if these more literal aerial landscapes - created in 1970 and after - lose some of the tension that gives the earlier {{paintings}} their distinctive power, they nevertheless address, with an intensely intimate delight, a perspective on reality <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> remember was still quite young in 1970, at least as a painterly subject. In [...] "Aerial Perception" [...] (1985), author Margret Dreikausen sees Jane Frank's aerial landscapes as sharing {{the spirit of the}} work of artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan Crile, and others, in creating images which [...] "reflect contemporary interest in reality", experienced from a historically new vantage point. Dreikausen insists that this art [...] "does not merely show landscape from the air" [...] but incorporates the [...] "earthbound vision" [...] into [...] "remembered images from both spaces". Dreikausen also sees Frank's aerial paintings as consisting of two basic types: the [...] "day scenes" [...] (such as [...] "Ledge of Light") and the [...] "night landings" [...] (such as [...] "Night Landing: Sambura"). [...] The day scenes show a fascination with the play of actual shadows and false, painted ones, [...] "inviting the viewer more closely to inspect the textures on the canvas and its 'reality' [...] ". In the night landings, by contrast, the city is the focus, nestled in the canvas's aperture, like a precious jewel in a dark velvet box, with its [...] "enticing twinkling lights", suggesting [...] "the anticipation of the unknown, mysterious city.... The use of beads and glitter, partially covered with paint, conveys a sense of personal landscape".|$|E
