He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E

She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him. I {{mentioned}} to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E

They hang on {{to each other in the}} sense of that when they got huge across the world, there was already a sense of family between them." ...|$|E

500|$|Television critic Scott D. Pierce {{revealed}} that NBC {{did not want}} television critics to give away too much detail about Jack and Cher's [...] "time together". In a June 2004 interview, actress Megan Mullally, who plays Karen, in regards to Cher's appearance, said: [...] "I wasn't sure about Cher's [...] They flew her in. Like, she was sort of dropped in on a crescent moon, she did the scene, and was, like, airlifted back out. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her {{she was in her}} full Cher Land drag, so I didn't get to experience her as a person." ...|$|E

She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E

Reynolds said, [...] "I've known about 'Green Lantern' my whole life, but I've never really followed it before. I {{fell in love with the}} character <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with Martin Campbell". Reynolds called the film [...] "an origin story to a certain degree, but it's not a labored origin story, where the movie begins in the third act. The movie starts when it starts. We find out Hal is the guy fairly early on, and the adventure begins". Alternatively Chris Pine and Sam Worthington had been in discussions for the role. Bradley Cooper, Jared Leto and Justin Timberlake were other top contenders, while Brian Austin Green, a Green Lantern fan, campaigned for the part, but ultimately did not audition.|$|E

500|$|Producer Lewis Merenstein had a {{background}} in jazz, and according to Merenstein, Morrison [...] "was not an aficionado of jazz <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him. R and soul, yes; but jazz, no. For the Astral Weeks recording sessions, Merenstein first contacted veteran bassist Richard Davis. Perhaps {{best known for his}} work with Eric Dolphy, Davis essentially served as the session leader, and it was through Davis that Merenstein recruited guitarist Jay Berliner, percussionist Warren Smith, Jr., and drummer Connie Kay. All of these musicians had strong backgrounds in jazz; Berliner had worked closely with Charles Mingus and Kay was part of the Modern Jazz Quartet. Morrison was still working with Kielbania and Payne, but for these sessions, they were essentially replaced. According to Kielbania, [...] "I got to show all the bass lines to Richard Davis. He embellished a lot of them, but I gave him the feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|Rado and Ragni {{brought their}} drafts {{of the show}} to {{producer}} Eric Blau who, through common friend Nat Shapiro, connected the two with Canadian composer Galt MacDermot. MacDermot had won a Grammy Award in 1961 for his composition [...] "African Waltz" [...] (recorded by Cannonball Adderley). [...] The composer's lifestyle was {{in marked contrast to}} his co-creators: [...] "I had short hair, a wife, and, at that point, four children, and I lived on Staten Island." [...] "I never even heard of a hippie <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Rado and Ragni." [...] But he shared their enthusiasm to do a rock and roll show. [...] "We work independently," [...] explained MacDermot in May 1968. [...] "I prefer it that way. [...] They hand me the material. [...] I set it to music." [...] MacDermot wrote the first score in three weeks, starting with the songs [...] "I Got Life", [...] "Ain't Got No", [...] "Where Do I Go" [...] and the title song. [...] He first wrote [...] "Aquarius" [...] as an unconventional art piece, but later rewrote it into an uplifting anthem.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breakaway" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers, which was shot in two days from July 10 to July 11, 2004. In the video, the younger version of Clarkson was played by Lindsey Krueger. According to Meyers, working with Clarkson was a pleasant experience because he felt she was good and honest, although he had initial doubts in the beginning. He explained, [...] "I was a little worried, her coming off 'American Idol,' it inherently feels manufactured and I didn't {{know how much of}} it was true artistry. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her, she really does have a good, solid vibe. It was an honor to bring some of that out of her." [...] Since the song is autobiographical, Clarkson decided to act out most of the lyrics in the video. Meyers also realized that the song was featured in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement and he struggled {{to find a way to}} address the film-footage in the music video, saying [...] "Since it's a movie tie-in, the idea stems from trying to figure out a new way of addressing the film-footage requirement they put on you, so we came up with the idea of her attending the premiere, which is very much something she will do in real life." ...|$|E

[...] Rapper Drake said that the singer has had the biggest influence on his career. He also has a tattoo of the singer on his back. Solange Knowles remarked on the tenth anniversary of her death that she idolized Aaliyah and proclaimed that she would never be forgotten. Adam Levine, the lead vocalist of the pop rock group Maroon 5, remembers that listening to [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of his then-band Kara's Flowers. Erika Ramirez, associate editor of Billboard.com, said at the time of Aaliyah's career [...] "there weren't many artists using the kind of soft vocals the ways she was using it, and now {{you see a lot of}} artists doing that and finding success," [...] her reasoning for Aaliyah's continued influence on current artists. She argued that Aaliyah's second album One in a Million was [...] "very much ahead of its time, with the bass and electro kind of R sounds that they produced", referring to collaborators Timbaland and Missy Elliott and that the sound, which [...] "really stood out" [...] at its time, was being replicated.|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
500|$|Straczynski {{described}} specific {{visual cues}} in the screenplay, {{such as in}} Sanford Clark's confession scene. Clark's flashback to a falling axe is juxtaposed with the crumbling ash from Detective Ybarra's cigarette. The image served two purposes: it was an aesthetic correlation between the axe and the cigarette, and it suggested that Ybarra was so shocked by Clark's confession {{that he had not}} moved or even smoked in the 10 minutes Clark took to tell his story. As with most of the cues, Eastwood shot the scene as written. To ensure the veracity of the story, Straczynski incorporated quotes from the historical record, including court testimony, into the dialogue. He also included photocopies of news clippings every 15–20 pages in the script to remind people the story was a true one. So the credits could present the film as [...] "a true story" [...] rather than as [...] "based on" [...] one, Straczynski went through the script with Universal's legal department, providing attribution for every scene. Straczynski believed the only research error he made was in a scene that referenced Scrabble, pre-dating its appearance on the market by two years. He changed the reference to a crossword puzzle. He did not alter the shooting script any further from his first draft; though Straczynski had written two more drafts for Howard, Eastwood insisted the first draft be filmed as he felt it had the clearest voice of the three. Straczynski said, [...] "Clint's funny—if he likes it, he'll do it, that's the end of the discussion. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with him to ask, 'Do you want any changes, do you want any things cut, added to, subtracted from, whatever', he said, 'No. The draft is fine.
