5|$|A painter whose {{creative}} output spanned {{nearly three}} decades, controversy erupted briefly in 1999, when disputed declarations <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> artist regarding whether some works under his signature {{had been painted}} by some female relatives. Creator of the work Straightening spears at Ilyingaungau (1990), Tolson's paintings are held by several major Australian public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and the National Museum of Australia.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, concerted efforts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe {{to destroy}} the main {{manufacturing}} plants at Woolston and Itchen, near Southampton. The first bombing raid, which missed the factories, came on 23 August 1940. Over the next month, other raids were mounted until, on 26 September 1940, both factories were destroyed, with 92 people killed {{and a large number}} injured. Most of the casualties were experienced aircraft production workers.|$|E
50|$|In {{developing}} this in Book X, Plato told of Socrates' {{metaphor of the}} three beds: one bed exists as an idea <b>made</b> <b>by</b> God (<b>the</b> Platonic ideal); one <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> carpenter, in imitation of God's idea; one <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> artist in imitation of the carpenter's.|$|R

A {{small part of}} the Montgomery County territory was detached, as were parts of Fayette County in Washington Court House in Union Township and the townships of Jasper and Marion. Part of Brown County was added, Jackson and Eagle Townships. These were the boundaries for the rest of McEwen's service in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Perseus {{was fitted}} with an {{experimental}} steam catapult. The catapult {{was placed on}} top of the carrier's existing flight deck and the deckhouse to port of the island was removed to accommodate it. Some 1,560 launches <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> catapult, beginning with over 1,000 wheeled dead-loads, of gradually increasing weight, and moving on to with unmanned aircraft with their wings truncated to reduce their ability to glide. The final tests were made by manned aircraft of every type flown by the Fleet Air Arm. After this, the ship arrived in Philadelphia on 14 January 1952 to demonstrate the catapult to the United States Navy. Between them, some 127 launches of manned aircraft <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British and the Americans. Perseus arrived back at Portsmouth on 21 March and had the catapult removed. All of her remaining maintenance equipment was removed and she was converted for use as a ferry carrier.|$|E

5|$|Minor {{alterations}} <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Caliphs Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1009 and Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah in 1125. The Caliph al-Hafiz (1129–1149) {{made significant}} further changes, adding a fourth arcade with keel arches, and a dome with elaborate carved stucco decorations {{in front of}} the transept. Since then, the mosque has been greatly enlarged and modified over the years. Of the original building little remains other than the arcades and some of the stucco decoration.|$|E
5|$|Only {{very small}} {{allowances}} <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> government to families of POWs, {{which was not}} sufficient to offset the economic difficulties caused. The large proportion of men in prisoner of war camps changed the gender balance in jobs. Many women took over running family farms and businesses, and others were forced to look for employment.|$|E
5|$|Plotland {{development}} {{elsewhere in}} Britain was bulldozed following the Second World War, and various attempts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local council to demolish Jaywick, {{but there was}} resistance from residents, who campaigned against this and won a preservation order in 1970. The council were unhappy about a housing development sitting on such a flood-prone site, and modern conveniences were slow in arriving. A mains sewer system was only installed in 1977.|$|E

5|$|Use-wear {{analysis}} {{indicates that}} the plates on the pommel and the crossguard <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same artist, while the plates on the grip were added later. The latter – obverse and reverse – were probably decorated in the same workshop and using the same tools, but by two different craftsmen. Moreover, a side plate with a rhombic pattern was added in the 19th century to replace one of the lost inscripted side plates.|$|E

5|$|After {{a number}} of failed {{attempts}} at colonising Tobago, Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland and Semigallia sent one more ship to the island, which landed there on 20 May 1654, carrying soldiers and colonists, who named the island New Courland. At approximately the same time, Dutch colonies were established at other locations on the island, and eventually outgrew those of the Duchy of Courland in population. When the Duke was captured by Swedish forces in 1658, Dutch settlers overtook the Courland colonies, forcing the Governor to surrender. After a return of the territory to Courland through the 1660 Treaty of Oliwa, {{a number of}} attempts <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> next Duke of Courland (Friedrich Casimir Kettler) at re-colonisation, but these met with failure, and he sold New Courland in 1689.|$|E
5|$|Although {{set in a}} hospital, it uses {{no medical}} storylines; the action is {{produced}} {{by a series of}} soap opera-style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters. They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch-like scenes, or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up, often emphasizing the body language of the characters. The show had eight writers. Two series <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Talkback Thames production company for Channel 4.|$|E
5|$|Anarky {{retained}} {{interest among}} a cult fan base during this obscure period.

In response, editors and writers of 52 indicated Anarky would {{be included in the}} series. However, the series concluded without Anarky making an appearance, and with no explanation given by anyone involved in the production of the series for the failed appearance.|$|E
