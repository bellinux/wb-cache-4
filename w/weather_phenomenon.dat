5|$|A <b>weather</b> <b>phenomenon</b> {{known as}} the föhn (with an {{identical}} effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E

Newspaper archives have many photographs of regional damage dating back to the beginnings of news reporting in Los Angeles. When the Los Angeles Basin was primarily an agricultural region, the winds were feared particularly by farmers for their potential to destroy crops.|$|E

25|$|The region {{receives}} {{rain and}} snow precipitation through two primary weather patterns: the Indian Monsoon and the Western Disturbances. The Monsoon carries moisture northwards from the Indian Ocean, occurs {{in late summer}} and {{is important to the}} Kharif or autumn harvest. Western Disturbances, on the other hand, are an extratropical <b>weather</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that carry moisture eastwards from the Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. They primarily occur during the winter season and are critically important for the Rabi or spring harvest, which includes the main staple over much of North India, wheat. The states of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand receive sustained snowfall in winter months.|$|E

25|$|From 1994 through 1998, {{under the}} {{government}} of Alberto Fujimori, the economy recorded robust growth driven by foreign direct investment, almost 46% of which {{was related to the}} privatization program. The government invested heavily on the country's infrastructure, which became a solid foundation {{for the future of the}} Peruvian economy. The economy stagnated from 1998 through 2001, the result of the century's strongest El Niño <b>weather</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> global financial turmoil, political instability, a stalled privatization program, increased government intervention in markets, and worsening terms of trade. President Alejandro Toledo implemented a recovery program after taking office, maintained largely orthodox economic policies, and took measures to attract investment, including restarting the privatization program. Nonetheless, political uncertainty led to GDP growth of 0.2% in 2001. The Lima Stock Exchange general index fell 34.5% in 2000 and 0.2% in 2001. Inflation remained at record lows, registering 3.7% in 2000.|$|E
25|$|As thermal {{radiation}} travels, more or less, {{in a straight}} line from the fireball (unless scattered) any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the exposed area outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a <b>weather</b> <b>phenomenon</b> as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the flash, with radiant energy then reaching burn sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of perfect visibility and therefore zero scattering. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few, if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun's infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open {{is just a matter of}} being protected from the explosion's flash energy.|$|E

500|$|Depending on {{how fast}} the winds from a {{waterspout}} are whipping, anything that is within about one yard of {{the surface of the}} water, including fish of different sizes, frogs, and even turtles, can be lifted into the air. A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish {{out of the water and}} all the way up into the cloud. Even if the waterspout stops spinning, the fish in the cloud can be carried over land, buffeted up and down and around with the cloud’s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere. Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere, the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down. People as far as [...] inland have experienced raining fish.

State governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz noted that the city of Monterrey had [...] "collapsed due to the worst <b>weather</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in its history." [...] In the municipality of Santa Catarina alone, 50,000 people were affected, with property damage being estimated at $1.2 billion (2010 MXN; 93.5 million USD). Residents from three colonias in García had to be permanently relocated as 800 homes were destroyed; the storm caused $900 million (2010 MXN; 70 million USD) in damage in the municipality. The flooding Santa Catarina River destroyed four bridges in Monterrey; at least 60 bridges were damaged statewide. Governor Medina also announced on July3 the allocation of $1.4 billion (2010 MXN; $107 million USD) for repairs to Monterrey's arterial streets. Municipalities {{in the metropolitan area}} used contraflow during part of the day to re-establish traffic in sections where the arterial streets bordering the Santa Catarina River were damaged only in one direction. The repairs to Monterrey's main roadways were estimated to take up to three months to complete.|$|E

40|$|Variations in temperature, {{precipitation}} {{and wind}} depend on variations in topography, vegetation, surface properties and topographic lines {{in a given}} landscape.
