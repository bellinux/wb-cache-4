Iron ore miners in Port Hedland and Dampier monitored Rosita's approach.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 24hours {{prior to}} Mamie's third landfall, all ships <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> {{in the port}} of Dalian to evacuate; however, 152 ships stayed at the port. Shortly after making landfall, Mamie was {{considered}} the worst storm to affect northeastern China in 26years. The nation was already inundated by significant flooding earlier in the summer of1985, especially from Typhoon Nelson.|$|E
5|$|Authorities in El Salvador {{declared}} a national state of alert {{in response to}} the potential threat from the hurricane. Residents in flood-prone areas <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> of potential flash flooding. As the hurricane turned sharply to the northwest, there are no reports of damage or deaths from Pauline in the country. Officials in Puerto Madero closed port facilities to all ships, excluding ships in open seas seeking shelter. The government ultimately closed six major ports between Acapulco and Puerto Madero. State authorities in Oaxaca opened 75emergency shelters and prepared 50schools to house 10,000people.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, oil {{and mining}} {{operations}} in threatened regions were temporarily shut down. Already {{suffering from the}} impacts of Cyclones Clare and Daryl, residents <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> about the likelihood of flooding due to the already saturated grounds. The Bureau of Meteorology also issued tropical cyclone warnings {{for most of the}} Pilbara coastline on 28 February. The same day, the Fire and Emergency Services of Australia issued a Yellow Alert for Point Samson, Roebourne, Wickham, Dampier, Karratha, and Mardie. Residents in these areas were advised to evacuate if necessary and ensure that all cyclone preparations had been completed. Shelters were also opened for residents who sought need for one. Schools throughout the Pilbara region were also closed for several days {{as a result of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|As the Chinese Civil War was raging at {{the time}} and Communist forces were attacking river boats {{travelling}} from Chongqing, it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air. The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only. After arriving in Hong Kong, the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea. Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China, and the Australian aircrew <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton.|$|E

This impacted the Chief Secretary, Secretaries, Commissioners, District Magistrates, and police officials. She suspended 12 IAS officers for laxity in carrying out development projects in their regions, including Divisional Commissioners and District Magistrates. Six IPS officers were suspended for failing to maintain law and order, while 24 officers <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> to improve.

5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> {{of the dangers of}} asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as they were allowed to return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> to stay in their houses the day before the raid.|$|E
5|$|In Colima and Jalisco, {{residents}} <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> {{of heavy}} rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for June21. In Colima, 236 shelters were {{opened to the}} public. Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief. A total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, {{many of which were}} in Acapulco, as many residents were expected to evacuate flood-prone area. An orange-level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains. Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (National Weather Service) advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of Beatriz.|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E

5|$|On 7 January 1992, {{a pair of}} Italian Army Agusta-Bell AB-206L LongRanger {{helicopters}} operated by ECMM observers entered Croatian air space from Hungary. The helicopters were white-painted and unarmed. They were flying from the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade to Zagreb via Kaposvár, Hungary. Authorities in Belgrade claim the helicopters were authorised to fly to Hungary, but that the pilots <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> they {{were not allowed to}} fly to Zagreb because no flights in Croatian airspace were permitted. The EC dismissed those claims, saying that the flight was approved in advance by Yugoslav air controllers. The approval was forwarded to the Yugoslav Air Force operations centre, but the order was never forwarded to the 5th Aviation Corps in Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3, {{a warning}} for winds of 100185km/h (62115mph), for areas of {{southern}} Luzon.

Metro Manila and the Tagalog provinces <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> of possible flooding and strong winds.|$|E
5|$|The Allied 'congress' {{met again}} {{in the spring of}} 480 BC. A Thessalian {{delegation}} suggested that the allies could muster in the narrow Vale of Tempe, on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes's advance. A force of 10,000 Allies led by the Spartan polemarch Euenetus and Themistocles was thus despatched to the pass. However, once there, they <b>were</b> <b>warned</b> by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed by at least two other passes, and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelming; the Allies therefore retreated. Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont. The abandonment of Tempe meant that all of Thessaly submitted to the Persians, as did many cities {{to the north of the}} pass of Thermopylae when it seemed help was not forthcoming.|$|E

In June, the division was withdrawn to Authie. The New Zealanders returned to the Somme front in early July, and settled into a sector east of Hébuterne that included Rossignol Wood. As with the division's previous stint on the Somme, trench raids were often carried out. During a raid mounted on 23 July, Sergeant Richard Travis performed actions {{that led to a}} posthumous award of the VC; he was killed the next day. A prominent soldier and renowned for his scouting skills, his death was mourned across the division.|$|E

As Rivoli neared completion, HMS Victorious was dispatched from the Mediterranean Fleet to intercept her should she leave port. Victorious was commanded by John Talbot, a successful and popular officer who had distinguished himself with the capture of the French frigate Ville de Milan in 1805 and his service in the Dardanelles Operation of 1807. Talbot was accompanied by the 18-gun brig HMS Weazel under Commander John William Andrew.|$|E
