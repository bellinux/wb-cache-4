5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|Lower {{temperature}} LDRs (120–200°C) require pumping. They {{are common}} in extensional terrains, where heating takes place via deep circulation along faults, {{such as in the}} Western US and Turkey. Water passes through a heat exchanger in a Rankine cycle binary plant. The water vaporizes an organic <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> that drives a turbine. These binary plants originated in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s and predominate in new US plants. Binary plants have no emissions.|$|E
5|$|A {{parabolic}} trough {{consists of a}} linear parabolic reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} parabolic mirror and is filled with a <b>working</b> <b>fluid.</b> The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. Parabolic trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E

The optimum combination of these design parameters gives maximum refrigeration effect and minimum desired efforts. The {{performance of}} the cryocooler depends significantly on the regenerator functioning and the <b>working</b> <b>fluids.</b> The mesh size of the regenerator affects dead space, pressure drop, regenerator effectiveness, etc. The <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> differ in their thermal properties and therefore affect the performance significantly The present paper aims to study the influence of regenerator matrix and <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> on these design parameters.

30|$|The {{parameters}} {{used for}} the case study are given in Appendix B. In this section, a sensitivity analysis is conducted {{to gain a better}} understanding of which the configuration parameters have a critical impact on the accumulated heat energy. The simulations are based on the comparison of both the outlet temperature of the extracted fluids and the heat accumulated from the well calculated by Eq. (8). In the sensitivity analysis, one parameter is varied over a reasonable range, while the rest are kept at the defined values, as given in Table  2. The parameters chosen for the analysis are the density of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> the thermal conductivity of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> the specific heat capacity of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> the viscosity of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> the inlet temperature of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> the effect of insulation, and geostring diameter.|$|R

5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of {{parabolic}} mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two tubes with <b>working</b> <b>fluid.</b> This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than parabolic mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) systems use lenses or {{mirrors and}} {{tracking}} systems to focus {{a large area}} of sunlight into a small beam. The concentrated heat is then used as a heat source for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light. In all of these systems a <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage.|$|E
5|$|Experimental mercury vapor {{turbines}} {{were installed}} {{to increase the}} efficiency of fossil-fuel electrical power plants. The South Meadow power plant in Hartford, CT employed mercury as its <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> in a binary configuration with a secondary water circuit, {{for a number of years}} starting in the late 1920s in a drive to improve plant efficiency. Several other plants were built, including the Schiller Station in Portsmouth, NH, which went online in 1950. The idea did not catch on industry-wide due to the weight and toxicity of mercury, as well as the advent of supercritical steam plants in later years.|$|E
30|$|Figure  6 {{illustrates}} the variation of COPs {{as a function}} of Th. In Figure  6, with the increase of Th, COPs increases for all <b>working</b> <b>fluids.</b> COPs equals the product of ηp and COPc. ηp for R 123 is the lowest among the six <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> as shown in Figure  2, and COPc is however highest for R 123 among the six <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> in Table  2; as a result, the product of ηp and COPc is highest. As evident in Figure  6, R 123 has the highest COPs and R 290 has the lowest COPs for all heat source temperatures. Except R 290, the differences between COPs for the five other <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> are very small. For example, COPs is 26.76 %, 26.45 %, 26.01 %, 25.72 % and 25.47 % for <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> R 123, R 134 a, R 600, R 245 fa and R 600 a, respectively, at Th = 80 °C, and they respectively increase to 35.04 %, 34.55 %, 33.97 %, 33.52 % and 33.21 % at Th = 95 °C.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the current}} paper, under the {{condition}} of different flue gas temperatures and constant flue gas thermal power, the influence of different organic <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> on the efficiency of sub-critical organic Rankine cycle system were studied. The efficiency and other parameters of the simple system were calculated. The {{results show that the}} efficiency of sub-critical organic Rankine cycle system could reach maximum when the parameters of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> in the expander inlet are dry-saturation. Flammability, toxicity, ozone depletion and other factors of the <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> should be considered in the organic Rankine cycles. R 245 fa is considered a better choice for low-temperature heat source power generation, and the efficiency of the system is about 10. 2 %; for the high-temperature heat source, R 601 a can be considered; however, due to its high flammability, novel <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> should be further discovered for power generation...|$|R

25|$|A Stirling engine uses a {{single-phase}} <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> that {{maintains an}} internal pressure {{close to the}} design pressure, and thus for a properly designed system the risk of explosion is low. In comparison, a steam engine uses a two-phase gas/liquid <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> so a faulty overpressure relief valve can cause an explosion.|$|E
25|$|A Stirling {{engine is}} a heat engine that {{operates}} by cyclic compression {{and expansion of}} air or other gas (the <b>working</b> <b>fluid)</b> at different temperatures, such {{that there is a}} net conversion of heat energy to mechanical work. More specifically, the Stirling engine is a closed-cycle regenerative heat engine with a permanently gaseous <b>working</b> <b>fluid.</b> Closed-cycle, in this context, means a thermodynamic system in which the <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is permanently contained within the system, and regenerative describes the use of a specific type of internal heat exchanger and thermal store, known as the regenerator. The inclusion of a regenerator differentiates the Stirling engine from other closed cycle hot air engines.|$|E

25|$|Centrifugal {{compressors}} {{are also}} similar to centrifugal pumps {{of the style}} shown in the adjacent figures. The key difference between such compressors and pumps is that the compressor <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is a gas (compressible) and the pump <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is liquid (incompressible).

30|$|The {{temperature}} {{of hot water}} from hot springs varies according to the season and weather, leading to the temperature variation of hot water at the generator inlet. As a result, the generation temperature Tboi varies with the variation of Th. Figure  2 exhibits ηp for different <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> {{as a function of}} Th. It is obvious from Figure  2 that for all <b>working</b> <b>fluids,</b> ηp depends largely on Th and it increases with the increase of Th. R 290 has the maximum ηp compared with the five other <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> for all heat source temperatures, followed by R 134 a, and R 123 has the minimum ηp. Except R 134 a, ηp for HCs is higher than those for R 123 and R 245 fa. ηp is 6.75 %, 6.57 %, 5.92 %, 5.75 %, 5.62 % and 5.53 % for <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> R 290, R 134 a, R 600 a, R 600, R 245 fa and R 123, respectively, at Th = 85 °C, signifying that ηp for R 290 is 1.22 times higher than that for R 123.|$|R
25|$|Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} and occasionally used.

Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by Goldsworthy Gurney in the UK and the St. Charles Avenue Streetcar line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s, and during World War II ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the Stirling engine is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the working parts of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the <b>working</b> <b>fluid.</b> Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall into the category of reciprocating piston engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of crewed spacecraft requires identifying and evaluating chemical compounds that may present reactivity and compatibility risks with the environmental control and life support (ECLS) system. Such risks must be understood so that appropriate design and operational controls, including specifying containment levels, can be instituted or an appropriate substitute material selected. Operational experience acquired during the International Space Station (ISS) program has found that understanding ECLS system and environmental impact presented by thermal control system <b>working</b> <b>fluids</b> is imperative to safely operating any crewed space exploration vehicle.

25|$|A popular {{choice of}} <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> is ammonia, which has {{superior}} transport properties, easy availability, and low cost. Ammonia, however, is toxic and flammable.

Hydrocarbons too are good candidates, but they are highly flammable; in addition, this would create competition for use of them directly as fuels. The power plant size is dependent upon the vapor pressure of the <b>working</b> <b>fluid.</b> With increasing vapor pressure, {{the size of the}} turbine and heat exchangers decreases while the wall thickness of the pipe and heat exchangers increase to endure high pressure especially on the evaporator side.|$|E
