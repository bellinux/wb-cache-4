2500|$|For {{most of the}} show's history, {{the usual}} order {{of the show is}} the Introduction {{followed}} by a Johnson <b>Wax</b> <b>plug</b> by Harlow then his introduction to Section 1 of the script (usually 11 minutes). Billy Mills usually follows with an instrumental (or accompanied by Martha Tilton in 1941). That musical interlude then segues to Section 2 of the script, followed by a performance by the vocal group The Kings Men (occasionally featuring a solo by leader Ken Darby). The final act then ensues, with the last line usually showing the lesson learned that day, a final commercial, and then Billy Mills' theme song to fade. Later, Harlow would meet up and visit with the McGees and work in a Johnson Wax commercial, sometimes assisted by Fibber and Molly.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that stomatal <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> in Agathis robusta (C. Moore ex F. Muell.) F. Muell. (Araucariaceae) protect leaves against fungal invasion by preventing hyphae entering the stomatal pore was tested. Leaves with intact <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> and leaves from which <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> had been experimentally removed were inoculated with either Botrytis cinerea (De Bary) Whetzel or Alternaria solani (Ellis & G. Martin) L. R. Jones & Grout. Interactions of fungal hyphae with stomata were subsequently analysed by scanning electron microscopy. <b>Wax</b> <b>plugs</b> blocked the penetration of fungal hyphae into stomata of A. robusta in 100 % of encounters. In contrast, hyphae readily penetrated stomata of leaves from which <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> {{had been removed}} or where the <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> were damaged. On rare occasions, hyphae were also observed to penetrate directly through the cuticle. Florin rings around the external surface of stomata also acted to deflect fungal hyphae from the stomatal opening. Formation and degradation of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> was also examined to assess the period over which they offer protection from fungal invasion. <b>Wax</b> <b>plugs</b> formed in young leaves in spring and were complete by summer. There was subsequent degradation of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> in the following winter, and they then regenerated again in spring. However, regeneration of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> appeared to decline after the leaves reached 2 years of age. The data are discussed {{with reference to the}} adaptive significance of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> in conifers and other plants. Mansour A. Mohammadian, Robert S. Hill and Jennifer R. Watlin...|$|R
40|$|Tropospheric ozone is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon causing injuries to forest trees. Californian pon-derosa and Jeffrey pines {{are well known}} for their sensitivity to ozone, while other pine species have varied in their susceptibility. Sensitive pine species {{are known for their}} chlorotic mottle and tip burn symptoms, caused by ozone air pollution. Epistomatal <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> and filamentous <b>waxes</b> around stomata are typical for pine needle surfaces. In this study, we investigated epistomatal and epicuticular needle waxes in eight species of field-grown pines in 1985, 1986 and 2006. The epis-tomatal <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> were present in asymptomatic needles without chlorotic mottle (23 % of needles). A lack of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> in needles with chlorotic mottle and tip burn symptoms was common (76 % of needles).

40|$|A novel active valving technique, whereby {{paraffin}} <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> in microchannels on a centrifugal microfluidic platform are actuated using focused infrared (IR) {{radiation is}} demonstrated in this report. Microchannels were simultaneously or sequentially opened using a stationary IR source by forming <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> with similar or differing melting points. The presented <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> offer key advantages over current active valving techniques, including a less involved fabrication procedure, a simpler actuation process, {{and the ability}} to multiplex experiment with active valves. In addition, a new technique for automated liquid reagent storage and release on the microfluidic disc platform, based on the formation and removal of a wax layer, is demonstrated. Overall, the techniques presented in this report offer novel methods for liquid handling, separation, and storage on the centrifugal microfluidic disc platform. close 272...|$|R
40|$|Hard {{gelatin capsule}} was coated by a {{cellulose}} acetate as a semi permeable membrane {{with or without}} castor oil and filled with propranolol hydrochloride, and sorbitol as an osmotic agent. After sealing the capsule with white bees <b>wax</b> <b>plug,</b> the onset of release and dissolution rate of the drug were studied. Water penetration into the capsule from the dissolution medium increases simultaneously the osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of its content. When the hydrostatic pressure is high enough to overweigh the gravity and frictional forces of the plug, the expulsion of the plug occurs and drug release starts. The effects of thicknesses of the membrane and plug {{as well as the}} concentrations of cellulose acetate and castor oil on the onset of drug release were presented by a polynomial model. It was found that the effect of plug thickness on the onset of release is more important when the membrane is thicker. The results showed that the presence of caster oil in coating formulation (cellulose acetate 10 % or 15 %) increased the onset of release (to values). The onset of release varied from 0. 6 to 10. 5 h among which the onset times of 4. 2, 4. 8, 5. 9, 5. 5, 7. 5, 5. 0, 7. 8 and 10. 5 h could be of use for either chronotherapeutic purposes in protection of patients against heart attacks and strokes during early morning hours or reducing daily frequency of dosage...|$|E

There was no effect produced by imbricacy in itself, but when combined with epistomy, gmax was significantly reduced to about 17 % of theoretical gmax. This is clearly illustrated by comparisons of juvenile-adult foliage, and closely related imbricate and non-imbricate species.

40|$|An {{examination}} of the morphology and photosynthetic physiology of the two dominant families of conifers in the southern hemisphere, the Podocarpaceae and Cupressaceae, was undertaken here in order to describe the physiological limitations which constrain their distribution. A species specific index of drought tolerance was devised which quantified the maximum attainable water-use efficiency of photosynthesis during imposed drought. This index, (ci/c a) min, measured the potential of leaves to photosynthesize under water stress, comparing the maximum draw-down of internal CO 2 concentration (ci) below ambient (ca). When operating at (ci/c a) min, the leaf was at the maximum water stress before leaf damage (indicated by an irreversible loss of variable fluorescence and photosynthetic rate) occurred. (ci/c a) min {{was found to be}} well correlated with the minimum rainfall within the natural range of the 12 species investigated, and this is strong evidence that the distribution of these species is largely determined by their drought tolerance. Further support for the drought limitation hypothesis came from a comparison of photosynthetic rates (as measured by chlorophyll fluorescence) of conifers in the field. The apparent photochemical electron transport rate (ETR) was found to be significantly reduced in a dry site when compared with a wet site. Most Podocarpaceae, and many Cupressaceae were found to be highly drought sensitive, and probably became increasingly susceptible to extinction during the substantial increase in aridity which occurred in Australia during the Tertiary. The influence of features considered as possible morphological drought adaptations on water loss were also examined. <b>Wax</b> <b>plugs</b> and imbricacy were found to substantially decrease maximum stomatal conductance, with the combination of <b>wax</b> <b>plugs,</b> imbricacy and epistomy reducing conductance to 17...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} novel vacuum/compression valves (VCVs) utilizing paraffin wax. A VCV {{is implemented}} by sealing the venting channel/hole with <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> (for normally-closed valve), {{or to be}} sealed by wax (for normally-open valve), and is activated by localized heating on the CD surface. We demonstrate that the VCV provides the advantages of avoiding unnecessary heating of the sample/reagents in the diagnostic process, allowing for vacuum sealing of the CD, and clear separation of the paraffin wax from the sample/reagents in the microfluidic process. As a proof of concept, the microfluidic processes of liquid flow switching and liquid metering is demonstrated with the VCV. Results show that the VCV lowers the required spinning frequency to perform the microfluidic processes with high accuracy and ease of control. open 5...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{delineate}} the pattern of bone regeneration from cortical bone segments during distraction lengthening. The lengthening procedure was applied for various periods through the Ilizarov system on the forearms of mature dogs. Bone was sectioned either by corticotomy, preserving the nutrient artery integrity, or by osteotomy. When an osteotomy was performed, the marrow cavity was in some cases plugged with either resorbable bone wax or nonresorbable material. Under distraction, both periosteal and medullary callus on either side of the gap gave rise to new bone trabeculae. The trabeculae on either side were oriented along the direction of distraction and progressively approached one another. This striated callus emerging from both sides was the most characteristic pattern of bone regeneration subsequent to distraction lengthening. Fusion was achieved approximately four weeks after the end of the lengthening period. Most of the new bone was formed by membranous ossification; some cartilaginous nodules developed. Corticalization of the bone trabeculae that had begun at three months was not fully achieved at five months after the lengthening period. There were no differences found in the pattern of bone healing and the amount of newly formed bone after corticotomy or osteotomy with or without resorbable bone <b>wax</b> <b>plugging...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two-photon {{excitation}} microscopy (TPEM) {{was used}} to monitor the air-to-leaf transfer and within-leaf movement and distribution of phenanthrene in two plant species (maize and spinach) grown within a contaminated atmosphere. Phenanthrene was visualized within the leaf cuticle, epidermis, mesophyll, and vascular system of living maize and spinach plants. No detectable levels of phenanthrene were observed in the roots or stems of either species, suggesting phenanthrene entered the leaves only from the air. Phenanthrene was observed in both the abaxial and adaxial cuticles of both species. Particulate material (aerosols/dust) contaminated with phenanthrene was located at {{the surface of the}} cuticle and became encapsulated within the cuticular waxes. Over time, diffuse areas of phenanthrene formed within the adjacent cuticle. However, most of the visualized phenanthrene reaching the leaves arrived via gas-phase transfer. Phenanthrene was found within the <b>wax</b> <b>plugs</b> of stomata of both species and on the external surface of the stomatal pore, but not on the internal surface, or within the sub-stomatal cavity. Phenanthrene diffused through the cuticles of both species in 24 - 48 h, entering the epidermis to reside predominantly within the cell walls of maize (indicative of apoplastic transport) and the cellular cytoplasm of spinach (indicative of symplastic transport). Phenanthrene accumulated within the spinach cytoplasm where it concentrated into the vacuoles of the epidermal cells. Phenanthrene was not observed to accumulate in the cytoplasm of maize cells. Phenanthrene entered the internal mesophyll of both species, and was found within the mesophyll cell walls, at the surface of the chloroplasts, and within the cellular cytoplasm. Phenanthrene was observed within the xylem of maize following 12 days exposure. The cuticle and epidermis at the edges of spinach leaves had a systematically higher concentration of phenanthrene than the cuticle and epidermal cells {{at the center of the}} leaf. These results provide important new information about how such compounds enter, move, and distribute within leaves, and suggest that contemporary views of such processes based on data obtained from traditional analytical methods may need to be revised...|$|R
40|$|Wax begonia (Begonia × semperflorens?cultorum Hort.) plants often {{suffer from}} high {{temperature}} stress during hot seasons in Taiwan. Since salicylic acid (SA) {{has proved to}} enhance heat tolerance in many plants, this study evaluates whether exogenous SA applications could alleviate high temperature stress of <b>wax</b> begonias. <b>Plug</b> seedlings of <b>wax</b> begonia ‘Super Olympia’ were treated with 25, 100, 400, 800, with 1600 μM SA before 55 °C, for 2 h of high temperature stress. Results indicated that 25 ? 400 μM SA enhanced heat tolerance by reducing the value of Relative Injury (RI) and Malondialdehyde (MDA), whereas 800, 1600 μM SA had adverse effects. Transplanted plants of wax begonia ‘Super Olympia’ were treated with 25, 100, 400 μM SA before 35 °C, for 16 days of high temperature stress. Results showed that 25 ? 400 μM SA enhanced heat tolerance by maintaining a higher value of Chlorophyll Meter Reading (CMR), reducing leaf thickness {{and the number of}} red spotted leaves. Especially, 100 μM SA treatment had most significant improvement among 25 ? 400 μM SA treatments. The thermo protection period of 100 μM SA maintained significantly for 5 days, based on the lower value of F 0, RI, and MDA, and the higher value of Fm and Fv/Fm. Applying times up to 2 or 3 times extended protective effect significantly, based on reducing the value of RI and MDA, and increasing plant height and number of flowers. Either medium drench or foliar spray treatments improved heat tolerance of wax begonias. Medium drench treatments produced better thermo protection {{based on the results of}} higher Fm and Fv/Fm value. In conclusion, salicylic acid pretreatments with satisfactory concentrations between 25 to 400 μM proved to enhance heat tolerance in the wax begonia. Results recommend medium drench with 100 μM SA per week, up to 2 ? 3 times as the most optimal application of SA...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} life {{partially}} depends {{on the ability to}} maintain the transportation of goods and people in an efficient and reliable fashion, even under difficult climatic conditions. A well-known problem at low temperatures is the filter blockage of diesel fuel. Fuel oils contain alkanes that precipitate at low temperature as large crystals or spherulites of wax {{in such a way as}} to form gels. Thereupon the fuel loses its ability to flow and the transportation system falters or is stopped. The lowest temperature at which the fuel will still flow is known as the pour point. As the temperature approaches that of the pour point, difficulties emerge in transporting the fuel through lines and pump. Furthermore, <b>wax</b> crystals can <b>plug</b> screens and filters at temperatures above the pour point; the so-called cold filter plugging point. To combat this behavior various additives have been developed to depress the pour point or to decrease the size and alter the shape of the wax crystals; e. g., smaller sized crystals are less likely to clog either screens or filters. This paper reports on the use of a crystalline-amorphous diblock copolymer that performs, in its self-assembled state, as an efficient nucleator for the wax in middle distillate fuels...|$|R
