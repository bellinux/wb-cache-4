5|$|Lane was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of preparedness in the prelude to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917, he urged <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels. Wilson refused, but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram. In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917, Lane, with other Cabinet members, urged American intervention in the war.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January Gordon-Cumming made a final {{attempt to}} have the rumours scotched by instructing his solicitors to write to the two Lycett Greens, Stanley Wilson, Levett and Mary <b>Wilson,</b> <b>to</b> demand {{retraction}} of the accusation or face a writ for slander. On 6 February, with no withdrawal forthcoming, Gordon-Cumming issued writs against the five, claiming £5,000 against each of them.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{while working}} as an Advance Man for the Republican gubernatorial {{candidate}} Richard M. Nixon, <b>Wilson</b> got <b>to</b> know Herb Klein, one of Nixon's top aides. Klein suggested that Wilson might do well in Southern California politics, so in 1963, <b>Wilson</b> moved <b>to</b> San Diego.|$|R
5|$|The {{heads of}} the art department, Bob Bell and Keith Wilson, divided their efforts so that Bell contributed mostly to the film and <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> the Series Two episodes. Sets {{constructed}} by Bell especially for Thunderbirds Are Go included the Glenn Field Control Tower and Press Conference Room, the interiors of The Swinging Star, and re-designed versions of various locations on Tracy Island.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{initially}} favoured relatively lenient {{treatment of}} Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment {{the rise of}} extremism, and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.|$|E
5|$|According to Graham Spinardi in {{his book}} From Polaris to Trident (1994), STRAT-X was a {{response}} by the U.S. Department of Defense's Deputy Director of Defense Research and Engineering, Lloyd <b>Wilson,</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Air Force; the service was demanding a large ICBM called the WS-120A. Spinardi suggests that STRAT-X was allowed to proceed so it could terminate the study for such a missile. Funding for the WS-120A would not be released by Secretary McNamara, and plans for such a missile were canceled in 1967.|$|E
50|$|Captain Bosch argues with <b>Wilson</b> {{over how}} <b>to</b> {{deal with the}} threat: <b>Wilson</b> wants <b>to</b> seal the sewers, open up some gas lines, and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s despite the {{inherent}} danger to the city.|$|R

He died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 46 the following May in Bradenton.|$|R
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{involved}} in the 1914 Second Battle of Vera Cruz, deploying their Marine contingents as part of the operation. Following the entrance of the United States into World War I in 1917, both ships were deployed to Europe. Florida was assigned to the British Grand Fleet and based in Scapa Flow; in December 1918 she escorted President Woodrow <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> France for the peace negotiations. Utah was assigned to convoy escort duty; she was based in Ireland and was tasked with protecting convoys as they approached the European continent.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Pollock was {{appointed}} as captain on , a German cruise liner which {{was seized by}} the United States government {{for use as a}} military transport ship.

5|$|In February 1974, the British Prime Minister, Edward Heath, {{advised the}} Queen {{to call a}} general {{election}} {{in the middle of}} her tour of the Austronesian Pacific Rim, requiring her to fly back to Britain. The election resulted in a hung parliament; Heath's Conservatives were not the largest party, but could stay in office if they formed a coalition with the Liberals. Heath only resigned when discussions on forming a coalition foundered, after which the Queen asked the Leader of the Opposition, Labour's Harold <b>Wilson,</b> <b>to</b> form a government.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wilson</b> {{returned}} <b>to</b> New York {{where he}} met Booth Tarkington in 1904, and Tarkington and <b>Wilson</b> traveled together <b>to</b> Europe in 1905. The two completed the play The Man from Home in 1906 in Paris. The play was a resounding success and was followed by more collaborations with Tarkington, but none repeated {{the success of the}} first. <b>Wilson</b> was elected <b>to</b> the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1908.|$|R
5|$|In May 1918, he {{was sent}} to Italy by President Woodrow <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> make a study of the {{economic}} conditions of that country during World War I in order to provide information for economic relief programs and encourage the Italians to continue the war effort after the disastrous defeat at Caporetto. As a representative of the Committee on Public Information, he spent most of the year in Italy and won the praise of President Wilson. He also received the decoration of Grand Officer of the Italian Crown from King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E

George Washington also carried U.S. President Woodrow <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> France twice for the Paris Peace Conference. George Washington was decommissioned in 1920 {{and handed over}} the United States Shipping Board (USSB), who reconditioned her for passenger service. SS George Washington sailed in transatlantic passenger service for both the United States Mail Steamship Company (one voyage) and United States Lines for ten years, before she was laid up in the Patuxent River in Maryland in 1931.|$|E

Maria, however, lost in the semi-finals to Lita.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E

5|$|On January 28, Khánh {{flew from}} Huế to Saigon dressed in {{civilian}} clothes on a commercial airliner. He covered for his ruse by claiming that he was travelling with United States military adviser Colonel Jasper Wilson and stating {{that he had come}} for a dental appointment. This came after Duc had arrived in I Corps earlier in the day with a message from the other plotters that Khánh was to be in Saigon to lead the coup on the day after. What Khánh had actually done was to send <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> Saigon earlier in the day to check with the embassy and confirm that Washington did support the coup.|$|E
5|$|Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, {{making his}} nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers {{out on the campaign}} trail, but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.|$|E
5|$|Staunton {{challenged}} Saint-Amant to {{a longer}} match {{to be played}} in Paris for a stake of £100, equivalent to about £73,000 in 2015. Then he prepared new opening lines, especially those beginning 1.c4, which {{became known as the}} English Opening after this match. He also took Thomas Worrall and Harry <b>Wilson</b> <b>to</b> Paris as his assistants; this is the first known case where seconds were used in a match. Staunton gained a seven-game lead but then struggled to keep it before winning the match 13–8 (eleven wins, four draws, and six losses) in December 1843.|$|E
