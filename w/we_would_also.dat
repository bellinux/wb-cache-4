25|$|Along {{the same}} lines, co-NP is the class {{containing}} the complement problems (i.e. {{problems with the}} yes/no answers reversed) of NP problems. It is believed that NP is not equal to co-NP; however, {{it has not yet}} been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP, since if P=NP <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have P=co-NP, since problems in NP are dual to those in co-NP.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the problem of}} {{aligning}} individual and organizational goals remains. In addition, in this case, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> need to consider departmental goals. Also, {{the high level of}} specialization is a barrier for the flexible reallocation of resources within the organization, i.e. people can not perform other tasks than those they are working with in their functional occupation. The most common way of process departmentalization is the division of the firm into business functions, such as purchasing, manufacturing, sales, accounting, etc.|$|E

The team felt that dividing focus and resources across both a single-player and an online multiplayer mode {{would be less}} efficient. When questioned {{about the lack of}} an online multiplayer mode, Öjerfors explained that the decision was simple. [...] "If we could take every bit of energy and sweat the studio has and pour all that into the single-player campaign, it gives us the resources to make something very, very cool, compared to if <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have to divert some of our resources to making multiplayer." [...] Executive producer Jerk Gustafsson attributed the choice to the style of game the team is familiar with, stating that MachineGames is [...] "a single-player studio".|$|E
2500|$|Public {{comments}} quickly {{came from}} her colleagues at the ABC, including local radio content manager Cath Hurley and radio broadcaster Jon Faine, on 28 September, shortly after the discovery of Meagher's body. An Australian flag and an ABC flag at the Southbank studios were lowered to half-mast for the day. A statement on Meagher was also placed on the ABC website. In part, it read [...] "Jill was a much loved member of the Local Radio family. She was witty, intelligent and great company. Her friends and workmates at the ABC will miss her greatly. This tragic outcome will undoubtedly weigh heavily on them, {{and they will be}} supported through this dark time. We thank the police for their dedication to the investigation and our colleagues in the media for their support. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> [...] thank our listeners and the general public for their overwhelming kindness and encouragement over the past week." ...|$|E

The {{examination}} of the roots of Moral Power, pp. 145-149, is a summary of what is afterwards developed with utmost care in my inaugural lecture at Oxford on the relation of Art to Morals; compare in that lecture, sections 83-85, with the sentence in p. 147 of this book, [...] "Nothing is ever done so as really to please our Father, unless <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have done it, though we had had no Father to know of it." ...|$|E

60|$|Not {{long after}} {{my friend and}} I had made up our accounts, to our entire satisfaction, there came in a Dutch coaster from Batavia of about two hundred tons. The crew of this vessel pretended {{themselves}} so sickly, that there were not hands sufficient to undertake a voyage; and the Captain having given out {{that he intended to}} go to Europe, public notice was given that the ship was to be sold. No sooner did this come to our ears, but we bought the ship, paid the master, and took possession. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> have very willingly entertained some of the men; but they having received their share of booty, were not to be found, being altogether fled to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence; and from thence went to travel to Surat, and so by the sea to the Persian Gulph. And indeed they had reason to fly in this manner; for the truth of it was the pretended Captain was the gunner only, and not the commander; that having been on a trading voyage, they were attacked on shore by the Malayans, who killed three men and the Captain; after whose death the other eleven men ran away with the ship to the Bay of Bengal, and left the mate and five men more on shore: but of this affair we shall have occasion to speak more at length hereafter.|$|E
6000|$|Nettle and Fern.--There are two {{moderately}} nutritious plants--nettle and fern--that {{are found}} wild in very many countries: and, therefore, the following extract from Messrs. Hue and Gabet's 'Travels in Thibet' {{may be of}} service:--"When the young stems of ferns are gathered, quite tender, before they are covered with down, and while the first leaves are bent and rolled up in themselves, you have only to boil them in pure water to realise a dish of delicious asparagus. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> recommend the nettle, which, in our opinion, might be made an advantageous substitute for spinach; indeed more than once we proved this by our own experience. The nettle should be gathered quite young, when the leaves are perfectly tender. The plant should be pulled up whole, with {{a portion of the}} root. In order to preserve your hands from the sharp biting liquid which issues from the points, you should wrap them in linen of close texture. When once the nettle is boiled, it is perfectly innocuous; and this vegetable, so rough in its exterior, becomes a very delicate dish. We were able to enjoy this delightful variety of esculents for more than a month. Then the little tubercles of the fern became hollow and horny, and the stems themselves grew as hard as wood while the nettle, armed with a long white beard, p 203 presented only a menacing and awful aspect." [...] The roots of many kinds of ferns, perhaps of all of them, are edible. Our poor in England will eat neither fern nor nettle: they say the first is innutritious, and the second acrid. I like them both.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Winter' {{is always}} amusing and audacious, though we cannot {{say that we}} entirely approve of the names he gives to his stories. Bootle's Baby was a masterpiece, but Houp-la was a terrible title, and That Imp is not much better. The book, however, is {{undoubtedly}} clever, and the Imp in question is not a Nyctalops nor a specimen for a travelling museum, but a very pretty girl who, because an officer has kissed her without any serious matrimonial intentions, exerts all her fascinations to bring the unfortunate Lovelace to her feet and, having succeeded in doing so, promptly rejects him with a virtuous indignation that is as delightful as {{it is out of}} place. We must confess that we have a good deal of sympathy for 'Driver' Dallas, of the Royal Horse, who suffers fearful agonies at what he imagines is a heartless flirtation {{on the part of the}} lady of his dreams; but the story is told from the Imp's point of view, and as such we must accept it. There is a very brilliant description of a battle in the Soudan, and the account of barrack life is, of course, admirable. So admirable indeed is it that we hope that 'Mr. Winter' will soon turn his attention to new topics and try to handle fresh subjects. It would be sad if such a clever and observant writer became merely the garrison hack of literature. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> earnestly beg 'Mr. Winter' not to write foolish prefaces about unappreciative critics; for it is only mediocrities and old maids who consider it a grievance to be misunderstood.|$|E

60|$|In this, as {{in so many}} things, {{there is}} no harm in our criticising foreigners, if only <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> criticise ourselves. In other words, the world might need even less of its new charity, if it had {{a little more of}} the old humility. When we {{complain}} of American individualism, we forget that we have fostered it by ourselves having far less of this impersonal ideal of the Republic or commonwealth as a whole. When we complain, very justly, for instance, of great pictures passing into the possession of American magnates, we ought to remember that we paved the way for it by allowing them all to accumulate in the possession of English magnates. It is bad that a public treasure should be in the possession of a private man in America, but we took the first step in lightly letting it disappear into the private collection of a man in England. I know all about the genuine national tradition which treated the aristocracy as constituting the state; but these very foreign purchases go to prove that we ought to have had a state independent of the aristocracy. It is true that rich Americans do sometimes covet the monuments of our culture in a fashion that rightly revolts us as vulgar and irrational. They are said sometimes to want to take whole buildings away with them; and too many of such buildings are private and for sale. There were wilder stories of a millionaire wishing to transplant Glastonbury Abbey and similar buildings as if they were portable shrubs in pots. It is obvious that it is nonsense as well as vandalism to separate Glastonbury Abbey from Glastonbury. I can understand a man venerating it as a ruin; and I can understand a man despising it as a rubbish-heap. But it is senseless to insult a thing in order to idolatrise it; it is meaningless to desecrate the shrine in order to worship the stones. That sort of thing is the bad side of American appetite and ambition; and we are perfectly right to see it not only as a deliberate blasphemy but as an unconscious buffoonery. But there is another side to the American tradition, which is really too much lacking in our own tradition. And it is illustrated in this idea of preserving Washington as a sort of paradise of impersonal politics without personal commerce. Nobody could buy the White House or the Washington Monument; it may be hinted (as by an inhabitant of Glastonbury) that nobody wants to; but nobody could if he did want to. There is really a certain air of serenity and security about the place, lacking in every other American town. It is increased, of course, by the clear blue skies of that half-southern province, from which smoke has been banished. The effect is not so much in the mere buildings, though they are classical and often beautiful. But whatever else they have built, they have built a great blue dome, the largest dome in the world. And the place does express something in the inconsistent idealism of this strange people; and here at least they have lifted it higher than all the sky-scrapers, and set it in a stainless sky.|$|E
