5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E

500|$|During the 1908 season, Crawford {{narrowly}} {{failed to}} complete his third double. He scored 1,371 runs {{at an average of}} 37.05 and took 98 wickets at 21.48. His season began with a probable dispute over the Surrey captaincy. H. D. G. Leveson Gower had been appointed captain for 1908 but the combination of an injury and his marriage left him unavailable for four matches near the beginning of the season. Crawford also missed the beginning of the season; a newspaper article by Albert Trott, a former Australian Test all-rounder now playing for Middlesex, suggested that Crawford withdrew from the team because he was not appointed captain in Leveson Gower's absence. Instead Harry Bush, who had not played first-class cricket for five years, led the team. Trott was sympathetic to Crawford, stating that the Surrey committee <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way [...] "to inflict a most undeserved slight" [...] on Crawford.|$|E

It re-equipped with North American P-51D Mustang fighters between 12September and 11January 1946, losing two aircraft to accidents in the process. The squadron deployed to Bofu, a former kamikaze base, during 13–18March 1946, once again as part of No.81 Wing with Nos.76 and 77 Squadrons; Nos.381 and 481 Squadrons provided logistics and maintenance support, respectively. No.82 Squadron lost three of its twenty-eight Mustangs, along with an escorting deHavilland Mosquito, in bad weather en route to Bofu, killing all crew members. From April 1946, the squadron conducted surveillance patrols over Japan as well as participating in routine exercises and flypasts. The Australians found that, far from offering resistance, the Japanese <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to be accommodating.

2500|$|Filming Take Me Out to the Ball Game (1949) [...] was, {{according}} to Williams in her autobiography, {{an experience of}} [...] "pure misery". A period musical starring Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, the two male leads character's were [...] players in a baseball team owned by K.C. Higgins, Williams's role. She claimed that Kelly and co-writer Stanley Donen treated her with contempt and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to make jokes at her expense. The film was well-received critically and became a major commercial success, raking in $3.4 million in rentals and becoming the 11th highest earning film of the year. Williams made Neptune's Daughter (also 1949) {{around the same time}} with co-stars Ricardo Montalbán, Red Skelton and Betty Garrett, who had also been in Take Me Out to the Ball Game. [...] In the film, Williams sings [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside" [...] with Montalbán. The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 22nd Academy Awards. Williams and Montalbán were originally slated to sing [...] "(I'd Like to Get You on a) Slow Boat to China", but studio censors thought the song was too sexual (interpreting the word [...] "get" [...] as [...] "have") and instead gave them [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside."

The Rockets <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to get Scottie and the fans have treated him well, so I was just disappointed in him." [...] Pippen commented on the situation in an interview by saying: [...] "I wouldn't give Charles Barkley an apology at gunpoint. He can never expect an apology from me, if anything, he owes me an apology for coming to play with his fat butt." [...] He stated that the main reasons for his departure were Barkley's selfishness and his lack of desire to win. He also expressed the wish to play for his former coach Phil Jackson, who was now coaching the Los Angeles Lakers. Scottie said one of the reasons he wants to play for Jackson is because he longs to return to the system in which they won six NBA titles together in Chicago. Pippen was traded by the Houston Rockets to the Portland Trail Blazers on October 2, 1999 in exchange for Stacey Augmon, Kelvin Cato, Ed Gray, Carlos Rogers, Brian Shaw and Walt Williams.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, Anand {{was offered a}} few roles {{starring}} as the male lead opposite singer-actress Suraiya in woman-oriented films. He considered himself to be very lucky {{to get a chance}} to star opposite such an established actress and accepted the offers. While shooting these films, they became romantically involved. The two of them were paired in seven films together: Vidya (1948), Jeet (1949), Shair (1949), Afsar (1950), Nili (1950), Do Sitare (1951) and Sanam (1951), all of which were successful at the box office. In these films, Suraiya was always first-biller in the credits, indicating that she was a bigger star than Anand. She fell in love with him during the shooting of the song Kinare kinare chale jayen ge from the film Vidya— while shooting the scene, the boat they were in capsized, and Anand saved Suraiya from drowning. Initially, Suraiya's family used to welcome Dev Anand at home, but when her maternal grandmother found out that the two were in love, and even planned an actual marriage on the set of [...] "Jeet", she started monitoring them. The two shared love letters and messages through their co-actors, like Durga Khote and Kamini Kaushal, who <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> way to engineer secret rendezvous. During the shooting of the film 'Afsar' (1950), Anand finally proposed to Suraiya and gave her a diamond ring worth Rs 3,000. Her maternal grandmother opposed the relationship as they were Muslim and Anand was Hindu, and so, Suraiya remained unmarried. They stopped acting together after her grandmother opposed their partnership, and [...] "Do Sitare" [...] was the last film in which they appeared together. Although the films he starred in with Suraiya had been successful, the producers and directors of those films attributed their success to the acting prowess and screen presence of Suraiya. Anand began looking for an opportunity to play the main male lead in a film where his acting skills could be demonstrated, so as to dispel scepticism about his acting abilities.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> {{way to try}} {{to ensure}} that Manchukuo was the {{embodiment}} of modernity in all of its aspects as Manchukuo was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo's legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law. The official ideology of Manchukuo was the wangdao ("Kingly Way") devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zheng Xiaoxu calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as {{the beginning of a new}} era in world history. The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual as the wangdao ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent Western concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor. The wangdao favored the collective over the individual, as the wangdao called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs. Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the Western legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the wangdao with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system. The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the [...] "rights" [...] of the subjects with their [...] "responsibilities" [...] to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The wangdao promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from the Emperor Puyi, and as such the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit. In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of assisting the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far less powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea the Showā Emperor was sympathetic to, but never took up. The Showa Emperor in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power while at the same time the fiction of the Imperial Diet together with a Prime Minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.|$|E
