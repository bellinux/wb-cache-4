5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato <b>was</b> <b>arrested</b> <b>and</b> <b>charged</b> with obscenity. As all copies were to {{be turned over to}} the authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication of the Photo article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E

The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E
