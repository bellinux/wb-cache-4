5|$|On DS9, Sisko informs Nog that he {{will not}} give him a {{recommendation}} as he has concerns that it is a scheme. Nog confesses that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> so that he doesn't turn out like his father Rom (Max Grodénchik), whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won't let him pursue it. Sisko, stunned by this confession of a Ferengi having such upstanding ambitions, responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy. Odo is suspicious of Kira's responses and points a phaser at her, demanding to know who she is. Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder (Salome Jens), who reveals that she stole the Maquis ship and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion. She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away. Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder, but not of his feelings for her.|$|E

Peter's sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield) takes a big liking to Leon and holds a party in 89b George Street so she can spend time with him. The party turns to chaos and Lucy and Leon get {{everyone}} out by saying the police are outside. Leon offers to help Lucy clean up and asks her to join {{in a game of}} Twister with him. As they are playing, a condom falls out Lucy's pocket. Leon sees it and says {{he did not want to}} take advantage of her. However, she kisses him passionately, which leads to sex. After they have sex, Leon receives a text message and gets dressed but asks if Lucy <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again. Lucy says yes, but after appears disturbed.|$|E
500|$|Regarding her {{involvement}} in a sequel to The Silence of the Lambs, Foster confirmed to Larry King in 1997 that she [...] "would definitely be part of it." [...] She told Entertainment Weekly magazine in 1997 that [...] "Anthony Hopkins always talks about it. I mean, everybody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Every time I see him, it's like: 'When {{is it going to}} happen? When is it going to happen?'" [...] De Laurentiis thought Foster would decline once she read the book, even believing the final film was better for it. Hopkins also had doubts Foster would be involved, saying he had a [...] "hunch" [...] she would not be. Foster did turn it down, confirming this in late December 1999.|$|E

500|$|In late 2007, public {{appearances}} by Talbot included headlining the Great Bridge Christmas and Winter Festival, which local police threatened to cancel unless crowds clamouring {{to reach the}} tent in which Talbot was performing could be brought under control. At the event, on 7 December 2007, Talbot said [...] "I love it here, it's brilliant, really fun", but had to be ushered off-stage by the police. Talbot performed publicly in Walsall's HMV store, and in Birmingham's Centenary Square. TV appearances included GMTV and Channel 5 news, both on 26 November 2007. According to her mother, Talbot has received offers for film roles. Sharon said [...] "'s been sent a script, I haven't had {{a good look at}} it yet but it's really exciting... Connie's a singer, not an actress, so we'll see what happens. It's completely up to her whether or not she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I can't believe it, though." ...|$|E
500|$|Swanigan {{had several}} teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke {{were among the}} schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan {{verbally}} committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, [...] "I just {{felt like it was}} better basketball-wise for me." [...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and said he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in the state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E
500|$|Mahone is {{depicted}} as an intelligent FBI agent with [...] "an amazingly sharp mind", quickly discovering the secret of Michael's tattoos and his plans. His thoroughness and investigational skills allow him to extrapolate the fugitives' location, causing Michael to remark, [...] "It's like he knows where we're going, what we're thinking." [...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law." [...] Michael and Mahone have been described as [...] "two sides of the same brilliant coin"; however, Mahone notes, [...] "there's one big difference between you and I (sic), Michael. And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely." [...] Fichtner defends Mahone by saying that he [...] "doesn't do everything he does because he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> He's not OK about it.

2500|$|In a December 2016 {{interview}} with Bleeding Cool, Galligan again spoke {{about a third}} film saying that [...] "Warner Bros. definitely wants it, Chris Columbus <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because he’d like to undo the Gremlins 2 thing as he wasn’t thrilled with it, and Spielberg <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> I imagine – because he’s Spielberg – and why wouldn’t he want to do it." [...] He said that Columbus was now {{in control of the}} franchise and once confirmed {{that there will be no}} remake or reboot, only a sequel. He also said that that Columbus [...] "has been aggressively working on a Gremlins 3" [...] and Columbus even went into some detail about what the third film would be about. Gremlins 3 takes place in present day. He tantalizingly says there will be some new characters and some old characters – I guess in the style of a [...] type sequel. One thing we know for sure is they have a writer on board. The only insight I can give is the following: There was a 6-year gap between Gremlins and Gremlins 2; most of that time was spent with them writing and rejecting ideas and re-writing. One of the ideas that was rejected was ‘gremlins in Vegas.’ They went with that for 18 months and felt it was too expensive. Eventually they came up with the tower idea, where essentially I’m working for Donald Trump, our new President! That took six years to happen. Carl Ellsworth has been apparently working on the script for a year and a half now." [...] Galligan said. It is unknown if Joe Dante will return to direct the third film.|$|E

I think there is so much richness in Toadie and Sonya going on that journey together which lends itself to humour, sadness, more drama. Cross fingers they will go down that path." [...] Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future. Morey told the official UK Neighbours website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first. When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it. Morey explained, [...] "At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons. They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for security to protect Callum, and he doesn’t want to do it...
