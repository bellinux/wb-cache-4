500|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> Why the Caged Bird Sings was {{published}} in 1969, Angelou was hailed as {{a new kind of}} memoirist, one of the first African-American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized {{to the point that they}} were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote. Linguist John McWhorter agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called [...] "tracts", as [...] "apologetic writing". He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of black culture, which he called [...] "a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period". [...] Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird [...] "a work of art that eludes description", argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers, but also African-American autobiography as a whole. Als said that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could, as he put it, [...] "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense". [...] Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women. It made her [...] "without a doubt,... America's most visible black woman autobiographer", and [...] "a major autobiographical voice of the time". [...] As writer Gary Younge said, [...] "Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} the winner of a then-record seven 1995 Golden Raspberry Awards (from a record {{thirteen}} nominations, a record that still stands) including Worst Picture, Worst Actress (Elizabeth Berkley), Worst Director (Paul Verhoeven), Worst Screenplay (Joe Eszterhas), Worst New Star (Elizabeth Berkley), Worst Screen Couple ("any combination of two people (or two body parts)") and Worst Original Song (David A. Stewart and Terry Hall for [...] "Walk Into the Wind"). Verhoeven gamely appeared in person at the Razzies ceremony to accept his award for Worst Director; Showgirls would later win an eighth Razzie Award for Worst Picture of the Last Decade in 2000. It was soon tied with Battlefield Earth for winning the most Razzies in a single year, a record broken <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>Know</b> Who Killed Me won eight trophies in 2008 and then again when Jack and Jill won ten awards in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Philpot made further {{controversial}} comments {{after the}} 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, legalizing gay marriage throughout the United States. Philpot described gay marriage as an oxymoron, the Supreme Court's decision as [...] "pretty close to insane," [...] and described homosexual relationships as [...] "sterile" [...] and [...] "just entertainment." [...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; this matches his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic." [...] LGBT rights advocates challenged these views as showing a [...] "fundamental misunderstanding {{of what it means to}} be LGBT" [...] and as evidence of a [...] "deep disrespect for LGBT people and their families." [...] Judges have a First Amendment right to express their views so long as they do not influence their decisions. Philpot has presided over many cases with LGBT people and lawyers who have been involved report that he does not base his decisions on a litigant's sexuality. Speaking of his religious views, Philpot has stated that [...] "I don't mention Jesus inside the courthouse very much, even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> he is absolutely the only answer to the problem in front of me." [...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals. Philpot regrets, however, that friendships between straight men are affected as they are unable to hug in the way they used to, and that the rainbow, a symbol from the Bible, had been [...] "stolen" [...] – and he plans to put a rainbow on the back of his car.|$|E
