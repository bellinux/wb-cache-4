25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

50|$|Gudang shares about 20% of its {{words with}} Kala Lagaw Ya (termed WCL = Western-Central Language here-in) due to loaning between the languages.

The data Brierly and others collected from Barbara Thompson and local people show that where marriage, clan membership and other cultural aspects were concerned, that the Gudang fitted as much into the Islanders' world as in the neighbouring Urradhi world.

The greatest stand of red spruce in the world, {{in terms of}} size and quality, could be found along the upper Red Creek. The largest recorded tree ever cut in West Virginia was a white oak, harvested in this region.

The number of shark attacks in any given year or region is highly influenced by the number of people entering the water." [...] However, the likelihood that one shark was involved is contested. Scientists such as Victor M. Coppleson and Jean Butler, relying on evidence presented by Lucas and Murphy in 1916, assert that a single shark was responsible. On the other hand, Richard Fernicola notes that 1916 was a [...] "shark year" [...] as fishermen and captains were reporting hundreds of sharks swimming in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Ellis remarks that [...] "to try to make the facts as we know them conform to the 'rogue shark' theory is stretching sensationalism and credibility beyond reasonable limits."

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} {{examination}} essay {{was to find}} out if participation of children in social welfare investigations had increased since the social services had started to work with BBIC. I compared the participation of the child before BBIC, then when social service had started to work with BBIC and I tried to see if there were increased participation in the investigations. My theoretic starting-point was the symbolic interactionism and I used the qualitative method of investigation. In my investigation I found that there is not yet any increase in participation of the child in the investigations when social service work with BBIC. What I found was that the reason to start an investigation often was that the parents made the problem for the child and that conditions at home for the child influenced the possibility of the child to communi- cate with an adult that the child did not know. It is important for the social welfare secretary to create social interaction/communication with the child to get the ability to listen to the child and its story.

50|$|Other unusual {{architectural}} {{features include}} the numerous recessed wall panels which are particularly prominent {{on the west}} side of the rooms on the third level. Because of the unquestionable palatial appearance of the building, it is tempting to accept this designation out of hand without asking for any proof. Unfortunately, there is little to go on in the way of hard data which has any reference to the function(s) of the various rooms. The circulation system does, however, establish a fairly clear hierarchy in terms of the degree of privacy or difficulty of entry with regard to the rooms on the several levels. The rooms on the second level are the most difficult to reach and access is easily controlled by means of the interior stair system. The rooms on the third level can be reached from either the interior or exterior stairways, but here again, checkpoints are provided at the points of entry. The outermost rooms on the ground level open directly to the plaza level and are therefore the easiest to reach and the least private. The inner rooms are well protected, however, and are well suited for more private activities.None of the above tells us very much about the specific functions of the rooms on different levels but the obvious advantages afforded by the restrictive access system could be put to use in a variety of ways. While <b>we</b> <b>will</b> probably <b>never</b> <b>know</b> exactly how the individual rooms were used, it is impossible to imagine the Palace as anything other than an elite residential-ceremonial-administrative structure where the highest-ranking members of the ruling class at Xtampak held sway.|$|R

But those side glances and backward glances were provocative of trouble. Charmian and I disagreed as to which way the connecting stream of water ran. We still disagree, for at the hotel, where we submitted the affair to arbitration, the hotel manager and the clerk likewise disagreed.

40|$|The Fall Field Days {{were held}} {{southeast}} of Ashland at the Carol Joy Holling Conference Center September 26 - 28. Field trips to Platte River and Schramm State Parks, Louisville and Memphis SRAs, Jack Sinn WMA, Fontenelle Forest, and Spring Creek Prairie {{were led by}} Kevin Poague, Clem Klaphake, Larry Einemann, Rick Schmid, and Don and Janis Paseka. Hawk migration was in full swing, and we observed 10 species, including a number of Broad-wings and Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s. An American Golden-Plover was a standout among the dozen shorebird species, and 10 warbler species were found, including Black-throated Green and Canada. Total species count was 126. Our speaker on Friday night was NOU member Dr. Daniel Leger, Professor of Psychology at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. His presentation was titled “How Many Bird Species Are There and How Do We Know?” His answer was that there are around 10, 000 species right now, that number is increasing, and <b>we</b> probably <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how many species there are. He spoke about 2 ̆ 2 cryptic 2 ̆ 2 species, ones that were there all along but were never noticed because we lacked crucial behavioral, vocal, or genetic data. Dr. Leger 2 ̆ 7 s work has included uncovering some cryptic species and will eventually result in the Bright-rumped Attila and the Ochre-bellied Flycatcher each being split into multiple species. On Saturday night, Dr. Robert Gibson, Professor of Biology at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, spoke about avian lek behavior. Several hundred species of birds exhibit lek behavior, in which clustered males engage in sometimes spectacular courtship behavior while the females are allowed a relatively unhindered choice of a mate. Dr. Gibson 2 ̆ 7 s {{studies have shown that}} females favor males in groups and prefer certain lek hotspots that are close to nesting sites. Only a few of the males actually mate, but the others may have more chance of mating if they display at a known lek site. Another advantage is that an individual bird stands a greater chance of survival during a predator attack in a group than it does if it is alone...|$|R
