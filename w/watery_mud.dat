60|$|One {{morning the}} sisters were {{sketching}} {{by the side}} of Willey Water, at the remote end of the lake. Gudrun had waded out to a gravelly shoal, and was seated like a Buddhist, staring fixedly at the water-plants that rose succulent from the mud of the low shores. What she could see was mud, soft, oozy, <b>watery</b> <b>mud,</b> and from its festering chill, water-plants rose up, thick and cool and fleshy, very straight and turgid, thrusting out their leaves at right angles, and having dark lurid colours, dark green and blotches of black-purple and bronze. But she could feel their turgid fleshy structure as in a sensuous vision, she KNEW how they rose out of the mud, she KNEW how they thrust out from themselves, how they stood stiff and succulent against the air.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Mn and Fe in water, sediments, hydroxide nodules and crusts of Eningi-Lampi ore-bearing lake is regular, and concordant {{from the source}} to the areas of accumulation of these components. Mn-Fe hydroxide nodules and crusts occur at the water-sediment interface, and more rarely in the upper (0 - 5 cm) film of brown <b>watery</b> <b>mud.</b> The {{leading role in the}} formation of Mn-Fe nodules and crusts is played by the chemosorption and auto-catalytic oxidation in the course of interaction of component-bearing solutions with active surfaces. This is considered to be the basic process for the model of ferromanganese ore formation in recent basins. Despite the differences in the physico-geographical and geochemical characteristics of lakes, mediterranean seas and oceans, the formation of ferromanganese hydroxide nodules and crusts in these basins may be explained by this model...|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of formation of iron-manganese nodules and crusts {{have been studied}} on {{an example of the}} Eningi-Lampi lake, Central Karelia, where the relationships between the source of the ore, sedimentary materials and areas of their accumulation prove relatively simple and apparent. Nodules and crusts are composed mostly by birnessite, amorphous hydrous ferric oxides and hydro-goethite. They occur, as a rule, on the surface of relatively coarse-grained sediments, at the ground-water interface. Considerably in a lesser extent are found the nodules in the upper part (0 รณ 5 cm) of the red-brown flooded <b>watery</b> <b>mud</b> covering dark-green, black muds. The nucleus of nodules, or the basis of crusts of iron-manganese hydroxides are various, frequently altered, fragments of rocks, sometimes pieces of wood. Distribution of Mn and Fe in sediments and waters of the lake is considered. It is shown that the Mn/Fe ratio decreases considerably in waters, sediments and nodules of the lake while moving off a distance from the source. The main role in the process of formation of iron-manganese nodules belongs to the selective chemosorption interaction (with auto-catalytic oxidation) of component-bearing solutions with active surfaces...|$|E
