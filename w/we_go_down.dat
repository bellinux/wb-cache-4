500|$|MacLaren {{was invited}} by the Melbourne Cricket Club {{to bring a}} team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately {{organised}} team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players {{at the beginning of}} their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom had never seen him. Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us." [...] The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.|$|E
60|$|THE DEVIL. This way, Commander. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the old trap [he places {{himself on}} the grave trap].|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll arrange {{things before}} I sail, and I'd better get off {{as soon as}} possible. Now, suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> and join the others." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} cabin, Mr. Ranson first, Phil following, and myself last.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> I {{filled by}} a strange uneasiness, which I am sure was entirely shared by Cavalcanti.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to dinner, I asked Uncle Chipperton how his lung {{had stood}} it, {{through all this}} exposure.|$|R
6000|$|Phonny seemed perplexed. After a moment's pause he added, [...] "Couldn't <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> {{and tell}} Espy {{that there is}} a {{squirrel}} in his trap?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that lean, bent old man trudges {{after that}} heavy blade of iron pulled {{by a couple}} of horses while <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to eat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> and look, Cuthbert. See, {{there is}} an omnibus going down the hill, so I don't suppose there can be much danger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Children, come down!" [...] here called Mrs. Bretton from below. Paulina {{would still}} have lingered, but I {{inclined}} to descend: <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
60|$|She ran {{and put on}} {{her long}} grey coat and her red tam-o-shanter. As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the yard, George called to me.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> I sat in {{the tower}} with the {{searchlight}} projecting its seemingly feeble rays ahead. We submerged very slowly and without headway more than sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction, and as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down,</b> I saw outlined ahead of us the black opening in the great cliff. It was an opening that would have admitted a half-dozen U-boats at {{one and the same}} time, roughly cylindrical in contour--and dark as the pit of perdition.|$|R
6000|$|... (O Mother--O Sisters dear! [...] If we are lost, no victor {{else has}} destroy'd us, [...] It is by {{ourselves}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to eternal night.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I do, Mr Lynch: {{never mind}} me; just wash and dress {{yourself}} as though I wasn't here. I'll wait here till <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I’ll {{give him}} another half-hour, then," [...] said the girl, calmly. [...] "Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to the cabin? It’s rather chilly up here now." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{was all the}} establishment. When <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> stairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian's room, and said, [...] "This you've seen already." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> together, I on top striving most earnestly to {{strangle}} him to death, and he fighting quite as strenuously {{to throw off}} my hold.|$|R
6000|$|We {{had written}} for a boat—a double {{sculling}} skiff; and when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with our bags to the yard, and gave our names, the man said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nice way to fix things, all right. What {{do you say}} <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to Jack Elder's {{and have}} a game of five hundred this afternoon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps they did," [...] Jake owned, grinning. [...] "Anyhow, we'll {{have some}} more, with {{a lump of}} ice in it, before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> to lunch." ...|$|E
6000|$|He stopped {{outside the}} hallway, {{and as she}} looked up inquiringly at him, he said quietly: [...] "Suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> the road. It seems pleasanter there." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the garden, and Stella {{passed into}} the centre hut. I saw Hendrika {{standing}} in the shadow near the door, {{and went up to}} her.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{into the}} {{confusion}} of that flying rout, and for three long hours we cut and hacked and stabbed. At last the bugles sang [...] "Halt!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The Colonel Sahib himself. Not {{in those}} many words, but plainly {{enough for one}} who is not {{altogether}} a mud-head. Yea, he told me in the te-rain when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to Lucknow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{believe you}} can," [...] said her brother. [...] "And now, suppose <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> and see Aunt Matilda, {{and have a}} talk with her about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{left the}} room. 'Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> {{to the shore}} {{and see what the}} night is like?' said Ethelberta. 'This is the last {{opportunity}} I shall have.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pardon!' Dragomiroff moaned. 'I {{have never}} seen Death. I {{have never seen}} the Board take action. Shall <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> and burn them alive, or is that already done?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} not," [...] she said, {{and gave me}} a silent kiss, expressing her sorrow for my sake; and then taking our candles, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the stairs into the hall again.|$|R
60|$|Kraft {{spent his}} puny store of coin {{at the bar}} and then gave Judkins and me such an {{appealing}} look that <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the last dime we had in toasting our guest.|$|R
6000|$|As <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{the steps}} of the hotel Mrs. Colesworthy looked at her watch. [...] "It is twenty-five minutes to twelve," [...] she said. [...] "We must get home as fast as we can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Oliver; [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> {{near the}} pond, {{as likely as}} not, the first skating night, {{some of the boys}} will tear our fort all to pieces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very fair}} bargain," [...] quoth Cary, [...] "and I for one {{will see it}} kept to. Lads, we'll twine a double strong halter for the captain as <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down</b> along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks, Garcias!" [...] {{the boys}} said earnestly, [...] "we will {{do our best}} to keep our throats safe. At any rate, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>down,</b> it shall not be for want of watchfulness!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so have I," [...] said Sir Griffin;--"often. Don't you {{remember}} that day when <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> from London to Bringher Wood, and they pretended to find at half-past four? That's what I call a sell." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> {{the hill}} full of {{confusion}} of thought, {{not being able}} to conceive whereabouts we were or what it must be, seeing by all our charts the sea was yet a vast way off.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to tea at the rest-house, where Stanley stuffed {{himself with}} {{sardines}} and raspberry jam, and beer, and cold mutton and pickles, when Garm wasn't climbing over him; and then Vixen and I went on.|$|R
