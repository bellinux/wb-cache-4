5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy of excitement and everyone <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
5|$|Pfeiffer and Horton {{married in}} Santa Monica in 1981, and it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> honeymoon that she {{discovered}} {{she had won}} the lead role in Grease 2. Horton directed Pfeiffer in a 1985 ABC TV special, One Too Many, in which she played the high school girlfriend of an alcoholic student (Val Kilmer); and in 1987, the real-life couple played an on-screen couple in the 'Hospital' segment of John Landis's comedy skit compilation, Amazon Women on the Moon. However, they decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later; Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than on their marriage.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} planned {{for several months}} prior to its public {{announcement}} while the band <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> 2016 tour of South America, titled América Latina Olé Tour 2016. The bands' manager, Joyce Smyth, and Concerts Westworked extensively with the Cuban government {{in order for the}} show to be approved, due to the Cuban government still having control over what its citizens listen to. The embargo on Cuba proved to be a technical challenge for the band and stage crews since they had to ship all of their equipment from Belgium and could not rely on local infrastructure to assist to the degree that they are used to in more developed areas.|$|E

5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still holding {{out at the}} bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge. That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, {{what was left of the}} brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, {{he told her he}} wanted to farm, which she accepted as long as it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|In December 1996, Ryder {{accepted}} {{a role as}} an android in Alien Resurrection (1997), alongside Sigourney Weaver, who {{had appeared in the}} entire Alien trilogy. Ryder's brother, Uri, was a major fan of the film series, and when asked, she took the role. The film became one of the least successful entries in the Alien film series, but was considered a success as it grossed $161million worldwide. Weaver's and Ryder's performances drew mostly positive reviews, and Ryder won a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Best Actress. Ryder then starred in Woody Allen's Celebrity (1998), after Drew Barrymore turned down Ryder's role, in an ensemble cast. The film satirizes the lives of several celebrities. She later appeared in the music video for Jon Spencer Blues Explosion's Talk About the Blues, which <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> sixth studio album ACME. Ryder also appeared on the cover artwork of its follow up album Xtra-Acme USA, which was made using a screenshot from the previously mentioned music video.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{positions}} were well-sited {{on the spur}} for an attack from the east along the track from Katika to Sattelberg, but at this point, Captain B. G. Cribb, the commander of D Company, 2/13th Infantry Battalion, came {{on the radio and}} announced that he was in contact with the Japanese to the west, and was going to attack from that direction. A furious fight ensured. The Japanese held their fire until the Australians were almost on top of them. Realising that the position was stronger than he had thought, Cribb withdrew after suffering eight dead and twenty wounded. Windeyer ordered the 2/17th to bypass the position and proceed to its objective, the high ground south of the Song River. The 2/15th was ordered to attack Katika Spur. The attack was delivered at 15:15 after a preliminary bombardment by 3 inch mortars, but the Japanese defenders had withdrawn, leaving behind eight dead. By nightfall, most of the brigade <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> objectives.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Brumbies {{became the}} first Australian Super Rugby team to host an {{international}} fixture against a touring side. On 12 June, the Brumbies played Wales at Canberra Stadium while Wales <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> 2012 Summer tour. Wales won 25–15.|$|E
25|$|This period {{leading up}} to 10 May 1940 {{was known as the}} Phoney War, as there was little combat apart from minor clashes of {{reconnaissance}} patrols.

25|$|During {{the night}} after the Battle of Fredericksburg, an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The Confederate Army took this {{as a sign that}} God <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south.

25|$|To {{understand}} the opposing groups, historians have assessed {{evidence of their}} hearts and minds. In the mid-20th century, historian Leonard Woods Labaree identified eight characteristics of the Loyalists that made them essentially conservative; opposite traits to those characteristic of the Patriots. Older and better established men, Loyalists tended to resist innovation. They thought resistance to the Crown—which they insisted was the only legitimate government—was morally wrong, while the Patriots thought morality <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> side.|$|E

25|$|The role of Jupiter in the {{conflict}} of the orders {{is a reflection of}} the religiosity of the Romans. Whereas the patricians were able to claim the support of the supreme god quite naturally being the holders of the auspices of the State, the plebs (also known as the plebeians) argued that as Jupiter was the source of justice he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> side since their cause was just.|$|E
25|$|The eight United States {{postage stamps}} issued in 1861 pictured Washington (5), Franklin (2) and Jefferson (1), and {{envelopes}} signaled the sacredness of the Constitution and rebellion as treason. Confederate stamps pictured Washington, Jefferson, Jackson and Jefferson Davis (a stamp was printed depicting John C. Calhoun but was never put into use). Confederate envelopes {{focused on the}} Confederate flag and Jefferson Davis to foster a growth of Confederate nationalism, characterizing Lincoln as the anticonstitutionalist, the North as disloyal and the Southern attempt at nationhood as a renewal of the American Revolution. In the struggle for preserving their rights and liberties, George Washington <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> side.|$|E
25|$|In the ICC Test Championship, England {{are ranked}} second and West Indies are ranked eighth, though England's most recent series was a {{whitewash}} {{loss in the}} Ashes against Australia {{for the first time}} since 1921, their first Test series loss since their tour of Pakistan in 2005. West Indies, meanwhile, lost 2–0 to Pakistan in November 2006 as their last Test series, and have not won a Test since April 2005. The last time West Indies won an away Test to a nation currently ranked above them <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> tour of England in 2000 – they also beat Zimbabwe and Bangladesh twice during the intervening seven years.|$|E

25|$|At around 4:50 am, an IED {{went off}} outside a girls primary school in Urmar area on Shamshato Road. The school gate was damaged as the bomb detonated.

The difused bomb contained 2–2.25 kgs of material. The CTD team <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> way back after inspecting the site when their vehicle was detonated near Khotko Bridge.

McNamara, setting foot {{for the first time}} in court, admitted to having ordered the bombing of the Llewellyn Iron Works on December 25. J.J. McNamara later told an interviewer that Darrow had kept the McNamara brothers isolated from public opinion. Had they known how strongly the public <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> side, they would not have agreed to the plea deal, he claimed.|$|E
25|$|From 800 to 909, Ibrahim ibn-al-Aghlab (800–812) and his descendants, {{known as}} the Aghlabids, ruled in Ifriqiya, {{as well as in}} Algeria (to the west) and in Tripolitania (to the east), yet in theory their rule was on behalf of the 'Abbasid Caliphate. The Aghlabids were {{predominantly}} of an Arab tribe the Bani Tamim. Their military forces were drawn from: (a) Arab immigrant warriors (those recently sent against the Kharajite revolts, and descendants of earlier Arab invasions), (b) Islamized and bilingual natives (Afariq), and (c) black slave soldiers. It <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> black soldiery that the rulers often relied.|$|E
