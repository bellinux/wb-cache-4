In this country, serious damage to vegetable crops is usually caused by slugs, while snails do not normally cause any significant harm. Typical xerophilic snail species in the genera Cernuella, Xerolenta and Theba cause damage even more rarely since they are limited to wild flora in uncultivated and ruderal areas, and local outbreaks occur seldom and only in forage leguminous crops.

40|$|The common <b>white</b> <b>snail</b> (Cernuella virgata) (da Costa) is {{an exotic}} pest of grain crops in {{southern}} Australia. In {{order to better}} control these snails and develop optimal management strategies, {{it is important to}} understand how their breeding behavior is influenced by soil moisture and soil type. Pairs of adult snails were placed into vials containing either a calcareous or a non-calcareous soil at five moisture levels along their soil moisture retention curves: no-water; permanent wilting-point; mid-point; field-capacity; and saturation. Survival analysis was used to estimate the tendency of C. virgata to lay an egg cluster. ANOVA showed that there was no two-way interaction between soil moisture and soil type, however, one-way ANOVA showed that the tendency of C. virgata to deposit the first egg cluster was greater in the non-calcareous soil and increased as soil moisture increased. There was a higher total number of egg clusters laid in the non-calcareous soil. The total number of egg clusters laid in the two soil types increased as soil moisture content increased. No eggs were laid in the no-water treatment. C. virgata breed more frequently in moist soils, and egg laying is greater in wet seasons. Therefore the risk of grain contamination in spring is predicted to be greater following a relatively wet autumn and spring. V. L. Carne-Cavagnaro, M. A. Keller and G. H. Bake...|$|E
40|$|On April 3 rd 2016 three empty {{shells of}} the Pulmonate two-toothed <b>white</b> <b>snail</b> were found washed ashore in a shell grit bank {{at the eastern}} border of the nature reserve Baai van Heist (municipality Knokke-Heist). One subadult {{specimen}} was clearly an old shell, very probably of fossil Pleistocene or Holocene origin. The other two snails (1 subad. and 1 juvenile) showed small traces of weathering but certainly had a recent appearance. This prompted our presumption that the species could possibly live in situ in the Baai van Heist. On September 19 th 2016 we searched for the species along the eastern mole of the outer port of Zeebrugge, situated within the reserve. At two localities in the mediolittoral zone we could find various live specimens of A. bidentata under stones. The features of the habitats {{in which they have}} been found were in conformity with those known from the literature. Moreover we could ascertain that two-toothed white snails living nearer to the coastline occurred lower beneath the mean tide level than their congeners from a more seaward finding spot. Most of the snails were dwelling on the substrate under stones. We also noticed that larger shell fragments, mainly from mussels, created small cavities under the stones. These could serve as shelter or air-chamber to provide oxygen for respiration. For the first time A. bidentata is now recorded alive along the Belgian coast. On the same day we found a fresh empty shell of the multi-toothed mouse-eared snail Myosotella denticulata in a shell grit bank at the shore of the Baai van Heist. We presume that this species may also live in this nature reserve under similar environmental conditions as the two-toothed <b>white</b> <b>snail.</b> So far however, it has not been discovered in situ. In Belgium this species is known from the IJzer estuary, but it is new to {{the eastern part of the}} coast. From the late 1960 s until the 1990 s the beach area of the Baai van Heist was repeatedly raised with sand dredged offshore of the harbour of Zeebrugge. In grit banks consisting of shells and debris washed out from these sediments, empty specimens of the mouseeared snail Myosotella myosotis have been found on rare occasions. These were clearly old shells of a fossil nature, presumed of Pleistocene (Eemian) and/or Holocene age. Nowadays an embryonic saltmarsh is developping in the Baai van Heist which will create potential habitats for mouse-eared snails. Up to now the species has not yet been observed living on this site. Regarding the foraging behaviour of A. bidentata it is assumed that she is a selective deposit feeder, mainly browsing on sediment particles (epipsammic browsing). Perhaps the snail also browses the epilithic microflora and -fauna from stones, on which she often dwells. Characteristic for the three Ellobiidae is that specimens as from 2. 5 whorls onward the columella in the top of the spire is resorbed. By this a small cavity develops in the snail's shell. We wonder if this cavity has a function in the life of the animals. For instance it may serve as a kind of float for local dispersal or as an air reservoir for respiration during flood at high tide. We further ask ourselves how A. bidentata, considering her non-planktonic life cycle, could have colonized the Baai van Heist. We suggest two possible dispersal mechanisms: rafting and kinds of zoochory. The latter can take place via birds foraging in the snail's habitat, especially turnstones and rock pipits. Also other bird species may be eligible for zoochory, e. g. oystercatcher, curlew, herring gull and possibly some songbirds which occasionally dwell in the intertidal area during migration or in the winter season...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of Study: From Baja, California to {{southern}} Alaska, a small <b>white</b> <b>snail</b> Epitonium tinctum is found intertidally {{in association with}} the clonal anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. Living in sand within the clones, this micropredator feeds on the tentacles and tubercles of the anemones. Previous studies of E. tinctum focused on aspects of feeding {{with the exception of one}} study which traced the development of the unusual sperm and presented evidence of protandric hermaphroditism. Little else has been reported about this species. The primary purpose of this study is to describe aspects of reproduction, feeding and ecology of E. tinctum. The secondary purpose is to compare these observations with those of other epitoniids. Procedure: Snails were collected approximately once per month from July, 1977 to July, 1979 in Sonoma County, California. Observations of spermatozeugmata, mating, egg laying, development and feeding were made in the laboratory. Findings: Although both sexes are found between 7 mm and 8 mm in length of shell, generally males are smaller than females. Males produce atypical sperm called. spermatozeugmata of which comprise one giant sperm with a myriad of normal sperm attached to its tail. Although motile, this giant sperm is incapable of swimming from a male to females. Lacking any copulatory organ, the males transfer spermatozeugmata to females via the respiratory currents. Tile peculiar sand-encrusted egg cases are strung along a strong elastic thread which is produced by the foot and attached to the substrate. Egg cases are formed in the oviduct and pass to a posterior ventral pocket in the foot where sand grains are molded to the outside of the capsule after it is joined to the thread. Grain size and size of female affect fecundity. Development within the egg case includes spiral cleavage and a brief trochophore stage. In seven days larvae emerge as free swimming planktotrophic veligers. Although not always immune to nematocysts, the snails consume the tentacles and tubercles of the anemones. Newly metamorphosed snails feed on anemones. The size frequency distribution of the population loosely fits an annual pattern. An influx of small snails occurs every year; however, the time at which this happens varies. In 1977 tiny snails were found in spring; in 1978 they were not found until early summer; in contrast, in 1980 they were found in late winter. During the summer the mean length of shell increases. In the fall larger females and egg cases are more abundant than at any other time of year. The abundance of snails declines throughout the winter. Conclusions : Confirming a previous report, this evidence indicates that E. tinctum is a protandric hermaphrodite changing sex only once during the life cycle. Observations of spermatozeugmata transferred from males to females via the respiratory currents negate the hypothesis that all spermatozeugmata swim from males to females. The egg cases, eggs and veligers of E. tinctum are compared to those of other epitoniids. The feeding behavior of E. tinctum is discussed and summarized in comparison to feeding in other wentletraps. The life cycle of E. ??tinctum is annual. Veligers may settle as early as January or as late as June. During a period of growth in the summer, the snails function as males until they change sex approximately between 7 mm and 8 mm in length of shell. In the fall large females produce huge masses of egg cases. Abruptly in early winter the abundance of snails drops. The population declines throughout winter until veligers, released during the fall, settle and metamorphose...|$|E

We determined quantitatively both the transglycosidic and hydrolytic products of pNPGlu and pNPFuc solvolysis for the detailed kinetic analysis on G 1 -catalyzed hydrolysis and transglycosylation reaction. The inhibition kinetic studies using deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and butanol as inhibitors were preceded. DNJ only inhibited competitively the hydrolysis of cellobiose and pNPGlu while "activated" the transglycosylation of pNPGlu and pNPFuc. This was {{evident from the}} increased V(max) tr value with no change of the apparent K(m) tr. In contrast, butanol exhibited a competitive inhibition to the transglycosylation reaction and non-competitive inhibition to the hydrolysis.

40|$|Cerion is a morphologically diverse genus of {{land snails}} inhabiting Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Bahama Islands, Hispanola, Virgin Islands, Dutch Antilles, and the Florida Keys. Due to {{extensive}} interpopulational variation over 600 {{species have been}} described, but nearly all hybridize freely, and only one case of sympatry is known. Morphological variation within populations is much more moderate. The distribution of morphological types has been explained {{as the result of}} hurricanes casting ashore lone propagules which founded new populations. But more recent work indicates there is a systematic pattern to the distribution of morphological types. Literature on the adaptive morphology of snail shells is reviewed and applied to Cerion. Specifically considered are shell size, color, strength of ribbing, and resistance to crushing. Experiments demonstrating the possible adaptive value of variation in each of these traits were performed and correlations between morphology and habitat were noted. ^ The force necessary to crush shells of seven species and ten populations of Cerion was determined using a mechanical crab claw. The populations sampled represent a variety of degrees of shell thickness, ribbiness, shape, and overall size. Models predicting shell strength from measures of shell height, breadth, thickness, and rib height were developed. Predictions of shell strength are consistent with determinations of snails 2 ̆ 7 susceptibility to being crushed by the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis, a predator of Cerion. ^ The color of different Cerion ranges from white to almost solid dark brown. It has been demonstrated for other snail species that more darkly pigmented shells absorb more radiant energy, and correlations between color and climate have been noted. Differences in the temperatures of Cerion shells of different degrees of mottling were estimated by measuring the temperatures of shells exposed to direct sunlight. Comparisons were also made between shells of different surface textures and ribbiness. The maximum difference between hourly mean temperatures was 3. 1 (DEGREES) C, between white and heavily mottled shells. The maximum shell temperatures of pigmented shells (48 (DEGREES) C) was below the lethal temperture determined in the laboratory when snails were exposed to elevated temperatures for 5 hours (52. 5 (DEGREES) C). But snails exposed to 42. 5 (DEGREES) C for one week died of dehydration. It is concluded that white shells should be favored in habitats where {{there is little or no}} shade. ^ Nine morphospecies of Cerion were collected from Abaco Island and Long Island in the Bahamas and from the Florida Keys. Habitat data for each collection site were recorded and included location, elevation, substrate type, shade, predominant vegetation, presence of other snail species, and evidence of predators. Notes were also made of the estivation position at each site, i. e., whether the snails were in leaf litter or above ground on plants or rocks. Snails with stronger shell types, as determined by experimental means, were more commonly found where there were signs of potential predators, especially Gecarcinus lateralis. Pigmented snails were more often found in shaded habitats, and <b>white</b> <b>snails</b> in habitats where they were exposed to direct sunlight. Snails at the most exposed sites had a lower height to breadth ratio, and small adult snails and juveniles behaviorally compensate for their greater susceptibility to desiccation by estivating in leaf litter rather than above ground. Thus, the distribution of different Cerion shell morphologies is consistent with functional adaptations to local habitat. ...|$|R
