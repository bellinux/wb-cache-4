40|$|Abstract Background: Major {{challenges}} in periodontology include understanding the pathophysiology, {{the interplay between}} various components of the host response, parallels with other diseases and identifying biomarkers of the disease. Objectives: Four <b>reviews</b> <b>were</b> compiled {{with the aim of}} better understanding: (1) the role of polymorphic nuclear leucocytes (PMNs), i. e. neutrophils; (2) the function of cytokine networks in the host response; (3) whether parallels exist with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); and (4) whether useful biomarkers currently exist to help in the management of periodontal disease. Material and Methods: Based on the focused questions, electronic and manual searches were conducted for human, animal and cellular studies on the above topics. Results: Papers fulfilling the inclusion criteria <b>were</b> selected <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> <b>were</b> <b>written</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> corrected before the academy meeting to produce consensus statements. Conclusion: The following consensus statements were produced. PMNs are important in the pathophysiology of periodontal disease but there is limited evidence on their much quoted destructive potential. Cytokine networks are enormously complex and we are really at the beginning of understanding their role in the disease process. RA has both similarities and marked differences to periodontal disease although the existing utilization of anticytokine therapies and other molecules in its treatment may have importance in periodontal disease therapy. Biomarkers for periodontal disease have yet to be completely defined but the ratio of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand to osteoprotegerin appears to be a biomarker test with utility for detecting bone destruction...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Strategies for {{improving}} the publication output of academics are {{an essential component of}} research directives at tertiary institutions. The aim of this report was to highlight the effects of a writing retreat as an intervention strategy used by a university faculty to improve academic publication output. The strategy used included a structured programme over a period of three days guided by a facilitator. METHODS: The report uses a qualitative design to report the effects of the writing retreat on the participants. RESULTS: The major themes that emerged <b>were</b> <b>reviewing</b> <b>and</b> critical reading, <b>writing</b> for publication, personal growth and confidence, dedicated time, peer mentoring, programme structure and facilitation, and future directives. CONCLUSION: From the feedback obtained, it is evident that strategies such as a writing retreat provide academics with an opportunity to produce articles that are a benefit to the authors’ career trajectories as well as the institutional publication profile of their university...|$|R
40|$|Simulations {{suggest that}} photomixing in {{resonant}} laser-assisted field emission {{could be used}} to generate and detect signals from DC to 100 THz. It is the objective of this research to develop a system to efficiently couple the microwave signals generated on an emitting tip by optical mixing. Four different methods for coupling are studied. Tapered Goubau line is found to be the most suitable. Goubau line theory <b>is</b> <b>reviewed,</b> <b>and</b> programs <b>are</b> <b>written</b> to determine loss on the line. From this, Goubau tapers are designed that have a 1 : 100 bandwidth. These tapers are finally simulated using finite difference time domain, to find the optimum design parameters. Tapered Goubau line is an effective method for coupling power from the field emitting tip. It has large bandwidth, and acceptable loss. Another important consideration is that it is the easiest to manufacture of the four possibilities studied, an important quality for any prototype...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{pleasure}} {{for me to have}} put together some thoughts on the subject of monitoring and evaluation, an understated issue in the development planning and management, both at national and organizational level The article describes the concept of M&E system and the process through which foundation of an effective M&E system could be laid in development sector organizations. Its main focus is on management rather than technical issues such as M&E tools or research instruments. However, it highlights the need and usefulness of setting M&E standards and automation through MIS for strengthening the M&E system at an advanced stage of system development subject to affordability and capacity. The article is an effort to formulate and express management concepts based on contemporary theories and personal experiences over a decade. It also contains some common terminology used in this area of work. There is a limited bibliography consisted of publications and documents that have <b>been</b> <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> consulted in <b>writing</b> this article. I wish to thank all those writers, M&E experts and professional managers, whose ideas have founded the very basis of this document.

40|$|Tito Marrone’s Work Inside Sergio Corazzini’s Roman Club   The poetic work of Tito Marrone, {{forgotten}} {{for years}} {{due to his}} prolonged creative silence, reveals itself to be key to understanding how the Crepuscolar Roman related to the Francophone Symbolist poets. Marrone, slightly more senior than his associates, {{was the only one}} to possess a solid grasp of French culture and command of its language. His association with Rosso di San Secondo and with Pirandello, additionally, shows an author needlessly excluded from the cultural context of the time: his presence as a character in Pirandello’s novel Suo marito and as a protagonist in Rosso di San Secondo’s Storie di uomini e di angeli is testimony to the bond he had with these two authors, who were, inter alia, his contemporaries. Moreover, Marrone was in contact with different proponents of Sicilian Futurism, and so Crepuscolar and Futurist influences also characterized his use of language and poetic style. Ultimately of interest <b>are</b> Marrone’s <b>reviews</b> <b>and</b> critical <b>writing,</b> that show a fine analytic eye and capacity to gather and interpret the authentic elements of his contemporary literary and theatrical milieu. And so, for these reasons, it would now be beneficial to shed light on and critically anthologize Marrone’s ample texts, which themselves would also come to be important in the Crepuscolar Roman movement. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of e-commerce, many products are now being sold worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain {{a better understanding of}} customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons. First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second, international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for multilingual opinion mining. Third, {{this is the first time}} an automatic questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in China and America, where product <b>reviews</b> <b>are</b> <b>written</b> <b>and</b> read in Chinese and English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine of the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American customers care more about the internal features of products...|$|R
40|$|Este projeto artístico teve como objetivo aprofundar duas questões relativas à {{performance}} no Teatro Musical: Quais são os métodos para uma interpretação com acting through song? - Como exprimir emoções a cantar? Para tal, procedeu-se a uma revisão bibliográfica e, simultaneamente à criação de um musical cujo reportório incluiu canções que retratam diversas emoções, de forma a tornar possível a experimentação das diversas teorias pesquisadas. Esta experimentação ocorreu nas aulas de canto e nos ensaios para o musical. Após este trabalho experimental e de pesquisa, concluiu-se que há duas perspetivas diferentes, mas complementares sobre a forma de interpretação de emoções em canções: uma mais direcionada para a construção da personagem e para a análise do texto cantado (métodos utilizados no teatro), e outra mais focada no uso das expressões faciais e dos sinais vocais característicos das diferentes emoções. The {{main objective}} behind this artistic project is, to thoroughly investigate two {{questions related to}} performance in Musical Theatre: - Which methods should we use for a performance with good acting through song? - How to express emotions while singing? For that effect, a literature <b>review</b> <b>was</b> <b>written</b> <b>and,</b> simultaneously, a musical was created. This repertoire of this musical included songs that portrayed different emotions, in order to enable the experimentation of the researched theories. This experimentation was carried out during the singing lessons and the rehearsals for the musical. Both experimental and research work, led {{to the conclusion that}} there are two different, but complementary perspectives on the way in which to interpret emotions in songs: one more related {{to the creation of the}} character and the analysis of the lyrics (common methods used in acting), and another one more focused on the use...|$|R
