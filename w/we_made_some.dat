500|$|Quentin Tarantino was {{originally}} intended to direct this episode, but was stopped from doing so by the Directors Guild of America. [...] Although the episode was written specifically for Tarantino to direct, the DGA complained that Tarantino, {{who is not a}} member, failed to join the union after working on ER as a director, per an agreement between the two entities. A spokeswoman from 20th Century Fox later noted, [...] "Quentin approached us, we were very excited at the opportunity. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> special arrangements, and we're disappointed that it's not happening. But we bow to Quentin's philosophical stance [...] we hope something can be worked out for the future." [...] The episode's air date was flipped with the episode [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the latter episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently had she been aware of this at the time, as Scully discovers she has cancer at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E
500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was {{determined}} to move on from the final after scoring an own goal: [...] "Losing cup finals and scoring an own goal is a bad day for myself, but I'll {{look forward to the}} next game now." [...] He also said that Chelsea deserved the victory: [...] "We scored early on and tried to see the clock out because we were 15 minutes away from lifting the cup, but credit to Chelsea they came back and deserved the win." [...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal you finish the game, but <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> mistakes and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I say to the players we must be proud because we played a good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E

The group [...] "aim for the stars" [...] on its choices of collaborators, with Wentz stating, [...] "I {{want to bring in}} people who no one would expect...This year it's like, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> new friends, like Lil Wayne. Or let's get Jay-Z on there." [...] Wentz commented on working with Jay-Z, saying [...] "It was insane. We called him up and thought we were gonna talk to his assistant. Then he answers the phone, like, 'Yo, this is Hov,' and we were like, 'Um ...' It just happened like that. And it was pretty crazy." [...] Jay-Z recorded his introduction to the album's opening song [...] "Thriller" [...] while on tour in Australia and sent it to the band, who later put the vocal on the album. At a fashion show in Los Angeles, Wentz met rapper Kanye West, who invited Wentz and Stump to his home to share new music. West then agreed to create a remix of [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] three weeks before the scheduled release of the album. The band was unable to include the remix on the album due to time constraints, but a remix of West's version featuring Lil Wayne, Lupe Fiasco, Travis McCoy, Paul Wall and Tyga was released in July 2007.|$|E

500|$|... "Rock Show", {{the first}} season finale of Parks and Recreation was written by Norm Hiscock and {{directed}} by series co-founder Michael Schur. Schur said he felt [...] "Rock Show" [...] marked a change in tone for the series and struck a better balance between personal and professional stories {{than any of the}} other episodes from the season. Schur said: [...] "We treated that whole six-episode season like a pilot. If you go back and watch those episodes now, you can see us making changes. The sixth episode is different in tone than the first. And <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> character tweaks, like every show ever does". Amy Poehler said she believed [...] "Rock Show" [...] would end what she described as the inevitable comparisons between Parks and Recreation and The Office, which is also produced by Parks creators Schur and Greg Daniels. Poehler said, [...] "I think it was something we had to work through in the beginning, and I’m kind of hoping we’re on the other side of that and people will start to judge the show on its own, for what it is and realize it’s just a completely different world in a similar style.” Schur made his directorial debut with [...] "Rock Show", and had only one day of preparation before directing the episode. While preparing to direct the episode, Schur was asked to make an appearance on The Office as Mose Schrute, the cousin of Dwight Schrute and a popular minor character, in the fifth season finale episode, [...] "Company Picnic". Schur regretfully declined because he needed the time to work on [...] "Rock Show", leading Office episode writers Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta to create the character Rolf, Dwight's friend played by James Urbaniak, as an alternative.|$|E

The town, too, appeared safe; there were no watchmen, and yet people slept everywhere upon cots placed opposite their open doors.

6000|$|From Derby, still journeying northwards, {{we passed}} {{two months in}} Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the {{northern}} sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than mine; his mind expanded {{in the company of}} men of talent, and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors.

60|$|Along {{the edges}} of those vast {{mountains}} we passed {{with the help of}} our guide, till we came into the forest of Swale; and finding ourselves perfectly concealed here, for no soldier had ever been here all the war, nor perhaps would not, if it had lasted seven years, we thought we wanted a few days' rest, at least for our horses. So we resolved to halt; and while we did so, <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> disguises, and sent out some spies into the country; but as here were no great towns, nor no post road, we got very little intelligence. We rested four days, and then marched again; and indeed having no great stock of money about us, and not very free of that we had, four days was enough for those poor places to be able to maintain us.|$|E

On {{approaching}} the Town, we found the highway lined {{on both sides with}} crowds of traders, and other strangers of all nations; who had come out, attracted by curiosity to see the conqueror of Silesia, and had ranged themselves in two rows there. His Majesty's entry into Frankfurt, although a very triumphant one, was far from being ostentatious. We passed like lightning before the eyes of the spectators, and we were so covered with dust, that it was difficult to distinguish the color of our coats and the features of our faces. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>some</b> purchases at Frankfurt; and arrived safely in the Capital [next day], where the King was received amidst the acclamations of his People."
