25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E
2500|$|CitroÃ«n SM non-US market {{vehicles}} were equipped with heating of the headlamp cover glasses, this heat supplied by ducts carrying warm {{air from the}} radiator exhaust to {{the space between the}} headlamp lenses and the cover glasses. This provided demisting/defogging of the entire interior of the cover glasses, keeping the glass clear of mist/fog over the entire surface. The glasses have thin stripes on their surfaces that are heated by the headlight beams; however, the ducted warm air provides demisting when the headlamps are not turned on. The glasses' stripes on both D and SM cars appear similar to rear <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> electric defogger heating strips, but they are passive, not electrified ...|$|E

50|$|Container {{glass is}} a type of glass for the {{production}} of glass containers, such as bottles, jars, drinkware, and bowls. Container glass stands in contrast to flat glass (used for windows, glass doors, transparent walls, <b>windshields)</b> and <b>glass</b> fiber (used for thermal insulation, in fiberglass composites, and optical communication).|$|R
25|$|The SM's six {{headlight}} set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. specification cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate <b>glass</b> <b>windshields</b> of the headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, which is why the DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight <b>glass</b> <b>windshields</b> at the same time.|$|R
50|$|Utilizing {{the same}} iStabilizer Mount technology, the iStabilizer Glass is a {{smartphone}} and GPS attachment that secures {{the device to}} a car <b>windshield.</b> The <b>Glass</b> attaches to the windshield using a suction cup, and has an adjustable arm that can pivot the screen of the device from driver to passenger.|$|R
5000|$|Automotive head-up {{displays}} {{have seen}} applications in several cars, augmenting analog gauges {{with a digital}} readout on the <b>windshield</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Low-E" [...] {{glass was}} {{introduced}} to the North American residential building market in the 1980s by a collaboration between Rob Hammon, now with BIRAenergy, and a <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> manufacturer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{preliminary}} report, given during lap 18, {{indicates that}} Smith [...] "may have been injured". The caution {{put in place}} by Smith's crash was released on lap 27, after Smith's car was towed away and <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> from the car was completely cleared from the track.|$|E
50|$|Vetrazzo {{claims on}} their website that their countertops consist of {{recycled}} glass and a cement binder. The glass {{is said to}} have been sourced from a curbside recycling program, windows, <b>windshields,</b> laboratory <b>glass,</b> stained glass and traffic lights. Vetrazzo's website also claims that their countertops are recyclable at the end of their useful lives.|$|R
50|$|The US {{cars were}} fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Buyers outside North America could also opt for {{headlight}} wipers and washers and/or headlights {{with a special}} vacuum-operated linkage whose aim could be adjusted at the dash depending on vehicle load. Separate <b>glass</b> <b>windshields</b> for headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, {{which is why the}} DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight <b>glass</b> <b>windshields</b> at the same time.|$|R
25|$|Surface treatments, {{coatings}} or lamination {{may follow}} {{to improve the}} chemical durability (glass container coatings, glass container internal treatment), strength (toughened <b>glass,</b> bulletproof <b>glass,</b> <b>windshields),</b> or optical properties (insulated glazing, anti-reflective coating).|$|R
50|$|Cadillac was restyled and {{re-engineered}} for 1961. The new grille slanted {{back towards}} both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> were seen. New standard equipment included {{a remote control}} trunk lock.|$|E
5000|$|GM's design {{engineers}} fashioned the [...] "Rounded-line" [...] exterior {{in an effort}} to help improve aerodynamics and fuel efficiency, using wind tunnel technology to help them sculpt the body. Other design traits include sleek sculpted body work, an aerodynamic cab with steep windshield rake, and a unique available hidden radio antenna embedded into the <b>windshield</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{most of the}} stock {{one-piece}} windshields were replaced with two-piece units {{similar to those used}} on the EMD GP20, a move intended to bring standardization of <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> to several classes of Santa Fe locomotives and thereby reduce maintenance stockpiles. A [...] "second generation"-style traction motor blower housing was fitted to the left side of later rebuilds.|$|E
50|$|Doors {{must remain}} in {{original}} stock location and maintain stock shape and size. Doors may be welded or fastened closed. <b>Windshield</b> and window <b>glass</b> is optional {{but must be}} shatterproof if retained.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter's <b>windshield</b> employs three <b>glass</b> panes {{separated}} by air gaps. The brittleness {{of the glass}} offers much less birdstrike energy-absorption capability than the laminated polycarbonate windshields of more conventional aircraft; attention must accordingly {{be given to the}} risk of catastrophic bird impact, and to methods of strike prevention that address bird populations around landing sites rather than the modification of the window's design. Bird populations' direct reduction, as well as careful scheduling of Orbiter landing times, are suggested as viable alternatives. The question of birdstrike-resistant <b>glass</b> <b>windshield</b> design for hypersonic aerospacecraft is discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} to mid-1950s the boats had styling {{features}} fairly common to the era, such as dramatically dropped shear lines and tail-fins. Automotive safety <b>glass</b> <b>windshields</b> purchased from the Ford Motor Company were fitted {{to some of the}} earliest 16 foot V-hull models.|$|R
5000|$|The Ford {{line of cars}} {{was again}} {{refreshed}} for 1952, although remaining similar to the all-new 1949 Fords. This time, curved one-piece <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> joined a new [...] "Mileage Maker" [...] straight-6 engine with 101 hp. [...] The 226 CID (3.7 L) L-head straight-6 was replaced by an overhead valve 215 CID (3.5 L) Mileage Maker with 101 hp (75 kW), while the old 239 CID (3.9 L) Flathead V8 remained with 110 hp (82 kW).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, Paul Kopsch (an Ohio coroner), Daniel Turcos (a police sergeant), and Donald Ward (Kopsch's special investigator), began {{experimenting with}} special purpose handgun ammunition. Their {{objective}} {{was to develop a}} law enforcement round capable of improved penetration against hard targets, such as <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> and automobile doors. Conventional bullets, made primarily from lead, often become deformed and less effective after striking hard targets, especially when fired at handgun velocities. The inventors named their company [...] "KTW," [...] after their initials.|$|E
50|$|The <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> itself blocks {{most of the}} UV {{light and}} some of the {{infrared}} radiation. But it can't protect from the visible light that mostly penetrates through it and gets absorbed by the objects inside the car. The visible light that passes into the interior through the windshield is converted into the infrared light which, in its turn, is blocked by the glass and gets trapped inside, heating up the interior. Windshield sun shades have a reflective surface to bounce the light back, reducing the interior temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Energy-absorbing crush {{zones are}} {{completely}} ineffective {{if they are}} physically bypassed; an extreme example of this occurs when the elevated platform of a tractor-trailer completely misses the front bumper of a passenger car, and first contact is with the <b>glass</b> <b>windshield</b> of the passenger compartment.|$|R
2500|$|CUCVs are {{intended}} to perform [...] "background" [...] roles, providing support for frontline forces, such as cargo transport, troop transport, first aid, and communications. CUCVs are not built for direct frontline combat use, as evident by their lack of bulletproofing and protection from ordnance. Like many of the vehicle parts, the <b>windshield,</b> cabin <b>glass,</b> and body panels are civilian-grade and offer no protection from firearms or explosives. As a result, some CUCVs were replaced in the 1980s and 1990s by the HMMWVs they were to augment.|$|R
40|$|Theoretical partâs opening {{describes}} {{brief history}} of manufacturing of <b>windshields</b> and <b>glass</b> in general. Further in this part, key parameters and additional features are described as well as manufacturing processes of a modern windshield. Moreover, homologation procedure is clarified. The main focus of this thesis is technical description of typical damage of carâs windshield and investigation of its root causes, which may help to reveal insurance fraud. The thesis also outlines alternative way, {{which can be used}} to recover damaged windshield or, if necessary, to replace it...|$|R

50|$|Cadillac was restyled and {{re-engineered}} for 1961. The new grille slanted {{back towards}} both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plan, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. Standard equipment power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual reverse lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror and oil filter. Rubberized {{front and rear}} coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.|$|E

50|$|They {{often had}} luxury {{features}} common on upper models of GM brands, such as cruise control, air conditioning, AM/FM/8-track sound systems, an aluminum/fiberglass body, {{as well as}} air suspension. The aerodynamic styling, with the wrap around <b>windshield</b> and expansive <b>glass</b> area, gave the vehicle a futuristic appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} colors of sea glass are kelly green, brown, and white (clear). These colors come from bottles used by {{companies}} that sell beer, juices, and soft drinks. The clear or white glass comes from clear plates and <b>glasses,</b> <b>windshields,</b> windows, and assorted other sources.|$|R
5000|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the boxy Crackerbox, the exterior of the Astro/Titan featured rounded body corners and wraparound <b>windshield</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] In 1975, GMC introduced a Dragfoiler roof spoiler as an option. [...] In an option that became standard a year later, in 1979, GMC and Chevrolet offered the SS (Special Series) package. [...] Featuring a (much) larger radiator grille, improvements to exterior and interior trim, the SS package was meant to market the Astro/Titan towards owner-operators. [...] In 1983, the Aero Astro option package was released, largely as an effort to improve fuel economy. Along with the Dragfoiler roof spoiler, the option package included body extension panels between the cab and trailer, an air dam below an extended bumper and an optimized radiator grille.|$|E
50|$|The Court {{conducted}} an extensive four-day Frye Daubert hearing... which it considered {{such issues as}} the basic science of laser technology, the technical methodology of, and theoretical challenges to, the reliability of radar guns... including the possibility of other âpulsesâ {{in the vicinity of}} use, difficulties in target identification, possible errors caused by vehicle license plates, <b>windshield</b> <b>glass,</b> shape, and color, and potential malfunction of the device. The Court also took judicial notice of at least six scientific publications on the subject in various journals of interest, together with two police-related studies in Florida, one New Jersey study, and one independent study in Florida on this and similar radar devices, all of which met the standards set forth by the National Highway Safety Administration...|$|E

New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound <b>windshield</b> <b>glass</b> were seen. The revised backlight treatment had crisp angular lines with thin pillars on some models and heavier semi-blind quarter roof posts on others. DeVille models featured front series designation scripts {{and a lower}} body [...] "skeg" [...] trimmed with a thin, three-quarter-length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening {{to the rear of}} the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual backup lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel discs, plain fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and 2-way power seats. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available. A new short-decked four-door Town Sedan hardtop appeared mid-season.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the pilot's <b>windshield</b> {{became a}} <b>glass</b> {{assembly}} (earlier {{it had been}} acrylic glass with a heat strip overlay). In 1996, numerous switches were moved to an overhead console. In 1999, the Mirage gained the strengthened wing designed for the turboprop Meridian. The base price for the M350 is $1.15 million.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the blind}} {{separation}} of linear image mix-tures is presented in this paper. Such mixtures often oc-cur, when, for example, we photograph a scene through a semireflecting medium (<b>windshield</b> or <b>glass).</b> The proposed method requires two mixtures of two scenes captured under different illumination conditions. We show that the bound-ary values of {{the ratio of the}} two mixtures can lead to an accurate estimation of the separation matrix. The technique is very simple, fast, and reliable, as it does not depend on iterative procedures. The method effectiveness is tested on both artificially mixed images and real images. 1...|$|R
50|$|New to {{the track}} in 2010, racing cars is for teens and pre-teens too, and {{starting}} in March, boys and girls, ages 11-15, will be racing in the Twister class. This is the first season for this class to compete at 85 Speedway, but other tracks around Texas have found it a popular activity and sport for the young drivers and their parents. These drivers compete in 4-cylinder, front-wheel drive cars that are completely stock, except for <b>windshields</b> and <b>glass</b> that have been removed. These young drivers learn driving skills, basic car maintenance, and sportsmanship, while spending quality time with their families.|$|R
