On the contrary, S IV is supersaturated in the liquid phase, in addition to the presence of significant aerosol-derived S VI transferred through nucleation scavenging. Upon droplet evaporation, a significant part of most species, including S IV, tends to efficiently return back into the gas phase. Overall, gas contribution to the droplet solute concentration ranges from at least 48. 5 to 98 % depending on the chemical species. This is particularly important considering that aerosol scavenging efficiencies are often calculated assuming a negligible gas-phase contribution to the solute concentration.

40|$|International audienceChemical {{reactions}} of dissolved {{gases in the}} liquid phase {{play a key role}} in atmospheric processes both in the formation of secondary atmospheric compounds and their <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> but also in the regulation of the oxidizing capacity of the troposphere (Lelieveld and Crutzen, 1991). The behaviour of gaseous species and their chemical transformation in clouds are difficult to observe experimentally given the complex nature of clouds. In this study, we have deployed an experimental set-up to provide an in-situ quantification of phase partitioning and chemical transformation of both organic (CH 3 COOH, HCOOH, H 2 C 2 O 4) and inorganic (NH 3, HNO 3, SO 2, HCl) species in clouds. We found that, carboxylic acids, nitrate, and chloride can be considered close to Henry's law equilibrium, within analytical uncertainty and instrumental errors. On another hand, for reduced nitrogen species, dissolution of material from the gas phase is kinetically limited and never reaches the equilibrium predicted by thermodynamics, resulting in significant sub-saturation of the liquid phase. On the contrary, sulfate is supersaturated in the liquid phase, indicating the presence of significant aerosol-derived material transferred through nucleation scavenging. Upon droplet evaporation, most species, including SO 2, tend to efficiently return back into the gas phase. In that sense, these species contribute to acidification (for carboxylic acids) or neutralization (for NH 3) of the liquid-phase but not totally of the processed aerosols. The only species that appears to be modified in the multiphase system is nitrate. A fraction of at least 10 to 40 % of the liquid phase NO 3 originates from dissolved HNO 3 of which only a fraction evaporates back to the gas phase upon evaporation, resulting in an NO 3 enrichment of the aerosol phase. In-cloud gas-to-particle transfer of HNO 3 possibly plays a key role in aerosol acidification and in the modification of their hygroscopic properties. Our study emphasizes the need to account for the in-cloud interaction between particles and gases to provide an adequate modeling of multiphase chemistry systems and its impact on the atmospheric aerosol and gas phases...|$|E
40|$|A dynamic {{conceptual}} and lumped accumulation wash-off model (SEWSYS) is uncertainty-calibrated with Zn, Cu, Pb and Cd field data from an intensive, detailed monitoring campaign. We use the generalized linear uncertainty estimation (GLUE) technique {{in combination with}} the Metropolis algorithm, which allows identifying a range of behavioral model parameter sets. The small catchment size and nearness of the rain gauge justified excluding the hydrological model parameters from the uncertainty assessment. Uniform, closed prior distributions were heuristically specified for the dry and <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> parameters, which allowed using an open not specified uniform prior for the dry deposition parameter. We used an exponential likelihood function based on the sum of squared errors between observed and simulated event masses and adjusted a scaling factor to cover 95 % of the observations within the empirical 95 % model prediction bounds. A positive correlation between the dry deposition and the dry (wind) <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> was revealed as well as a negative correlation between the <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> (wash-off) <b>rate</b> and the ratio between the dry deposition and wind <b>removal</b> <b>rates,</b> which determines the maximum pool of accumulated metal available on the conceptual catchment surface. Forward Monte Carlo analysis based on the posterior parameter sets covered 95 % of the observed event mean concentrations, and 95 % prediction quantiles for site mean concentrations were estimated to 470 mu g/l +/- 20 % for Zn, 295 mu g/l +/- 40 % for Cu, 20 mu g/l +/- 80 % for Pb and 0. 6 mu g/l +/- 35 % for Cd. This uncertainty-based calibration procedure adequately describes the prediction uncertainty conditioned on the used model and data, but seasonal and site-to-site variation is not considered, i. e. predicting metal concentrations in stormwater runoff from gauged as well as ungauged catchments with the SEWSYS model is generally more uncertain than the indicated numbers...|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to increasing trends in sulfur deposition in Northeast Asia, three {{countries in the}} region (China, Japan, and Korea) agreed to devise abatement strategies. The concepts of critical loads and source-receptor (S-R) relationships provide guidance for formulating such strategies. Based on the Long-range Transboundary Air Pollutants in Northeast Asia (LTP) project, this study analyzes sulfur deposition data in order to optimize acidic loads over the three countries. The three groups involved in this study carried out a full year (2002) of sulfur deposition modeling over the geographic region spanning the three countries, using three air quality models: MM 5 -CMAQ, MM 5 -RAQM, and RAMS-CADM, employed by Chinese, Japanese, and Korean modeling groups, respectively. Each model employed its own meteorological numerical model and model parameters. Only the emission rates for SO 2 and NOx obtained from the LTP project were the common parameter used in the three models. Three models revealed some bias from dry to wet deposition, particularly the latter because of the bias in annual precipitation. This finding points to the need for further sensitivity tests of the <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> in association with underlying cloud-precipitation physics and parameterizations. Despite this bias, the annual total (dry plus wet) sulfur deposition predicted by the models were surprisingly very similar. The ensemble average annual total deposition was 7, 203. 6 +/- 370 kt S with a minimal mean fractional error (MFE) of 8. 95 +/- 5. 24 % and a pattern correlation (PC) of 0. 89 - 0. 93 between the models. This exercise revealed that despite rather poor error scores in comparison with observations, these consistent total deposition values across the three models, based on LTP group's input data assumptions, suggest a plausible S-R relationship that {{can be applied to the}} next task of designing cost-effective emission abatement strategies. close 3...|$|R
40|$|The South African savannah {{region is}} complex {{environment}} {{of air pollution}} and natural emissions influenced by a strong seasonal cycle in biomass burning and strong precipitation. However, the scarcity of long-term observations means that our knowledge of controlling aerosol processes in this environment is very poor. Here we use a new dataset of 18 months of aerosol observations to understand the factors that control aerosol properties, and in particular cloud condensation nuclei. We find that biomass burning produces a strong source of primary CCN-sized particles during the dry winter season. However, measured CCN-sized particle concentrations remain high during the wet summer season {{despite the lack of}} burning and high <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates.</b> We show that during the wet season, a substantial fraction of CCN-sized particles originate from boundary layer new particle formation, whereas primary sources dominate during the dry winter season. The large contribution of boundary layer nucleation to CCN concentrations during the wet season is found to be due to high particle formation and growth rates and low pre-existing particle concentration in the beginning of particle formation. Based on the estimated seasonal cycle of condensable sulphuric acid and organic vapours, higher growth rates during the wet season are attributed to vapours of biogenic origin. Global model results for this region have the same seasonal cycle in nuclei growth rates but the opposite cycle in particle formation rates, and both rates are much lower than observed. In contrast, the same model tends to capture the seasonal cycle in particle concentrations at many other global sites where nucleation is an important process. These results point to deficiencies in our understanding of biogenic emissions and the factors controlling nucleation and growth in such dynamic environments...|$|R
40|$|Long-term (2009 – 2015) {{observations}} of atmospheric black carbon (BC) mass concentrations were performed using a continuous soot-monitoring system (COSMOS) at Fukue Island, western Japan, {{to provide information}} on <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> constraints and the emission strengths of important source regions in East Asia (China and others). The annual average mass concentration was 0. 36  µg m − 3, with distinct seasonality; high concentrations were recorded during autumn, winter, and spring and were caused by Asian continental outflows, which reached Fukue Island in 6 – 46  h. The observed data were categorized into two classes, i. e., with and without a wet removal effect, using the accumulated precipitation along a backward trajectory (APT) for the last 3  days as an index. Statistical analysis of the observed ΔBC ∕ ΔCO ratios was performed to obtain information on the emission ratios (from data with zero APT only) and wet removal rates (including data with nonzero APTs). The estimated emission ratios (5. 2 – 6. 9  ng m − 3  ppb − 1) varied over the six air mass origin areas; the higher ratios for south-central East China (30 – 35 ° N) than for north-central East China (35 – 40 ° N) indicated {{the relative importance of}} domestic emissions and/or biomass burning sectors. The significantly higher BC ∕ CO emission ratios adopted in the bottom-up Regional Emission inventory in Asia (REAS) version  2 (8. 3 – 23  ng m − 3  ppb − 1) over central East China and Korea needed to be reduced at least by factors of 1. 3 and 2. 8 for central East China and Korea, respectively, but the ratio for Japan was reasonable. The wintertime enhancement of the BC emission from China, predicted by REAS 2, was verified for air masses from south-central East China but not for those from north-central East China. Wet removal of BC was clearly identified as a decrease in the ΔBC ∕ ΔCO ratio against APT. The transport efficiency (TE), defined as the ratio of the ΔBC ∕ ΔCO ratio with precipitation to that without precipitation, was fitted reasonably well by a stretched exponential decay curve against APT; a single set of fitting parameters was sufficient to represent the results for air masses originating from different areas. An accumulated precipitation of 25. 5  ±  6. 1  mm reduced the TE to 1 ∕ e. BC-containing particles traveling to Fukue must have already been converted from hydrophobic to hydrophilic particles, because the behavior of TE against APT was similar to that of PM 2. 5, the major components of which are hydrophilic. Wet loss of BC greatly influenced interannual variations in the ΔBC ∕ ΔCO ratios and BC mass concentrations. This long-term data set will provide a benchmark for testing chemical transport/climate model simulations covering East Asia...|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{attempts}} have been made to incorporate sea-salt aerosol (SSA) source functions in chemistry transport models with varying results according to the complexity of the scheme considered. This contribution compares the inclusion of two different SSA algorithms in two chemistry transport models: CMAQ and CHIMERE. The main goal is to examine the differences in average SSA mass and composition and to study the seasonality of the prediction of SSA when applied to the Mediterranean area with high resolution for a reference year. Dry and wet deposition schemes are also analyzed to better understand the differences observed between both models in the target area. The applied emission algorithm in CHIMERE uses a semi-empirical formulation which obtains the surface emission rate of SSA as a function of the particle size and the surface wind speed raised to the power 3. 41. The emission parameterization included within CMAQ is somehow more sophisticated, since fluxes of SSA are corrected with relative humidity. In order to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, the participating algorithms as implemented in the chemistry transport models were evaluated against AOD measurements from Aeronet and available surface measurements in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, showing biases around − 0. 002 and − 1. 2 μg m − 3, respectively. The results indicate that both models represent accurately the patterns and dynamics of SSA and its non-uniform behavior in the Mediterranean basin, showing a strong seasonality. The levels of SSA strongly vary across the Western and the Eastern Mediterranean, reproducing CHIMERE higher annual levels in the Aegean Sea (12 μg m − 3) and CMAQ in the Gulf of Lion (9 μg m − 3). The large difference found for the ratio PM 2. 5 /total SSA in CMAQ and CHIMERE is also investigated. The dry and <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> <b>rates</b> are very similar for both models despite the different schemes implemented. Dry deposition essentially follows the surface drag stress patterns, meanwhile wet deposition is more scattered over the continent. CMAQ tends to provide larger amounts of SSA dry deposition over the Northern Mediterranean (0. 7 – 1. 0 g m − 2 yr − 1), meanwhile the Southeastern Mediterranean accounts for the maximum annual dry deposition in the CHIMERE model (0. 9 – 1. 5 g m − 2 yr − 1). The wet deposition is dominated by the accumulation mode and is strongly correlated to the precipitation patterns, showing CMAQ a higher wet deposition/total deposition ratio over coastal mountain chains. The results of both models constitute a step towards increasing the understanding of the SSA dynamics in a complex area as the Mediterranean...|$|R

40|$|Ground-based {{measurements}} of black carbon (BC) were performed near an industrial source {{region in the}} early summer of 2014 and at a remote island in Japan {{in the spring of}} 2015. Here, we report the temporal variations in the transport, size distributions, and mixing states of the BC-containing particles. These particles were characterized using a continuous soot monitoring system, a single particle soot photometer, and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor. The effects of aging on the growth of BC-containing particles were examined by comparing the ground-based observations between the near-source and remote island sites. Secondary formation of sulfate and organic aerosols strongly affected the increases in BC coating (i. e., enhancement of cloud condensation nuclei activity) with air mass aging from the source to the outflow regions. The effects of <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> on BC microphysics were elucidated by classifying the continental outflow air masses depending on the enhancement ratios of BC to CO (ΔBC ∕ ΔCO), which were used as an indicator of the transport efficiency of BC. It was found that ΔBC ∕ ΔCO ratios were controlled mainly by the <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> during transport in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) on the timescale of 1 – 2  days. The meteorological conditions and backward trajectory analyses suggested that air masses strongly affected by <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> originated mainly from a region in southern China (20 – 35 ° N) in the spring of 2015.

In particular, the high dependency of <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> on pressure when α > 1 results in a much higher material <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> in the upper pattern than in the lower pattern. Therefore, the planarization efficiency of ceriabased slurry is better, from initial polishing time to the completion of the polishing step, than that of conventional silica-based slurry with an exponent value of α ≈ 1...|$|R

The influence of the applied current density on the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of p-benzoquinone has also been studied. An increase in the applied current density was found to increase the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of p-benzoquinone only slightly, thus resulting in an actual decrease of the current efficiency of this process.

40|$|AbstractWire {{electric}} discharge machine (WEDM) is a spark erosion non conventional machining method to cut hard and conductive material {{with the help of}} a wire electrode. High strength low alloy steel (HSLA) is a hard alloy with high hardness and wear resisting property. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of parameters on metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> for WEDM using HSLA as work-piece and brass wire as electrode. HSLA used in cars, trucks, cranes, bridges, roller coasters and other structures that are designed to handle large amounts of stress. It is observed that metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface roughness increases with increase in pulse on time and peak current. Metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface roughness decreases with increase in pulse off time and servo voltage. Wire mechanical tension has no significant effect on metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface roughness. Response Surface methodology (RSM) is used to optimize the process parameter for metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface roughness. Response Surface Methodology is formulating a mathematical model which correlates the independent process parameters with the desired metal <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> and surface roughness. The central composite rotatable design (CCRD) has been used to conduct the experiments...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of pad {{temperature}} on the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of tungsten were investigated. During polishing, the pad temperature was monitored and the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> behavior {{with respect to the}} pad temperature evolution was explored. The pad temperature was increased during tungsten CMP, and the tungsten <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> increased accordingly. Further, {{it was found that the}} two had a strong correlation. Although tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) polishing experiment showed that the pad temperature increased similarly under various experimental conditions, the TEOS <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> did not change for all conditions. A novel pad-cooling nozzle effectively reduced the pad temperature during tungsten polishing and influenced the tungsten <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> drop. Table motor current monitoring revealed that friction forces were almost identical under all experimental conditions for tungsten polishing regardless of the application of pad cooling. On the basis of pad temperature and table motor current data, it was clear that the tungsten <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> was determined by temperature, indicating that the tungsten removal mechanism was mostly driven by a chemical reaction. Further, the pad cooling function can be used to control the tungsten <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> effectively, resulting in a stable tungsten CMP process...|$|R
40|$|Many global aerosol {{and climate}} models, {{including}} the widely used Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM 5), have large biases in predicting aerosols in remote regions {{such as the}} upper troposphere and high latitudes. In this study, we conduct CAM 5 sensitivity simulations to understand the role of key processes associated with aerosol transformation and <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> affecting the vertical and horizontal long-range transport of aerosols to the remote regions. Improvements are made to processes that are currently not well represented in CAM 5, which are guided by surface and aircraft measurements together with results from a multi-scale aerosol–climate model that explicitly represents convection and aerosol–cloud interactions at cloud-resolving scales. We {{pay particular attention to}} black carbon (BC) due to its importance in the Earth system and the availability of measurements. We introduce into CAM 5 a new unified scheme for convective transport and aerosol <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> with explicit aerosol activation above convective cloud base. This new implementation reduces the excessive BC aloft to better simulate observed BC profiles that show decreasing mixing ratios in the mid- to upper-troposphere. After implementing this new unified convective scheme, we examine <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> of submicron aerosols that occurs primarily through cloud processes. The <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> depends strongly on the subgrid-scale liquid cloud fraction and the rate of conversion of liquid water to precipitation. These processes lead to very strong <b>wet</b> <b>removal</b> of BC and other aerosols over mid- to high latitudes during winter months. With our improvements, the Arctic BC burden has a 10 -fold (5 -fold) increase in the winter (summer) months, resulting in a much-better simulation of the BC seasonal cycle as well. Arctic sulphate and other aerosol species also increase but to a lesser extent. An explicit treatment of BC aging with slower aging assumptions produces an additional 30 -fold (5 -fold) increase in the Arctic winter (summer) BC burden. This BC aging treatment, however, has minimal effect on other underpredicted species. Interestingly, our modifications to CAM 5 that aim at improving prediction of high-latitude and upper-tropospheric aerosols also produce much-better aerosol optical depth (AOD) over various other regions globally when compared to multi-year AERONET retrievals. The improved aerosol distributions have impacts on other aspects of CAM 5, improving the simulation of global mean liquid water path and cloud forcing...|$|R
40|$|A {{dielectric}} barrier discharge (DBD) {{powered by}} pulsed sinusoidal voltage at atmospheric pressure {{was used for}} the removal of thin oil films. Using pulsed power with suitably chosen pulse and pause duration, the oil <b>removal</b> <b>rate,</b> obtained here by the film thickness differences and the total local treatment time, can be significantly enhanced when compared to the continuous excitation. At pulse lengths of 120 µs and pause lengths of 1200 µs, the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> is approximately 10. 4 nm/s. That is approximately twice the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> obtained without pauses. The <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of thin oil films sensitively depends on the pulse length in the range from 100 to 200 µs and the pause length shorter than 480 µs. We propose a simple equation, based on a model containing reactions with long-lived reactive species during the pause period, to describe the effect of pulse and pause length in the <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> of thin oil films...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompared {{to single}} pulses the {{utilization}} of pulse bursts on steel samples {{was reported to be}} more efficient. But with regards to the specific <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> it can be shown that a maximum value is achieved when the applied peak fluence equals exp(2) times the threshold fluence. The higher reported efficiency is caused by the reduced energy of the single pulses nearer to the optimum value. Recent investigations on the application of pulse bursts on copper samples suggest an interaction of the single pulses in a pulse burst in terms of the specific <b>removal</b> <b>rate.</b> The specific <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> drops to less than 50 % for a 2 -pulse-burst consisting of two pulses of identical pulse energy, whereas the maximum specific <b>removal</b> <b>rate</b> for a 3 -pulse-burst exceeds that of a single pulse by approx. 20 %.
