5|$|There are countless {{subjects}} that {{are affected by}} the ideas developed in the philosophy of mind. Clear examples of this are the nature of death and its definitive character, the nature of emotion, of perception and of memory. Questions about <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> is and what his or her identity consists of also {{have much to do with}} the philosophy of mind. There are two {{subjects that}}, in connection with the philosophy of the mind, have aroused special attention: free will and the self.|$|E
5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics taught that {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter knew <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter knew <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E
25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E
25|$|The theory {{holds that}} the stages {{are a part of}} the {{framework}} that helps people learn to live without what they lost. Lay people and practitioners consider the stages as tools to help frame and identify <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> who's suffered a loss may be feeling. The theory {{holds that the}} stages are not stops on a linear time line of grief. The theory also states that not everyone goes through all of the stages, nor in a prescribed order. In addition to the five-stages theory, KÃ¼bler-Ross has been credited with bringing mainstream awareness to the sensitivity required for better treatment of people who are dealing with a fatal disease.|$|E

25|$|Mammalian {{orthoreovirus}} {{does not}} really cause a significant disease in humans. Even though the virus is fairly common, the infection produced is either asymptomatic or causes a mild disease which is self-limiting in the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory region for children and infants. Symptoms are similar to <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> might have when they have the common cold, such as a low-grade fever and pharyngitits. However, in other animals such as baboons and reptiles, other known orthoreoviruses fusogenic strains can cause more serious illness. In baboons it can cause neurological illness while in reptiles {{it can be the}} cause of pneumonia. In birds this virus may even cause death.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{included}} in the National Highway Safety Commission's anti-drunk driving campaign, [...] "Drinking and Driving Can Kill a Friendship". The song was also included on the accompanying album. Jackson collected an award from President Ronald Reagan at the White House, in recognition for his support of the campaign. Reagan stated that Jackson was [...] "proof of <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> can accomplish through a lifestyle free of alcohol or drug abuse. People young and old respect that. And if Americans follow his example, then we can face up to the problem of drinking and driving, and we can, in Michael's words, 'Beat It'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album's lyrics discuss political issues in the United States. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News calls the album [...] "a response to the oppressive vacuousness of the Bush years". Dealing with specific tracks on the album, AllMusic states that Rise Against [...] "rages against the moral decay rotting {{the core of the}} U.S. on the opening 'Collapse (Post-Amerika),' just as they strike out against the slow dumbing down of America on 'Re-Education (Through Labor)'". In addition to political topics, more personal issues constitute {{a large portion of the}} lyrical content. [...] "Savior" [...] is about forgiveness and broken relationships, while [...] "The Dirt Whispered" [...] is about the need to sacrifice for <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> loves. Bassist Joe Principe said, [...] "The political side of this band is just that -- it's a side. There are political lyrics. There are social awareness and there are lyrics about the environment. I think if people take the time to read the lyrics, they'll know we're not strictly force feeding you our politics." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} painting was set in a barbershop with patrons {{of a variety of}} religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a [...] oil on canvas depicting tolerance as [...] "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.|$|E

500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, use of {{the term}} [...] "comprehensive campaign" [...] varies widely among labor activists, employers, {{attorneys}} or academics. This may cause confusion when an author or speaker refers to a comprehensive campaign but means something more restricted. Context is often the key to determining exactly <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> means, and speeches and written works must be closely read to determine the actual meaning of the descriptive phrase used.|$|E

For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis {{of the role of the}} environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.|$|E

2500|$|The idea of {{organizational}} justice stems from equity theory (Adams, 1963, 1965), which posits that judgments of equity and inequity {{are derived from}} comparisons between one's self and others based on inputs and outcomes. [...] Inputs refer to <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> perceives to contribute (e.g., knowledge and effort) while outcomes are what an individual perceives {{to get out of}} an exchange relationship (e.g., pay and recognition). [...] Comparison points against which these inputs and outcomes are judged may be internal (one's self at an earlier time) or external (other individuals).|$|E
2500|$|The {{final stage}} in {{learning}} to read, is the expert stage. [...] When a reader is {{at this stage of}} reading, it will usually only take them one half second to read almost any word. [...] The degree to which expert reading will change over the course of an adult's life depends on <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> reads and how much they read. [...] As a person matures, life experiences as well as the cognitive process of reading text shapes reading comprehension. [...] It is this interpretive response that adds depth to reading and will often take the reader in a new direction from where the author intended.|$|E
2500|$|Describing vocal {{sound is}} an inexact science {{largely because the}} human voice is a {{self-contained}} instrument. Since the vocal instrument is internal, the singer's ability to monitor the sound produced {{is complicated by the}} vibrations carried to the ear through the Eustachean (auditory) tube and the bony structures of the head and neck. In other words, most singers hear something different in their ears/head than <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> listening to them hears. As a result, voice teachers often focus less on how it [...] "sounds" [...] and more on how it [...] "feels". Vibratory sensations resulting from the closely related processes of phonation and resonation, and kinesthetic ones arising from muscle tension, movement, body position, and weight serve as a guide to the singer on correct vocal production.|$|E
