5|$|Conversely, on {{particularly}} windy days, {{even with}} penetration levels of 16%, <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> generation can surpass all other electric power sources in a country.

In a realistic wind turbine this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered.

5|$|Although the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{industry}} {{was affected by}} the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010, GWEC predicts that the installed capacity of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> will be 792.1 GW {{by the end of}} 2020 and 4,042 GW by end of 2050. The increased commissioning of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power. In some cases, wind onshore is already the cheapest electric power generation option and costs are continuing to decline. The contracted prices for wind onshore {{for the next few years}} are now as low as 30 USD/MWh.|$|E

Germany held the top spot in Europe in terms of installed capacity, {{with a total of}} 27,215 MW as of 31 December 2010. In 2015 <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> constituted 15.6% of all installed power generation capacity in the EU and it generates around 11.4% of its power.|$|E

5|$|In the UK {{there were}} 124 {{separate}} occasions from 2008 to 2010 when the nation's wind output fell {{to less than}} 2% of installed capacity. A report on Denmark's <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> noted that their <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> network provided less than 1% of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> advocates argue that these periods of low wind {{can be dealt with}} by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness, or interlinking with HVDC. Electrical grids with slow-responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of <b>wind</b> <b>power.</b> According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology, interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33% of the total energy produced (i.e. about 8% of total nameplate capacity) to be used as reliable, baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads, as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height.|$|E

5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> is variable, {{and during}} low wind periods {{it must be}} {{replaced}} by other power sources. Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand, but the variability of intermittent power sources such as <b>wind</b> <b>power,</b> is more frequent than those of conventional power generation plants which, when scheduled to be operating, {{may be able to}} deliver their nameplate capacity around 95% of the time.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide use {{of solar}} power and <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{continued}} to grow significantly in 2012. Solar electricity consumption increased by 58 percent, to 93 terawatt-hours (TWh). Use of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> in 2012 increased by 18.1 percent, to 521.3 TWh. Global solar and wind energy installed capacities continued to expand even though new investments in these technologies declined during 2012. Worldwide investment in solar power in 2012 was $140.4billion, an 11 percent decline from 2011, and <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> investment was down 10.1 percent, to $80.3billion. But due to lower production costs for both technologies, total installed capacities grew sharply. This investment decline, but growth in installed capacity, may again occur in 2013. Analysts expect the market to triple by 2030. In 2015, investment in renewables exceeded fossils.|$|E
