In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that defendants must {{have the opportunity to}} confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>drug</b> user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project was The Story of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E
