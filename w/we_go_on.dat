500|$|Britain's {{involvement}} in this {{became one of the}} most controversial parts of its Empire's history, and damaged its reputation in the Middle East for generations. According to historian Elizabeth Monroe: [...] "measured by British interests alone, [...] one of the greatest mistakes in [...] imperial history." [...] The 2010 study by Jonathan Schneer, specialist in modern British history at Georgia Tech, concluded that because the build-up to the declaration was characterized by [...] "contradictions, deceptions, misinterpretations, and wishful thinking", the declaration sowed dragon's teeth and [...] "produced a murderous harvest, and <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> harvesting even today". The foundational stone for modern Israel had been laid, but the prediction that this would lay the groundwork for harmonious Arab-Jewish cooperation proved to be wishful thinking.|$|E

Gerrard was unrepentant for tackling Vieira and stated {{he was trying to}} [...] "stamp [...] authority" [...] on the match. [...] He accepted defeat and was optimistic Liverpool had the means to win the Premier League: [...] "We'd rather they beat us in this game and then <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> to pick up the title. That's what we're really looking at. Even though they got the better of us yesterday, it doesn't mean they'll do better than us over the whole season." [...] Diouf insisted he should have earned a penalty in the second half, given he felt there was [...] "definite contact" [...] from a challenge in the penalty box: [...] "It was a penalty, definitely, but the referee is the master on the pitch and he didn't give it. I know the Arsenal players think I dived, but I didn't." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the runaway}} {{success of the}} single [...] "Please Please Me", the Beatles found {{themselves}} in huge demand {{for the whole of}} 1963. They appeared on ABC TV's Thank Your Lucky Stars show on 11 January (televised 19 January) and recorded for the BBCs Here <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>on</b> 16 January and the BBC's Saturday Club and Talent Spot on 22 January. As well as completing four nationwide tours in 1963, they performed at a great many one-off shows across the UK throughout the year, often finishing one show only to travel straight to the next show in another location—sometimes even to perform again the same day. Two of the nationwide tours were led by popular American stars, but at every show during both tours, the crowds would not stop screaming for the Beatles, who proved even more popular than the American stars. Souvenir programmes were hastily reprinted in response, to show the Beatles as the tour leaders. While pleased with the positive reception, the Beatles were also embarrassed for the American performers, as it had never before happened that a UK act had topped an American act at a UK concert.|$|E
500|$|Prince Albert Victor died in 1892, but society {{gossip about}} his sex life continued. Sixty {{years after the}} scandal the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Prince Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none of the lawyers involved in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off at the time, indeed most had very distinguished careers. However, Arthur Newton was struck off for 12 months for professional misconduct in 1910 after falsifying letters from another of his clients—the notorious murderer Harvey Crippen. In 1913, he was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences. Newton may have invented and spread the rumours about Prince Albert Victor in an attempt to protect his clients from prosecution by forcing a cover-up. State papers on the case in the Public Record Office, released to the public in the 1970s, provide no information on the prince's involvement other than Newton's threat to implicate him. Hamilton Cuffe wrote to the Director of Public Prosecutions, Sir Augustus Stephenson, [...] "I am told that Newton has boasted that if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a very distinguished person will be involved (PAV). I don't mean to say that I for one instant credit it—but in such circumstances as this one never knows what may be said, be concocted or be true." [...] Surviving private letters from Somerset to his friend Lord Esher, confirm that Somerset knew of the rumours but did not know if they were true. He writes, [...] "I can quite understand the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being coupled with the thing... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... I wonder if it is really a fact or only an invention." [...] In his correspondence, Sir Dighton Probyn refers to [...] "cruel and unjust rumours with regard to PAV" [...] and [...] "false reports dragging PAV's name into the sad story". When Prince Albert Victor's name appeared in the American press, the New York Herald published an anonymous letter, almost certainly written by Charles Hall, saying [...] "there is not, and never was, the slightest excuse for mentioning the name of Prince Albert Victor." [...] Biographers who believe the rumours suppose that Prince Albert Victor was bisexual, but this is strongly contested by others who refer to him as [...] "ardently heterosexual" [...] and his involvement in the rumours as [...] "somewhat unfair".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the debate}} in the Commons on 12 November 1936, Churchill {{attacked}} the government on rearmament as being [...] "decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.

[...] I'm very confident about the Ronald Reagan Strike Group's ability to go into harm's way and also to do the nation's business.|$|E
2500|$|Gavin Greenaway is the {{composer}} for IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. Greenaway's colleague Hans Zimmer, composer of The Lion King, asked Greenaway {{to take on}} the project because he was busy with other projects. [...] Zimmer collaborated with Greenaway {{in the beginning of the}} process. The score from [...] "Reflections of Earth" [...] was recorded with a 71-piece philharmonic orchestra and a 30-voice chorus and was used for ABC 2000 Today, ABC Television's 25-hour-long program that followed the beginning of 2000 around the globe on December 31, 1999/January 1, 2000. The broadcast also included video of IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth. ABC also used a modified version for their program ABC 2002 on December 31, 2001/January 1, 2002. Finally, ABC News used a version of the theme for their televised election coverage throughout 2000 and 2004. Most of the score (excluding the Chaos section and the start of <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>On)</b> was used in a laser light show at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree at Fort A.P. Hill. The Chaos section was used in the October 4, 2008 fireworks celebration of the 250th anniversary of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. [...] ABC also used the music during coverage of the Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama on January 20, 2009. [...] Parts of the score are also used in the video [...] "Welcome: Portraits of America", displayed in the Customs and Border Protection checkpoints in most US airports. Domino Day 2009 used the ending part of <b>We</b> <b>Go</b> <b>On</b> when the final builders challenge, Fire, was successful.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 November, Churchill {{returned}} to the topic. Speaking in the Address in Reply debate, after giving some specific instances of Germany's war preparedness, he said [...] "The Government simply cannot make up their mind or they cannot get the Prime Minister to make up his mind. So they go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful for impotency. And so <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> preparing more months more years precious perhaps vital for the greatness of Britain for the locusts to eat." [...] Robert Rhodes James called this one of Churchill's most brilliant speeches during this period, Baldwin's reply sounding weak and disturbing the House. The exchange gave new encouragement to the Arms and the Covenant Movement.|$|E

60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> till <b>we</b> came {{to another}} hotel. That {{was a very}} nice hotel, too, and it had honey-suckle on it, round at the side; but Harris did not like the look {{of a man who was}} leaning against the front door. He said he didn’t look a nice man at all, and he wore ugly boots: so <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> further. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> a goodish way without coming across any more hotels, and then we met a man, and asked him to direct us to a few.|$|R
2500|$|... "Before <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the {{offensive}} politically or militarily {{we take the}} greatest defensive precautions possible to ensure success, e.g. we do not advocate a United Ireland {{without being able to}} justify our right to such a state as opposed to partition; we do not employ revolutionary violence as our means without being able to illustrate that we have no recourse to any other means. Or in more everyday simple terms: we do not claim {{that we are going to}} escalate the war if we cannot do just that; we do not mount an operation without first having ensured that we have taken the necessary defensive precautions of accurate intelligence, security, that weapons are in proper working order with proper ammunition and that the volunteers involved know how to handle interrogations in the event of their capture etc, and of course that the operation itself enhances rather than alienates our supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creative}} {{side of the}} Foundation {{involves the}} usual application process, but in addition, the Foundation began with [...] "an advisory committee made up of three... people working in the industry" [...] whose input is sought {{on how best to}} proceed with each application. Submissions are evaluated prior to Laird's involvement, and then he makes the ultimate decisions based on their recommendations. Laird stated in 1993 that: [...] "...knock on wood, God willing, and the creek don't rise, if <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> for another couple of decades, and I'm able to put more money into the basic funding of the Xeric Foundation, then {{the amount of money that}} can be given out can really be raised significantly." [...] He hoped that ultimately the figure can be raised from [...] "thousands of dollars" [...] to [...] "hundreds of thousands of dollars," [...] to support an increasing number of large and small projects.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, at 10:00am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles {{began working}} their way through their live set song by song, the number of takes varying on each, and {{finished}} at 10:45pm—less than 13 hours later— capturing in essence an authentic representation of the band's Cavern Club-era sound. The day ended with a cover of [...] "Twist and Shout", {{which had to be}} recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: [...] "I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day but the longer <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the better they get." [...] Mark Lewisohn would later write: [...] "There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music" [...] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on [...] "A Taste of Honey" [...] and Lennon added harmonica onto [...] "There's a Place" [...] during these sessions. Martin overdubbed piano on [...] "Misery" [...] and celesta on [...] "Baby It's You" [...] on 20 February, during which the Beatles were not present.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2009 European {{elections}} the British National Party won {{two seats}} in the European Parliament. Andrew Brons was elected in the Yorkshire and the Humber regional constituency with 9.8% of the vote. Party chairman Nick Griffin was elected in the North West region, with 8% of the vote. Nationally, the BNP received 6.26%. Griffin stated that it was [...] "a great victory... <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> from here." [...] Meanwhile, the Labour and Conservative parties both {{referred to it as}} a [...] "sad moment". The Archbishops of Canterbury and York said it would be tragic if people abstained or voted BNP at the local and European elections. In local elections held the same day, the BNP also won its first three county council seats in Lancashire, Leicestershire and Hertfordshire. The breakthrough of the British National Party in the 2009 European elections was widely reported throughout Britain by the media. Matthew Goodwin in his article [...] "The BNP's breakthrough", notes that the British National Party was able to capitalise on widespread public anxiety over immigration. Also in light of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, there was media speculation that the BNP could do well in the polls, as voters sought an alternative party to register their protest. Nick Griffin claimed that the success of the British National Party was down to its modernisation, having kept things [...] "simple" [...] and ditched the fringe in the movement who were concerned with [...] "...genetics, Zionism and historical revisionism". He also claimed the party's success was down to the fact the mainstream parties in Britain never discussed immigration, while the British National Party openly did and were not scared to do so: ...|$|E
