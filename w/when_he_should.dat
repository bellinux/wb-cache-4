5|$|Obsidian is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tony Warriner, one of four founders of the adventure game developer Revolution Software. Warriner was introduced to home computers {{at the age of}} 13, as a result of which he developed an interest in game development. This interest resulted in him creating Obsidian <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been studying for his school exams, resulting in him failing every exam. The game was published, however, resulting in the young developer's entry into the video game industry. Revolution Software was formed 4 years later.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} seventeen, Cú Chulainn single-handedly defends Ulster {{from the}} army of Connacht in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Medb, queen of Connacht, has mounted the {{invasion}} to steal the stud bull Donn Cúailnge, Cú Chulainn allows her to take Ulster by surprise because he was with a woman <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been watching the border. The men of Ulster were disabled by a curse that caused them to suffer from labor pains. So it becomes Cu Chulainn's job to stop Medb's army from advancing further. He does this by invoking the right of single combat at fords. He defeats champion after champion in a stand-off that lasts for months.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the cast}} and writers of TGS are {{preparing}} their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have been.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{less than}} six months before his first {{positive}} drug test, Christie won a libel action against the journalist John McVicar. McVicar had insinuated in a satirical magazine that Christie's remarkable rise from 156th in the world to triumph at an age <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been in decline could only have been achieved through performance-enhancing drugs.|$|E
25|$|Evan-Thomas {{was never}} {{consulted}} over the account, but had obtained a copy. He arranged {{to speak to}} First Lord of the Admiralty Leo Amery in July 1923, but the meeting and ensuing correspondence with the Admiralty failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The issue now also included when a flag signal from Lion had been hoisted and then lowered (which was {{the point at which}} the ship receiving the order was supposed to act upon it), the failure of which signal caused Evan-Thomas to continue steaming towards the enemy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have turned away with Beatty's other ships. Evan-Thomas arranged another interview in December 1923, but on this occasion Beatty interrupted the meeting before Evan-Thomas could explain his business, and 'pushed' him out of the room. Evan-Thomas returned to Chatham, but by 2.30 pm that day he was taken ill and was diagnosed to have suffered a stroke. In March 1924 he was obliged to retire, and was not sufficiently well to attend a formal interview with the King, as would be expected for a retiring admiral. He was awarded the grand cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) for his services to the Royal Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season – {{one with}} hardly {{a day of}} rain in the Home Counties after early May – bore out almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen {{for a long time}} in county cricket and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox’s bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times – notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval – his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on even the best of pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey’s last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox “often played <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been resting.” Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games: some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden.|$|E
60|$|The populace passed on, then {{seemed to}} halt, {{and at last}} the shouts died down on the noontide air. I {{went back to my}} writing, and to wait until from my jailer, <b>when</b> next <b>he</b> <b>should</b> chance to appear, I might learn the meaning of that uproar.|$|R

500|$|Hordern and Jonathan Miller reprised their {{collaboration}} in 1982 {{with a final}} performance of King Lear, again televised by the BBC. The actor considered this version to be his best and attributed its success to the fact he was getting older and therefore able {{to better understand the}} character. The author Joseph Pearce, writing in 2008, claimed that Hordern played the king [...] "straight up with no gloss" [...] and made a [...] "reliable and workmanlike Lear" [...] who is [...] "forceful <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be forceful, compassionate <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be compassionate, [...] sorrowful <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be sorrowful". Despite the praise, Pearce thought that Hordern's performance in Act 3 [...] "lack the required fierceness and miss the mythic quality when compared to some of the bigger names".|$|E
500|$|Crumley joined Bristol City, newly {{promoted}} to the Second Division for 1923–24, as a backup to Frank Vallis. By 13 October, with Bristol City already bottom {{of the table and}} both Vallis and Robert Goddard already tried in goal, Crumley made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Southampton. According to the Western Daily Press, he had nothing to do, so [...] "we [...] yet to learn... how good he is when asked to meet League requirements". He kept his place for the next match, a 1–0 defeat to Fulham, in which he exhibited a tendency to rush off his line <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not, but that was his last appearance in the League side.|$|E
500|$|The two brigades had a {{combined}} field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they {{charged with the}} 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve. There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, {{the morning of the}} battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to [...] "support movements to their front". It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur, Hussey Vivian and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies. Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying [...] "I committed a great mistake", <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support.|$|E

500|$|Edward Lycett Green, {{described}} by Havers, Grayson and Shankland as [...] "the emotional {{force behind the}} accusations", was next in the witness box. Although Lycett Green had not played on the first night, Clarke considered him a potentially dangerous witness who was capable of giving vital evidence. Lycett Green stated {{that he had seen}} Gordon-Cumming twice push counters over the chalk line <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not have done so; he had considered accusing Gordon-Cumming at the time, but decided against it because he [...] "did not like to make a scene before ladies". At points in the examination by Asquith, Lycett Green contradicted the course of events outlined by Stanley Wilson—which Levett had also done—and on one point regarding a question the prince put to Levett; his answer was [...] "highly suspect". Havers, Grayson and Shankland later wrote that [...] "it is remarkable that he, the prime mover in the affair, seemed unable to say anything without qualifying it with some such remark as, 'I don't exactly remember'... The hedging by the principal accuser certainly weakens the defendants' case". They also thought that [...] "is refusal to remember anything was obviously humbug, a deliberate policy".|$|E
500|$|The {{relatively}} short expedition—Bruce {{was back in}} Scotland in May 1893—failed in its main purpose, and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work. No right whales were found, and to cut the expedition's losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered, to secure skins, oil and blubber. Bruce found this distasteful, especially as {{he was expected to}} share in the killing. The scientific output from the voyage was, in Bruce's words [...] "a miserable show". In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote: [...] "The general bearing of the master (Captain Fairweather) was far from being favourable to scientific work". Bruce was denied access to charts, so was unable to establish the accurate location of phenomena. He was required to work [...] "in the boats" [...] <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been making meteorological and other observations, and no facilities were allowed him for the preparation of specimens, many of which were lost through careless handling by the crew. Nevertheless, his letter to the RGS ends: [...] "I have to thank the Society for assisting me in what has been, despite all drawbacks, an instructive and delightful experience." [...] In a further letter to Mill he outlined his wishes to go South again, adding: [...] "the taste I have had has made me ravenous".|$|E
500|$|Stratton tried {{variations}} of the experiment {{over the next few}} years. First he wore the glasses for eight days, back at Berkeley. The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal sensory perception, vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E

500|$|An {{anonymous}} critic in the Monthly Magazine disparaged the [...] "writhings and twinings" [...] of the painting's subjects, describing them as [...] "as {{close to}} the unpardonable limits as anything that has lately appealed to the public eye". This same writer disapproved of the dark skin tones {{of some of the}} figures, arguing that [...] "the brown visage of the [...] gives but a dingy image of the roses and lilies that, from time immemorial, have made the charm of British beauty". The correspondent for The London Magazine felt that although the painting was [...] "in many respects worthy of admiration... is a spirit, a boldness, and a startling effect", the work was poorly executed overall. Its depiction of women drew particular ire: [...] "the expression of the faces is vapid; the features rather homely; the limbs, though not ill-drawn, have not that finish and play of the muscles, which alone give lightness and elasticity. They seem lifted up with difficulty, and ready to fall." [...] The review upbraided Etty as an artist who had [...] "advanced half way on his road to classic excellence; and there, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have proceeded with increased ardour and more careful exactness from being in view of his object, he has stopped short." [...] Etty's fellow artist John Constable privately described the work as [...] "a revel rout of Satyrs and lady bums as usual".|$|E
500|$|The 1987 Giro {{has become}} {{famous for the}} series of events {{involving}} teammates Roche and Visentini. Many writers highlight the fifteenth stage as the defining moment of the race. The Corriere delle Alpi and cycling book author Bill McGann even named {{it as one of}} the most famous in the Giro d'Italia and cycling history. On that day, Roche [...] who was second in the general classification and over two minutes behind race leader Visentini [...] attacked the lead, despite orders from his team to stop. Upon completing the stage, Visentini told the press that either Roche or himself would not start the following day, while Roche independently held a press conference from his hotel and answered questions. Carrera Jeans-Vagabond manager David Boifava ordered Roche and Visentini to stay silent. The following day, many Italian newspapers called Roche a betrayer or cheat for his actions. Despite Visentini's statement, both riders started the sixteenth stage after receiving orders from Carrera company boss Tito Tachella. In the days that followed, Italian fans threw things and spat at Roche, which led him to receive police protection until the race's conclusion. Looking back on the incident, Roche claimed that he just descended the mountain quicker than Visentini and did nothing wrong, while Visentini maintained that Roche attacked him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been aiding him. Visentini accused Roche of dashing the team's morale and strategy, but some critics believed that Roche's actions were acceptable because he was the stronger rider.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} company {{set up by}} Olivier took a lease on the St James's Theatre. In January 1950 he produced, directed and starred in Christopher Fry's verse play Venus Observed. The production was popular, despite poor reviews, but the expensive production did little to help the finances of Laurence Olivier Productions. After a series of box-office failures, the company balanced its books in 1951 with productions of Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra which the Oliviers played in London and then took to Broadway. Olivier was thought by some critics to be under par in both his roles, and some suspected him of playing deliberately below his usual strength so that Leigh might appear his equal. Olivier dismissed the suggestion, regarding it as an insult to his integrity as an actor. In {{the view of the}} critic and biographer W.A. Darlington, he was simply miscast both as Caesar and Antony, finding the former boring and the latter weak. Darlington comments, [...] "Olivier, in his middle forties <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have been displaying his powers at their very peak, seemed to have lost interest in his own acting". Over the next four years Olivier spent much of his time working as a producer, presenting plays rather than directing or acting in them. His presentations at the St James's included seasons by Ruggero Ruggeri's company giving two Pirandello plays in Italian, followed by a visit from the Comédie-Française playing works by Molière, Racine, Marivaux and Musset in French. Darlington considers a 1951 production of Othello starring Orson Welles as the pick of Olivier's productions at the theatre.|$|E

50|$|All friars were {{required}} to be trained and licensed by the church before {{they were allowed to}} preach. The friars studied treatises on sermon making.
