25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|A common {{identifier}} {{naming convention}} {{is for the}} loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), <b>where</b> <b>i</b> <b>would</b> be the most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of FORTRAN, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to mathematical notation where indices for sums and multiplications are often i, j, etc. A variant convention {{is the use of}} reduplicated letters for the index, ii, jj, and kk, as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.|$|E

In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah."

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] {{was directed by}} Bryan Barber and choreographed by Jeri Slaugher. After seeing a trailer of Barber's film project, Idlewild, Aguilera {{wanted to make a}} video directed by him, explained: [...] "It intrigued me that this man, Bryan Barber, had been very locked into and had surrounded himself with this whole world of the '20s and '30s era, and it made me think that he could understand what I'm trying to do conceptually. I needed to get the right director who shared my vision". At first Aguilera planned to make a black-and-white video and shot it in her living room for Barber and Slaugher. [...] "I had acted out the entire video in my living room. I used my fireplace as a makeshift stage and the staircase as the pool table <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> stand", said Aguilera. According to Barber, Aguilera was very involved in the making of the videot. The whole team seemed like they were doing a movie more than a music video. On June 21, 2006, the music video for [...] "Ain't No Other Man" [...] was premiered on MTV's Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black.

As a former Governor, I say let the states decide that, and that's <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be, if I were in national office. I'd be saying let the states decide. And if you see, Greta, and pay attention to where the states have gone with this particular issue and the votes of the people, overwhelmingly the people within the states have said they want to continue to define marriage as one man and one woman, as the Muslims do, Orthodox Jews do, nondenominational Christians do, faith-practicing Catholics do. It truly is a cornerstone of religion and civilization." ...|$|E
