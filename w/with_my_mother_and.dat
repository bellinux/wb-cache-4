500|$|Even some staunch traditionalists {{from both}} the urban and rural folk music {{communities}} had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir And A Voice To Sing With, singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that [...] "Traveling across the country <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I {{became one of the}} leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..." [...] Arthel [...] "Doc" [...] Watson of North Carolina, {{one of the most respected}} and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, [...] "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!" ...|$|E

[...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they have no idea of where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{her father}} was a [...] "Roman Catholic in the Irish tradition" [...] it has been {{incorrectly}} assumed that Whittlesey grew up as a Catholic, when in fact her mother's family did not approve of her father's Catholicism. [...] "o he left the Catholic Church," [...] Whittlesey explained in her Memoirs. [...] "He attended the Methodist Church <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> brother, Tom, and me. I was thus raised as a Methodist. As a family we went to the Williamsville, New York, Methodist Church every Sunday. I went to regular Sunday school and sang in the choirs." [...] Her husband's family was Presbyterian. Whittlesey converted to Roman Catholicism in 2000 in Staten Island, New York, having been greatly influenced {{as a result of her}} Reagan administration association with John Cardinal O'Connor of New York. She was baptized and confirmed by Father Michael Reilly, principal of St. Joseph's By-the-Sea High School in Staten Island, New York.|$|E

2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E

60|$|What troubled me {{most of all}} was {{the fear}} that Grafton had reaped the {{advantage}} of the opportunity the illness gave him, and by his insidious arts had worked himself back into the good graces of his father. You must not draw from this, my dears, that I feared for the inheritance. Praised be God, I never thought of that! But I came by nature to hate and to fear my uncle, as I hated and feared the devil. I saw him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> father's eyes, <b>and</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>my</b> grandfather had seen him in the old days when he was strong. Instinct and reason alike made me loathe him. As the months passed, and letters in Grafton's scroll hand came from the Kent estate or from Annapolis, my misgivings were confirmed by odd remarks that dropped from Mr. Carvel's lips. At length arrived the revelation itself.|$|R

60|$|Although I {{myself was}} gratefully {{sensible}} of {{the kindness of}} Pesca's motives, my spirits were hardly so much elevated as {{they ought to have}} been by the prospect of future employment now placed before me.

60|$|So I swam on a {{long way}} and began to forget things; indeed I thought that I was playing in the big turnip field <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sister.

60|$|Of course I said I {{would go}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> {{of course they}} all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with us.
