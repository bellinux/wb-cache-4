500|$|Homer captures Molloy at the {{retirement}} home, and the surprisingly amiable cat burglar returns the objects he stole. Chief Wiggum arrests {{him and he}} is imprisoned. While in his cell at the police station, Molloy casually mentions that he assumes Homer and the cops probably <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he hid all of his loot. This piques their interest, and Molloy tells them the stash is hidden under a giant [...] "T" [...] somewhere in Springfield. They all rush {{out of the station}} hoping to get the treasure for themselves. In a matter of minutes the entire town hears of the existence of Molloy's stash and almost everybody in Springfield is racing to get there first. After the residents get to the site and dig, they finally discover a box with a note inside. The note tells them that there is no treasure and that while they have been searching, Molloy has escaped from his cell. However, several citizens continue to dig, convinced that a real treasure must be buried deeper.|$|E
500|$|A new league, the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA), {{was formed}} in late November 1909. One of the teams, the All-Montreal Hockey Club, hired Ross as a playing-manager, but the league only lasted to mid-January 1910 before disbanding. Ross, who scored four goals in four games in the CHA, then signed with the Haileybury Comets of the National Hockey Association (NHA), a league formed in December 1909, which {{proved to be the}} {{stronger}} replacement to the ECAHA as the highest level of hockey in Canada. He received $2,700 to play in the 1910 season, which lasted from January to March, playing twelve games for the team and finishing with six goals. Before the following season, the NHA imposed a salary cap of $5,000 per team. The players, including Ross, were unhappy as this would result in a pay decrease, and began looking to form their own league without a cap. Ross wrote to the Montreal Herald, stating [...] "all the players want is a fair deal ... The players are not trying to bulldoze the NHA, but we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we get off at." [...] The plans were abandoned when they realized all the suitable arenas would be unavailable as they were owned or leased by the NHA. Ross scored four goals in eleven games with the Wanderers, who finished fourth in the five team league. During a match against the Quebec Bulldogs on February 25, 1911, Ross knocked out Eddie Oatman in a fight, provoking a massive brawl between the two teams, which the police had to break up. The fight helped to increase the reputation Ross had as a tough player unwilling to back down from any opponent. The following season Ross had eleven goals in nineteen games as the Wanderers improved to second in the league.|$|E
2500|$|After Game 4, Roenick {{told the}} media, [...] "It {{should have been}} a penalty shot, there's no doubt about it. I like Patrick's quote that he would've stopped me. I'd just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he was in Game 3, {{probably}} getting his jock out of the rafters in the United Center maybe." [...] Roy retorted with his now-famous line, ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{tensions}} increased, Graffin {{would sing}} alternate lyrics during concerts such as [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Brett gets his crack" [...] or [...] "I {{want to know}} why Gurewitz cracked," [...] on the song [...] "Stranger Than Fiction". [...] These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's Suffer Tour documentary, Along the Way, and is now clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band the Daredevils entitled [...] "Hate You", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley.|$|E
2500|$|The Cantometrics {{team also}} created a set of {{teaching}} tapes that {{make it easy to}} develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A United Press {{correspondent}} described Robinson's {{speech as}} [...] "the most unrestrained language that ever has been {{heard in the}} Senate." [...] La Follette sat motionless in his chair, even when Robinson began shaking his fist at him. Near the conclusion of his speech, Robinson violated the custom of the Senate and addressed his colleague directly, pointing at La Follette and shouting, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you stand." [...] La Follette {{was not allowed to}} take the floor to refute the other Senators before adjournment, though Senator Fall allowed him a brief statement, whereupon he announced he was prepared to substantiate everything he said in St. Paul and desired the chance to rebut the charges being made against him by his fellow senators. Throughout the remainder of his term in the Senate, his opponents used procedural maneuvers to ensure he never was allowed to address charges of disloyalty again.|$|E

2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, but they said that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> he is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do not want to know who took him. We just want to know, even anonymously, where he is," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Tobin {{wrote in}} The Jewish World Review that [...] "Rosenfeld {{is careful to}} specify that {{questioning}} policies of Israeli governments {{is not the same}} as being anti-Israel, let alone anti-Semitic. But he has the bad manners to point out that those who aggressively question Israel's right to have any government or to defend itself against those who seek to destroy it are, at best, unwitting allies of a growing anti-Jewish movement.... For this, Rosenfeld and his sponsors at AJC have been treated to the sort of public tar and feathering that is usually reserved only for the troglodyte denizens of the far-right." [...] Tobin concludes [...] "in recent years, it is the supporters of Israel who are becoming pariahs in intellectual circles, not its critics. For all the talk of 'martyrdom' on the part of people like Tony Judt, the fact is, they have not suffered one bit for pot shots at Israel or their sneers at those who stand up for Zion. If we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> we are headed, we need only look to Britain, where in intellectual and artistic circles it has gotten to the point where it may no longer be possible to identify as a Jew without also disavowing any support for Israel." ...|$|E
