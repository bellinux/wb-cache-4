Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at girls {{will be easier to}} sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived. After Hasbro issued a cease and desist to the Fighting Is Magic project over the use of copyrighted and trademarked characters, Faust offered to provide the developers with original character arts to allow them to continue to develop the game without copyright issues.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers.

I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant is the epitome of the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants. It's about being out of place, it's about not knowing where you're going to end up..." ...|$|E

Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera. He thought that the episode was average for the third season, and wasn't as good as [...] "". However, he felt that the scenes were reminiscent of comic books, saying that [...] "There's nothing really <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> Nothing great about it either."

[...] The producers chose to air it {{the first week of}} the new season in order to explain Mr. Hooper's absence as soon as possible, for maximum exposure, and to ensure that parents were at home with their children in order to discuss it. [...] The illustrations used for the episode were drawn by Caroll Spinney, who performed Big Bird. [...] Mr. Hooper's picture remained on the set from then on, as a continuing memorial to Lee and Mr. Hooper. [...] Spinney, speaking of the scene in which the pictures were passed out, reported, [...] "When we finished that scene there wasn't one of us whose face wasn't streaked with tears", even Spinney underneath his costume. [...] Jon Stone, who directed the episode, wanted to do another take, although Spinney later said, [...] "There was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> take. [...] It was perfect".

500|$|The {{income from}} the concerts did not permit generous {{rehearsal}} time. Wood had nine hours to rehearse all the music for each week's six concerts. To gain the best results on so little rehearsal, Wood developed two facets of his conducting that remained his trademark throughout his career. First, he bought sets of the orchestral parts and marked them all with minutely detailed instructions to the players; secondly he developed a clear and expressive conducting technique. An orchestral cellist wrote that [...] "if you watched him, you couldn't come in wrong." [...] The violist Bernard Shore wrote, [...] "You may be reading at sight in public, but you can't possibly go <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> stick in front of you". Thirty-five years after Wood's death, André Previn recounted a story {{by one of his}} players who recalled that Wood [...] "had everything planned out and timed to the minute ... at 10a.m. precisely his baton went down. You learned things so thoroughly with him, but in the most economical time." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and I knew there were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised there was nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

500|$|The review {{aggregator}} website Comic Book Roundup {{reported a}} 7.3 out of 10 average rating for the event, based on 270 critic reviews. Just before {{the release of}} the final part, Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated, [...] ""Trinity War" [...] itself seems almost wholly disinterested in the Trinity of Sin, the Seven Deadly Sins, {{or any of the other}} elements the crossover was initially predicated upon." [...] After Justice League #23 was released, Schedeen added,"Event comics often fail because they're more concerned with setting up a new status quo and changing the playing field than simply allowing readers to savor the high stakes and epic nature of the conflict at hand. [...] "Trinity War" [...] may well emerge as the new poster child for everything <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> approach. In the end, [...] "Trinity War" [...] becomes little more than a stepping stone towards Forever Evil. The result is that Justice League #23 is an almost wholly unfulfilling [...] "finale" [...] issue." [...] Overall, Newsarama's Richard Gray praised the storytelling, with the event [...] "cleverly weaving in threads set up two years ago in all related titles." [...] However, Gray was somewhat critical of the fact that [...] "the last panel of “Trinity War” leads directly into “Forever Evil”, effectively making this one big event that begets another. It’s a crime that both major syndicates are repeatedly guilty of these last few years, one so commonplace that it is increasingly difficult to take umbrage with a singular instance anymore." [...] Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza felt [...] "there are no true conclusions of any sort" [...] after the whole event, [...] "just more shock-for-shock's sake moments and lots of new questions" [...] added at the end of Justice League #23. As with Gray, Zawisza [...] "was hopeful DC's tactic of bleeding events one to the next would be over following the relaunch, but this issue proves – without an inkling of doubt – that that is simply not the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scientists {{who have}} {{reviewed}} What the Bleep Do We Know!? have described distinct assertions {{made in the}} film as pseudoscience.

Amongst the assertions in the film that have been challenged are that water molecules can be influenced by thought (as popularized by Masaru Emoto), that meditation can reduce violent crime rates, and that quantum physics implies that [...] "consciousness is the ground of all being." [...] The film was also discussed in a letter published in Physics Today that challenges how physics is taught, saying teaching fails to [...] "expose the mysteries physics has encountered [...] reveal the limits of our understanding". In the letter, the authors write: [...] "the movie illustrates the uncertainty principle with a bouncing basketball being in several places at once. There's nothing <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>that.</b> It's recognized as pedagogical exaggeration. But the movie gradually moves to quantum 'insights' that lead a woman to toss away her antidepressant medication, to the quantum channeling of Ramtha, the 35,000-year-old Lemurian warrior, and on to even greater nonsense." [...] It {{went on to say}} that [...] "Most laypeople cannot tell where the quantum physics ends and the quantum nonsense begins, and many are susceptible to being misguided," [...] and that [...] "a physics student may be unable to convincingly confront unjustified extrapolations of quantum mechanics," [...] a shortcoming which the authors attribute to the current teaching of quantum mechanics, in which [...] "we tacitly deny the mysteries physics has encountered".|$|E
