5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} war she encouraged AWAS members to undertake further training to find jobs in the civilian labour force, but only a small proportion of servicewomen did so.

25|$|Interactionism {{had become}} popular in America in the 1950s and 1960s as a {{politically}} radical alternative to structural-functionalism. Instead of viewing {{society as a}} system regulating and controlling the actions of individuals, interactionists argued that sociology should address what people <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> particular situations, and how they understood their own actions. The sociology of deviance, which included topics such as crime, homosexuality, and mental illness, became the focus for these theoretical debates. Functionalists had portrayed crime as a problem to be managed by the legal system. Labeling theorists, by contrast, focused {{on the process of}} law-making and enforcement: how crime was constructed as a problem. A number of British sociologists, and some researchers in law schools, have drawn on these ideas in writing about law and crime.|$|E
25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>In</b> answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as fallacious.|$|E

Robinson did however work with singer Jonathan Davis as a vocal coach for the album. Korn was shown making the video on KornTV. The reason they exposed themselves making the album was because they wanted to let their fans see what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> the studio and behind the scenes. Follow the Leader features numerous guest vocalists, including Ice Cube on [...] "Children of the Korn", Tre Hardson of The Pharcyde on [...] "Cameltosis" [...] and Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst on [...] "All in the Family".|$|E
500|$|Childe was {{a proponent}} of the culture-historical {{approach}} to archaeology, coming {{to be seen as}} one of its [...] "founders and chief exponents". Culture-historical archaeology revolved around the concept of [...] "culture", which it had adopted from anthropology. This has been seen as [...] "a major turning point {{in the history of the}} discipline", allowing archaeologists to look at the past through a spatial dynamic rather than simply a temporal one. Childe adopted the concept of [...] "culture" [...] from German philologist and archaeologist Gustav Kossinna, before using it in three of his books [...] The Dawn of European Civilisation (1925), The Aryans (1926) and The Most Ancient East (1928) [...] without defining it. He proceeded to give it a specifically archaeological definition in The Danube in Prehistory (1929). There, he defined a [...] "culture" [...] as being a set of [...] "regularly associated traits" [...] in the material culture [...] i.e. [...] "pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites, house forms" [...] that are repeatedly found across a certain area. He stated that in this respect a [...] "culture" [...] was the archaeological equivalent of a [...] "people". Childe's use of the term was non-racial, and he considered a [...] "people" [...] to be a social grouping, not a biological race. He opposed the equation of archaeological cultures with biological races, as various nationalists <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> Europe at the time, and was a vociferous critic of Nazi uses of archaeology, arguing that the Jewish people were not a distinct biological race but a socio-cultural grouping.|$|E

2500|$|Jazz {{historian}} and journalist Ira Gitler has considered 1958 Miles {{to be one}} of Davis' best works, while also noting that he was [...] "very taken with the performances", alluding to the album's recordings after Gitler had listened to them. In the 1979 LP reissue liner notes, Gitler wrote [...] "These prime cuts of the Miles Davis Sextet, representative of what this most influential leader and his trendsetting band of that time, <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> that particular portion of 1958, are a most welcome addition to the collectors library." [...] The live portion of the album recorded at The Plaza Hotel was noted by critics as an early stage of the new sextet. Music writer Nicholas Taylor later wrote of the Plaza set: ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{division}} of labor that became commonplace as Taylorism was implemented in manufacturing, workers lost their sense of connection to the production of goods. Workers began to feel disenfranchised with the monotonous and unfulfilling work they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> factories. Before scientific management, workers felt a sense of pride when completing their good, which went away when workers only completed one part of production. [...] "The further 'progress' of industrial development... increased the anomic or forced division of labor," [...] the opposite of what Taylor thought would be the effect. Partial adoption of Taylor's principles by management seeking to boost efficiency, while ignoring principles such as fair pay and direct engagement by managers, led to further tensions and the rise of unions to represent workers needs.|$|E
2500|$|As Anger {{discovered}} his homosexuality, {{at a time}} when homosexual acts were still illegal in the United States, he began associating with the underground gay scene. At some point in the mid-1940s, he was arrested by the police in a [...] "homosexual entrapment", after which he decided to move out of his parents' home, gaining his own sparse apartment largely financed by his grandmother, and abandoning the name Anglemyer in favor of Anger. He started attending the University of Southern California, where he studied cinema, and also began experimenting with the use of mind-altering drugs like cannabis and peyote. It was then that he decided to produce a film that would deal with his sexuality, just as other gay avant-garde film makers like Willard Maas <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> that decade. The result was the short film Fireworks, which was created in 1947 but only exhibited publicly in 1948.|$|E

"Good Girls Don't" [...] {{begins with}} Fieger playing the harmonica, {{in a part}} which authors Michael Uslan and Bruce Solomon liken to The Beatles' song [...] "I Should Have Known Better."

However, Joyce Canaan of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies wrote that this line succinctly captures the transformation of teenage girls' representations of their sexual practices; while {{they want to be}} seen as [...] "good girls", even good girls may engage in practices not corresponding to established moral standards. Fieger has stated that [...] "All we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> songs like the naughty 'Good Girls Don't' was reflecting the way 14-year-old boys feel.

2500|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album three stars and states: [...] "The music on this CD reissue {{is better than}} it should be.

There is some strong material on the set (including [...] "West Coast Blues," [...] "Stockholm Sweetnin'" [...] and a remake of [...] "This Here") but the results are not too substantial and this was not that big a seller; it is still a reasonably enjoyable effort". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album three stars stating [...] "'A departure from and an extension of what the Adderleys <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> their small groups. Ernie Wilkins arranges a set of full-bodied top-heavy charts which Adderley has to jostle with to create their own space, and the music's worth hearing for its Sheer Brashness and impact".|$|E
2500|$|Possessed, a {{band that}} formed in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1983, is {{described}} by Allmusic as [...] "connecting the dots" [...] between thrash metal and death metal with their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches. While attributed as having a Slayer influence, current and {{former members of the}} band had actually cited Venom and Motörhead, as well as early work by Exodus, as the main influences on their sound. Although the group had released only two studio albums and an EP in their formative years, they have been described by music journalists and musicians as either being [...] "monumental" [...] in developing the death metal style, or as being the first death metal band. Earache Records noted that [...] "the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> their formative years on the Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary Seven Churches recording. Possessed arguably did more to further the cause of 'Death Metal' than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80's." ...|$|E
