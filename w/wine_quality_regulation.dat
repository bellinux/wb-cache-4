But consumer trust in the private, government-backed mark varies significantly in France and Italy, and France manages to obtain significantly higher prices for regulated AOC wine than their Italian DOC counterparts. This article investigates the origins of divergent trust patterns as well as the relationship between trust and production strategies. My research indicates trust patterns are shaped by the structure and operation of the regulatory regime. Drawing upon extensive personal interviews, I find price differentials and trust in the regulatory mark may be explained by three factors: administrative historical legacy and government trust, trust among supply chain actors, and market structure. Higher institutionalized trust—or trust in the regulatory regime—is associated with higher quality production, higher prices, less price-based competition, and less market concentration...|$|R

The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, <b>regulation</b> of the <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> and <b>regulation</b> of the market.

The import licence and export licence, export aid and guarantee belong among these mechanisms of regulation.

40|$|Purpose ? The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between wine drinkers 2 ̆ 7 product involvement and their engagement with <b>wine</b> <b>quality.</b> It examined particularly how they conceptualise quality, how they evaluate it, and the dimensions of quality they focus on. Design/methodology/approach ? The study used focus groups (including wine tasting as a stimulus) and individual interviews to elicit data. Wine drinkers across Australia were informants for the study. Findings ? There appears to be a relationship between involvement level and how <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> is perceived. Higher-involvement drinkers seemed more inclined to conceptualise <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> as objective whereas lower-involvement consumers tended to see it as subjective. Lower-involvement informants often focused more on sensory dimensions of <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> (like flavour or smoothness), while high-involvement drinkers used more cognitive dimensions such as interest or complexity. Further, there appears to be evidence for a group of medium-involvement consumers, with some distinct characteristics. Research limitations/implications ? The research suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 7 understanding of <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> is substantially dependent on their involvement level. This finding is tentative as the study used only qualitative methods in a single Anglophone country. Nevertheless, there are suggestions that the approach which consumers use to evaluate quality varies depending on involvement level and that consumption behaviour is substantially different.

The relationships between climatic {{variables and the}} yield, and novel technological berry quality (QItechnologicalberry), phenolic berry quality (QIphenolicberry), overall berry <b>quality</b> (QIoverallberry), and <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> (QIwine) indices confirmed {{that the most important}} climatic factors were rainfall, temperature, and radiation. Climate was more influential in determining yield, berry, and wine composition in some important physiological periods such as early season (budburst–fruit set) and ripening (véraison–harvest). In general, climate had more influence on berry <b>quality</b> than on <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> indices and greater QIoverallberry was also reflected in greater QIwine. According to the stepwise multiple regression, the best fitted models for the partial root-zone drying irrigation (PRI) system were less complex (with a lower number of climatic variables) than for the regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) system, suggesting that PRI is less influenced by climatic factors than RDI. For PRI, the models for yield, berry and <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> were explained by three climatic factors (rainfall, Tª, and radiation), whereas for RDI, more climatic factors came into play (number of hours of sunshine, evapotranspiration, and vapor pressure deficit). According to these models, in RDI, a sunny and drier pre-véraison period followed by higher soil water availability and associated greater crop evapotranspiration during ripening favored final berry and <b>wine</b> <b>quality.</b> In contrast, in PRI, greater rainfall during the growing season and greater solar radiation during ripening were the main climatic factors that positively influenced the yield response, berry and <b>wine</b> <b>quality.</b> Besides, berry quality in PRI was more affected (negatively) by high temperatures (high Tªmax and Tªmin) during the growing season than in RDI and SDI, indicating that cooler and humid years may favor the PRI response more. These results suggest that years with a cool, wet winter followed by a mild, wet spring and early summer (April–June) and a mild fruit set–véraison period (June–July), and then greater solar radiation during ripening (August–mid-September) provide adequate growth potential and increase the likelihood of higher berry and <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> in PRI. Besides, more irrigated SDI vines were less sensitive to high temperatures and low soil water content during ripening than RDI and PRI vines.

Moreover, we examine if cooperatives with {{deep roots in}} their local economy specialize in specific regional denomination rules (i. e. DOC, IGT). Compared to private wineries, cooperatives face additional challenges {{in order to raise}} <b>wine</b> <b>quality,</b> among them appropriate incentives that induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes (e. g. vineyard management and grape pricing schemes to lower yields). The quality reputation of a winery with consumers depends crucially on its winemaking skills. Wine regions differ with respect to climatic conditions and quality denomination rules. Assuming similar climatic conditions within wine regions as well as winemaking skills between firms, incentive schemes to induce individual growers to supply high quality grapes and quality denomination rules remain crucial determinants of <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> and winery reputation when comparing different regions and firm organizational forms. The data set analyzed allows differentiating local cooperatives vs. private wineries and denotes retail prices, <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> evaluations, indicators for winery reputation, and distinct denomination rules. We employ a hedonic pricing model in order to test the following hypothesis: First, wines produced by cooperatives suffer a significant reputation and/or <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> discount relative to wines from private producers. Second, cooperatives and/or private wineries specialize in specific wine denominations for which they receive a price premium relative the competing organizational form. Our results are mixed. However, we reject the hypothesis that cooperatives suffer a reputation/wine quality discount relative to private producers for the Alto Adige wine region. Moreover, we find that regional cooperatives and private wineries specialize in specific wine denomination for which they receive a relative price premium (e. g. Alto Adige cooperatives specialize in DOC relative to private wineries in the region; private wineries in Trentino specialize in IGT denominated wines emphasizing their own brands). Our results indicate regional differences in terms of how cooperatives compete with private wineries with respect to <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> and reputation. If cooperatives are able to implement incentive schemes to induce individual growers to raise grape quality, they may also gain a <b>wine</b> <b>quality</b> and reputation premium in the market.
