50|$|In 1972, the left-handed Bellows’ {{ability to}} work was halted by pain caused by a {{ganglion}} cyst that was wound around the tendons of his left wrist. Bellows was referred to the Mayo Clinic, where the cyst was removed in a long and complicated surgery. Bellows soaked his wrist in a therapeutic hot <b>wax</b> <b>bath</b> daily {{for the rest of}} his life to treat the remaining wrist pain.|$|E
40|$|Colles’ {{fracture}} is {{a relatively}} uncommon presentation to a chiropractic office. A case of a 74 -year-old woman complaining of pain, loss of strength and diminished range of motion in her left wrist is presented. These complaints {{were the result of}} a slip and fall causing a Colles’ fracture that occurred four weeks prior to presentation. Dynamometer and goniometric testing revealed significant losses of strength and range of motion when compared to the unaffected wrist. Initial therapy consisted of ice, <b>wax</b> <b>bath</b> application and gentle range of motion mobilizations for two weeks followed by entry into a supervised active rehabilitation program for a further three weeks. After thirteen visits, the patient demonstrated objective improvement in both range of motion and grip strength as well as subjective improvement in pain intensity. A rehabilitation protocol is proposed for clinicians with patients suffering from Colles’ fractures. Appropriate management may begin passively and ultimately leads to a supervised active program for optimal results...|$|E

30|$|The {{birds in}} each group were killed and the livers were excised {{separately}} according to the group for histological study. The livers were preserved in universal bottles and fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution until they were needed for the histological analysis. The tissues were observed and {{cut into small pieces}} of about 4  mm. The tissues were processed with tissue processor (Leica TP 1020) and dehydrated by passing them through different reagents. The tissues were eventually placed in <b>wax</b> <b>baths.</b> Having sectioned the tissue appropriately, and the section floated on water bath, the slides through which the sections were picked were labelled, dried and stained accordingly with haematoxylin and eosin (Galighor and Koziff 1976; Avwioro 2010).|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is {{the most}} common chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease. Involvement of wrist and hand is a characteristic finding and occur at an early stage. Hand function is of great importance in performance of daily activities (ADL). Aims. We wanted to study the effects of hand exercise and <b>wax</b> <b>bath</b> treatment in patients with RA and to develop a clinical hand function test. We also wanted to study predictors of hand function and to study changes of hand function and ADL in patients followed for five year. Moreover, we investigated the precision grip lift sequence. Method. Eighty-three females and 32 males with RA from the Department of Rheumatology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Göteborg, Sweden, participated and 27 females and five males were used as healthy controls in the studies. Hand function tests, upper extremity mobility measures, grip strength, pain and stiffness as well as precision grip-lift performance and self reported ADL abilities were evaluated. Results. Hand exercise improved hand function and reduced pain and stiffness. Surface heat may act supportive to exercise. A clinical hand function test, Grip Ability Test (GAT), was developed. The GAT consists of three items, does not require sophisticated equipment and takes less than 5 min to perform. GAT is valid, has a good inter- and intra-observer reliability, is sensitive to change and correlated well to performance of ADL tasks. Observer assessed hand function tests were best predicted by joint motion in fingers whereas grip strength displayed strongest influence on self estimated hand function. The five-year follow-up study revealed that females declined in hand function, upper extremity function and ADLs. In contrast, males did not deteriorate. Patients with RA displayed a disturbed precision grip-lift performance, Conclusions. Active hand exercise and <b>wax</b> <b>bath</b> treatment may improve hand function and reduce pain and stiffness in patients with established RA. The Grip Ability Test is valid, reliable clinical hand function test, which is easy to perform. A sex difference was noted with regards to decline of hand function and ADL over time. The precision grip-lift performance in females with RA was disturbed indicating a need for further investigations concerning etiological mechanisms. Extended knowledge of the complex interplay of hand function in RA will result in more adequate and addressed measures...|$|E
40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety six cases of Volkmann's ischaemic eontracture {{in the upper}} limb were studied for their pattern of {{contracture}} and recovery (Sundararaj and Mani 1985). Mild, moderate and severe forms of contracture have been described (Tsuge 1975; Sundararaj and Mani 1985). The management of 102 of these cases has been studied and discussed here. The principles of management of established Volkmann's ischaemic ontracture have been: 1. Correction of deformities 2. Restoring to stiff and contracted joints, their range of movements and maintaining these joints in a functional position 3. Provide active motor tendons to restore movements at important joints 4. Stabilisation of joints when: (a) contracture correction is impossible by soft tissue release (b) active restoration of movements of joint is not possible 5. To relieve the involved, entrapped nerves of their circumferential constricting pressure and restore or replace them in a more vascular bed. These may be achieved by: i Conservative measures consisting of physiotherapy, passive stretching, splinting (with plaster of Paris and dynamic splints), serial cast application, wedging and <b>wax</b> <b>bath</b> treatment. ii Operative measures: Surgery on joints: Capsulotomy with collateral ligament xcision; Fusion. Surgery o f bones [...] Osteotomy for correction of deformity Surgery o f nerves [...] Neurolysis; Nerve pedicle graft Surgery o f muscles and tendons [...] Tendon lengthening; Muscle slide; Excision of fibrosed muscle; Tendon transfer...|$|E
40|$|A {{horizontal}} finger arthrograph {{has been}} developed to measure stiffness in the human metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger. Data from the arthrograph {{has been shown to}} have reasonable reproducibility. Stiffness is quantified in terms of dissipated energy, equilibrium position and absolute resistive torque measured from the equilibrium position. Three groups of experiments are reported. The first investigates the circadian variation of stiffness in normal subjects. The second investigates stiffness in normal subjects and patients with rheumatoid arthritis and the third looks at the effects of various techniques of physiotherapy in altering stiffness. The results show a circadian variation of stiffness with increased stiffness {{in the early hours of}} the morning. Male subjects exhibit higher dissipated energy than female subjects though no statistically significant differences could be found in other stiffness parameters. Within the range of values tested no statistically significant differences could be found between controls and patients in dissipated energy, resistive torque or equilibrium position. Correlation of these characteristics with other parameters, for example, grip strength and limb circumference has identified differences between controls and patients, and it is concluded that, in rheumatoid arthritis, stiffness mainly results from the involvement of immediate soft tissue periarticular structures. The effects of physiotherapeutic techniques, usually administered to alleviate stiffness, are shown to be variable. Short wave diathermy and ultrasound effected a reduction in dissipated energy in the patient group and it is concluded that a reduction in the viscous and frictional properties of periarticular structures produces this effect. A shift in the equilibrium position is also shown to occur in this group following the application of short wave diathermy. Paraffin <b>wax</b> <b>baths,</b> ice and exercises had no effect on stiffness in the patient group and no treatment technique produced significant effects in the control group...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{the project}} was to further the {{research}} into the objective measurement of the symptoms of arthritic disease. There were three major parts to this study. The first part was to design a measurement system capable of making large scale, objective measurements of the stiffness of the human metacarpophalangeal joint. The second part was to design a new device to measure the grip strength of the human hand objectively. The last part was to use these two measurement systems to conduct research into the clinical manifestations of arthritic disease and study the effects of some therapeutic agents. A new, microcomputer controlled arthrograph system was developed to measure the stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger. The system proved to be reliable, easy to use and sufficiently accurate to quantify changes in joint stiffness. A new design of grip machine was produced which enabled the forces developed during a power grip to be analysed. Measurement was made of the force contributions of individual digits and the maximum total gripping force. The machine was portable and extremely easy to use. A study of the circadian variation of joint stiffness and grip strength, over a full twenty four hour period, was carried out. Measurements were made every two hour in both healthy and arthritic subjects. A circadian variation of stiffness was observed in the joints of arthritic subjects. Joint stiffness was elevated in the early morning and for some subjects the degree of change was profound. No significant circadian variation was observed in the joint stiffness of healthy subjects. A circadian variation of grip strength was observed in arthritic subjects. Grip strength reached a minimum value between 2. 00 and 4. 00 a. m. in the majority of subjects. No consistent relationship was found between changes in joint stiffness and changes in grip strength. The effect of several forms of physiotherapy on the joint stiffness of arthritic subjects was studied in both the short and long term. The subjects were measured before, and then immediately after, treatment each time they visited a physiotherapy hand clinic. Only the results of those patients who attended the clinic for a minimum of five weeks were used in any subsequent analysis. Four different treatments were studied: hot wax and ultrasound, hot wax alone, ultrasound alone and exercise. The combination of hot <b>wax</b> <b>baths</b> and ultrasonic therapy effected temporary reductions in all joint stiffness parameters. The reductions in energy dissipation and torque range were highly significant (p < 0. 05 and p < 0. 001 respectively). No significant reductions were found for hot wax, ultrasound alone or exercise. In the long term, no significant change in joint stiffness was found for any of the treatments considered...|$|R
