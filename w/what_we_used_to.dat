500|$|When {{those plans}} fell through, McLaren, Rhodes {{and the band}} began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties. As {{described}} by Matlock, [...] "Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do was if someone had short hair we would stop them {{in the street and}} ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer." [...] Among those they approached was Midge Ure, who was involved with his own band, Slik. Kevin Rowland—who would co-found Dexys Midnight Runners three years later—auditioned, but apart from Matlock, no one was impressed. With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{finishing}} off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk {{began working on}} new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, [...] "the two of us would go in {{with a lot of}} keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months." [...] Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: [...] "We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [...] for four minutes straight." [...] Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the [...] film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: [...] "Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently." [...] Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become Random Access Memories: [...] "We wanted to do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do with machines and samplers, but with people." [...] They avoided the use of samples on the album, {{with the exception of the}} closing track [...] "Contact".|$|E

500|$|Blackhill Enterprises {{provided}} a [...] high stage, with the speakers being {{housed in a}} thirty-foot-high tower so that people {{at the far end}} of the park would be able to hear the music. The stage was flanked by palm trees in pots and behind the performers there was a blowup of the cover of the Beggars Banquet album. Richards had started experimenting with open tunings by this point in the band's career, particularly after hearing Ry Cooder, and the Hyde Park gig was the first chance audiences got to hear them. He played a Gibson ES-330 tuned to open E tuning with a capo on the fourth fret, and a Gibson Flying V. Taylor, meanwhile, played a Gibson Les Paul for the opening number, followed by an SG for the majority of the set. The PA system was supplied by Watkins Electric Music, who already handled amplification at previous Hyde Park shows. Company founder Charlie Watkins recalls it was the largest PA he had assembled to that point and, unable to provide enough gear himself, he was forced to borrow extras from other groups, later saying, [...] "I didn't have many columns, but I wanted to put 1500W up. I borrowed some from T-Rex. They all chipped in — that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
500|$|In Britain, the {{reception}} was highly favourable. In their joint review for Record Mirror, Richard Green and Peter Jones found the album [...] "full of musical ingenuity" [...] yet [...] "controversial", and added: [...] "There are parts that will split the pop fraternity neatly down the middle." [...] Allen Evans of the NME highlighted the album's [...] "electronic effects", McCartney's [...] "penchant for the classics" [...] and Harrison's [...] "stunning {{use of the}} sitar" [...] as diverse elements that distinguished it as a group effort, such that the four band members' [...] "individual personalities are now showing through loud and clear". Evans concluded: [...] "this is a brilliant album which underlines {{once and for all}} that the Beatles have definitely broken the bounds of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> call pop." [...] Having found Rubber Soul [...] "almost monotonous" [...] at times, Melody Maker lauded the new release as a work that would [...] "change the direction of pop music". Peter Clayton, a jazz critic for Gramophone magazine, described it as [...] "an astonishing collection" [...] that defied easy categorisation since much of the album had no precedent in the context of pop music. Clayton concluded: [...] "if there's anything wrong with the record at all it is that such a diet of newness might give the ordinary pop-picker indigestion." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present in}} this paper an {{algorithm}} for determining 3 D motion and structure from correspondences of line segments between two perspective images. To our knowledge, this paper is the first investigation of use of line segments in motion and structure from motion. Classical methods use their geometric abstraction, namely straight lines, but then three images are necessary for the motion and structure determination process. In this paper we show {{that it is possible}} to recover motion from two views when using line segments. The assumption <b>we</b> <b>use</b> is that two matched line segments contain the projection of a common part of the corresponding line segment in space, i. e. they overlap. Indeed, this is <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> match line segments between different views. This assumption constrains the possible motion between two views to an open set in motion parameter space. A heuristic, consisting in maximizing the overlap, leads to a unique solution.
