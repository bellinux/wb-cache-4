5|$|The Quebec Agreement allowed Simon and Peierls to {{meet with}} representatives of Kellex, who were {{designing}} and building the American gaseous diffusion plant, Union Carbide and Carbon, who would operate it, and Harold Urey's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, the Manhattan Project's centre tasked with {{research and development of}} the process. The year's loss of cooperation cost the Manhattan Project dearly. The corporations were committed to tight schedules, and the engineers were unable to incorporate British proposals that would involve major changes. Nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible to build a second plant. Nonetheless, the Americans were still eager for British assistance, and Groves asked for a British mission to be sent to assist the gaseous diffusion project. In the meantime, Simon and Peierls were attached to Kellex.|$|E
25|$|The Federation of the West Indies was not {{the first}} attempt at a British Caribbean {{federation}} (nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> the last). The history of the previous attempts at federations and unions, in part, explains the failure of the 1958 Federation.|$|E
25|$|The Néstor Kirchner {{administration}} placed Brazil as {{a foreign}} policy priority and relations with Brazil were considered strategic. This was met with reciprocity in Brazil, as Lula da Silva placed Argentina as the main priority of his foreign policy. It should be emphasized, that the first foreign visit of Lula da Silva, as president-elect, was to Argentina in December 2002. From the Brazilian perspective, only with this strategic alliance <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible to transform South America into a world power bloc, {{one of the goals}} of Lula da Silva's foreign policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} Moncayo in 1958 tangibly {{marked the end}} of the Mexican {{nationalist}} composition school. In the same way that his work without followers surpassed and abolished the innocent use of the Mexicanism theme, his death closed the predominance of a composition style whose imprint marked musical creation in Mexico during more than three decades; although only {{at the beginning of the}} sixties <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible to talk about the definitive abandonment of the great Mexican fresco, the oblivion of the epic tone, and the search for new structural factors in composition.|$|E
25|$|But {{my family}} {{acquired}} {{in the time of}} my father a plot of land upper than Mart Moura. It is called Marg el-Dayr and it belonged to the family Mousa. Its conversion into an orchard caused the cleaning of an oratory in decline devoted to Saint Augustine. <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> rather there the place of celebration of the synod? I prefer to believe it because the place in question is on the border of the famous village of Bqoufa, also ruined, but from which we know that the prelates of the family Rizzi are originated, prelates who led our Church in those times with three successive patriarchs.|$|E
25|$|During Japan's {{invasion}} and occupation of Manchuria Chiang Kai-shek, {{who saw the}} CPC as a greater threat, refused to ally with them {{to fight against the}} Imperial Japanese Army. Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.|$|E

25|$|Prohibitions of {{displays}} {{of lack of}} respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant, except in the specific circumstances envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the Covenant. Such prohibitions must also comply with the strict requirements of article 19, paragraph 3, as well as such articles as 2, 5, 17, 18 and 26. Thus, for instance, it would be impermissible for any such laws to discriminate in favor of or against one or certain religions or belief systems, or their adherents over another, or religious believers over non-believers. Nor <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> permissible for such prohibitions to be used to prevent or punish criticism of religious leaders or commentary on religious doctrine and tenets of faith.|$|E
25|$|The first {{matters to}} {{establish}} were the design principles and layout. Since {{this was to}} be the first non-denominational chapel for a European garden cemetery, there were no existing guidelines. What should it look like? Where <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> most appropriately located within the park? How should it be aligned in the landscape? And which direction should it face? William Hosking, in discussion with George Collison II developed a plan to site the novel chapel {{at the very heart of}} Abney Park foregoing any positioning close to the main entrance. The aim was that, once the pine trees that were planted along the Chapel Ride matured, the chapel would gradually be revealed through a sylvan landscape approach drive. The sinuously designed Chapel Ride was therefore lined with Bhutan Pine trees on its south side, contributing an attractive odoriferous all-year effect. Not only could nature be appreciated, but the main entrance (with its Egyptian revival building style) would not be eclipsed.|$|E
25|$|Partly as {{a result}} of these failures, and those of other English commanders at this period, John was one of the first {{important}} figures in England to conclude that the war with France was unwinnable because of France's greater resources of wealth and manpower. He began to advocate peace negotiations; indeed, as early as 1373, during his great raid through France, he made contact with , brother and political adviser of Pope Gregory XI, to let the pope know he would be interested in a diplomatic conference under papal auspices. This approach led indirectly to the Anglo-French Congress of Bruges in 1374–77, which resulted in the short-lived Truce of Bruges between the two sides. John was himself a delegate to the various conferences that eventually resulted in the Truce of Leulinghem in 1389. The fact that he became identified with the attempts to make peace added to his unpopularity at a period when the majority of Englishmen believed victory would be in their grasp if only the French could be defeated decisively as they had been in the 1350s. Another motive was John's conviction that it was only by making peace with France <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible to release sufficient manpower to enforce his claim to the throne of Castile.|$|E

500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E

500|$|When {{they began}} {{recording}} in studio in June 2012, the band's members felt little pressure {{to complete the}} album as they could deliver something similar to their previous album [...] "if you've delivered once already, why <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> a problem to do it again? We are the band that made those records [...] so there's really no problem in that regard." [...] Guitarist Jeff Sahyoun {{said he did not}} even think back on Fake History when they were producing The Blackest Beautiful. However, as they progressed through it, there were elements that were not clicking, and the performances lacked the same bite in comparison to their Fake History demos. [...] Butler said that this [...] "almost sent the band crazy". He said he required a specific environment when he sings as his performance puts him in a vulnerable state.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} that actress Betty White would guest star on the show playing herself. After winning his second Emmy Award as Jack Donaghy at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in that same month, Alec Baldwin revealed that White was the cast's first choice to make a guest appearance. [...] "We all put names in a hat, and we took a vote– if you could have one guest star for the whole season, who <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be?</b> And Betty White was the winner." [...] Television host Jimmy Fallon played himself in [...] "Stone Mountain". The character Rick Wayne, a ventriloquist, was played by real-life ventriloquist Jeff Dunham. Actor Blaine Horton, who reprised his role as Sasha, a gay friend of Jenna Maroney's, first appeared as the character in [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] that was broadcast during the show's second season.|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt, a {{personal}} friend of Saint-Gaudens, wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury, Leslie Mortier Shaw: [...] "I think {{the state of our}} coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness. [...] <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible, without asking permission of Congress, to employ a man like Saint-Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty?" [...] Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint-Gaudens, who replied, [...] "I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work." [...] Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval—the cent and the four gold coins. [...] No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Broderick, Scully's successor, {{realized}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{not enough to}} merely save the church. <b>Its</b> age <b>was</b> evident, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to restore it.

500|$|According to Taliaferro, [...] "only {{after the}} deed was {{accomplished}} and Hay was installed as the {{ambassador to the}} Court of St. James's <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> possible to detect just how subtly and completely he had finessed his ally and friend, Whitelaw Reid". A telegraph from Hay to McKinley in the latter's papers, dated December 26 (most likely 1896) reveals the former's suggestion that McKinley tell Reid that the editor's friends had insisted that Reid not endanger his health through office, especially in London's smoggy climes. The following month, in a letter, Hay set forth his own case for the ambassadorship, and urged McKinley to act quickly, as suitable accommodations in London {{would be difficult to}} secure. Hay gained his object (as did Hanna), and shifted his focus to appeasing Reid. Taliaferro states that Reid never blamed Hay, but Kushner and Sherrill recorded, [...] "Reid was certain that he had been wronged" [...] by Hay, and the announcement of Hay's appointment nearly ended their 26-year friendship.|$|E
500|$|Goodrem's manager, Glenn Wheatley, {{suggested}} making Nina into {{an aspiring}} singer. He said: [...] "We didn't want that soap star-turned-singer vibe but how cool <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> if she already was a singer? Neighbours developed a character to suit her {{rather than the}} other way around." [...] Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that Neighbours gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, but she was too shy to sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, [...] "Born To Try", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was too shy to go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried to take credit for the song instead. Connor stopped her and Nina overcame her shyness to sing her song. Within weeks of it being performed, [...] "Born to Try" [...] became the number one single in Australia.|$|E

[...] Afterwards, Grizz says that he and Liz were the [...] "Sam and Diane of this place [...] ", a reference to the Sam and Diane characters from the television show Cheers.
