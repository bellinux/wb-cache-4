5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988.

Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> is consumed.|$|E

However, for households in high forest cover regions, forest stock and forest access may be more important factors than scarcity of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> in determining household’s labour input to <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> collection.

Therefore, supply-side strategies alone may not be effective in addressing the problem of forest degradation and biodiversity loss. Any policy on natural resource management, especially related to rural energy, should make a distinction between regions with different levels of forest degradation. <b>Fuel</b> <b>wood,</b> labor allocation, biomass, rural Ethiopia...|$|R

A study on the consumption trends of <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> & their impact on forest were carried out in Chivranj & Ichchhapur village of Kanker forest division of Chhattisgarh, and its rural environs. Results show that the villagers of Kanker are highly dependent on <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> for cooking purpose. In tribal village <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> are sold {{in the form of}} wood lots which contains about 20 - 30 kg <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> & averagely pricing about Rs. 110 / lots. Price value of these <b>fuel</b> <b>woods</b> varies from Rs. 20 - 30 according to their traders & <b>fuel</b> <b>wood</b> species. The rural population works under the community forest policy, but illegal harvesting in natural forests is indiscriminate and results in severe environmental degradation.

25|$|Striking {{differences}} {{can be observed}} between the vegetation of the highlands and the lower zone towards the coast. One characteristic feature of the coastal area is the baobab (Adansonia Digitata, or imbondeiro, in Portuguese). Tropical forests {{can also be found}} in the areas that receive significant rainfall. Until recently, the highlands were covered with a variety of trees; today, however, except in isolated areas in Bailundo and other regions, grasslands have taken the place of forest and woodland. Traditional methods of agriculture, slash-and-burn techniques (queimadas) and overpopulation by large concentrations of people displaced from their homes during the war (1975–2002) have caused significant deforestation. The use of <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> for the Benguela Railway until the 1980s was also responsible for deforestation. Large extensions of native forest have been cut down and replaced by rapid-growing and soil-depleting eucalyptus and pine trees.|$|E

President MacMaster informed the faculty and students later that day at a chapel meeting, which all students and faculty members were required to attend, that those involved in the incident with Old Main would be expelled. This ultimately backfired though, for the following night even more students broke into Old Main and packed the main floor with snow, along with chairs, tables, benches, and the entire <b>wood</b> <b>fuel</b> supply for the winter, which then froze overnight.

The biomass energy supply in Scotland was forecast to reach 450 MW or higher, (predominantly from wood), with power stations requiring 4,500–5,000 oven dry tonnes per annum per megawatt of generating capacity. However a 2011 Forestry Commission and Scottish government follow-up {{report concluded}} that: [...] "...there is no capacity to support further large scale electricity generation biomass plants from the domestic wood fibre resource." [...] A plan to build in Edinburgh a 200 MW biomass plant which would have imported 83% of its wood, was withdrawn by Forth Energy in 2012. The energy company E.ON has constructed a 44 MW biomass power station at Lockerbie using locally sourced crops while the smaller EPR Westfield power plant in Fife produces 9.8 MW of output using chicken litter as fuel. The Scottish Executive and the Forestry Commission issued a Scottish Biomass Action Plan in 2007. The Scottish Government set up the Scottish Biomass Support Scheme in 2006 with a £7.5 million grant, later increased to £10.5 million, to support biomass energy. £6 million of grants were drawn down by the time the scheme finished in March 2008 and a 2009 review of results concluded that the scheme had [...] "...achieved limited success against its strategic aims objectives." [...] A 2007 article by Renew Scotland claimed that automatic wood pellet boilers could be as convenient to use as conventional central heating systems.

Usually such indirect care should be included, as it is in many time use studies. But it is not always, and as a result some studies may undervalue the amount of certain types of unpaid work.
