6000|$|Tradition tells us, credibly enough, [...] "She {{was very}} like her Mother: beautiful, much the lady (VON FEINEM TON), and of {{energetic}} character;" [...] and adds, probably on slight foundation, [...] "but very cold and proud towards the people." [...] [Vehse, xxv. 251.] Many Books will inform you how, [...] "On first entering Stuttgard, when the reigning Duke and she {{were met by}} a party of congratulatory peasant women dressed in their national costume, {{she said to her}} Duke," [...] being then only sixteen, poor young soul, and on her marriage-journey, [...] "'WAS WILL DAS GESCHMEISS (<b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> rabble bore us)!'"

6000|$|And {{if you ask}} me, How is it a {{sacrifice}} to God to confess to Him that we are sinners? the answer is simple. It is {{a sacrifice}} to God, and a sacrifice well-pleasing to Him, simply because it is The Truth. God wants nothing from us; we can give Him nothing. The wild beasts of the forest are His, {{and so are the}} cattle on a thousand hills. If He be hungry He will not tell us for the whole world is His and all that is therein. But what He asks is, that for our own sakes we should see the truth about ourselves, see what we really are, and sacrifice that self- conceit which prevents our seeing ourselves as God our Father sees us. [...] And <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> please God? Simply because it puts us in our right state, and in our right place, where we can begin to become better men, let us be as bad as we may. If a man be a fool, the best possible thing for him is that he should find out that he is a fool, and confess that he is a fool, as the first, and the absolutely necessary first step to becoming wise. Therefore repentance, contrition, humility, is the very foundation-stone of all goodness, virtue, holiness, usefulness; and God desires to see us contrite, simply because He desires to see us good men and good women.|$|E

Just evaluate me on my music and my lyrics and I'll be happy. Gretchen Seager DeSantis recalled:So many of the stories that women were able to tell in ROCKRGRL were stories they weren’t able to tell in any place else. What was different about ROCKRGRL was {{that a lot of the}} artists we talked to had cautionary tales. My favorite artists to talk to are the ones who can talk honestly about what happened. They were dropped by their label - <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> happen? Bands broke up, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> happen? In ROCKRGRL, what I was looking for were career arcs and career stories - how people got started, what their career was like, how it went for them, and what unusual things they did to be successful.|$|R

5000|$|Since amalgamation, {{the region}} has officially been known as the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), {{although}} [...] "Halifax" [...] has remained in common usage for brevity. On April 15, 2014, the regional council approved {{the implementation of a}} new branding campaign for the region developed by the local firm Revolve Marketing. The campaign would see the region referred to in promotional materials simply as [...] "Halifax", although [...] "Halifax Regional Municipality" [...] would remain the region's official name. The proposed rebranding was met with mixed reaction from residents, some of whom felt that the change would alienate other communities in the municipality through a perception that the marketing scheme would focus on Metropolitan Halifax only, while others expressed relief that the longer formal name would no longer be primary. Mayor Mike Savage defended the decision, stating: [...] "I'm a Westphal guy, I'm a Dartmouth man, but Halifax is my city, we’re all part of Halifax. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> matter? Because when I go and travel on behalf of this municipality, there isn’t a person out there who really cares what HRM means." ...|$|E

5000|$|Following his introduction, the {{character}} {{was involved in}} few high-profile storylines until September 2006, when his estranged mother Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) was introduced in a special week of off-set episodes, filmed in Weymouth, Dorset. In the storyline, the Wicks family went on holiday and were traced by Shirley, who liaised with her unsuspecting children and, despite Kevin's best efforts, later revealed her true identity. The revelation was shown to {{have a negative effect}} on the Wicks family, in particular Deano who was involved in a car accident shortly afterwards and was hospitalised after driving recklessly. The storyline progressed further, when it transpired that Shirley was hiding a secret for Kevin, that he was not the biological father of Deano or Carly. When revealed, Deano was shown to [...] "go off the rails". Commenting on the storyline, Di Angelo has said, [...] "I don't think you can ever forget about things like that. But at the same time, Kevin's looked after him since he was a baby so <b>why</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> make him not his dad, just because he's not his biological father? In my view, your father is person who looked after you since you were born." [...] Describing his character's relationship with his mother Shirley in 2007, Di Angelo said, [...] "I think he's very fond of his mum, he's a bit of a big kid. He's not the big tough guy, he's not aggressive and he's quite a placid guy. That's because he does have this longing for a mum that he never had ... he'd like to get to know her".|$|E
