5000|$|Gilbert and Lewis formed Dome during Wire's 1980-1984 hiatus. Over {{its first}} three albums, <b>Wire's</b> <b>music</b> had progressed from rapid-fire punk rock to moody, ambitious post-punk. Dome {{continued}} the experimentation, often abandoning traditional song structures {{in favor of}} found sounds, melodic fragments, and what critics Steven Grand and David Sheridan described as [...] "lurching mechanical noises infrequently keeping a vague beat".|$|R

5000|$|The Clarks' eighth studio album, Restless Days, was {{released}} on June 9, 2009 after a five-year gap without a studio album. The album was co-released by High <b>Wire</b> <b>Music</b> and Clarkhouse Entertainment, the band's newly-formed label to self-release their own projects. Restless Days most notably included [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] and the radio singles [...] "True Believer" [...] and [...] "Inside."

5000|$|... feedtime's {{sound was}} loud, primitive, and brutal. The most {{distinctive}} musical element is thick, roaring electric guitar, {{played with a}} slide, over a thick, chugging rhythm section. Their loud but stripped-down, minimalist approach led them to {{be compared to the}} British postpunk band Wire (although feedtime didn't know <b>Wire's</b> <b>music),</b> but feedtime's sound also heavily referenced rural American country and blues. A large influence from classic rock is most easily heard on their covers LP Cooper S on which they covered the Rolling Stones and the Animals in addition to punk forebears like the Ramones and the Stooges.|$|R

5000|$|The band first {{attracted}} {{attention at}} Jake's Roadhouse in Atlanta and JJ Cagney's on Savannah's Bay Street, which eventually relocated to River Street {{and later became}} The Live <b>Wire</b> <b>Music</b> Hall. They played a very notable show at J. J.

5000|$|In 2008, Byrne and his {{production}} team turned the Battery Maritime Building, a 99-year-old ferry terminal in Manhattan, into a playable musical instrument. The structure was connected electronically to a pipe organ and made playable {{for a piece}} called [...] "Playing the Building". This project was previously installed in Stockholm, Sweden in 2005, and later at the London Roundhouse in 2009. It bears similarities {{to a series of}} installations created by New Zealand and Detroit based artists Alastair Galbraith and Matt De Genaro, which were recorded on their 1998 record <b>Wire</b> <b>Music</b> and on the 2006 follow-up Long Wires in Dark Museums, Vol. 2. Byrne says that the point of the project was to allow people to experience art first hand, by creating music with the organ, rather than simply looking at it.|$|R
