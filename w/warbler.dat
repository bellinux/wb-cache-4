5|$|Of these relatives, {{the range}} of the black-throated gray <b>warbler</b> {{overlaps}} with those of Townsend's <b>warbler</b> and the hermit <b>warbler,</b> but they occur in different habitats. While Townsend's and hermit warblers commonly hybridize with each other, records of either species hybridizing with the black-throated gray <b>warbler</b> are uncommon.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} olivaceous <b>warbler</b> records {{commenced}} in 1986, and {{continued through the}} 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous <b>warbler</b> into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain {{which of the two}} they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's <b>warbler</b> into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence was available to make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's <b>warbler</b> all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003–04, all desert <b>warbler</b> records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian desert <b>warbler,</b> rather than African desert <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5|$|Predominantly insectivorous, the black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} berries and seeds in winter. It builds its nests in thick shrubs and {{the closeness of}} its nesting sites to the ground make it a favored species {{for the study of}} <b>warbler</b> behavior in the wild. The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> defends its territory against other birds of the same species for both nesting and winter habitats. As the black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> requires large, unbroken forest areas for nesting, its numbers are declining.|$|E

50|$|Hypoderma tarandi, {{also known}} as {{reindeer}} <b>warble</b> fly and caribou bot fly, is a species of <b>warble</b> fly that is parasitic on reindeer.|$|R
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru reed <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed <b>warbler,</b> which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed <b>warbler</b> is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed <b>warbler</b> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|E
5|$|This <b>warbler</b> {{gets its}} name from its simple {{distinctive}} song, a repetitive cheerful chiff-chaff. This song {{is one of the}} first avian signs that spring has returned. Its call is a hweet, less disyllabic than the hooeet of the willow <b>warbler</b> or hu-it of the western Bonelli's <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} <b>warbler,</b> the Nauru reed <b>warbler</b> has {{dark brown}} upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays {{two or three}} white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed <b>warbler</b> is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means {{that it could be}} vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar <b>warbler</b> from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats.|$|E
50|$|The buff-throated <b>warbling</b> finch (Poospiza lateralis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thraupidae. It is found in forest borders and {{woodland}} in south-eastern Brazil. It was previously considered conspecific with the gray-throated <b>warbling</b> finch, and together they were known as the red-rumped <b>warbling</b> finch. The SACC found enough evidence to split them in 2009.|$|R
40|$|The <b>warble</b> song of male budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) is an {{extraordinarily}} complex, multi-syllabic, learned vocalization that is produced continuously in streams lasting {{from a few}} seconds to a few minutes without obvious repetition of particular patterns. As a follow-up of the <b>warble</b> analysis of Farabaugh et al. (1992), an automatic categorization program based on neural networks was developed and used to efficiently and reliably classify more than 25, 000 <b>warble</b> elements from 4 budgerigars. The relative proportion of the resultant seven basic acoustic groups and one compound group is similar across individuals. Budgerigars showed higher discriminability of <b>warble</b> elements drawn from different acoustic categories and lower discriminability of <b>warble</b> elements drawn from the same category psychophysically, suggesting that they form seven perceptual categories corresponding to those established acoustically. Budgerigars also perceive individual voice characteristics in addition to the acoustic measures delineating categories. Acoustic analyses of long sequences of natural <b>warble</b> revealed that the elements were not randomly arranged and that <b>warble</b> has at least a 5 th-order Markovian structure. Perceptual experiments provided convergent evidence that budgerigars are able to master a novel sequence between 4 and 7 elements in length. Through gradual training with chunking (about 5 elements), birds are able to master sequences up to 50 elements. The ability of budgerigars to detect inserted targets taken in a long, running background of natural <b>warble</b> sequences appears to be species-specific and related to the acoustic structure of <b>warble</b> sounds...|$|R

5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden <b>warbler</b> eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used {{the song of}} the garden <b>warbler</b> as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden scene as its sixth movement. This features {{the song of the}} <b>warbler,</b> along with those of the nightingale and blackbird.|$|E
5|$|Its {{nesting site}} is more {{important}} than its foraging site in playing a role in determining the habitat of the black-throated blue <b>warbler.</b> The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> is an open-nesting species, that nests very close to the ground so it has to choose a protected nesting site where the risk of predation is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> (Setophaga caerulescens) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the New World <b>warbler</b> family. Its breeding ranges {{are located}} in the interior of deciduous and mixed coniferous forests in eastern North America. Over the cooler months, it migrates to islands in the Caribbean and Central America. It is very rarely found in western Europe, where it {{is considered to be a}} non-indigenous species. The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> is sexually dimorphic; the adult male has a black face and cheeks, deep blue upperparts and white underparts, while the adult female is olive-brown above and light yellow below.|$|E
40|$|The {{budgerigar}} (Melopsittacus undulatus) has {{an extraordinarily}} complex, learned, vocal repertoire consisting {{of both the}} long rambling <b>warble</b> song of males {{and a number of}} short calls produced by both sexes. In <b>warble,</b> the most common elements (> 30 %) bear a strong resemblance to the highly frequency-modulated, learned contact calls that the birds produce as single utterances. However, aside from this apparent similarity, little else is known about the relationship between contact calls and <b>warble</b> call elements. Here, both types of calls were recorded from four male budgerigars. Signal analysis and psychophysical testing procedures showed that the acoustic features of these two vocalizations were acoustically different and perceived as distinctive vocalizations by birds. This suggests that <b>warble</b> call elements are not simple insertions of contact calls but are most likely different acoustic elements, created de novo, and used solely in <b>warble.</b> Results show that, like contact calls, <b>warble</b> call elements contain information about signaler identity. The fact that contact calls and <b>warble</b> call elements are acoustically and perceptually distinct suggests that they probably represent two phonological systems in the budgerigar vocal repertoire, both of which arise by production learning...|$|R

5|$|The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> mostly forages in the {{understory}} {{instead of}} the canopy. The large leaves and long branches in the understory affect its foraging behaviors. The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> more often hovers rather than gleans its prey {{because it is more}} difficult to glean among thick understory foliage.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray <b>warbler</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by John Kirk Townsend from a specimen collected near today's Portland, Oregon. It {{was known to}} the Chinook inhabitants of the northwest coast, who called it Ah Kah a qual. Townsend described the species as Sylvia nigrescens, placing it with the other New World warblers and the unrelated Old World warblers in the genus Sylvia. It is now placed in the genus Setophaga along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in Dendroica for some time. Within its genus, {{it is part of}} a group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit <b>warbler</b> and Townsend's <b>warbler.</b> It is usually considered an early offshoot among this group of species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace's <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main predators of {{the garden}} <b>warbler</b> are Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats. Some falcons will also take adults, and the Eleonora's falcon hunts the garden <b>warbler</b> and many other small passerines as they migrate across the Mediterranean. Eurasian jays and Eurasian magpies take the eggs and young of warblers, as do mammals such as stoats, weasels and squirrels. The garden <b>warbler</b> is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The blackcap has a much lower level of parasitism than its relative because the cuckoo's eggs are often rejected.|$|E

5|$|A {{review of}} spectacled <b>warbler</b> records was {{initiated}} in 1984. This review {{resulted in the}} species being removed from the British list; of the three accepted records, one, at Spurn, Yorkshire in 1968, was re-identified as a first-year female subalpine <b>warbler,</b> while descriptions of the other two, at Porthgwarra, Cornwall in October 1969 and on Fair Isle in June 1979, were not considered sufficiently watertight to permit their continued acceptance. Spectacled <b>warbler</b> has since been re-added to the British list following an individual at Filey, Yorkshire in 1992, {{and there have been}} further subsequent records. In the late 1990s, BBRC reviewed some of the accepted records of moustached <b>warbler,</b> and concluded that one, from Sussex in 1979, was unacceptable, but that one other, from Buckinghamshire in 1965, should stand. Two further records, from Hampshire in 1951 and Kent in 1952, were reviewed as part of the 1950–1957 review (see below), and found to be unacceptable. Following these rejections, the Buckinghamshire record, and the remaining record, a breeding pair in Cambridgeshire in 1946, previously accepted as Britain's first, were scrutinised by the BOURC and found to be unacceptable, leading to the removal of moustached <b>warbler</b> from the British list; it has not re-occurred.|$|E

5|$|The black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> {{enjoys a}} large range {{and a big}} {{population}}. Its population trend is currently increasing. This species was ranked as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2012. Deforestation and habitat fragmentation are threatening the black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> in its tropical wintering areas. A report in 2000 discussed the impact {{of global climate change}} on the population dynamics of the black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> by an observation from 1986 to 1998. In particular, the effect of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) was studied in relation to the survival, fecundity and recruitment of this migratory bird. It was found that El Niño years (the warm South Pacific oceanic phase) were associated with lower adult survival rate in their wintering ground, Jamaica, lower fecundity in the breeding habitats in New Hampshire of the United States, and lower annual recruitment of yearlings and juveniles to both breeding and wintering grounds. All the three factors were relatively higher during La Niña years (cold South Pacific Ocean) when the weather was wetter and the food availability was much more abundant. Long-term global warming can aggravate the ENSO effect, adding to the fluctuation of the black-throated blue <b>warbler</b> population.|$|E
50|$|Spix's <b>warbling</b> antbird (Hypocnemis striata) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Thamnophilidae.

As presently defined, Spix's <b>warbling</b> antbird includes two subspecies, H. s. implicata and H. s. affinis. The westernmost population is likely to represent an undescribed subspecies. Spix's <b>warbling</b> antbird is found at lower levels in humid forest in the south-eastern Amazon of Brazil.|$|R
