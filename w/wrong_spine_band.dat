50|$|C. longispinus {{has a small}} central {{test and}} spines up to 30 cm in length. These are toxic and can cause a painful sting. The spines are of varying length and are mobile and used for locomotion. There {{are a number of}} {{club-shaped}} spines on the oral (lower) surface, a characteristic that this species shares with C. besnardi and C. coronatus but not other members of the genus. These spines are reddish brown and are tipped with purple or pink pigment. The subspecies C. l. longispinus has <b>spines</b> <b>banded</b> in purple on a pale green, buff or whitish background. Juvenile C. l. rubricingulus have reddish-brown spines on a pale background while adults have either <b>spines</b> <b>banded</b> in brown on pale brown or uniformly dark-colored spines.

40|$|Extract] The {{conclusion}} by Souter et al. (1997) that <b>spine</b> pigment <b>band</b> count (SPBC) is not {{an appropriate}} method to estimate age in Acanthaster planci is not justified. They are incorrect {{to suggest that the}} ages derived from the SPBC method bear no relationship to the actual age of the specimen, because their study did not test the SPBC method proposed by Stump and Lucas (1990) and further confirmed by Stump (1994, 1996). Instead, Souter et al. (1997) sampled spines from all over the aboral surfaces of five specimens, including regenerated arms. They found that numbers of pigment bands declined progressively in spines away from the longest spines at the midline base of arms and were less than maximal in regenerating arms. By employing an indiscriminant sampling method, they showed a potential for spines from adult A. planci to have variation in banding patterns. However, the SPBC method recognizes <b>spine</b> <b>banding</b> variation within individuals and specifies that the longest spines must be carefully sampled from the proximal area of whole arms; this allows for possible effects from spine autotomy, sublethal predation and regeneration. In addition, the interpretation of their results is not well founded. Ultimately, the testing of the validity of age-determining methods can be achieved only through medium-term to long-term mark recapture studies or by identifying known-age individuals in populations (Beamish and McFarlane 1983) ...|$|R

Surg. 2011, 5 : 33) reported the successful surgical treatment of a persistent thoracic pain following a T 7 - 8 microdiscectomy, truly performed at the ‘level immediately above’. The <b>wrong</b> level in <b>spine</b> surgery is a multi-factorial matter and several strategies have been designed and adopted to try decreasing its occurrence. We think that three of these factors are crucial: global strategy, attention, precision in level identification; and the actors we identified are the surgeon, the assistant nurse and the (neuro) radiologist respectively. Basing upon our experience, {{the role of the}} radiologist pre- and intraoperatively and the importance of the assistant nurse are briefly described. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Wrong site {{surgery is}} one of five {{surgical}} "Never Events," which include performing surgery on the incorrect side or incorrect site, performing the wrong procedure, performing surgery on the wrong patient, unintended retention of a foreign object in a patient, and intraoperative/immediate postoperative death in an ASA Class I patient. In the <b>spine,</b> <b>wrong</b> site surgery occurs when a procedure is performed on an unintended vertebral level. Despite the efforts of national safety protocols, literature suggests that the risk for <b>wrong</b> level <b>spine</b> surgery remains problematic. Case Presentation A 34 -year-old male was referred to us to evaluate his persistent thoracic pain following right-sided microdiscectomy at T 7 - 8 at an outside institution. Postoperative imaging showed the continued presence of a herniated disc at T 7 - 8 and evidence of a microdiscectomy at the level immediately above. The possibility that wrong level surgery had occurred was discussed with the patient and revision surgery was planned. During surgery, the site of the previous laminectomy was clearly visualized; however, we also experienced confusion when verifying the level of the previous surgery. We ultimately used the previous laminectomy site as a landmark for identifying and treating the correct pathologic level. Postoperative consultation with Musculoskeletal Radiology revealed the patient had two abnormalities in his spinal anatomy that made intraoperative counting of levels inaccurate, including a pair of cervical ribs at C 7 and the absence of a pair of thoracic ribs. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of strict adherence to a preoperative method of vertebral labeling that focuses on the landmarks used to label a pathologic disc space, rather than simply relying on the reference to a particular level. That is, by designating the pathological level as the disc space associated with the fourth rib up from the last rib-bearing vertebrae, rather than calling it "T 7 - 8 ", then the correct level can be found intraoperatively even in the case of abnormal segmentation. We recommend working closely with radiology during preoperative planning to identify unusual anatomy that may have been overlooked. We also recommend that radiology colleagues use the same system of identifying pathological levels when dictating their reports. Together, these strategies can reduce the risk of wrong level surgery and increase patient safety. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wrong</b> level <b>spine</b> surgery dominates {{malpractice}} claims. 1 In one series, {{the wrong}} level was approached in 15 % of cases undergoing a lumbar discectomy. 2 We report three steps to avoid incorrect level surgery and litigation. TECHNIQUE Prior to skin incision, lateral fluoroscopy is {{performed with the}} patient prone. A radiopaque pointer is used to identify {{the level of the}} disc be-ing approached (Fig 1) and this level is marked on the skin. The surgi-cal approach is centred on the skin mark and once the laminae have been exposed, a radiopaque instrument is inserted below the inferior border of the upper lamina, {{at the level of the}} disc. Further fluor-oscopy is used to confirm correct positioning (Fig 2). A final image is taken following discectomy with an instrument in the disc space, thereby confirming correct level surgery (Fig 3). DISCUSSION In 2010 a retrospective study by Irace and Corona reported the use of a pre-incision wire marker inserted to the spinous process using radiography for patients undergoing microlumbar discectomies. 3 They described one case of incorrect approach. We have defined a reli-able technique that confirms with absolute certainty the correct level for discectomy before, during and after the procedure. We have per-formed 64 open lumbar discectomies using this technique with no cases of incorrect level discectomy. Three ways to avoid incorrect-level lumbar spine surger...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) gives detailed information on the morphological characteristics which can help identify the immature forms of the flies.
