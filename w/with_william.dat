40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the profile of}} repetitive behaviour in individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome, utilising cross-syndrome comparisons with people with Prader–Willi and Down syndromes. The Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire was administered to caregivers of adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> (n[*]=[*] 96), Prader–Willi (n[*]=[*] 103) and Down (n[*]=[*] 78) syndromes. There were few group differences, although participants <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome {{were more likely to}} show body stereotypies. Individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome also showed more hoarding and less tidying behaviours than those with Down syndrome. IQ and adaptive ability were negatively associated with repetitive questioning in people <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome. The profile of repetitive behaviour amongst individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome was similar to the comparison syndromes. The cognitive mechanisms underlying these behaviours in genetic syndromes warrant further investigation. No Full Tex...|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{hallmark}} traits of individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome is an {{apparent lack of}} social inhibition. Dykens and Rosner (1999) found that 100% of those <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome were kind-spirited, 90% sought the company of others, 87% empathize with others' pain, 84% are caring, 83% are unselfish/forgiving, 75% never go unnoticed in a group, and 75% are happy when others do well. [...] Infants <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome make normal and frequent eye contact, and young children <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> will often approach and hug strangers. Individuals affected by Williams syndrome typically have high empathy, and are rarely observed displaying aggression. In regards to empathy, they show relative strength in reading people's eyes to gauge intentions, emotions, and mental states. The level of friendliness observed in people <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> is often inappropriate for the social setting, however, and teens and adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome often experience social isolation, frustration, and loneliness despite their clear desire to connect to other people.|$|R
5000|$|Despite their {{physical}} and cognitive deficits, individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome exhibit impressive social and verbal abilities. Williams patients {{can be highly}} verbal relative to their IQ. When children <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome are asked to name an array of animals, they may well list such a wild assortment of creatures as a koala, saber-toothed cat, vulture, unicorn, sea lion, yak, ibex and Brontosaurus, a far greater verbal array than would be expected of children with IQs in the 60s. [...] Some other strengths that have been associated <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome are auditory short-term memory and facial recognition skills. The language used by individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome differs notably from unaffected populations, including individuals matched for IQ. People <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome tend to use speech that is rich in emotional descriptors, high in prosody (exaggerated rhythm and emotional intensity), and features unusual terms and strange idioms.|$|R

50|$|Adults and {{adolescents}} <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome typically achieve a below-average height and weight, compared with non-affected populations. As individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome age, they frequently develop joint limitations and hypertonia, or abnormally increased muscle tone. Hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, and genitourinary symptoms often persist into adulthood, {{as well as}} cardiovascular problems. Adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome are typically limited {{in their ability to}} live independently or work in competitive employment settings, but this developmental impairment is attributed more to psychological symptoms than physiological problems.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} auditory {{perception in}} Williams syndrome by investigating strategies used in organizing sound patterns into coherent units. In Experiment 1, we investigated the streaming of sound sequences into perceptual units, {{on the basis}} of pitch cues, in a group of children and adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome compared to typical controls. We showed that individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome were sensitive to the same pitch cues as typical children and adults when streaming these patterns. In Experiment 2, we evaluated differences in reliance on pitch and contour cues in unfamiliar melody perception in a group of adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome relative to typical control children and adults. Unlike controls who demonstrated greater proficiency when contour cues were available, adults <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome showed no such advantage...|$|R

5|$|Hugh was not {{involved}} in the controversy between King Henry II and Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. The king did suspect Hugh of supporting Henry's heir, Henry the Young King, when the prince rebelled and Hugh was also suspected of aiding the King of Scots, William I, during an invasion of Northern England in 1174. After the accession of Henry's second son Richard as king, Hugh bought the office of Sheriff of Northumberland, as well as the earldom of Northumbria. He also acquired the office of Justiciar, which he was supposed to share <b>with</b> <b>William</b> de Mandeville, but with Mandeville's death Hugh shared the office <b>with</b> <b>William</b> Longchamp. Longchamp had managed to secure the office for himself by the middle of 1190.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{syndrome}} is also {{marked by a}} delay in development of motor skills. Infants <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> develop the ability to lift their heads and sit without support months later than typically developing children. These delays continue into childhood, where patients <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome are delayed in learning to walk. In young children, the observed motor delay is around five to six months, though some research suggests that children <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome have a delay in development that becomes more extreme with age. Children with motor delays {{as a result of}} Williams syndrome are particularly behind in development of coordination, fine motor skills such as writing and drawing, response time, and strength and dexterity of the arms. Impaired motor ability persists (and possibly worsens) as children <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome reach adolescence.|$|R

5|$|In 1154, as Manuel {{prepared}} for war <b>with</b> <b>William</b> I of Sicily, {{he gave his}} uncle command of the Byzantine fleet and ordered him to proceed to Monemvasia, where to await further reinforcements. Constantine, however, was persuaded by his astrologers that if he attacked the Sicilians he would win. Disobeying the Emperor's orders, he proceeded to intercept a far larger Sicilian fleet returning from a raid against Fatimid Egypt. In the ensuing engagement, the Byzantines were defeated and most of their ships were captured. His brother Nicholas managed to escape {{with a handful of}} ships, but Constantine was captured and imprisoned in Palermo until 1158, when Manuel concluded a peace treaty <b>with</b> <b>William.</b>|$|E

50|$|People <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> {{syndrome}} {{are often}} affable and hyperverbal, demonstrating the decreased inhibition ability that stems from dorsal-frontal deficits. Some {{studies suggest that}} the amygdala of a person <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome has greater volume than the average person's (though it is smaller than average in childhood).In general, neuroimaging studies demonstrate that individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> syndrome have diminished amygdala reactivity in response to socially frightening stimuli (such as disapproving faces), but demonstrate hyperreactivity in the amygdala when presented with nonsocial fear stimuli (such as frightening animals). This may partially account for the apparent absence of social inhibition observed in individuals with the syndrome, as well as the prevalence of anxious symptoms (but see fear for details on the relationship between the amygdala and fear response). There is also evidence that individuals <b>with</b> <b>Williams</b> exhibit hyper amygdala activity when viewing happy facial expressions.|$|R
