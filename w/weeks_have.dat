With the Matrix now emptied of all its power, Optimus decides to go by his old name of Orion Pax, and agrees to leave Cybertron forever in exchange for the Autobots being allowed to stay.|$|E

500|$|Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph {{said the}} episode was good but lacked {{significant}} background motivation into the villains. Fuller also noted {{the revelation of}} River Song being Amy's grown up child [...] "is perhaps a narrative strand which would sit uncomfortably with a series where loss has often been brushed off {{as soon as the}} next couple of episodes". However, he did have praise for the performance of Smith's Doctor, commenting [...] "the last few <b>weeks</b> <b>have</b> seen Matt Smith's Doctor in a welcome generally more serious vein, which he kept up here, with leavening at the right moments where his alien lack of comfort with human emotions, although used to comic effect, rang very true, as did his awkwardness when discovering the truth about River".|$|E

The game ends with Neku abandoning his headphones, before a title card appears entitled [...] "The World Begins with You".|$|E

500|$|In early spring, {{expectant}} mothers {{begin to}} look for a den where they can give birth. The female otters do not dig their own dens; instead, they rely on other animals, such as beavers, to provide suitable environments to raise their offspring. When the mothers have established their domains, they give birth to several kits. Litter size can reach five, but usually ranges from one to three. Each otter pup weighs approximately five ounces. At birth, the river otters are fully furred, blind, and toothless. The claws are well-formed and facial vibrissae (about [...] long) are present. The kits open their eyes after 30–38 days. The newborns start playing at five to six weeks, and begin consuming solid food at 9–10 weeks. Weaning occurs at 12 weeks, and females provide solid food for their progeny until 37–38 <b>weeks</b> <b>have</b> transpired. The maximum weight and length of both sexes are attained at three to four years of age.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most intense}} {{work on the}} book was done {{during the winter of}} 1850–1851, when Melville had changed the noise of New York City for a farm in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The move may well have delayed {{finishing}} the book. During these months, he wrote several excited letters to Hawthorne, including one of June 1851 in which he summarizes his career: [...] "What I feel most moved to write, that is banned, — it will not pay. Yet, altogether, write the other way I cannot. So the product is a final hash, and all my books are botches." [...] This is the stubborn Melville who stood by Mardi and talked about his other, more commercial books with contempt. The letter also reveals how Melville experienced his development from his 25th year: [...] "Three <b>weeks</b> <b>have</b> scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded within myself. But I feel that I am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould." [...] One other theory holds that getting to know Hawthorne first inspired him to write Ahab's tragic obsession into the book, but Bryant and Springer object that Melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the Bible's Jonah and Job, Milton's Satan, Shakespeare's King Lear, Byron's heroes.|$|E
