5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back,</b> the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E
500|$|In December 1968, Iommi {{abruptly}} left Earth to join Jethro Tull. Although his stint {{with the}} band would be short-lived, Iommi made an appearance with Jethro Tull on The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus TV show. Unsatisfied with the direction of Jethro Tull, Iommi returned to Earth in January 1969. [...] "It just wasn't right, so I left", Iommi said. [...] "At first I thought Tull were great, but I didn't much go for having {{a leader in the}} band, which was Ian Anderson's way. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from Tull, I came back with a new attitude altogether. They taught me that to get on, you got to work for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Peggy did return {{briefly in}} 2004 to attend her {{daughter}} Sam's wedding to Andy Hunter (Michael Higgs), {{it was not}} until 2005 that she resumed her role as a series regular. Her full return was announced in January 2005, with John Yorke, the BBC controller of continuing drama series, stating he was [...] "delighted" [...] as [...] " [...] is a hugely loved character and one we think will be stirring things up from the moment she steps back into Walford." [...] Windsor said that she was [...] "over the moon" [...] to return, adding: [...] "I had a great time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to film {{for a couple of weeks}} recently. It really reminded me that the square is where I feel at home." [...] BBC executives hoped that Peggy's return would help to revive EastEnders ratings. Her absence coincided with a two-year ratings slump for EastEnders, with David Liddiment in The Guardian drawing direct correlation between her return and the show's [...] "ratings rejuvenation". The episode in which she returned was watched by 10 million viewers, winning EastEnders a 47% audience share in the timeslot.|$|E

500|$|It {{was around}} this time that Nirvana's Nevermind was making waves in the rock and pop scene. As the {{popularity}} of 80's pop gave way to alternative rock, Yankovic {{decided it was time}} to record a parody of the Seattle-based band's huge hit single [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Yankovic later said, [...] "I wanted to make sure that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> after that long hiatus, it was with something strong, and it wasn't until Nirvana that I felt I had a real contender." [...] To secure permission for the parody, Yankovic wanted to approve it with Kurt Cobain. After learning that Nirvana was to perform on Saturday Night Live, Yankovic called up his UHF co-star, Victoria Jackson, who was, at the time, a regular cast member on the show. Jackson got Cobain on the phone so that Yankovic could make his request. Cobain agreed, although he asked if the new parody was [...] "going to be a song about food". [...] Yankovic reassured him that it would actually be about how [...] "no one can understand [...] lyrics" [...] to the original, which Cobain thought was funny. After receiving permission, Yankovic wrote and recorded [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] on January 27, 1992.|$|E
500|$|Many {{viewers and}} fans of EastEnders {{expected}} Poppy's return {{to be only}} temporary, and thought that she would depart soon after her return. However, it was announced on 24 October that Kirkwood's successor Lorraine Newman decided that Bright will remain with EastEnders {{for the foreseeable future}} as a regular character. Upon this news, Digital Spy announced that Wood-Davis had been cast as Tansy Meadow, Poppy's younger sister, who appeared for one episode. Poppy is [...] "less than enthusiastic" [...] to hear about her sister's visit. In 30 October 2012 episode, Poppy, along with Fatboy (Norwood) host a Halloween ghost tour of the Square organised showing people where former residents have died. A BBC representative said, [...] "The backroom staff {{had a lot of fun}} planning this one". Newman stated in an interview in November 2012 that there is [...] "plenty more on the table" [...] for Poppy adding, [...] "We'll see Poppy become involved in a relationship very soon, which is progressing very well in the material we're working on at the moment. She'll become far more involved in the Square and the friendships within those groups". Digital Spy also revealed Poppy's new relationship, adding that [...] "viewers will have to wait and see who she falls for and how things pan out as the new plot develops". This was confirmed as Fatboy, and the two kiss in 22 November's episode. The pair [...] "grow close" [...] after Tansy's visit, where Fatboy acts as Poppy's [...] "high-flying" [...] businessman boyfriend in front of Tansy, trying to make herself look good in front of her [...] "successful sibling". Bright said of their relationship, [...] "It's really sweet. I don't think Poppy or Fatboy realised they liked each other as they've been friends for a while. She's unsure at first because she doesn't want to ruin a friendship. She's also been unlucky in love, so she's a little bit wary. But I think she can trust Fatboy". Bright expressed her delight at working with Norwood upon her return, after being disappointed she did not work with him during her first stint. In an interview with Metro she said, [...] "Before I started the show Fatboy was one of my favourite characters. I was gutted I didn’t work with him the first time round so <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> and they told me about Poppy and Fatboy’s relationship, I was just so excited. Their characters are perfect for each other. Poppy and Fatboy are a little bit of light in a lot of gloom around the Square. It’s important to have a bit of comedy between everything else. I’m very lucky". She also expressed her wish for the two to get married, adding that their relationship [...] "looks long term".|$|E
2500|$|Blas Galindo and I went to Alvarado, one of {{the places}} where folkloric music is {{preserved}} in its most pure form; we were collecting melodies, rhythms and instrumentations during several days. The transcription of it was very difficult because the huapangueros (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to Mexico, I showed the collected material to Candelario Huízar; Huízar gave me a piece of advice that I will always be grateful for: [...] "Expose the material first in the same way you heard it and develop it later according to your own thought."

And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. The doctor told me: 'You are totally over-worked.' I don't think I've ever felt so depressed as I did <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from New York." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Ratcliff, Sue getting {{pregnant}} {{put her in}} a dilemma because she worried that happiness for the Osmans would need to be curtailed if she decided to leave the programme; she felt this would be unfair on viewers because of all the misery Sue had been put through on-screen already. Discussing this in 1987, Ratcliff said, [...] "I knew nothing about the baby plans until a few weeks ago <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from my holidays and was told that Sue was pregnant again. Sue has gone through enough {{in the last couple of}} years. I'm glad she's got her dearest wish [...] I think she'll make a great mum and I'm sure Ali will be supportive. Hopefully, the storylines will open up for me, but it also means that if the pregnancy goes well and the baby is fine, it would be very difficult for me to leave without there being another tragedy in the Osman family. I don't think that would be fair on the show or the viewers." ...|$|E

I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked. Instead of just strolling in at any hour, it made it more like we were saying, [...] "Let’s do it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The opera {{historian}} Harold Rosenthal {{wrote of}} the Moody-Manners company: [...] "With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists {{in the years before}} World War I." [...] Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: [...] "I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal. It was not till over six years after I left my studies that I found anything I had learnt at the academies of any value to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking to The Sun {{newspaper}} in June 2008, Swash {{has talked about}} his dissatisfaction with the direction the producers had taken Mickey. In Swash's opinion, Mickey had only been used for [...] "light relief" [...] since September 2005, when Swash was forced to take a three-month break from the serial after he contracted meningoencephalitis — a rare form of viral meningitis, which makes the brain swell up. EastEnders writers were reported to be [...] "frantically reworking scripts" [...] to explain Mickey's sudden disappearance, and according to Swash, this meant that a big storyline concentrating {{on the relationship between}} Mickey and his estranged father Mike had to be cut. He has commented, [...] "My illness had a massive impact on my job. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> I couldn’t find my feet. New producers came in and brought in new actors and I got lost down the pecking order [...] Ever since I came back, I’ve had nothing regular. As an actor you want storylines to stretch yourself. To be fair, I didn't work as much when the Miller family arrived in 2004. When it was just Mickey, I got really good stuff. I was over the moon about the family but producers needed to concentrate on developing their characters and I had to take a back seat [...] Mickey just became light relief – the joker. That’s all right but I’ve got more ambition. I would have stayed for ages if I had good stuff, but I wasn’t getting the work [...] I wasn't that upset when I was told [...] I kind of predicted it [...] My character hadn’t been working out for ages [...] it will be a relief not to be Mickey Miller any more!" ...|$|E
