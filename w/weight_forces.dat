50|$|For other situations, {{such as when}} {{objects are}} {{subjected}} to mechanical accelerations from forces other than the resistance of a planetary surface, the weight force {{is proportional to the}} mass of an object multiplied by the total acceleration away from free fall, which is called the proper acceleration. Through such mechanisms, objects in elevators, vehicles, centrifuges, and the like, may experience <b>weight</b> <b>forces</b> many times those caused by resistance to the effects of gravity on objects, resulting from planetary surfaces. In such cases, the generalized equation for weight W of an object is related to its mass m by the equation W = -ma, where a is the proper acceleration of the object caused by all influences other than gravity. (Again, if gravity is the only influence, such as occurs when an object falls freely, its weight will be zero).|$|E

50|$|A {{curtain wall}} system is an outer {{covering}} {{of a building}} in which the outer walls are non-structural, but merely keep the weather out and the occupants in. As the curtain wall is non-structural {{it can be made}} of a lightweight material, reducing construction costs. When glass is used as the curtain wall, a great advantage is that natural light can penetrate deeper within the building. The curtain wall façade does not carry any dead load weight from the building other than its own dead load weight. The wall transfers horizontal wind loads that are incident upon it to the main building structure through connections at floors or columns of the building. A curtain wall is designed to resist air and water infiltration, sway induced by wind and seismic forces acting on the building, and its own dead load <b>weight</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|E
50|$|A ground {{reaction}} force is {{the force that}} is exerted by the ground onto whatever body is {{in contact with the}} ground and is equal to the force that is placed on the ground. An example is the force that the ground exerts onto the foot and then up the leg of a person when walking and making contact with the ground. These can be measured by having a subject walk across a force platform and collect the forces exerted on the ground. These forces have long been thought to increase loads on the knee and would increase with greater mass from an obese person. This may be a predictor of osteoarthritis for an obese subject as the vertical force has been documented to potentially be the most significant force that is transmitted up the leg to the knee. In 1996, Messier and colleagues observed the differences in ground {{reaction force}}s between obese and lean older adults with osteoarthritis. They found that when they accounted for age and walking velocity, the vertical force was significantly positively correlated with BMI. Therefore, as BMI increased, the forces increased. They found this in not only the vertical force, but also in the anteroposterior and mediolateral forces. Because of the study population, this study did not compare obese adults with lean counterparts. Browning and Kram in 2006 observed two groups (one obese and one non-obese group) of young adult’s ground reaction forces across different speeds. They found that absolute ground reaction forces were significantly greater for the obese people than the non-obese group at slower walking speeds and at each walking speed the peak vertical force was approximately 60% greater. Absolute peak in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were also greater for the obese group but the difference was erased when scaled to body <b>weight.</b> <b>Forces</b> were also greatly reduced at slower walking speeds.|$|E

40|$|For ground {{testing of}} {{controlled}} flexible space structures an active suspension design is proposed to eliminate dynamic reaction {{forces from the}} suspension cables. Thus, supporting only the constant <b>weight</b> <b>forces</b> at the hinges, an approximative dynamic g-compensation is achieved. The principle suspension actuator design is based upon apassive spring bias weight support, augmented by an electrodynamic actuator which eliminates the spring restraint forces about equilibrium. Moving mass reaction forces are compensated for by feedback of a hinge mounted dynamic force sensor output. The salient feature of the voice-coil type actuator is the on- line compensation of the inherent non-linear force-displacement characteristic by a high-speed signal processor. Due to the simple mechanical design the actuator can be easily adapted with respect to range and output force level. Moreover the overall cost is considerably reduced by elimination of complex mechanical adjustment and calibration procedures and by utilization of respective software control instead...|$|E
40|$|In 1901 {{the third}} Conference Generale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) defined {{the weight of}} a body as ``the product of its mass and the {{acceleration}} due to gravity". In practical terms the <b>weight</b> <b>force</b> corresponds to the gravitational force. However, this gravitational definition of the weight lacks logic from the perspective of present knowledge and can be misleading. In a space traveling time, weight associated concepts such as "true weight", "apparent weight", "weightlessness", "zero gravity", "microgravity", are ambiguous and strong deceptive. The superfluousness or ambiguousness of these concept would be removed if an operational definition of {{the weight of a}} body as the force the body exerts on its support or suspender is adopted. In this definition the <b>weight</b> <b>force</b> does not act on the body and {{it is not necessary to}} describe the body's sate of motion.

40|$|Abstract. The static {{balancing}} of the <b>weight</b> <b>forces</b> {{is necessary to}} any mechanical system which is not working in horizontal plane. The effect is the decrease (until to vanishing) of the acting power. From practical point of view two main ways of {{static balancing}} could be taken into consideration: by mass redistribution of components or/and by adding counterweights, and by elastic forces of the springs or of the gases. The first solution is not always possible due to the dimensions of mechanical systems and due to increasing of the dynamic stresses of components. Second solution {{is more and more}} used to various mechanical systems. The complexity of balancing systems with springs comes from the need of using zero-free length springs. In any case the mathematical model has not a unique solution. Present paper is an extension of a paper of first author [1] and is presenting a method to find the optimum solution of the simplest elastic system which is using a real helical extension spring with finite-free length. Design variables are the position of spring’s joints, as well as the constructional parameters of a extension spring. Finally some examples are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{articular}} processes (AP) of {{the neural}} arch have {{been implicated in}} weight transmission through the cervical spine. To analyse the mechanism of weight transmission in the AP, we studied the direction of forces within it, in particular, the pattern of trabecular trajectories. Twenty-two AP from C 4 vertebrae were studied in anatomical sections, and corresponding photoelastic models from selected sections were constructed and analysed. Anatomical and photoelastic findings show the subarticular spongiosa of the superior articular process (SAP) to be orthogonally arranged with vertical and oblique trabeculae {{in the direction of}} compressive forces and additional trabeculae always oriented perpendicular to the former. Vertical and oblique trabeculae are divided into rostral, middle and posterior groups. Rostral and middle trabeculae end in the anterior wall of the SAP and the transitional zone with the pedicle. Posterior trabeculae end in the subarticular spongiosa of the inferior articular process (IAP). The findings relating to trabecular trajectories in the SAP differ from previous descriptions and instead suggest that a part of the <b>weight</b> <b>forces</b> distributed within the AP transmit to the subchondral zone of the IAP. Knowledge of the trajectorial architecture of the AP may contribute to refining finite element analytical models for investigating its weight-bearing function...|$|E
40|$|Gas-solid {{fluidised}} {{beds are}} widely used in chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, biochemical and powder industries. Particles used in gas-solid fluidised beds often differ in size and/or density, thus have the tendency to segregate under certain operating conditions. The results of our earlier work (Alghamdi et al., 2013) showed that for a given binary mixture, the transition from segregation to mixing occurred when the superficial gas velocity was increased over a critical value. In this study, force analysis at particle scale, including particle-particle, particle-wall and particle-fluid interacting forces, has been performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms that drive the occurrence of the transition. The results showed that as the superficial gas velocity increased, the system exhibited three sequential states: segregated, transition, and mixed. The vertical fluid force acting on the particles {{was found to be}} responsible for the occurrence of the transition from segregation to mixing, at which the bulk density of the heavy (small) particle species became smaller than the actual density of the light (large) species. After the occurrence of the transition, the particle collisional effects were dominant over the fluid viscous effects in governing the gas-solid two-phase flow. After the system became mixed, the net force of fluid and particle net <b>weight</b> <b>forces</b> conversely tended to separate the particles. However, the particle dispersion induced by particle collisions counterbalanced the particle segregation, acting as the main mechanism driving the good mixing of the binary particle species. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tilt table incline and knee flexion angle {{on the degree of}} weight bearing and forces exerted across the supporting straps. DESIGN: A quantitative and exploratory study to {{investigate the}} effects of a mechanical procedure. SETTING: Physiotherapy gymnasium. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy subjects (9 female, 3 male) aged 22 - 45 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects stood on a tilt table, on two occasions, with simulated contractures of 10 degrees and 40 degrees knee flexion. Nine tilt angles, between 10 degrees and 90 degrees, were maintained for 1 minute each in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Force was recorded from single-point load cells placed under the feet, and at knee and chest straps. RESULTS: The degree of simulated knee contracture (10 degrees or 40 degrees) influenced the distribution of forces at different recording sites. Weight bearing increased with table incline and was significantly less with the 40 degrees than the 10 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 001). Conversely, forces across the knee straps were systemically higher with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 0001). The effects were accentuated by greater body <b>weight.</b> <b>Forces</b> across the chest strap also increased with tilt and were significantly larger with the 40 degrees knee angle (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between table incline, angle of knee flexion and distribution of forces generated during tilt table standing have been quantified and described. Standing with flexed knees involved less weight bearing under the feet and greater force exerted across the supporting straps. These effects were more pronounced at the higher knee angle and with greater body weight, and could be modified by reducing table inclin...|$|E
