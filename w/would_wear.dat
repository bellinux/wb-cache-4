5|$|The Canucks {{announced}} {{that they would be}} celebrating 100 years of hockey in British Columbia during the season. To that end, they <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> a special patch on their jerseys with the logo of the Vancouver Millionaires, the first professional team in the city. They also <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> replica jerseys of the Millionaires for their March 16 game against the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Ezra... would {{approach}} with the step of a dancer, making passes {{with a cane}} at an imaginary opponent. He <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> trousers made of green billiard cloth, a pink coat, a blue shirt, a tie hand-painted by a Japanese friend, an immense sombrero, a flaming beard cut to a point, and a single, large blue earring.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E

3000|$|Future {{researchers}} {{may continue to}} pursue the effects of dress on the wearer. The extended enclothed cognition framework {{could be applied to}} school uniforms. A possible research question could be that if school uniforms are associated with powerlessness among schoolchildren, <b>would</b> <b>wearing</b> school uniforms affect the level of effort children expend to solve homework problems or write papers?

50|$|Members of {{the society}} would write {{extensively}} on the Vikings, often in a romanticized manner which described a largely heroic and noble ancient people. Members of the Geatish Society <b>would</b> occasionally <b>wear</b> horned helmets, which {{is the source of}} the myth that Vikings <b>would</b> have <b>worn</b> such helmets. In actuality, there is not evidence to suggest they ever did.|$|R
5|$|Two manned orbital Block I CSM {{missions}} were planned: AS-204 and AS-205. The Block I crew {{positions were}} titled Command Pilot, Senior Pilot, and Pilot. The Senior Pilot would assume navigation duties, while the Pilot would {{function as a}} systems engineer. The astronauts <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> {{a modified version of}} the Gemini spacesuit.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{simplified}} symbol {{which does not}} depict St. Andrew's image, the saltire or crux decussata, (from the Latin crux, 'cross', and decussis, 'having {{the shape of the}} Roman numeral X'), began in the late 14th century. In June 1385, the Parliament of Scotland decreed that Scottish soldiers serving in France <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> a white Saint Andrew's Cross, both in front and behind, for identification.|$|E
5|$|For her {{exemplary}} {{service to}} the Marine Corps, Reckless was awarded two Purple Hearts (for the wounds received during the Battle of Vegas), a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, a Presidential Unit Citation with bronze star, the National Defense Service Medal, a Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Korea Medal, a Navy Unit Commendation, and a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation. She <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> these awards on her horse blanket, plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his attention to detail in diet and fitness, he also afforded close scrutiny to his kit. 1950–51 he struck a boot sponsorship deal with the Co-op, though he instead began wearing a more lightweight pair of boots he had discovered on show at the World Cup – {{at the time they}} were not available to buy in England. He <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> the customized boots until his retirement, though they were so delicate that he got through countless pairs every season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders were {{reluctant}} to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested that the race continue, with a British rider, whose team <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Barry Hoban won the stage, This was later a subject of argument as it was widely believed that the race winner should have been Denson, Simpson's other teammate and close friend.|$|E
5|$|U-156 {{received}} a radio message on 17 September 1942 indicating that Werner Hartenstein {{had become the}} 63rd member of the U-boat service and the 125th of the Kriegsmarine to be awarded Germany's highest military honour, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Hartenstein issued a bottle of beer to {{each member of the}} crew and held a speech honouring the achievements of everyone on board, and telling them that he <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> the decoration in their name.|$|E
50|$|McMahon {{occasionally}} <b>would</b> play <b>wearing</b> gloves, {{and urged}} former NFL quarterback David Carr to also wear gloves.|$|R

25|$|Outside, button up boots <b>would</b> {{have been}} <b>worn</b> or lace up boots also shoes with spats <b>would</b> have been <b>worn</b> {{in the winter}} spats worn over shoes created the look of wearing a long boot.|$|R
5|$|Laffoon {{knew the}} primary bill would be widely {{supported}} in the General Assembly, since both legislators and their constituents {{had grown to}} distrust party nominating conventions. Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a runoff election would be held between the top two candidates in the first round. Historian Lowell H. Harrison maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea, and that he hoped a two-stage primary <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> Beckham down. Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate—citing his own ill health {{and that of his}} son—before the special session convened. Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.|$|E
5|$|Operation Goodwood was {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} British carrier air raids conducted against the German battleship Tirpitz at her anchorage in Kaafjord, Norway, during late August 1944. It formed the last of several major attacks made by the Home Fleet during 1944 which sought to eliminate the potential threat Tirpitz posed to Allied shipping by badly damaging or sinking the warship. While each of the previous raids on Kaafjord conducted by Fleet Air Arm aircraft had involved only a single air strike, Operation Goodwood involved repeated attacks over a week. The Royal Navy hoped that these raids <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> down the formidable German defences.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she <b>would</b> <b>wear,</b> and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends {{let her know that}} he hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
50|$|Anderson <b>would</b> again <b>wear</b> {{the yellow}} jersey {{in the next}} year, when he also won the young rider classification.|$|R
25|$|Brussel {{additionally}} {{predicted to}} his visitors {{that when the}} bomber was caught, he <b>would</b> be <b>wearing</b> a double-breasted suit, buttoned.|$|R
50|$|The league {{mandated}} that road teams <b>would</b> now <b>wear</b> a basic white uniform, while home teams will wear coloured uniforms.|$|R
5|$|The {{calls of}} {{throwing}} so infuriated Marsh {{that at the}} end of the day's play, he announced that he <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> splints when he was bowling the next day. Marsh took this action to ensure that his elbow was kept straight and to demonstrate that he could bowl fast without throwing. Marsh had previously performed such an exhibition to ground members and the requisite splints and bandages were acquired from the nearby St. Vincent's Hospital, in order to bind his bowling arm. The hospital provided a medical certificate stating that Marsh could not move his elbow while encased in the splints. Marsh was proactive in attempting to defend the legitimacy of his bowling action. Marsh's intentions were published in the Sydney Morning Herald and Curran was made aware that Marsh would seek to challenge him.|$|E
5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif was white and made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E

50|$|The court dress has {{traditionally}} been a white evening dress, but shades of ivory and pink were acceptable. The white dress featured short sleeves and white gloves, a veil attached to the hair with three white ostrich feathers, and a train, which the débutante would hold on her arm until {{she was ready to}} be presented. Débutantes <b>would</b> also <b>wear</b> pearls but many <b>would</b> also <b>wear</b> jewellery that belonged to the family.|$|R
50|$|During tricana's heyday, a tricana girl <b>would</b> {{typically}} <b>wear</b> a shawl, an apron, a skirt, {{a handkerchief}} and glossy high-heeled slippers.|$|R
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a hydropneumatic suspension system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, {{and they had no}} idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the attack}} on 17 July, the British learned from intercepted German radio {{transmissions}} and reports provided by Secret Intelligence Service agents that Tirpitz had not suffered any significant damage. Admiral Moore blamed the failure of Operation Mascot on the inexperience of the aircrew involved in the attack, and criticised the strike leader for not selecting alternative targets after {{it became clear that}} Tirpitz could not be accurately bombed. Moore also judged that further attacks on Kaafjord using Barracudas would be futile, as the dive bombers' slow speed gave the Germans enough time to cover Tirpitz with smoke between the time raids were detected and their arrival over the target area. The Admiralty was hopeful that a strategy of repeatedly striking Kaafjord over a 48-hour period <b>would</b> <b>wear</b> down the defences, and Moore agreed to attempt another attack. Consideration was also given to flying fast and long-ranged de Havilland Mosquito bombers off the carriers in an attempt to achieve surprise, but none of these land-based aircraft could be spared from supporting the Allied bombing of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Bonnets {{were being}} {{replaced}} by hats {{by the end of}} the Victorian era so girls <b>would</b> have <b>worn</b> a hat when out.|$|R
25|$|Mieszko <b>would</b> never <b>wear</b> his outdoor garment in a {{house where}} Odo was present, or remain seated after Odo had gotten up.|$|R
5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June that they <b>would</b> be <b>wearing</b> their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis {{noted that it}} was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when they <b>would</b> be <b>wearing</b> their green jerseys.|$|R
