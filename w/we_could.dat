5|$|Basil was no {{more than}} the name of {{bachelor}} uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti or pick a globe artichoke to pieces.... Then came Elizabeth David like sunshine, writing with brief elegance about good food, that is, about food well contrived, well cooked. She made us understand that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do better with what we had.|$|E
5|$|I needed {{somebody}} who could perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were shooting in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E

5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} account available, written by Melchior Estácio do Amaral in 1604: the sea was purple with blood dripping from the scuppers, the decks cluttered with {{the dead and the}} fire raging {{in some parts of the}} ships, and the air so filled with smoke that, not only <b>we</b> <b>could</b> sometimes not see each other but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not recognize each other.|$|E
25|$|Believer {{was formed}} in Colebrook, Pennsylvania in 1986 by drummer Joey Daub and vocalist-guitarist Kurt Bachman. The band was joined by Howe Kraft (bass) and David Baddorf (guitar). They began playing melodic metal and {{released}} the cassette The Return in 1987. Later, Believer changed its style to thrash metal, as the band said: ”We realized that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> write thrash better than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> write anything else”.|$|E

6000|$|When we saw this, <b>we</b> hesitated. <b>Could</b> <b>we</b> ask a man {{who owned}} books, and could {{probably}} read, to play second fiddle {{to a woman who}} could not speak the English language, and who for years, perhaps, had devoted the energies of her soul to the sale of pepper-pods? ...|$|R
25|$|Of course, if a {{different}} set of axioms were chosen for logic, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> modify ours accordingly.|$|E
25|$|It {{is obvious}} that if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find {{characters}} or signs suited for expressing all our thoughts as clearly and as exactly as arithmetic expresses numbers or geometry expresses lines, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do in all matters insofar as {{they are subject to}} reasoning all that we can do in arithmetic and geometry. For all investigations which depend on reasoning would be carried out by transposing these characters and by a species of calculus.|$|E

25|$|In other words, don't {{spend the}} money unless you're sure you're {{going to have the}} legal {{environment}} to go forward. Don't {{spend the money}} unless you're sure you're going to have the permit. No, I can't tell you that I'm going to have that permit until June, but we need to plan like we're going to have that permit in June. And so probably the biggest lesson is to make sure <b>we</b> <b>could</b> smooth out the on/off switches wherever <b>we</b> <b>could</b> and take control of our own destiny.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> {{associate}} an algebra to our geometry using a Cartesian {{coordinate system}} made of two lines, and represent points of our plane by vectors. Finally we can write these vectors as complex numbers.|$|E

[...] "There are sixteen of us and there are in all {{eighteen}} horses, for I and Farquharson have two each; but there are eight women and fourteen children; so all the horses would have to carry double. <b>We</b> certainly <b>could</b> not hope to escape from them with our horses so laden; and if {{they came up with}} us, what fighting <b>could</b> <b>we</b> do with women behind our saddles?

25|$|There {{is nothing}} magical about {{the choice of}} symbols for the values of Boolean algebra. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> rename 0 and 1 to say α and β, {{and as long as}} we did so {{consistently}} throughout it would still be Boolean algebra, albeit with some obvious cosmetic differences.|$|E
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> {{remove the}} points where μ is zero, {{and take the}} support to be the {{remainder}} X\{x∈X|μ({x})=0}. This might work for the Dirac measure δ'p, but it would definitely not work for λ: since the Lebesgue measure of any singleton is zero, this definition would give λ empty support.|$|E
25|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{collapse}} {{the sets}} into an auxiliary point α, and a recurrent Harris chain {{can be modified}} to contain α. Lastly, the collection of Harris chains is a comfortable level of generality, which is broad enough to contain {{a large number of}} interesting examples, yet restrictive enough to allow for a rich theory.|$|E
