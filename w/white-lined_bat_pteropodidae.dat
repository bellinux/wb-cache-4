5000|$|The lesser <b>white-lined</b> <b>bat</b> feeds {{primarily}} on aerial insects {{in the order}} Hymenoptera. This includes flying ants and formicids. The bats forage in areas under tree canopies and use echolocation to hunt the flying insects. The bats don't change their calling frequency or their mouth size when using echolocation while hunting. When roosting, the bats usually form small groups anywhere from 2 to a 9. Additionally, the bats {{are thought to be}} monogamous which is rare for most mammals. [...] Females typically only produce one or two young per year. The young can't fly for about the first 12 days after birth. These young are taken care of by the female for up to 18 months.

Here, we a) review extensively what is known about geographic variation of acoustic signals in terrestrial mammals, using common terminology adopted from linguistics to define different forms of variation (i. e. accents and dialects), and b) examine which factors may determine this variation (i. e. genetic, environmental and/or social). Heretofore, terminology has been used inconsistently within and across taxa, and geographic variation among terrestrial mammals has never been defined as in human speech. Our results show that accents, phonologically different varieties, occur widely in terrestrial mammals. Conversely, dialects, lexically and phonologically different varieties, have only been documented thus far in great <b>white-lined</b> <b>bats,</b> red deer, chimpanzees and orangutans.

To test whether the Slc 2 a 4 gene has undergone adaptive evolution in bats with carbohydrate-rich diets in relation to their insect-eating sister taxa, we sequenced the coding region of the Slc 2 a 4 gene in a number of bat species, including four Old World fruit <b>bats</b> (<b>Pteropodidae)</b> and three New World fruit bats (Phyllostomidae). Our molecular evolutionary analyses revealed evidence that Slc 2 a 4 has undergone a change in selection pressure in Old World fruit bats with 11 amino acid substitutions detected on the ancestral branch, whereas, no positive selection was detected in the New World fruit bats.

40|$|Frugivorous and {{nectarivorous}} bats fuel their metabolism {{mostly by}} using carbohydrates and allocate the restricted amounts of ingested proteins mainly for anabolic protein syntheses {{rather than for}} catabolic energy production. Thus, {{it is possible that}} genes involved in protein (amino acid) catabolism may have undergone relaxed evolution in these fruit- and nectar-eating bats. The tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT, encoded by the Tat gene) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. To test whether the Tat gene has undergone relaxed evolution in the fruit- and nectar-eating bats, we obtained the Tat coding region from 20 bat species including four Old World fruit <b>bats</b> (<b>Pteropodidae)</b> and two New World fruit bats (Phyllostomidae). Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed a gene tree in which all echolocating bats (including the New World fruit bats) formed a monophyletic group. The phylogenetic conflict appears to stem from accelerated TAT protein sequence evolution in the Old World fruit bats. Our molecular evolutionary analyses confirmed a change in the selection pressure acting on Tat, which was likely caused by a relaxation of the evolutionary constraints on the Tat gene in the Old World fruit bats. Hepatic TAT activity assays showed that TAT activities in species of the Old World fruit bats are significantly lower than those of insectivorous bats and omnivorous mice, which was not caused by a change in TAT protein levels in the liver.

Several reports of pteropodid bats consuming insects in captivity exist, and insects have been found in the faeces and digestive tracts of some wild pteropodid bats, although their ingestion was initially thought to be accidental. However, more recent observations of large insects in faeces of wild bats, coupled with two reports (one anecdotal) of observed intentional insectivory in the wild, suggest that intentional insectivory by pteropodid bats may be more common than previously thought. In addition, reports of intentional insectivory to date have been of bats catching insects from a stationary position, and a large question still remains as to the ability of pteropodid bats to catch insects in flight without the use of laryngeal echolocation. Here, we report on an observation of intentional insectivory by a group of grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) actively preying on, and consuming, numerous (> 20) cicadas (Psaltoda sp.) by aerial hunting in southeastern Australia.

Bats (Chiroptera) represent one of the most fascinating mammal groups for molecular evolutionary studies of the Myo 6 gene.

Females had larger home ranges and core foraging areas and foraged over longer distances (average 28. 1 km; median 26. 7 km) than males (average 15. 4 km; median 9. 5 km). Because the study was conducted during the gestation period, the increased energy requirements of females may explain their greater mean foraging area. Compositional analysis revealed that bats show strong preferences for overgrown sisal (Agave sisalana) plantations (a mix of shrub, trees and sisal plants) and remnant riverside forest patches. Sisal nectar and pollen were abundant food sources during the tracking period and this probably contributed to the selective use of overgrown sisal plantations.

Enzymatic antioxidants and low molecular weight antioxidants (LMWAs) constitute major parts of the antioxidant systems. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) -like 2 (Nrf 2, encoded by the Nrf 2 gene) is a central transcriptional regulator, regulating transcription, of many antioxidant enzymes. Frugivorous bats eat large amounts of fruits that contain high levels of LMWAs such as vitamin C, thus, a reliance on LMWAs might greatly {{reduce the need for}} antioxidant enzymes in comparison to insectivorous bats. Therefore, it is possible that frugivorous bats have a reduced need for Nrf 2 function due to their substantial intake of diet-antioxidants. To test whether the Nrf 2 gene has undergone relaxed evolution in fruit-eating bats, we obtained Nrf 2 sequences from 16 species of bats, including four Old World fruit <b>bats</b> (<b>Pteropodidae)</b> and one New World fruit bat (Phyllostomidae). Our molecular evolutionary analyses revealed changes in the selection pressure acting on Nrf 2 gene and identified seven specific amino acid substitutions that occurred on the ancestral lineage leading to Old World fruit bats. Biochemical experiments were conducted to examine Nrf 2 in Old World fruit bats and showed that the amount of catalase, which is regulated by Nrf 2, was significantly lower in the brain, heart and liver of Old World fruit bats despite higher levels of Nrf 2 protein in Old World fruit bats. Computational predictions suggest that three of these seven amino acid replacements might be deleterious to Nrf 2 function. Therefore, the results suggest that Nrf 2 gene might have experienced relaxed constraint in Old World fruit bats, however, we cannot rule out the possibility of positive selection.

Yet pollinators in the Old World tropics are relatively understudied, particularly paleotropical nectarivorous <b>bats</b> (<b>Pteropodidae),</b> and much is unknown about their interactions with night-blooming plant species. To better understand these bat-plant pollination interactions, I conducted fieldwork in southern Thailand {{for a total of}} 20 months, spread across three years. I examined the foraging times of pteropodid bat species (Chapter 1), and found that strictly nectarivorous species foraged earlier, and for a shorter duration, than primarily frugivorous species. I also studied year-long foraging patterns of pteropodid bats to determine how different species track floral resources across seasons (Chapter 2). Larger species capable of flying long distances switched diets seasonally to forage on the most abundant floral species, while smaller species foraged throughout the year on nearby plant species that were low-rewarding but highly reliable. To determine which pteropodid species are potentially important pollinators, I quantified the frequency and effectiveness of their visits to six common bat-pollinated plant taxa for an entire year (Chapter 3). The three strictly nectarivorous species were responsible for almost all pollination, but pollinator importance of each bat species varied across plant species. I further examined the long-term reliability of these pollinators (Chapter 4), and found that pollinator importance values were consistent across the three study years. Lastly, I explored mechanisms that reduce interspecific pollen transfer among bat-pollinated plants, despite having shared pollinators. Using a flight cage experiment, I demonstrated that these plant species deposit pollen on different areas of the bat’s body (mechanical partitioning), resulting in greater pollen transfer between conspecific flowers than heterospecific flowers (Chapter 5). Additionally, while I observed ecological and phenological overlap among flowering plant species, pollinators exhibited high floral constancy within a night, resulting in strong ethological separation (Chapter 6). Collectively, these findings illustrate the importance of understudied Old World bat pollinators within a mixed agricultural-forest system, and their strong, interdependent interactions with bat-pollinated plant species within a night, across seasons, and across years...|$|R

Results: Our phylogenetic analysis identified nine clusters of nycteribiid bat flies on Madagascar and the neighbouring Comoros Archipelago. Bat flies sampled from frugivorous bats {{of the family}} Pteropodidae are monoxenous: Eucampsipoda madagascariensis, E. theodori and Cyclopodia dubia appear wholly restricted to Rousettus madagascariensis, R. obliviosus and Eidolon dupreanum, respectively. Two different host preference patterns occurred in nycteribiids infecting insectivorous bats. Flies parasitizing bats of the genera Miniopterus (Miniopteridae) and Myotis (Vespertilionidae), namely Penicillidia leptothrinax, Penicillidia sp. and Nycteribia stylidiopsis, are polyxenous and showed little host preference, while those parasitizing the genera Pipistrellus and Scotophilus (both Vespertilionidae) and referable to Basilia spp., are monoxenous. Lastly, the inferred Bayesian phylogeny revealed that the genus Basilia, as currently configured, is paraphyletic. Conclusion: This study provides new {{information on}} the differentiation of nycteribiid taxa, including undescribed species. Host preference is either strict as exemplified by flies parasitizing fruit bats, or more relaxed as found on some insectivorous bat species, possibly because of roost site sharing. Detailed taxonomic work is needed to address three undescribed nycteribiid taxa found on Pipistrellus and Scotophilus, tentatively allocated to the genus Basilia, but possibly warranting different generic allocation...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a population-genetic study of the short-nosed fruit <b>bat,</b> Cynopterus sphinx (<b>Pteropodidae).</b> The purpose of our study was to assess the {{relative}} importance of drift, gene flow, and spatially varying selection in shaping patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation across a latitudinal climatic gradient in peninsular India. At a microgeographic scale, polygynous mating resulted in a substantial reduction of effective population size. However, at a macrogeographic scale, rates of migration were sufficiently high to prevent a pronounced degree of stochastic differentiation via drift. Spatial analysis of genetic and phenotypic differentiation revealed that clinal variation in body size of C. sphinx cannot be explained by a neutral model of isolation by distance. The geographic patterning of morphometric variation is most likely attributable to spatially varying selection and/or the direct influence of latitudinally ordered environmental effects. The combined analysis of genetic and phenotypic variation indicates that recognized subspecies of C. sphinx in peninsular India represent arbitrary subdivisions of a continuous spectrum of clinal size variation...|$|R
