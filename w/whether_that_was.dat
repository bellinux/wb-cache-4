5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the local water table, but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number of abandoned resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former Vauclusian spring, the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E

His grandfather was as sailor and diver known as Martín; it is not clear <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a first or last name, and whether in his generation Pinzón was a surname or an epithet. His father was a sailor named Martín Pinzón; his mother was named Mayor Vicente.|$|E
25|$|Small was {{involved}} {{in one of the}} most controversial incidents in early cricket history when Hambledon played Chertsey at Laleham Burway on 23 & 24 September 1771. Hambledon won the match by 1 wicket. It was in this game that Chertsey's Thomas White used a bat that was as wide as the wicket, possibly in an attempt to force an issue about the width of the new straight bats that had recently replaced the old curved sticks. <b>Whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> White's intention is unclear but his action ensured that a new rule was passed which limited the width to 4.25inches. This rule supported a written motion presented by Hambledon bowler Thomas Brett that was counter-signed by club captain Richard Nyren and senior batsman Small. The original of Brett's memorandum, bearing Small's signature, is maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club in its museum at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|When Antony {{attempted}} {{to take control}} of Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy) by force and displace Decimus Brutus, the Senate led by Cicero called on Lepidus to support Brutus – one of Caesar's killers. Lepidus prevaricated, recommending negotiation with Antony. After Antony's defeat at the Battle of Mutina, the Senate sent word that Lepidus' troops were no longer needed. Antony, however, marched towards Lepidus's province with his remaining forces. Lepidus continued to assure the Senate of his loyalty, but engaged in negotiations with Antony. When the two armies met, large portions of Lepidus's forces joined up with Antony. Lepidus negotiated an agreement with him, while claiming to the Senate that he had no choice. It is unclear whether Lepidus' troops forced him to join with Antony, <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> always Lepidus's plan, or whether he arranged matters to gauge the situation and make the best deal.|$|E

Wilson called the claim that sociobiology is biological determinism [...] "academic vigilantism" [...] and the Sociobiology Study Group response [...] "a largely ideological argument".|$|E

Chen said she pursued the doctorate degree because she did not receive any job offers and she questioned <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> due to her being [...] "young, a woman, Asian, or the combination of all three." ...|$|E

500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... I just felt like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. <b>Whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> right or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E
500|$|Monteux {{regularly}} introduced new compositions in Boston, often {{works by}} American, English and French composers. [...] He {{was proud of}} the number of novelties presented in his years at Boston, and expressed pleasure that his successors continued the practice. He was dismayed when it was announced that his contract would not be renewed after 1924. The official explanation was that the orchestra's policy had always been to appoint conductors for no more than five years. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> genuinely the reason. One suggested possibility is that the conductor chosen to replace him, Serge Koussevitzky, was thought more charismatic, with greater box-office appeal. Another is that the primmer members of Boston society disapproved of Monteux's morals: he and his second wife had gradually drifted apart and by 1924 he was living with Doris Hodgkins, an American divorcée, and her two children. They were unable to marry until 1928, when Germaine Monteux finally agreed to a divorce.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process {{to go to the bathroom}} and not pass by Stanley. The producers debated <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature in the early years of the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E

2500|$|The civil {{division}} of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales later found in 1982 that the British parliament could have legislated for a Dominion simply by including in any new law a clause claiming the Dominion cabinet had requested and approved of the act, <b>whether</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> true or not. Further, the British parliament was not obliged to fulfil a Dominion's request for legislative change. Regardless, in 1935 the British parliament refused to consider {{the result of the}} Western Australian secession referendum of 1933 without the approval of the Australian federal parliament. In 1937, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa ruled unanimously that a repeal of the Statute of Westminster in the United Kingdom would have no effect in South Africa, stating: [...] "We cannot take this argument seriously. Freedom once conferred cannot be revoked." [...] Others in Canada upheld the same position.|$|E
