500|$|A {{month before}} the filming of the final episode, Aniston said that with each episode it got [...] "harder just to read the lines." [...] She {{explained}} that the cast was [...] "all just nerves and raw emotions [...] No one knows how to feel. <b>We</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to be sedated on the last night." [...] The producers promised a tearful ending, and the cast admitted their crying was not faked when they filmed their scenes. LeBlanc revealed it had been {{too much for him}} {{and the rest of the}} cast; he said Kudrow started crying first, and when he looked at Aniston and Cox they also appeared emotional. Schwimmer, who LeBlanc thought was the [...] "consummate professional", was also upset, so LeBlanc [...] "just lost it." [...] Maggie Wheeler, who was Chandler's [...] "on and off" [...] girlfriend Janice, told People, [...] "the entire cast had to go back and have their makeup redone before starting," [...] and that Perry broke the tension by saying, [...] "Somebody is gonna get fired." [...] Perry told the New York Daily News that he did not cry, [...] "but I felt like I was about to for like seven hours." ...|$|E

"It is not {{possible}} to be precise {{about the size of the}} Egyptian chariot force at Kadesh though it could not have numbered less than 2,000 vehicles spread though the corps of Amun, P'Re, Ptah and Sutekh, assuming that approx. 500 machines were allocated to each corps. To this <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> to add those of the Ne'arin, for if they were not native Egyptian troops their number may not have been formed from chariots detached from the army corps." ...|$|E

2500|$|Drexler {{argues that}} <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> {{to wait until}} our {{conventional}} nanotechnology improves before solving these issues: [...] "Molecular manufacturing will result {{from a series of}} advances in molecular machine systems, much as the first Moon landing resulted from a series of advances in liquid-fuel rocket systems. We are now in a position like that of the British Interplanetary Society of the 1930s which described how multistage liquid-fueled rockets could reach the Moon and pointed to early rockets as illustrations of the basic principle." [...] However, Freitas and Merkle argue [...] that a focused effort to achieve diamond mechanosynthesis (DMS) can begin now, using existing technology, and might achieve success in less than a decade if their [...] "direct-to-DMS approach is pursued rather than a more circuitous development approach that seeks to implement less efficacious nondiamondoid molecular manufacturing technologies before progressing to diamondoid".|$|E
2500|$|As {{the novel}} became popular, the reviews became {{positive}}; Crawford Woods, also in The New York Times, wrote a positive review countering Lehmann-Haupt's negative review: {{the novel is}} [...] "a custom-crafted study of paranoia, a spew from the 1960s and — in all its hysteria, insolence, insult and rot — a desperate and important book, a wired nightmare, the funniest piece of American prose"; and [...] "this book is such a mind storm that <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>need</b> {{a little time to}} know that it is also literature[...] [...] it unfolds a parable of the nineteen-sixties {{to those of us who}} lived in them in a mood — perhaps more melodramatic than astute — of social strife, surreal politics and the chemical feast."
