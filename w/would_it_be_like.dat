My husband and I got involved and were really moved and horrified. As I was writing the song I was putting myself in that place – what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because you're afraid of what would happen?" ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|A key to Lord's {{method is}} his {{technique}} of adopting an unconventional {{approach to the}} chronology of the event, [...] " [...] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable, the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex, and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away." [...] In short it is [...] "a modernist narrative [...] around a modernist event." [...] Reviewers highlighted {{the way in which}} Lord depicted the human side of the Titanic story, which The New York Times called [...] "the core of Mr. Lord's account, and explains its fascination, a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself." [...] While the [...] "legendary acts of gallantry" [...] stood out, the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation. As Newsweek put it, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be aboard a sinking ocean liner?" ...|$|E

60|$|This, {{she took}} it, {{was a fair}} sample of what she might expect after marriage.

40|$|It seems {{natural to}} choose whether {{to have a}} child by {{reflecting}} on what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to actually have a child. I argue that this natural approach fails. If you choose to become a parent, and your choice is based on projections about what you think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for you {{to have a child}}, your choice is not rational. If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> for you to have a child, your choice is not rational. This suggests we should reject our ordinary conception of how to make this life-changing decision, and raises general questions about how to rationally approach important life choices...|$|R

60|$|Carley took to {{the trail}} below where West Fork emptied its golden-green waters into Oak Creek. The red walls seemed to dream and wait under the blaze of the sun; the heat lay like a blanket over the still foliage; the birds were quiet; only the murmuring stream broke {{the silence of the}} canyon. Never had Carley felt more the {{isolation}} and solitude of Oak Creek Canyon. Far indeed from the madding crowd! Only Carley's stubbornness kept her from acknowledging the sense of peace that enveloped her--that and the consciousness of her own discontent. What <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to come to this canyon--to give up to its enchantments? That, like many another disturbing thought, had to go unanswered, to be driven into the closed chambers of Carley's mind, there to germinate subconsciously, and stalk forth some day to overwhelm her.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{as if it}} {{were some}} sort of fever to which you might {{conclude}} they were immune when they hadn't taken it for two years," [...] sighed Rilla. [...] "The danger is just as great and just as real as it was the first day they went into the trenches. I know this, and it tortures me every day. And yet I can't help hoping that since they've come this far unhurt they'll come through. Oh, Miss Oliver, what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> not to {{wake up in the morning}} feeling afraid of the news the day would bring? I can't picture such a state of things somehow. And two years ago this morning I woke wondering what delightful gift the new day would give me. These are the two years I thought would be filled with fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hidden somewhere amidst those bristling {{miles of}} masonry to the northward {{of the towers}} was her future home. Her mind dwelt upon it now, for the first time, and tried to {{construct}} it. Once she had spoken to Howard of it, but he had smiled and avoided discussion. What <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to have a house of one's own in New York? A house on Fifth Avenue, as her girl friends had said when they laughingly congratulated her and begged her to remember that they came occasionally to New York. Those of us who, like Honora, believe in Providence, do not trouble ourselves with mere matters of dollars and cents. This morning, however, the huge material towers which she gazed upon seemed stronger than Providence, and {{she thought of her}} husband. Was his fibre sufficiently tough to become eventually the captain of one of those fortresses, to compete with the Maitlands and the Wings, and others she knew by name, calmly and efficiently intrenched there? ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{described}} the process, but she--scarcely listened. She was striving to adjust {{herself to the}} elements of a new and revolutionary experience; to the waiters who came and went, softly, deferentially putting hot plates before her, helping her to strange and delicious things; a creamy soup, a fish with a yellow sauce whose ingredients were artfully disguised, a breast of guinea fowl, a salad, an ice, and a small cup of coffee. Instincts and tastes hitherto unsuspected and ungratified were aroused in her. What <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> always to be daintily served, to eat one's meals in this leisurely and luxurious manner? As her physical hunger was satisfied by the dainty food, even as her starved senses drank in the caressing warmth and harmony of the room, the gleaming fire, the heavy scent of the flowers, the rose glow of the lights in contrast to the storm without,--so the storm flinging itself against the windows, powerless to reach her, seemed to typify a former existence of cold, black mornings and factory bells and harsh sirens, of toil and limitations. Had her existence been like that? or was it a dream, a nightmare from which she had awakened at last? From time to time, deep within her, she felt persisting a conviction that that was reality, this illusion, but she fought it down. She wanted--oh, how she wanted to believe in the illusion! ...|$|E
6000|$|What was she feeling? Short, quick stabs of self-consciousness {{as to how}} she was looking; a sort of stunned {{excitement}} due {{to sheer}} noise {{and the number of}} things offered to her to eat and drink; keen pleasure in the consciousness that Colonel Martlett and Sir John Fanfar and other men, especially that nice one with the straggly moustache who looked as if he were going to bite, glanced at her when they saw she wasn't looking. If only she had been quite certain that it was not because they thought her too young to be there! She felt a sort of continual exhilaration, that this was the great world--the world where important things were said and done, together with an intense listening expectancy, and a sense most unexpected and almost frightening, that nothing important was being said or would be done. But this she knew to be impudent. On Sunday evenings at home people talked about a future existence, about Nietzsche, Tolstoy, Chinese pictures, post-impressionism, and would suddenly grow hot and furious about peace, and Strauss, justice, marriage, and De Maupassant, and whether people were losing their souls through materialism, and sometimes one of them would get up and walk about the room. But to-night the only words she could catch were the names of two politicians whom nobody seemed to approve of, except that nice one who was going to bite. Once very timidly she asked Colonel Martlett whether he liked Strauss, and was puzzled by his answer: [...] "Rather; those 'Tales of Hoffmann' are rippin', don't you think? You go to the opera much?" [...] She could not, of course, know that the thought which instantly rose within her was doing the governing classes a grave injustice--almost all of whom save Colonel Martlett knew that the 'Tales of Hoffmann' were by one Offenbach. But beyond all things she felt she would never, never learn to talk as they were all talking--so quickly, so continuously, so without caring whether everybody or only the person they were talking to heard what they said. She had always felt that what you said was only meant for the person you said it to, but here in the great world she must evidently not say anything that was not meant for everybody, and she felt terribly that she could not think of anything of that sort to say. And suddenly she began to want to be alone. That, however, was surely wicked and wasteful, when she ought to be learning such a tremendous lot; and yet, what was there to learn? And listening just sufficiently to Colonel Martlett, who was telling her how great a man he thought a certain general, she looked almost despairingly at the one who was going to bite. He was quite silent at that moment, gazing at his plate, which was strangely empty. And Nedda thought: 'He has jolly wrinkles about his eyes, only they might be heart disease; and I like the color of his face, so nice and yellow, only that might be liver. But I DO like him--I wish I'd been sitting next to him; he looks real.' From that thought, of the reality of a man whose name she did not know, she passed suddenly into the feeling that nothing else of this about her was real at all, neither the talk nor the faces, not even the things she was eating. It was all a queer, buzzing dream. Nor did that sensation of unreality cease when her aunt began collecting her gloves, and they trooped forth to the drawing-room. There, seated between Mrs. Sleesor and Lady Britto, with Lady Malloring opposite, and Miss Bawtrey leaning over the piano toward them, she pinched herself {{to get rid of the}} feeling that, when all these were out of sight of each other, they would become silent and have on their lips a little, bitter smile. <b>Would</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> that up in their bedrooms, or would it only be on her (Nedda's) own lips that this little smile would come? It was a question she could not answer; nor could she very well ask it of any of these ladies. She looked them over as they sat there talking and felt very lonely. And suddenly her eyes fell on her grandmother. Frances Freeland was seated halfway down the long room in a sandalwood chair, somewhat insulated by a surrounding sea of polished floor. She sat with a smile on her lips, quite still, save for the continual movement of her white hands on her black lap. To her gray hair some lace of Chantilly was pinned with a little diamond brooch, and hung behind her delicate but rather long ears. And from her shoulders was depended a silvery garment, of stuff that looked like the mail shirt of a fairy, reaching the ground on either side. A tacit agreement had evidently been come to, that she was incapable of discussing 'the Land' or those other subjects such as the French murder, the Russian opera, the Chinese pictures, and the doings of one, L---- , whose fate was just then in the air, so that she sat alone.|$|E
