Presently, the success rate for grafting is only 30–40%, and even with successful grafts {{there is a tendency}} for the union to fail under stress.

Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane to depressurize. The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane {{makes it to the}} terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is considered}} to be the central control for reproduction due to its role in hormone regulation. Hence, factors that determine when a seasonal breeder <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for mating affect this tissue. This is achieved specificlly through changes in the production of the hormone GnRH. GnRH in turn transits to the pituitary where it promotes the secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH, both pituitary hormones critical for reproductive function and behavior, into the bloodstream. Changes in gonadotropin secretion initiate the end of anestrus in females.|$|E

Aubrey plans how to finish the battle, once the remaining French ships <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to sail, and his ships are ready to fight again, when they reach Mauritius. Keating is equally ready. The Emma nears the Boadicea, with many other British sails in view. Tom Pullings comes aboard with the Gazette announcing {{the birth of a}} son to Sophia. Aubrey is ecstatic at the news. Then he opens Admiral Bertie's letter ordering him to join the fleet at Rodriguez, where he will be on HMS Illustrious, and the Army led by General Abercrombie. The final invasion, based on Aubrey and Keating's original plan, is almost without bloodshed. The French capitulate after being given honourable terms.|$|E
25|$|The April 2016 Report {{from the}} U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) {{described}} Boeing’s test {{schedule for the}} KC-46 program as “optimistic” and projects Boeing will need an additional four months beyond the August 2017 target to deliver 18 full-up tankers due to testing and parts qualification issues. The report notes that operational testing will not now begin until May 2017 {{and will not be}} completed until two months after the first tranche of 18 aircraft are delivered, risking late discoveries of problems. The GAO also noted that Boeing has not obtained Federal Aviation Administration's approval for two key aerial refueling systems - the centerline drogue system and the wing aerial refueling pods, which were built without following FAA processes. Boeing now projects these components <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for the FAA to certify by July 2017 — over three years late. The 18 aircraft were meant to include the four developmental aircraft, brought up to an operational standard, plus the first 14 low-rate production (LRP) examples. Instead, 16 of the 18 will be production line examples; because the aircraft will be delivered before operational testing is complete, Boeing will be responsible for any late design fixes.|$|E
