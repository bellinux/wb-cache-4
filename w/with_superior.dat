5|$|Once a recruit was {{accepted}} he was 'marked' on the arm, presumably a tattoo or brand, to facilitate recognition if {{he attempted to}} desert. The recruit was then issued with an identification disk (which was worn around the neck) and a certificate of enlistment (probatoria). He was then assigned to a unit. A law of 375 required those <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> fitness to be assigned to the comitatenses. In the 4th century, the minimum length of service was 20 years (24 years in some limitanei units).

40|$|The author proposes {{the idea}} that {{conflict}} <b>with</b> <b>superiors</b> has a barrier effect in the positive relationship between employee empowerment and organizational commitment. <b>Superiors</b> <b>with</b> higher authority rankings set and pursue organizational goals and values to which employees with lower authority rankings are expected to become committed. Conflicts <b>with</b> those <b>superiors</b> may hinder empowered employees to develop or maintain high levels of organizational commitment. A questionnaire survey among 91 secondary school teachers in The Netherlands provides empirical support for this suggestion. The moderator effect of conflict <b>with</b> <b>superiors</b> that was proposed and {{found in this study}} suggests that psychological empowerment in the workplace interacts with other employee experiences in its effects on an employee's commitment to the organization...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between career strategies and career success. The three dimensions that measured career strategies were enhancing promotability, strengthening external contacts, and improving image <b>with</b> <b>superiors.</b> Meanwhile, the dimension that measured career success was subjective career success. Data were gathered through questionnaires administered to employees at a manufacturing organisation (n= 185). Correlation and regression analyses were used {{to examine the relationship between}} career strategies and career success. The results indicated that there were no relationship between career strategies and career success. Only two of the career strategy dimensions were positively correlated with career success, namely strengthening external contacts and improving image <b>with</b> <b>superiors.</b> The multi-regression results suggested that improving image <b>with</b> <b>superiors</b> was the most important factor in influencing individual’s career success.

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{investigated}} relationships among self-management skills, communication <b>with</b> <b>superiors,</b> and {{the mental health}} of employees in a Japanese worksite. The subjects were manufacturing workers in a medium-sized company in Kyushu. In 1999, we mailed a selfadministrated questionnaire which included questions on age, gender, job rank, communication <b>with</b> <b>superiors,</b> a General Self-Efficacy Scale, a Self-Management Skill Scale, and the Japanese version of the 12 -item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Eighty percent of the subjects returned the questionnaire. Excluding senior managers and insufficient answers, the final response rate was fifty-five percent. The multiple regression analysis showed that job rank contributed significantly and positively and that age, communication <b>with</b> <b>superiors,</b> and self-management skills contributed significantly and negatively to the GHQ- 12. Our results implied that self-management skills might have the potential of affecting {{the mental health of}} Japanese employees...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> specifications. This idea was {{challenged}} by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France. Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World WarI.|$|E

The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996.

5|$|Metformin has acid {{dissociation}} constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make metformin a stronger base {{than most other}} basic drugs with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of -1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As {{a result of its}} low lipid solubility it requires the transporter SLC22A1 in order for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (-0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation with the aim of producing prodrugs <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> oral absorption than metformin.|$|E

Finally, the managers studied here, both Asian-American and Caucasian-American, used different influence tactics <b>with</b> <b>superiors</b> as compared to subordinates. The minor differences, with less than 3 % of the variance due to managers' different ethnic backgrounds, suggest that differences found in cross-cultural studies may not be generalizable to different ethnic groups within one country...|$|R
5|$|Other {{distinctive}} features are a relatively long, level croup, or {{top of the}} hindquarters, and naturally high tail carriage. The USEF breed standard requires Arabians have solid bone and standard correct equine conformation. Well-bred Arabians have a deep, well-angled hip and well laid-back shoulder. Within the breed, there are variations. Some individuals have wider, more powerfully muscled hindquarters suitable for intense bursts of activity in events such as reining, while others have longer, leaner muscling better suited for long stretches of flat work such as endurance riding or horse racing. Most have a compact body with a short back. Arabians usually have dense, strong bone, and good hoof walls. They are especially noted for their endurance, and {{the superiority of the}} breed in Endurance riding competition demonstrates that well-bred Arabians are strong, sound horses <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> stamina. At international FEI-sponsored endurance events, Arabians and half-Arabians are the dominant performers in distance competition.|$|E

A joint Italian-German general {{had been set up}} in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and the growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and instead concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. While many countries believed motorised troops to have been proven less effective than first thought, it was the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force that dominated German thought.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, {{two members}} of the Security Committee of the Czech Parliament visited Uherský Brod and talked to {{multiple}} witnesses. The MPs issued a report condemning handling of the situation by the police. Among other issues, the MPs criticized that policemen parked their cars and put bullet proof vests on within the shooting range of the attacker, initially failed to get information from the witnesses and only later during the intervention attempted to contact them, didn't cover the back exit and thus potentially allowed the perpetrator {{to get out of the}} object and jeopardize other people. The police even let a helicopter land within the shooting range of the attacker. According to MPs, the police left much to be desired in regards of communication and most importantly, they wrongly decided to believe the perpetrator's claim of having hostage even though the witnesses could have readily confirmed that everyone inside was most likely dead. The policemen didn't seal the vicinity of the attack until 1pm and used civilian phones in communication <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> officers instead of using either their own phones or radio transmitters. Minister of Interior Chovanec commented that the MPs failed to interview the policemen and thus didn't get all the relevant information.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 24 May, von Bock had thrown four divisions, of Reichenau's 6th Army, against the Belgian IV Corps position at the Kortrijk area of the Leie during the Battle of the Lys (1940). The Germans managed, against fierce resistance, to cross the river at night and force a one-mile penetration along a 13-mile front between Wervik and Kortrijk. The Germans, <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> numbers and {{in command of the}} air, had won the bridgehead. Nevertheless, the Belgians had inflicted many casualties and several tactical defeats on the Germans. The 1st, 3rd, 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions, acting as reinforcements, had counterattacked several times and managed to capture 200 German prisoners. Belgian artillery and infantry were then heavily attacked by the Luftwaffe, which forced their defeat. The Belgians blamed the French and British for not providing air cover. The German bridgehead dangerously exposed the eastern flank of the southward stretched BEF's 4th Infantry Division. Montgomery dispatched several units of the 3rd Infantry Division (including the heavy infantry of the 1st and 7th Middlesex battalions and the 99th Battery, 20th Anti-Tank Regiment), as an improvised defence.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} {{withdrawal}} of the RAAF's Vengeances from combat. Odgers judged that a key reason behind the decision was the poor performance of the Vengeance compared to other available aircraft in the region. USAAF units equipped <b>with</b> <b>superior</b> types were arriving in New Guinea during early 1944, and Kenney wanted to free up scarce space at forward airfields so that he could launch attacks on the important Japanese bases at Wewak and Hollandia; these targets were beyond the range of the Vengeance. In particular, No. 77 Wing was required to vacate Nadzab so that its airfields could accommodate a group of long-ranged Lockheed P-38 Lightning fighers. Odgers also argued that the Vengeances had proven to be mechanically unreliable, and had difficulty taking off while carrying a full bomb load: in practice it was found that they could carry only the same bomb load as Kittyhawk fighters. The Kittyhawks were also superior at strafing targets and {{did not need to be}} escorted. A 2008 paper written by staff of the RAAF's Air Power Development Centre disputed Odgers' views on the reliability of the aircraft, stating that No. 77 Wing had a good serviceability rate. This paper instead argued that difficulties in supplying the wing may have been a more important factor.|$|E
