5|$|After the war, {{allegations}} that Leopold's surrender {{had been an}} act of collaboration provoked a political crisis, known as the Royal Question, about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to the throne, which ultimately ended with his abdication.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's playing {{career was}} that of a typical journeyman, owing mostly to the fact he often played as an amateur; this meant that <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> play for a {{particular}} club was dictated by <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find an appropriate job nearby. He first played as a youth for his local side, Kiveton Park Colliery, before leaving home in 1895. He moved to Ashton-under-Lyne and played as an amateur for Ashton North End, before moving on to Stalybridge Rovers and then Rochdale (not {{to be confused with the}} modern-day Rochdale A.F.C.) – all three clubs being members of the Lancashire League. Chapman played at inside right, and although he lacked the skill of his brother Harry, he compensated for it with his strength and robustness.|$|E
5|$|In her autobiography, Rage to Survive, James recounted their meeting, {{writing that}} Wanderone neither {{confirmed}} nor denied his paternity. According to James, {{he told her}} that he did not recall the details of his life {{at the time of her}} conception well enough to know <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have been the father.|$|E
60|$|Mr Dombey smiled, as {{he might}} have smiled at an inquiry <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> raise ten {{thousand}} pounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> suffers in his {{conscience}} {{because of that}} habit," [...] said Dorothea; [...] "I wonder <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> wishes <b>he</b> <b>could</b> leave it off." ...|$|R
6000|$|Charlie said [...] "Nobody could," [...] {{and then}} 'e walked {{along with her}} hanging on to 'is arm, arf {{wondering}} {{whether it would be}} wrong to shove 'er under a bus that was passing, and arf wondering <b>whether</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> do it if it wasn't.|$|R
5|$|TurboTax, a U.S. tax {{preparation}} software firm {{owned by}} Intuit, ran a Humpty Dumpty-inspired television commercial during Super Bowl LI. The ad depicted Humpty Dumpty {{in a hospital}} using a smartphone application to ask <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> claim a tax deduction for medical expenses.|$|E
5|$|James played wide {{receiver}} for St. Vincent-St. Mary's football team and was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame. As a sophomore, {{he was named}} first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals. He decided to stop playing high school football before his senior year, after he broke his wrist during an AAU basketball game. Many sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, and former and current players have speculated on <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have played in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was optimism he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue playing.|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed like}} a 'orrid dream to Sam, {{and the only thing}} that comforted 'im was the fact that he felt much better. His illness seemed to 'ave gone, and arter hunting round the stable to see <b>whether</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> find {{anything}} to eat, 'e pulled the rug over him and went to sleep.|$|R
60|$|<b>Whether</b> even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have {{maintained}} his position for another month was doubtful. Suicide, though hinted at, was proved {{to have been}} impossible. It seemed as though with his amazing audacity he had tricked even Death into becoming his accomplice.|$|R
60|$|Off {{went the}} man to the clerk, and asked him <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> teach a bull-calf {{that they had to}} speak, for they wished so much to have it as their heir.|$|R
5|$|The {{political}} crisis surrounding Leopold III's role during the occupation, and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{return to the}} throne, polarized Belgian public opinion {{in the years following}} the war between Catholics, notably in Flanders, who broadly supported his return, and Socialists, in Wallonia and Brussels, who were strongly opposed to it. After a general strike and an indecisive referendum, the king resigned in favour of his son, Baudouin, in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during {{the early months of}} the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win by a margin of 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E
5|$|The Persian polymath Avicenna {{claimed to}} have {{observed}} Venus as {{a spot on the}} Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.|$|E
5000|$|Besarion {{could speak}} Georgian, Russian, Turkish and Armenian. Although it's unclear <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>could</b> write {{in his native}} Georgian.|$|R
60|$|Henri {{kissed his}} sister, {{and when he}} gave his hand to Marie, she did not turn her lips away from him; and as he threw himself on his bed, <b>he</b> hardly knew <b>whether,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have his own way, he would marry her at once or not.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I tell thee, boy,' said James, 'not one king--nay, not one man--in a {{thousand}} would have offered thee the frank amends King Harry hath done this day: nay, I doubt <b>whether</b> even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> so have done, {{were it not}} that the hope of his wife's coming hath made him overflow with joy and charity to all the world.' ...|$|R
5|$|Uttanka then {{wondered}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{reach his}} guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over}} the earrings to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E
5|$|When Ernst Lindemann {{returned}} to Germany, it was uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> remain on active military service. As {{a result of}} the Treaty of Versailles which was signed on 28 June 1919, the former Imperial German Navy was downsized to 15,000 men, including 1,500 officers, while being renamed the Reichsmarine in the era of the Weimar Republic. As Lindemann had finished fifth in the Class of 1913, he stood a good chance of being retained. He served temporarily in the Dahlem Protection Company a part of the Protection Regiment of Greater Berlin (June–July 1919), before he became adjutant to the newly created chief of the Naval Command Department (1 August 1919 – 30 September 1922), at the time under the command of William Michaelis. The Naval Command Department was directly subordinated to the Admiralty Staff. At the same time, he held the position of adjutant in the Fleet Department. During this assignment Lindemann was promoted to Oberleutnant zur See (Sub-Lieutenant) on 7 January 1920.|$|E
25|$|DeLay won the Republican primary on March 7, 2006, getting 62% of {{the vote}} in the four-way race. DeLay outspent his closest opponent, Tom Campbell, by a near 20-1 ratio. It was his lowest {{percentage}} of votes in a primary election and it prompted questions about <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win the general election.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Lauda {{had been}} the first and only driver to break the seven-minute mark. Fans were looking forward to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or others <b>could</b> repeat this after the {{technical}} rules had been changed, with the disappearance of the high air boxes being the most visible difference.|$|R
40|$|Apologises for {{not having}} written sooner. Sending Sicilian plants, two maniples and copies of his {{published}} pamphlets via William Swainson. Asks <b>whether</b> in future <b>he</b> <b>could</b> send his manuscripts, with sketches and illustrations, to be inserted into ["Linnean Transactions"], so as to save printing costs...|$|R
5000|$|Asked in a 1995 {{interview}} on CBS News Sunday Morning <b>whether,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{go back in}} time, he would participate again {{in the creation of}} the bomb, Hull said: “I would again do whatever was necessary to defend our way of life, to save the life of this country and this society, which, as difficult, as fragile and as—as flawed as it is, it's still the best the world has ever seen. That I'd—that I'd do it again. Sorry.” ...|$|R
25|$|In 1928, Charles {{approached}} artist-gallerist Frank Rehn to see <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{afford to}} paint full-time by selling through the Rehn gallery in New York City. Though {{the decision to}} leave Birge wallpaper company preceded the Great Depression, Charle's works continued to sell. From thereon, {{he was able to}} support the family through his artwork.|$|E
25|$|To some modern readers it {{can appear}} that some {{dynamical}} quantities recognised today {{were used in}} the Principia but not named. The mathematical aspects of the first two books were so clearly consistent that they were easily accepted; for example, Locke asked Huygens <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> trust the mathematical proofs, and was assured about their correctness.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Hinckley was {{permitted}} to leave the hospital for supervised visits with his parents; he was granted longer unsupervised releases in 2000. These privileges were revoked when he {{was found to have}} smuggled materials about Foster into the hospital. Hinckley was allowed supervised visits with his parents again during 2004 and 2005. Court hearings were held in September 2005 on <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have expanded privileges to leave the hospital.|$|E
25|$|While {{supporters}} of the aetherial theory accepted the possibility that negatively charged particles are produced in Crookes tubes, they believed {{that they are a}} mere by-product and that the cathode rays themselves are immaterial. Thomson set out to investigate <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>could</b> actually separate the charge from the rays.|$|R
60|$|Rollo further inquired of {{his uncle}} <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> and Josie <b>could</b> not talk {{in their own}} room; but Mr. George said no. If boys were allowed to talk {{together}} after they went to bed, he said, they were very apt {{to get into a}} frolic, and disturb those who slept in the adjoining rooms.|$|R
6000|$|Whether Shakespeare {{could or}} could not have written these reflections, without having read Seneca's De Clementia, <b>whether,</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not {{conceive}} the ideas [...] "out of his own head," [...] he might not hear Seneca's words translated in a sermon, or in conversation, or read them cited in an English book, each reader must decide for himself. Nor do I doubt that Shakespeare could pick out what he wanted from the Latin if he cast his eye over the essay of the tutor of Nero.|$|R
25|$|In February 2009, Barnes told Sky Sports that {{he wanted}} to return to club {{management}} if the opportunity arose. It was reported in May 2009 that Barnes contacted English League Two side Port Vale to see <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> replace out-going manager Dean Glover. Ultimately, though, the potential move to Port Vale did not happen. Instead, on 14 June 2009 he confirmed that he was to be appointed manager of League One side Tranmere Rovers.|$|E
25|$|Once again, Frank Norman was Colten's opponent, but the {{incumbent}} {{had the advantage}} because the community leadership lined up solidly behind him. Yet, Colten seemed unsure as to <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win again and took nothing for granted. He had first considered running as an Independent {{in the general election}} but chose in the end to remain a Republican. In their 1970 rematch, Colten defeated Norman 2,381 votes (58.9 percent) to 1,661 ballots (41.1 percent).|$|E
25|$|On Monday March 8, 2004 Abbas, age 55, died {{of natural}} causes while an American {{prisoner}} in an Iraqi jail outside Baghdad. He had been held there while discussions about his legal status and <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be tried in the US or elsewhere had continued. Most US anti-terrorism laws with extraterritorial provisions had been enacted after the hijacking, and the Italian government despite having sentenced Abbas to five consecutive life sentences in absentia had not sought his extradition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{system does}} various test {{scanning}} for elevated blood pressure, rapid heart and breath rate, and non-verbal cues. According to the scientists, the MALINTENT system uses {{a barrage of}} non-invasive sensors and imagers to detect and evaluate a person's facial expressions to gauge <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or she <b>could</b> be planning to commit an attack or crime.|$|R
60|$|The groom {{who held}} the horse for Herbert to mount, touched his hat respectfully as his young master rode off slowly down the avenue, {{and then went back}} to the stables to meditate with awe on the changes which had {{happened}} in his time, and to bethink himself <b>whether</b> or no <b>he</b> <b>could</b> bring himself to serve in the stables of Owen the usurper.|$|R
50|$|Peppermint Patty, {{who is the}} school's {{coordinator}} for the Junior Olympics, oversees Charlie's rigorous training for the event. Marcie also watches (and gives encouragement) and Snoopy works out with him (showing how in-shape he is and how out of shape Charlie is in the process). During {{a review of the}} ten events, Patty worries of <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win, and decides to enter Marcie to back him up.|$|R
