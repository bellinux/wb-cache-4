The goal {{of the present study was}} to propose a measure of <b>wound</b> healing rate that is independent of initial <b>wound</b> extent and to present a method of <b>wound</b> healing rate prediction. Comparisons were made of <b>wound</b> healing rate de®ned as absolute area healed per day, percentage of initial area healed per day and advance of the <b>wound</b> margin towards the <b>wound</b> centre per day. Analysis was performed on 300 <b>wound</b> cases. A disadvantage of <b>wound</b> healing measures that either use absolute area healed per day or percentage of initial area healed per day is their very limited use for comparing healing rates of <b>wounds</b> with different initial sizes. This disadvantage was overcome by incorporating a <b>wound</b> perimeter; thus obtaining a measure of the advance of the <b>wound</b> margin towards the <b>wound</b> centre. A de®nition of healing rate expressed as the greatest average <b>wound</b> margin distance from the <b>wound</b> centre divided by the time to complete <b>wound</b> closure is proposed. Because not all <b>wounds</b> are closed in the observation period, the time to complete <b>wound</b> closure has to be predicted.
