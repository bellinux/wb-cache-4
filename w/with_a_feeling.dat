5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The Heart of a Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|In his smaller poetic works, Johnson {{relied on}} short lines and filled his work <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of empathy, which {{possibly}} influenced Housman's poetic style. In London, his first imitation of Juvenal, Johnson uses the poetic form {{to express his}} political opinion and, as befits a young writer, approaches the topic in a playful and almost joyous manner. However, his second imitation, The Vanity of Human Wishes, is completely different; the language remains simple, but the poem is more complicated and difficult to read because Johnson is trying to describe complex Christian ethics. These Christian values are not unique to the poem, but contain views expressed in most of Johnson's works. In particular, Johnson emphasises God's infinite love and shows that happiness can be attained through virtuous action.|$|E

25|$|Hackett's solo career continued, {{releasing}} {{a plethora of}} both electric, classical and acoustic based albums throughout the 1990s to the present day. In 1992 Virgin/Universal released the compilation The Unauthorised Biography, including two previous unreleased recordings co-written with Brian May of Queen. Hacketts first solorelease in the 90s was the low-key and melancholy Guitar Noir in 1993. An dreamy album that sounded darker and different from his last more commercial releases. It was followed up by the bluesy and right forward Blues <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Feeling</b> (1994).|$|E
25|$|Houston Stewart Chamberlain {{was born}} in Southsea, Hampshire, England, the son of Rear Admiral William Charles Chamberlain, RN. His mother, Eliza Jane, {{daughter}} of Captain Basil Hall, RN, died before he was a year old; his grandmother brought him up in France. Chamberlain's poor health frequently led him to {{being sent to the}} warmer climates of Spain and Italy for the winter. This constant moving about made it hard for Chamberlain to form lasting friendships and left him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of rootlessness, of not belonging anywhere.|$|E
25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} limbic system begin to function. The limbic system is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of contentedness. Further development of the limbic system might be responsible for the onset of laughter around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E

Romanian newspapers Cancan and Click! pointed out cut scenes that portray Stan's mime {{of the sexual}} intercourse and oral sex with a fellow dancer, which, according to them, {{would have been a}} reason for the clip to be banned in Romania.

Alex Macpherson of guardian.co.uk was more critical to the song and labeled it as [...] "eurotrash trance", while Danny Walker of RWD Magazine called the song pacy. According to Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media Usher [...] "sounds most uncomfortable and the least sharp on overblown club tracks 'Euphoria' and 'Numb', {{and the presence of}} rote numbers is almost comically predictable."

500|$|Bizet's early one-act opera Le docteur Miracle {{provides}} the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, [...] "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation". Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements {{in many of}} his earliest works: [...] "gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved." [...] Until Carmen, however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as Donizetti, Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.|$|E
500|$|Symeon {{repeatedly}} {{describes the}} experience of divine light in his writings, as both an inward and outward mystical experience. These experiences began in his youth, and continued all during his life. They came to him during inward prayer and contemplation, and were associated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of indescribable joy, {{as well as the}} intellectual understanding that the light was a vision of God. In his writings, he spoke directly to God about the experience variously as [...] "the pure Light of your face" [...] and [...] "You deigned to reveal Your face to me like a formless sun." [...] He also described the light as the grace of God, and taught that its experience was associated with a mind that was completely still and had transcended itself. At times he described the light speaking to him with kindness, and explaining who it was.|$|E
500|$|Alonso Duralde {{wrote that}} the film should please slasher fans, but that it added nothing new to the genre or the {{franchise}} and would not appeal to {{people who did not}} like slasher films.

He also said the prospect of another Friday the 13thcrafted by the film's [...] "sequel-friendly" [...] endingdid not leave him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of dread.

Although Goodykoontz acknowledges the unique touches the film brings to certain characters' deaths, he was unimpressed with the acting and said Padalecki's presence gave the film a [...] "less-good episode of Supernatural" [...] vibe.|$|E

500|$|At a 1994 Village Voice {{symposium}} {{about the}} film, historian Annette Insdorf described how her mother, {{a survivor of}} three concentration camps, felt gratitude that the Holocaust story was finally being told in a major film that would be widely viewed. Hungarian Jewish author Imre Kertész, a Holocaust survivor, feels {{it is impossible for}} life in a Nazi concentration camp to be accurately portrayed by anyone who did not experience it first-hand. While commending Spielberg for bringing the story to a wide audience, he found the film's final scene at the graveyard neglected the terrible after-effects of the experience on the survivors and implied that they came through emotionally unscathed. Rabbi Uri D. Herscher found the film an [...] "appealing" [...] and [...] "uplifting" [...] demonstration of humanitarianism. Norbert Friedman noted that, like many Holocaust survivors, he reacted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of solidarity towards Spielberg of a sort normally reserved for other survivors. Albert L. Lewis, Spielberg's childhood rabbi and teacher, described the movie as [...] "Steven's gift to his mother, to his people, and in a sense to himself. Now he is a full human being." ...|$|E
500|$|Trumble was {{selected}} in the Australian team to tour England in 1896, despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw {{his place in the}} touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him {{as a member of a}} team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. Wisden said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year, [...] "...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia". In that season, Trumble took 148wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who [...] "was able to inspire [...] batsmen <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of apprehension". [...] Wisden's summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, [...] "His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy" [...] and [...] "he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [...] side".|$|E
500|$|Several writers {{felt that}} the novel left much to be desired {{following}} Fitzgerald's previous works and promptly criticized him.

[...] John McClure of The Times-Picayune said that the book was unconvincing, writing, [...] "Even in conception and construction, The Great Gatsby seems a little raw." [...] Ralph Coghlan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch felt the book lacked what made Fitzgerald's earlier novels endearing and called the book [...] "a minor performance... At the moment, its author seems a bit bored and tired and cynical." [...] Ruth Snyder of New York Evening World called the book's style [...] "painfully forced", noting that the editors of the paper were [...] "quite convinced after reading The Great Gatsby that Mr. Fitzgerald is not one of the great American writers of to-day." [...] The reviews struck Fitzgerald as completely missing the point: [...] "All the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about." ...|$|E
