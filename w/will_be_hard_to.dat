A July 2010 analysis by the Financial Times on the aftermath cited legal sources as saying that [...] "at some point {{the scale of the}} litigation becomes so large that it really is novel", that [...] "the situation is likely to be complicated further because the variety of probable cases means it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> aggregate them into so-called class actions" [...] and that there was [...] "no way to put this in historical context because we have never faced anything like this before".

It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner, who are producing the Uncharted film, will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment. In early 2013, s Game Director, Todd Papy, {{said he did not}} know the status of the film. The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words.

500|$|Jab Tak Hai Jaan {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics overseas. Priya Joshi of the website Digital Spy gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "The film is invested {{with a healthy}} dose of Shah Rukh, the very heart and saans of Yash Chopra and the message which he lived and breathed through his films: that love is eternal." [...] Simon Foster of Australia's Special Broadcasting Service also gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, calling it [...] "a grand cinematic work boasting all {{the pros and cons of}} the genre." [...] He observed: [...] "Chopra fans will not hear complaints that the great producer-director had become mired in a rut, or that his films are rote melodramas reliant on boisterous music (here, a typically string-heavy work from the omnipresent A.R. Rahman) and over-active camerawork. One could argue that it's their very vivid cinematic nature that makes them particularly noteworthy, even when the dialogue (at times, awful) and plotting (rarely based in logical realism) can test one's patience." [...] Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "The film has a freshness that would never lead one to think it was directed by an 80-year-old while at the same time it has a sureness of tone, a certainty about itself even at its most audacious, that only comes from the hand of a seasoned master...Jab Tak Hai Jaan serves as a fitting tribute to the career of Chopra." [...] Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: [...] "Director-producer Yash Chopra's film, his final project before he died, delivers not only the romance and human touch, but also reflects a modern sensibility." [...] Nicolas Rapold of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Even though the film drags, the magic of Bollywood is that this story's muddle of twists only clarifies the urgency behind the undying desires of all concerned parties." [...] Mazhar Farooqui of Dubai's the Gulf News wrote: [...] "Despite its inherent flaws, JTHJ comes across as a beguiling romantic film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of high emotions set amidst picture postcard locales but more than anyone the movie belongs to Chopra. In his swan song, the celebrated director once again proved why his legacy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> match." ...|$|E
