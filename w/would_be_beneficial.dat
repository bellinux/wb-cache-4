5|$|A 2013/4 {{survey by}} the National Association for Business Economics found that about 75 percent of those {{surveyed}} said ACA hadn’t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn’t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{had driven}} the Swedish out of Butre, the {{director}} general of the Dutch West India Company, with headquarters in St. George d'Elmina in the central Gold Coast, decided that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> to negotiate a treaty with the local political leadership in order to establish a peaceful long-term relationship. The Ahanta leaders found it equally beneficial to enter into such an agreement. The 1656 treaty signalled the definitive switch in European jurisdiction in the area until 1872.|$|E

5|$|Cathodoluminescence (CL) — light {{emission}} excited by electron beam — {{is a process}} commonly observed in TV screens. An electron beam can be finely focused and scanned across the studied material. This technique is widely used to study defects in semiconductors and nanostructures with nanometer-scale spatial resolution. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> to apply this technique to carbon nanotubes. However, no reliable CL, i.e. sharp peaks assignable to certain (n,m) indices, has been detected from carbon nanotubes yet.|$|E
5|$|In 1751, Washington {{traveled}} to Barbados with Lawrence, who {{was suffering from}} tuberculosis, {{with the hope that}} the climate <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> to Lawrence's health. Washington contracted smallpox during the trip, which left his face slightly scarred but immunized him against future exposures to the dreaded disease. Lawrence's health failed to improve, and he returned to Mount Vernon where he died in the summer of 1752. Lawrence's position as Adjutant General (militia leader) of Virginia was divided into four district offices after his death. Washington was appointed by Governor Dinwiddie as one of the four district adjutants in February 1753, with the rank of major in the Virginia militia. During this period, Washington became a Freemason while in Fredericksburg, although his involvement was minimal.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her with knowledge of a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E

50|$|The AAFC has {{specific}} rank establishments {{depending on}} the strength of a squadron. This is to ensure a balance between leadership roles and subordinates members (especially to prevent a top-heavy squadron developing). As an exaggerated example, it <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> for a squadron of 40 cadets to have 39 CUOs and 1 CDT, nor <b>would</b> it <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> for it to have 20 CWOFFs, 10 CFSGTs and 10 CSGTs. Rather, that squadron ought to have 2 CUOs, 2 CWOFFs, 1 CFSGT, 3 CSGTs, 5 CCPLs and around 30 LCDTs/CDTs. The general standard is 1-4 NCOs and CUOs.|$|R
5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} in 1984, and was a significant modification of the traditional Westminster system of government. Since the ruling People's Action Party had won all parliamentary seats in the four general elections since independence, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew argued that the NCMP scheme would ensure that opposition voices would be heard in Parliament. According to him, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> to Singapore as it would give the younger generation of Singaporeans {{a chance to see}} what an opposition can or cannot do. When the first constitutional amendment was made to initiate the NCMP scheme, between three and six NCMPs were allowed in Parliament. The Constitution was amended again in 2010 to allow for a maximum of nine NCMPs in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Two {{locations}} on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition: the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations {{were the primary}} areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley Formation's age was approximated {{to be about the}} same as Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E

50|$|Analysing {{data for}} 40 countries, Lee et al. show that {{fertility}} well above replacement {{and population growth}} <b>would</b> typically <b>be</b> most <b>beneficial</b> for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability <b>would</b> <b>be</b> most <b>beneficial</b> for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.|$|R
5|$|Churchill did {{not support}} the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to {{pressure}} Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> by lending the dream-like ghost {{world of the}} film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the voices {{that were going to}} be recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E

25|$|A V-shaped pelikan tail {{could be}} implemented, {{replacing}} conventional vertical tail fins and horizontal stabiliser structures. This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>beneficial</b> for reduction of radar signature, weight and aerodynamic drag, since control surface area and corresponding control mechanisms are reduced. Problems faced by {{this type of}} design are flight control system complexity and control surface loading.
