2500|$|Pass the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> {{around the}} anchor object. [...] Bring it back {{alongside}} of the standing part {{and make a}} half-hitch around the standing part.|$|E
2500|$|Continue {{by passing}} the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> over the working part, around the {{standing}} part again and {{back through the}} loop formed in the first step. [...] Make sure this second wrap tucks in between the first wrap and the working part of the line {{on the inside of}} the loop. [...] This detail gives this version its additional security.|$|E
2500|$|Planing the {{end grain}} of the board {{involves}} different techniques, and frequently different planes designed for <b>working</b> <b>end</b> grain. Block planes and other bevel-up planes are often effective in planing the difficult nature of end grain. These planes are usually designed to use an iron bedded at a [...] "low angle," [...] typically about 12 degrees.|$|E

50|$|The cowboy bowline has the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> {{go around}} the {{standing}} part on the side closer to the loop and results with the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> outside the loop. In contrast, a regular bowline has the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> finishing inside the loop.|$|E

50|$|Like {{the reef}} knot, the surgeon's knot capsizes and fails {{if one of}} the <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> is pulled away from the {{standing}} end closest to it.|$|R
5000|$|First, {{learn to}} tie the bowline by laying the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> on the {{standing}} part and twisting to form a loop (the [...] "hole" [...] that the rabbit comes out of). Wrap the loop once more around the <b>working</b> <b>end.</b> Then pass the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> behind the standing part and back down through the double loop.|$|E
50|$|To tie the hitch {{around a}} pole, begin by passing the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> a half turn round the pole. Next, pass a half turn round the {{standing}} part. Then, pass a half turn round both the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> and the standing part, above the first turn (i.e. {{closer to the}} pole). Finally, push a bight of the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> {{through the middle of}} the hitch - between the two half turns, and between the standing part and the <b>working</b> <b>end.</b> Pull on the standing part to tighten, if necessary sliding the hitch snugly up against the pole.|$|E
5000|$|Begin {{by forming}} a {{clockwise}} loop around the pole, with the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> {{of the rope}} on top. Bring the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> through the loop. At this point, you have an overhand knot around the pole.|$|E
5000|$|The starkly differing {{behavior}} of the knot, depending on how it is arranged, has been exploited {{as the basis of}} a parlor trick. [...] When pulling on the standing ends the knot starts slipping and the <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> become crossed. By twisting the <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> so that they uncross and then recross in reverse, the knot's structure is changed so that it will no longer slip. The twisting motion has been paralleled to the turning of a key, [...] "locking" [...] and [...] "unlocking" [...] the knot.|$|R
5000|$|The Reever Knot and the Vice Versa Bend are {{essentially}} the same knot. They only differ {{in the selection of}} which lines are used as the [...] standing and [...] <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> of the knot.Given the structure of the knot there are three possible combinations one can use for the standing and <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> of the knot. The standing parts can be A-A, A-B, or B-B. The Reever knot results when the standing ends are selected as A-A. [...] Selecting the standing ends as A-B results in the Vice Versa Bend.|$|R
5000|$|All {{forms of}} the knot are {{considered}} reliable and secure but {{it is suggested that}} the Reever Knot is the better version because the arrangement of standing and <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> in the Vice Versa Bend is not strictly symmetric.|$|R
5000|$|Bring the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> {{down and}} to the left. Loop it under the {{standing}} end. Pull the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> through the loop just formed, tighten, and slide the knot along the standing end up to the post.|$|E
50|$|The Water Bowline can be tied {{very quickly}} by {{throwing}} two half hitches over the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> and then running the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> around the standing line and back through both half hitches. This {{is illustrated in}} the three pictures below.|$|E

50|$|Any {{basket weave}} knot {{that can be}} tied from two strands can be drawn as an endless knot by {{connecting}} the standing ends together and the <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> together. An example {{of this can be}} seen in the carrick mat.|$|R

50|$|Twybils {{always have}} two <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> {{and these are}} always different. The first is an axe-like blade, with the edge {{arranged}} parallel to the handle. The second edge is crossways, as for an adze. This is used for prying and levering rather than cutting.|$|R
50|$|Start {{by tying}} a clove hitch around the spar or pole. Then make an {{additional}} turn {{around with the}} <b>working</b> <b>end,</b> {{in the same direction}} as the turns forming the clove hitch. Now, tuck the <b>working</b> <b>end</b> under the standing part of the original clove hitch. Pull up tight to complete the hitch.|$|E

50|$|The grief knot {{resembles the}} granny knot, but tied {{so that the}} <b>working</b> <b>ends</b> come out diagonally from each other, whereas a granny knots ends both {{come out on the}} same side.
