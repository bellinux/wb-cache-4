500|$|In Malay, kuala {{can have}} the {{meanings}} of [...] "river mouth", [...] "estuary", or [...] "confluence". Thus, the name Kuala Terengganu is roughly translated as [...] "the confluence/estuary of Terengganu", referring to the broad expanse of the Terengganu River estuary which empties into the South China Sea. There are several theories regarding the name Terengganu. One such theory attributes the name's origin to terang ganu, Malay for 'bright rainbow'. Another story, which {{is considered to be}} the most popular version, {{is said to have been}} originally narrated by the ninth Sultan of Terengganu, Baginda Omar. It tells of a party of hunters from Pahang roving and hunting in the area of what is now southern Terengganu. One of the hunters spotted a big animal fang lying on the ground. A fellow party member asked to which animal did the fang belong. The hunter, not knowing which animal, simply answered taring anu (Malay: 'fang of something'). The party later returned to Pahang with a rich hoard of game, fur and sandalwood, which impressed their neighbours. They asked the hunters <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> source their riches, to which they replied, from the land of taring anu, which later evolved into Terengganu.|$|E

Barlett commented to the Gleaner, [...] "We {{just have to say}} that care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in portraying images of our destination and people, Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [...] ". Mavado's manager defended the video, stating, [...] "The concept that they came up with, <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> come up with that?

It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows {{when we were on}} the air were All in the Family and The Mary Tyler Moore Show both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense," [...] continued Gelbart. [...] "But our show was a film show – supposedly shot in the middle of Korea. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> come from?'" [...] Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. [...] "So you know what they said?" [...] Gelbart said. [...] "'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!' The people who defend laugh tracks have no sense of humor." [...] Gelbart summed up the situation by saying, [...] "I always thought it cheapened the show. The network got their way. They were paying for dinner." ...|$|E

In doing so, the article pays {{particular attention to the}} standby nations’ constant calculation of political and financial costs. It argues that recognizing these cost-benefit calculations allows for identifying the most crucial areas to be tackled to make the EU Battlegroups functional.
