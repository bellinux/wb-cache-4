40|$|This {{study was}} carried out {{at the request of}} the Swedish forest company Sveaskog which is an {{important}} producer of logging residues (branches and tops) intended for energy production. The company wanted to increase the average dry content to 60 percent in their delivered logging residues. At the time when this study was initiated, the dry content in the chipped logging residues originating from the Bergslagen district was at 52 percent. The aim of the study was to find out how <b>windrows</b> <b>of</b> logging residues could be arranged in order to help obtain desired properties such as increased dry content. Sveaskog had developed a system for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>windrows</b> and a standardized form was utilized to describe different properties <b>of</b> the <b>windrows.</b> The form consisted of six major sections, each looking at different quality parameters. Emphasis was directed towards evaluating the planning, preparation, and choice of site for the landing area and to see if local site conditions had been utilized to help improve the final windrow properties. Additional information concerning overall design <b>of</b> the <b>windrow</b> and the quality of the covering, as well as the extent of contamination in the windrows was also collected. There was no coherence between the six quality parameters investigated and the measured dry content. Furthermore, the number of months during which the logging residue had been stored in a windrow was found to be of negligible importance. On the contrary however, the time of the year during which the material was transported out of the stand appeared to affect measured dry content the most. Hauling in the period of April to October resulted in a higher dry content compared to the period between November and March. There were large differences between the dry content <b>of</b> <b>windrows</b> at the same sites which added to the sources of error in this study. In addition, it was impossible to accurately estimate the degree of contamination inside the <b>windrows</b> because <b>of</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> present during the time when the field work was conducted. Another problem in this study was that no data on dry content for individual windrows could be obtained; only averages for the entire site were available. This made it impossible to evaluate effects due to factors such as location <b>of</b> individual <b>windrows</b> and distance from windrows to the nearest standing forest, since most sites consisted <b>of</b> many different <b>windrows.</b> When performing a new similar study it would therefore be more appropriate to measure dry content on every single <b>windrow</b> instead <b>of</b> only obtaining overall averages.

40|$|As is {{the case}} with many other substances, snow {{responds}} visco-elastically to a force applied to it provided that the force remains so small that it does not break down the snow. M. de Quervain studied the visco-elastic properties <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> and ice by twisting a pillar <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> or ice and found that their mechanical properties could be qualitatively represented by a rheological model composed of a Maxwell unit and a Voigt unit in series connection (1). Exten-sive investigations on the viscous properties <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> namely the creep phenome-non <b>of</b> <b>snow,</b> were performed by R.
