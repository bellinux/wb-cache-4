The objective {{of this research was}} to assess the contribution of soils information to the prediction accuracy of a large area crop yield prediction model. The available <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity,</b> defined as the soil water held between 0. 3 and 15 bars tension, was used as the major component to study the interaction of soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> and weather variability. ^ The available soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> was estimated from soil texture for 902 soil profiles representative of Indiana soils. A multivariate cluster analysis of the available soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> in ten 15 -cm layers was used to classify the soil profiles in 4, 8, and 12 cluster classes. These cluster classes, which represent three levels of aggregation of available soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity,</b> were compared to each other in terms of available <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity,</b> areal extent in the nine Indiana crop reporting districts, and their contributions to improving the accuracy of a large area soybean yield prediction model. ^ These analyses indicate: (1) distinctly different available soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> groups can be distinguished in a population of soils with a wide range, (2) most of the soybean area in a crop reporting district can be represented by five soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> groups, although these groups vary from one district to another, (3) the soybean yield prediction model weather indices are not sensitive to the <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> differences between all of the soil <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> groups at all levels of aggregation, but important differences between poorly and well and high and low <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> soils do exist. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{storm in}} June 2011 caused public {{utilities}} including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, {{which made the}} course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's <b>water</b> <b>capacity</b> and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though {{it did not take}} corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.|$|E

They were interested in understanding the different effects of temperature and feedstock on the <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> of biochar but all values were calculated at a 2 % mixture rate only. By varying retort temperature from 250 °C to 750 °C, increases in <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> ranging from 7 % to 16 % were observed. Another finding was an 11 % increase in <b>water</b> holding <b>capacity</b> reported as an additional observation and was not validated through the use of control techniques [15].

5|$|Sir Nigel Gresley's {{independent}} {{report on}} the Kand K1classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant {{that they could have}} been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and not only on the poorest quality tracks. The restricted <b>water</b> <b>capacity</b> also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the Brighton Main Line, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when {{the decision was made to}} rebuild them as U/U1 tender engines following the Sevenoaks disaster. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70mph (110km/h) with a greater degree of stability.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its <b>water</b> <b>capacity,</b> because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E
