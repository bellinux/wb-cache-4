40|$|Electrospun fiber has highly {{structural}} similarity {{with natural}} bone extracelluar matrix (ECM). Many researches about fabricating organicâ€“inorganic composite materials {{have been carried}} out in order to mimic the natural composition of bone and enhance the biocompatibility of materials. In this <b>work,</b> <b>pearl</b> powder was added to the poly (3 -hydroxybutyrate-co- 3 -hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and the composite nanofiber scaffold was prepared by electrospinning. Mineralization ability of the composite scaffolds can be evaluated by analyzing hydroxyapatite (HA) formation on the surface of nanofiber scaffolds. The obtained composite nanofiber scaffolds showed an enhanced mineralization capacity due to incorporation of pearl powder. The HA formed amount of the composite scaffolds was raised as the increase of pearl powder in composite scaffolds. Therefore, the prepared PHBV/pearl composite nanofiber scaffolds would be a promising candidate as an osteoconductive composite material for bone repairing...|$|R
