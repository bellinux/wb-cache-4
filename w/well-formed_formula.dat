25|$|A <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> is any atomic formula, or any {{formula that}} can be built up from atomic {{formulas}} by means of operator symbols {{according to the rules}} of the grammar.|$|E
25|$|Each of the {{variables}} just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A sentence in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> with no free variables (of any sort).|$|E
2500|$|For example, , is a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> of second-order {{arithmetic}} that is arithmetical, has {{one free}} set variable X and one bound individual variable n (but no bound set variables, as {{is required of}} an arithmetical formula)mdash&whereas [...] is a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> that is not arithmetical, having one bound set variable X and one bound individual variable n.|$|E

2500|$|A theorem may be {{expressed}} in a formal language (or [...] "formalized"). A formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem.

The symbols and strings of symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense and <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas.</b> A formal language {{is identical to the}} set of its <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas.</b> The set of <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas</b> may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems.|$|R

5000|$|Let , , and [...] {{stand for}} <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas.</b> (The <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas</b> {{themselves}} would not contain any Greek letters, but only capital Roman letters, connective operators, and parentheses.) Then the axioms are as follows: ...|$|R

"A {{property}} is definite in Skolem's sense {{if it is}} expressed [...] [...] [...] by a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> in the simple predicate calculus of first order in which the sole predicate constants are ε and possibly, =. ... Today an axiomatization of set theory is usually embedded in a logical calculus, and it is Weyl's and Skolem's approach to the formulation of the axiom of separation that is generally adopted.|$|E
2500|$|With this {{definition}} {{we can now}} formalize {{what it means for}} a formula [...] to be implied by a certain set [...] of formulas. Informally this is true if in all worlds that are possible given the set of formulas [...] the formula [...] also holds. This leads to the following formal definition: We say that a set [...] of well-formed formulas semantically entails (or implies) a certain <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> [...] if all truth assignments that satisfy all the formulas in [...] also satisfy [...]|$|E
2500|$|Logic, {{especially}} {{in the field of}} proof theory, considers theorems as statements (called formulas or well formed formulas) of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and [...] may be broadly divided into nonsense and well-formed formulas. A set of deduction rules, also called transformation rules or rules of inference, must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to Hofstadter, a formal system often simply defines all its <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> as theorems.|$|E

50|$|All other <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulae</b> are {{obtained}} by composing atoms with logical connectives and quantifiers.|$|R
2500|$|Propositional {{logic is}} closed under truth-functional connectives. [...] That is to say, for any {{proposition}} , [...] {{is also a}} proposition. [...] Likewise, for any propositions [...] and , [...] is a proposition, and similarly for disjunction, conditional, and biconditional. [...] This implies that, for instance, [...] is a proposition, and {{so it can be}} conjoined with another proposition. [...] In order to represent this, we need to use parentheses to indicate which proposition is conjoined with which. [...] For instance, [...] is not a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula,</b> because we do not know if we are conjoining [...] with [...] or if we are conjoining [...] with [...] [...] Thus we must write either [...] to represent the former, or [...] to represent the latter. [...] By evaluating the truth conditions, we see that both expressions have the same truth conditions (will be true in the same cases), and moreover that any proposition formed by arbitrary conjunctions will have the same truth conditions, regardless of the location of the parentheses. [...] This means that conjunction is associative, however, one should not assume that parentheses never serve a purpose. [...] For instance, the sentence [...] does not have the same truth conditions of , so they are different sentences distinguished only by the parentheses. [...] One can verify this by the truth-table method referenced above.|$|E
50|$|Since biconditionality is an {{equivalence}} relation, any {{instance of}} ¬¬A in a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> {{can be replaced}} by A, leaving unchanged the truth-value of the <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula.</b>|$|E

50|$|In earlier {{works on}} {{mathematical}} logic (e.g. by Church), formulas referred to any strings of symbols and among these strings, <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas</b> were the strings {{that followed the}} formation rules of (correct) formulas.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the formal}} {{languages}} used in mathematical logic and computer science, a <b>well-formed</b> <b>formula</b> or simply formula is an idea, abstraction or concept which is expressed using the symbols and formation rules (also called the formal grammar) {{of a particular}} formal language.

50|$|The {{first step}} of the proof is to {{represent}} (<b>well-formed)</b> <b>formulas</b> of the theory, and finite lists of these formulas, as natural numbers. These numbers are called the Gödel numbers of the formulas.|$|R
25|$|First-order {{logic is}} a {{particular}} formal system of logic. Its syntax involves only finite expressions as <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas,</b> while its semantics are characterized by the limitation of all quantifiers to a fixed domain of discourse.|$|R
25|$|Our propositional {{calculus}} has ten inference rules. These rules {{allow us to}} derive other true formulas given a set of formulas that {{are assumed to be}} true. The first nine simply state that we can infer certain <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas</b> from other <b>well-formed</b> <b>formulas.</b> The last rule however uses hypothetical reasoning in the sense that in the premise of the rule we temporarily assume an (unproven) hypothesis {{to be part of the}} set of inferred formulas to see if we can infer a certain other formula. Since the first nine rules don't do this they are usually described as non-hypothetical rules, and the last one as a hypothetical rule.|$|R
