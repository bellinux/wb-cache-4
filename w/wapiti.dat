5|$|Four {{subspecies}} {{described in}} Asia include the Altai <b>wapiti</b> (C. canadensis sibiricus) and the Tianshan <b>wapiti</b> (C. canadensis songaricus). Two distinct subspecies found in China and Korea are the Manchurian <b>wapiti</b> (C. canadensis xanthopygus) and the Alashan wapitis (C. canadensis alashanicus). The Manchurian <b>wapiti</b> is darker and more reddish in coloration {{than the other}} populations. The Alashan <b>wapiti</b> of north central China is the smallest of all subspecies, has the lightest coloration and is the least studied. Biologist Valerius Geist, who has written on the world's various deer species, holds {{that there are only}} three subspecies of elk. Geist recognizes the Manchurian and Alashan <b>wapiti</b> but places all other elk into C. canadensis canadensis, claiming that classification of the four surviving North American groups as subspecies is driven, at least partly, for political purposes to secure individualized conservation and protective measures for each of the surviving populations.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{subspecies}} {{are sometimes}} referred to as the maral, but this name applies primarily to the Caspian red deer (Cervus elaphus maral), a subspecies of red deer. There is a subspecies of elk in Mongolia called the Altai <b>wapiti</b> (Cervus canadensis sibiricus), also known as the Altai maral.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{elevation}} and level of precipitation, the Black Hills ecology differs significantly from the plains. The mountains are thickly blanketed by various types of pines, including ponderosa and lodgepole pines, as well as spruces. Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (<b>wapiti),</b> bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pine marten, and mountain lions, while the streams and lakes contain several species of trout.|$|E
5|$|RAAF squadrons began {{adopting}} specialised {{roles in}} the early 1930s, No.1 Squadron becoming No.1 Single-Engined Bomber Squadron. By November 1935 it {{was made up of}} two flights of newly delivered Hawker Demon fighter-bombers, and one of Wapitis. In December 1935 it was augmented by No.1 FTS's Fighter Squadron and its six Bristol Bulldogs, which were redesignated fighter-bombers. Nos.21 and 22 (Cadre) Squadrons were formed on 20April 1936 at Laverton and Richmond, respectively, absorbing the CAF personnel of Nos.1 and 3Squadrons, which became PAF units. The same day, No.1 Squadron was renamed No.1 (Fighter Bomber) Squadron. This reorganisation temporarily denuded No.1 Squadron of most of its aircraft, leaving only AFlight, with four Bulldogs and a <b>Wapiti,</b> in operation. The <b>Wapiti</b> was transferred to No.1 FTS in July, {{and by the end of}} the month the squadron's complement of aircraft stood at four Bulldogs and one Moth.|$|E
5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that there are no more than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian <b>wapiti</b> (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not distinguishable from the Alashan <b>wapiti.</b> The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not distinguishable from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E
5|$|Black Hills mammals include deer, elk (<b>wapiti),</b> bighorn sheep, {{mountain}} goats, {{and mountain}} lions, while the streams and lakes contain {{several species of}} trout. Cottontail rabbits and wood rabbits live throughout the Hills, as do squirrels, raccoons, chipmunks, and porcupines. Wild burro and bobcat can be found, as well as bison in limited quantity. Woodpecker, robin, sparrow, jay, bobwhite, and wren are Black Hills birds.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the Yukon Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of Yukon horse, steppe bison, caribou, <b>wapiti</b> (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|Throughout their range, {{they live}} in forest and in forest edge habitat, similar to other deer species. In mountainous regions, they often dwell at higher {{elevations}} in summer, migrating down slope for winter. The highly adaptable elk also inhabit semi-deserts in North America, such as the Great Basin. Manchurian and Alashan <b>wapiti</b> are primarily forest dwellers and their smaller antler size is a likely adaptation to a forest environment.|$|E
5|$|Elk (also {{known as}} <b>wapiti),</b> mule deer, and {{pronghorn}} (also called pronghorn antelope) {{are some of}} the most commonly seen large mammals. During winter, pronghorn that spend the summer in the Sawtooth Valley migrate south to the lower elevations on the Snake River Plain, and some sections of the forest are closed to motorized use to protect the elk winter range. Bighorn sheep are rare sights in the forest, but the forest contains one-third of Idaho's mountain goat population, and they are commonly seen at high elevations in the Boulder, White Cloud, Pioneer, and Sawtooth mountains. Other mammals in the forest include the coyote, moose, bobcat, beaver, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, and badger.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly {{expanded}} the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon {{the creation of}} the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A remnant of the earliest years of the forest management is the <b>Wapiti</b> Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian <b>wapiti</b> and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
5|$|Most Korean mammal {{species are}} {{found only in}} {{a small part of}} Korea. The large southeastern island of Jeju, and the rugged northeastern Paektu Mountain region, are {{particularly}} known for their distinctive mammal species. Several species, including the Dsinezumi shrew, are found only on Jeju, while many other species, such as the wild boar, are absent or extirpated from there. Some mammals, such as the Manchurian <b>wapiti,</b> are considered natural monuments of North Korea, while others, such as the spotted seal, are considered natural monuments of South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Wolf and coyote {{packs and}} the solitary cougar {{are the most}} likely predators, {{although}} brown and black bears also prey on elk. Coyote packs mostly prey on elk calves, though they can sometimes take a winter-weakened adult. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem which includes Yellowstone National Park, bears are the most significant predators of calves. Major predators in Asia include the wolf, dhole, brown bear, Siberian tiger, Amur leopard, and snow leopard. Eurasian lynx and wild boar sometimes prey on Asian elk calves. Historically, tigers in the Lake Baikal region fed on Manchurian <b>wapiti,</b> and continue {{to do so in the}} Amur region.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, No.1 AD {{comprised}} 350 staff; {{the overall}} {{strength of the}} RAAF at this time was under 2,000. The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the Westland <b>Wapiti,</b> Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Demon, de Havilland Dragon Rapide, Avro Cadet, Avro Anson, and North American NA-16. The NA-16 was later augmented by {{the purchase of the}} more advanced North American NA-33, which was licensed and built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation as the CAC Wirraway. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit Training Section, incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton on 1March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1September 1936. No.1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft fitters and riggers in 1935, leading to the formation of No.1 School of Technical Training five years later.|$|E
5|$|In December 1935, No.1 AD's workshops, {{under the}} command of Squadron Leader Arthur Murphy, {{specially}} modified a <b>Wapiti</b> and a deHavilland Gipsy Moth for Antarctic conditions, to enable an Air Force team led by Flight Lieutenant (later Group Captain) Eric Douglas and Flying Officer Alister Murdoch to rescue explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, who was presumed lost on a journey across the continent. On 3May 1937, Recruit Training Squadron acquired a new sub-unit, the Communications and Survey Flight, utilising Tugan Gannets and Dragon Rapides for ongoing photographic survey work; the squadron was re-formed as No.1 Recruit Depot on 2March 1940. Coupled with its aircraft assembly and test facilities, the recruit training unit made Laverton an obvious choice for the establishment of future RAAF squadrons. No.1 AD's commanding officers during this decade included Wing Commanders Frank McNamara (February 1933 to April 1936), Frank Lukis (April 1936 to January 1938), and Arthur Murphy (January 1938 to May 1940).|$|E
5|$|Until recently, {{red deer}} and elk were {{considered}} to be one species, Cervus elaphus. However, mitochondrial DNA studies, conducted on hundreds of samples in 2004 from red deer and elk subspecies as well as other species of the Cervus deer family, strongly indicate that elk, or <b>wapiti,</b> should be a distinct species, namely Cervus canadensis. The previous classification had over a dozen subspecies under the C. elaphus species designation; DNA evidence concludes that elk are more closely related to Thorold's deer and even sika deer than they are to the red deer. Though elk and red deer can produce fertile offspring in captivity, geographic isolation between the species in the wild and differences in mating behaviors indicate that reproduction between them outside a controlled environment would be unlikely. However, the two species have freely inter-bred in New Zealand's Fiordland National Park, where the cross-bred animals have all but removed the pure elk blood from the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, No.1 FTS {{started running}} two courses each year, the first commencing in January {{and the second}} in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned {{officers}} as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places. Wing Commander Hippolyte DeLa Rue became commanding officer in early 1933. The following year, No.1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance. In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer {{to bridge the gap}} between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the <b>Wapiti</b> used for advanced training. De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions. Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939.|$|E
5|$|Native herbivores such as {{the moose}} are found in small numbers near waterways, {{especially}} at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America {{have been on the}} decline {{since the end of the}} 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as <b>wapiti)</b> and 40,000 mule deer. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations.|$|E
5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to dark brown hair on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian <b>wapiti</b> may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} {{had made}} its first flight by 5 March 1927, and underwent official evaluation against the designs from Bristol (the Beaver), Fairey (the Fairey Ferret and IIIF), Gloster (the Goral) and Westland (the <b>Wapiti).</b> Its initial tests showed it to possess good handling, and was taken forwards for squadron trials, along with the Ferret, IIIF and <b>Wapiti.</b> Following these trials, the <b>Wapiti</b> {{was chosen as the}} winner, with the Valiant, which was 30% more expensive than the <b>Wapiti,</b> rejected because it was a poor bombing platform, not being sufficiently stable.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{evidence}} {{clearly shows}} the <b>wapiti</b> and western red deer form two separate species.|$|E
25|$|The {{experimental}} Bristol Phoenix of 1928–1932 {{was successfully}} flight {{tested in a}} Westland <b>Wapiti</b> and set altitude records in 1934 that lasted until World War II.|$|E
25|$|Red {{deer are}} ruminants, {{characterized}} by a four-chambered stomach. Genetic evidence indicates the red deer as traditionally defined is a species group, rather than a single species, although it remains disputed as to exactly how many species the group includes. The closely related and slightly larger American elk or <b>wapiti,</b> native to North America and eastern parts of Asia, had been regarded as a subspecies of red deer, but recently it has been established as a distinct species. It is probable that the ancestor of all red deer, including <b>wapiti,</b> originated in central Asia and resembled sika deer.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{game of the}} Chiricahua was {{the deer}} {{followed}} by pronghorn. Lesser game included: cottontail rabbits (but not jack rabbits), opossums, squirrels, surplus horses, surplus mules, <b>wapiti</b> (elk), wild cattle, wood rats.|$|E
25|$|Until recently, {{biologists}} {{considered the}} red deer and elk or <b>wapiti</b> (C. canadensis) the same species, forming a continuous distribution throughout temperate Eurasia and North America. This belief was {{based largely on}} the fully fertile hybrids that can be produced under captive conditions.|$|E
25|$|The Widgeon proved {{expensive}} {{compared to}} its competitors {{and a total}} of only 26 of all types, including the prototype, were built and sold before production was stopped in 1930 in order to allow Westland to concentrate on the <b>Wapiti</b> general-purpose military aircraft and the Wessex airliner.|$|E
25|$|Prey {{species of}} Siberian tigers include Manchurian <b>wapiti,</b> Siberian musk deer, long-tailed goral, moose, Siberian roe deer, Manchurian sika deer, wild boar, even {{sometimes}} small size Asian black bear and Ussuri brown bear. Siberian tigers also take smaller species like hares, rabbits, pikas and salmon as food.|$|E
25|$|The Parnall G.4/31 design {{would be}} as a {{replacement}} for the Westland <b>Wapiti</b> and Fairey Gordon. As such it needed to be usable as a day and night bomber as well as the reconnaissance, torpedo and dive-bombing roles. Designs were offered by Handley Page, Vickers, Fairey and Armstrong Whitworth as well as Parnall.|$|E
25|$|Historically, related deer {{species such}} as central Asian red deer, <b>wapiti,</b> Thorold's deer, and sika deer have been reared on deer farms in Central and Eastern Asia by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. In modern times, Western {{countries}} such as New Zealand and United States have taken to farming European red deer for similar purposes.|$|E
25|$|The only {{indigenous}} primary {{definitive host}} of F. magna is white-tailed deer. This species has been parasitized by the fluke {{for the longest}} time in historical context. <b>Wapiti</b> and caribou are of Eurasian origin and entered North America during the Pleistocene epoch, and overlapped with white-tailed deer in some parts of North America. They might have encountered F. magna in these shared biotopes.|$|E
25|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature {{originally}} listed nine subspecies of {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus): three as endangered, one as vulnerable, one as near threatened, and four without enough data {{to give a}} category (Data Deficient). The species as a whole, however, is listed as least concern. However, this {{was based on the}} traditional classification of red deer as one species (Cervus elaphus), including the <b>wapiti.</b> The western European red deer is also known as simply red deer.|$|E
25|$|Red {{deer are}} widely {{depicted}} in cave art found throughout European caves, {{with some of}} the artwork dating from as early as 40,000 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic. Siberian cave art from the Neolithic of 7,000 years ago has abundant depictions of red deer, including what can be described as spiritual artwork, indicating the importance of this mammal to the peoples of that region (Note: these animals were most likely <b>wapiti</b> (C. canadensis) in Siberia, not red deer).|$|E
25|$|The Indian Air Force was {{established}} in British India as an auxiliary air force of the Royal Air Force with {{the enactment of the}} Indian Air Force Act 1932 on 8 October that year and adopted the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia. On 1 April 1933, the IAF commissioned its first squadron, No.1 Squadron, with four Westland <b>Wapiti</b> biplanes and five Indian pilots. The Indian pilots were led by RAF Commanding officer Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) Cecil Bouchier.|$|E
25|$|The faunal {{complex of}} the region is {{represented}} by a mixture of Asian and boreal life forms. The ungulate complex is represented by seven species, with Manchurian <b>wapiti,</b> Siberian roe deer, and wild boar being the most common throughout the Sikhote-Alin mountains but rare in higher altitude spruce-fir forests. Sika deer are restricted to the southern half of the Sikhote-Alin mountains. Siberian musk deer and Amur moose {{are associated with the}} conifer forests and are near the southern limits of their distribution in the central Sikhote-Alin mountains.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the present Glasgow Airport goes back to 1932, when the site at Abbotsinch, between the Black Cart Water and the White Cart Water, near Paisley in Renfrewshire, was opened and the Royal Air Force 602 Squadron (City of Glasgow) Auxiliary Air Force moved its <b>Wapiti</b> IIA {{aircraft}} from nearby Renfrew in January 1933. The RAF Station HQ, however, was not formed until 1 July 1936 when 6 Auxiliary Group, Bomber Command, arrived. From May 1939, until moving away in October 1939, the Squadron flew the Supermarine Spitfire.|$|E
25|$|Three {{species have}} been identified. P. lakustai, from the <b>Wapiti</b> Formation, the bonebed horizon of which is roughly {{equivalent}} age to the upper Bearpaw and lower Horseshoe Canyon Formations, {{is known to have}} existed from about 73.5-72.5 million years ago. P. canadensis is younger, known only from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, about 71.5-71 Ma ago. Fossils of the youngest species, P. perotorum, have been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, and date to 70-69 million years ago. The presence of three known species makes this genus the most speciose among the centrosaurines.|$|E
