6000|$|The trail (it {{was not a}} road) {{ran like}} a graceful furrow over the hills, around little lakes covered deep with snow, through {{tamarack}} swamps <b>where</b> <b>the</b> tracks of <b>wild</b> <b>things</b> thickened, over ridges of tall pine clear of brush, and curving everywhere amid stumps, where dismantled old shanties marked {{the site of the}} older logging camps. Sometimes they met teams going to the store. Sometimes they crossed logging roads--wide, smooth tracks artificially iced, down which mountainous loads of logs were slipping, creaking and groaning. Sometimes they heard the dry click-clock of the woodsmen's axes, or the crash of falling trees deep in the wood. When they reached the first camp, Ridgeley pulled up the steaming horses at the door and shouted, [...] "Hello, the camp!" ...|$|R
60|$|From art, then, Darwin harks {{back once}} more to nature. He {{proceeds}} to show that variability occurs among all wild plants and animals, though not so frequently under ordinary circumstances {{as in the case}} of domesticated species. Individual differences everywhere occur between plant and plant, between animal and animal. Sometimes these differences are so very numerous that it is impossible to divide the individuals at all into well-marked kinds; for example, among British wild-roses, brambles, hawkweeds and epilobes, with a few other very variable families, Babington makes as many as 251 distinct species, where Bentham gives only 112--a margin of 139 doubtful forms of shadowy indefiniteness. Varieties, in fact, are always arising, and dominant species in particular always tend to vary most in every direction. The reason why variation is not so marked in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> state as under domestication is of course because the conditions are there less diverse; but <b>where</b> <b>the</b> conditions of <b>wild</b> <b>things</b> are most diverse, {{as in the case of}} dominant kinds, which range over a wide space of country or of ocean, abundant individual variations habitually occur. Local varieties thus produced are regarded by Darwin as incipient species: they are the raw material on which natural selection gradually exerts itself in the struggle for existence.|$|R
25|$|The band {{soon after}} began a {{longtime}} association with Blackout Records, who released {{some of their}} songs on the label's compilation <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are, in 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, {{he was able to}} allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others enjoying his often blunt and obscenity filled humor.|$|E

[...] Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth [...] "is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins". Copies of Outside Over There and <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room {{at the start of the}} film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, a book by Hans Christian Andersen, Grimms' Fairy Tales and Walt Disney's Snow White.

It also shares similarities with Maurice Sendak's book <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are, while Orrec's transformation in the novel has been compared to the biblical story of Jonah.|$|E

500|$|After losing out on {{the role}} of Lois Lane in two {{previous}} films about Superman, Adams secured the part in Zack Snyder's 2013 reboot, Man of Steel, starring Henry Cavill as the titular superhero. She played Lane with a mixture of toughness and vulnerability, but Peter Bradshaw thought that the character was [...] "sketchily conceived" [...] and criticized her lack of chemistry with Cavill. Even so, the film earned over $660 million to become one of her biggest box-office hits. Adams next featured in Her, a drama from the writer-director Spike Jonze about a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with an operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson); Adams played his close friend. She had unsuccessfully auditioned for Jonze's 2009 film <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are and was hired for Her after Jonze looked back at those tapes. Adams was drawn to the idea of portraying a platonic male-female friendship, which she believed was rare in film.|$|E

According to Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "The Climb" [...] was submitted for consideration by mistake. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the presenters of the Grammy Awards, released a statement stating, [...] "Walt Disney Records was proactive and forthcoming to our awards department and verified that the song was not written specifically for the film Hannah Montana: The Movie.

[...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest initial vote count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: Its not about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is easy when you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification".

500|$|The {{story is}} narrated by Orrec Caspro, {{the son of}} Canoc, master of the domain of Caspromant. The gift that his family {{possesses}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "unmake" [...] things, but his gift seems to manifest very late, and he is unable to control it. Later he seems to strike down his pet dog, and then destroy an entire hillside with his power. He decides the death was his fault, and horrified by the thought of his power out of control, demands that he be blindfolded. Orrec's battles with his power and its potential to destroy have been described {{as an example of a}} person's confrontation with their own shadow, a common theme in Le Guin's writing. The blindfold initially brings him some peace. Unable to see the real world, he lives within the stories that Melle has told him, Eventually he begins to retell the stories to his mother, and to add to them himself. When Melle asks to see his face without the blindfold one last time, he realizes he couldn't have hurt her, and feels the [...] "dry fury of impotent regret." [...] After his mother's death he descends into grief and rage, which he eventually emerges from with Gry's assistance. At Gry's suggestion he begins to remove his blindfold to read the books his mother writes for him.

Orrec's emotional journey during his blindfoldment has been compared to that of the biblical character Jonah, as well as to that of Max in the Maurice Sendak children's picture book <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are.|$|E

2500|$|The initial {{idea for}} Wild Things, and the Creatures, came about during the {{recording}} sessions for the Siouxsie and the Banshees album Juju. While bassist Steven Severin and guitarist John McGeoch took a break, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie created the song [...] "But Not Them." [...] Deciding {{that it was}} complete as a drum-and-voice piece, they left it alone, and quickly recorded four more minimal tracks to accompany it. The result was the Wild Things EP (so named by Severin, who upon hearing it, said it sounded like something the creatures in the book <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Things</b> Are would have danced to on their island). The only cover version of the ep was The Troggs' [...] "Wild Thing": Siouxsie included extra angry lyrics to the original: [...] "Wild thing, I think I hate you/but I wanna know for sure/so come on, hit me hard/I hate you". [...] "So Unreal" [...] drew inspiration from the novel The Stepford Wives by Ira Levin and [...] "Mad Eyed Screamer" [...] from local characters met in Hyde Park, London.
