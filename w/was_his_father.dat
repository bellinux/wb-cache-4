5|$|After {{learning}} that Jiraiya {{has been killed}} by the Akatsuki leader, Pain, Naruto prepares for a future encounter by learning toad-style Senjutsu, a power-enhancing ability involving the gathering of natural energy. When they finally face off, Naruto defeats Pain and convinces him to quit Akatsuki. At that time, Naruto learns that the Fourth Hokage <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> who sealed the Fox so that Naruto could use it to defeat the Akatsuki founder Tobi who was behind the Fox's attack on Konohagakure.|$|E
5|$|Poverty {{may have}} pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less happy and Van Gogh {{may have felt}} family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam {{when he was about}} 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in 1904.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated with images of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.|$|E

Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that {{his father and mother}} were worried sick since they didn't know where he <b>was.</b> <b>His</b> <b>father</b> reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the devastating effects of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and {{has no choice but to}} accept Leslie's death.|$|E
5|$|The younger Roger's {{family was}} a {{powerful}} one in England - not only <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> the Bishop of Salisbury, but he also held {{the administration of the}} government in his hands. The older Roger had the powers of the office of justiciar, without having actually been appointed to that office, as a continuation of the power he had held during {{the second part of the}} reign of Henry I. The elder Roger's two nephews Nigel, who was Bishop of Ely and had previously been Lord Treasurer, and Alexander, who was Bishop of Lincoln - both held important bishoprics, and another nephew or son held the Treasurership from 1136. This was Adelelm, who may have been a full brother to Roger le Poer. The family also controlled a number of castles throughout England. William of Malmesbury, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the younger Roger's appointment as chancellor was the price demanded by the elder Roger for the bishop's support of Stephen as king after the death of King Henry I. Roger served as chancellor from 1135 until 24 June 1139.|$|E

They {{returned to}} Genoa City and married. While Victor was in Kansas, Cole and Victoria had eloped, and when Victor revealed their sibling relation, the marriage was annulled. However, when Eve died, it was revealed that Cole was never Victor’s son; Victoria and Cole remarry. Victor and Hope later have a son, Victor Adam Newman Jr. Hope wanted to return to Kansas and Victor was not interested; he divorced her and Victor Jr. was raised without knowing Victor <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>father.</b> Nikki had been engaged to Brad, much to Victor’s dismay. On their wedding night, Victor was shot and Nikki returned to him; the mentally unstable Mari Jo Mason (Diana Barton) was revealed as the gunwoman. Victor and Nikki briefly reunite before he returns to Kansas after Hope’s new husband, Cliff Wilson, had died. In 1997, Victor marries Diane Jenkins (Alex Donnelley), Jack’s ex-girlfriend. Nikki had Victor have a vasectomy, but had frozen sperm for a future possibility.
