5|$|Another {{approach}} {{starts with}} the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory. Using the initial-value-formulation of general relativity (cf. evolution equations above), {{the result is the}} Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff. However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity. Space is represented by a <b>web-like</b> structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.|$|E
5|$|Russula emetica {{produces}} a white to yellowish-white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (<b>web-like)</b> surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8μm, and are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will stain blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in Melzer's reagent. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6μm. Cystidia located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4μm. They are yellowish, and contain granular contents. Cheilocystidia (found {{on the edges of}} the gills), which are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a <b>web-like</b> metal cutout {{representing}} the zodiac, which {{also features a}} Julian calendar dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
25|$|Ceratobasidium cornigerum is {{a species}} of fungus in the order Cantharellales. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are thin, spread on the {{substrate}} out like a film (effused) and <b>web-like.</b> A Rhizoctonia-like anamorphic state, sometimes referred to the genus Ceratorhiza, is frequently obtained when isolates are cultured. Ceratobasidium cornigerum is saprotrophic, but is also a facultative plant pathogen, causing a number of economically important crop diseases, and an orchid endomycorrhizal associate. The species is genetically diverse and is sometimes treated as a complex of closely related taxa.|$|E
25|$|In the {{perspective}} of encyclopedism, {{the emphasis is on}} developing a universal knowledge network. The first systematic attempt to create such an integrated system of the world's knowledge was the 18th century Encyclopédie of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. However, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the amount of knowledge had become too large to be published in a single synthetic volume. To tackle this problem, Paul Otlet founded the science of documentation, now called information science. In the 1930s he envisaged a World Wide <b>Web-like</b> system of associations between documents and telecommunication links that would make all the world's knowledge available immediately to anybody. H. G. Wells proposed a similar vision of a collaboratively developed world encyclopedia that would be constantly updated by a global university-like institution. He called this a World Brain, as it would function as a continuously updated memory for the planet.|$|E
500|$|The cap is [...] in diameter, convex to cushion-shaped. The cap {{surface is}} dry, and younger {{specimens}} {{are covered with}} characteristic spikes; as the spikes break up with age, they tend to look more hairy or woolly. Older specimens typically have the surface features worn off. The cap margin tends to be rolled inwards when young, gradually becoming straight with maturity. The color of the cap is bright or pale yellow, increasing in intensity towards {{the center of the}} cap. C.asprata has a <b>web-like</b> ring that soon disappears.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} of C.vinicolor has caps that are {{initially}} conical to convex before later flattening out, sometimes developing a small umbo, or a central depression; the caps measure [...] wide. Its color is highly variable, ranging from wine-red to reddish-brown to orange-brown or yellow-brown. Wine-red stains develop where the surface has dried or become rotten. The smooth cap surface is shiny, somewhat sticky when wet, and often radially streaked. The flesh is thick and orangish to ochraceous in color; its taste and odor have been variously described as [...] "not distinctive" [...] or [...] "pleasant". The thick gills are decurrent (attached to and extending a short ways down the stem), well spaced, ochraceous buff to pale orange when young, but turning to blackish after the spores mature. In his original description, Peck {{noted that the}} gills, when viewed with a hand lens, [...] "appear velvety due to the abundant spores". The fruit bodies are initially covered with a thin, <b>web-like</b> partial veil that soon disappears as the cap expands. The cylindrical stem measures [...] long by [...] thick, and taper towards the base. It is ochraceous to wine red or reddish-brown with a dry, smooth to [...] surface. The partial veil sometimes leaves an indistinct, thin fibrous ring on the upper stem.|$|E
500|$|To more {{successfully}} hunt {{fast and}} agile prey such as sea lions, {{the great white}} has adapted to maintain a body temperature warmer than the surrounding water. One of these adaptations is a [...] "rete mirabile" [...] (Latin for [...] "wonderful net"). This close <b>web-like</b> structure of veins and arteries, located along each lateral side of the shark, conserves heat by warming the cooler arterial blood with the venous blood that has been warmed by the working muscles. This keeps {{certain parts of the}} body (particularly the stomach) at temperatures up to 14°C (25°F) above that of the surrounding water, while the heart and gills remain at sea temperature. When conserving energy the core body temperature can drop to match the surroundings. A great white shark's success in raising its core temperature is an example of gigantothermy. Therefore, the great white shark can be considered an endothermic poikilotherm because its body temperature is not constant but is internally regulated. Great whites also rely on the fat and oils stored within their livers for long-distance migrations across nutrient-poor areas of the oceans. Studies by Stanford University and the Monterey Bay Aquarium published on 17 July 2013 revealed that In addition to controlling the sharks' buoyancy, the liver of great whites is essential in migration patterns. Sharks that sink faster during drift dives were revealed to use up their internal stores of energy quicker than those which sink in a dive at more leisurely rates.|$|E

2500|$|The order Embioptera, {{commonly}} known as webspinners, are {{a small group of}} mostly tropical and subtropical insects, classified under the subclass Pterygota. The order has also been referred to as Embiodea or Embiidina. The name Embioptera ("lively wings") comes from Greek, εμβιος, embios meaning [...] "lively" [...] and πτερον, pteron meaning [...] "wing", a name that has not been considered to be particularly descriptive for this group of fliers, perhaps instead referring to their remarkable speed of movement both forward and backward. The group probably first appeared during the Jurassic and is well represented in Cretaceous amber. The common name webspinner comes from the insects' unique ability to spin silk from structures on their front legs. They use the silk to make a <b>web-like</b> pouch or gallery in which they live.|$|E
2500|$|Instead {{of running}} {{statistical}} {{analysis on the}} distortion of galaxies {{based on the assumption}} of a positive weak lensing that usually reveals locations of positive mass [...] "dark clusters", these researchers propose to locate [...] "negative mass clumps" [...] using negative weak lensing, i.e. where the deformation of galaxies is interpreted as being due to a diverging lensing effect producing radial distortions (similar to a concave lens instead of the classical azimuthal distortions of convex lenses similar to the image produced by a fisheye). Such negative mass clumps would be located elsewhere than assumed dark clusters, as they would reside at the center of observed cosmic voids located between galaxy filaments within the lacunar, <b>web-like</b> large-scale structure of the universe. Such test based on negative weak lensing could help to falsify cosmological models proposing exotic matter of negative mass as an alternative interpretation to dark matter.|$|E

2500|$|Newman et al. (2006) {{inserted}} conductive and non-conductive fibers into a collagen-TERP scaffold (collagen cross-linked with a terpolymer of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNiPAAm) [...] ). The fibers were embedded by tightly wrapping {{them on a}} {{small glass}} slide and sandwiching a collagen-TERP solution between it and another glass slide; spacers between the glass slides set the gel thickness to 800µm. The conductive fibers were carbon fiber and Kevlar, and the nonconductive fibers were nylon-6 and tungsten wire. Neurites extend in all directions in thick bundles on the carbon fiber; however with the other three fibers, neurites extended in fine <b>web-like</b> conformations. The neurites showed no directional growth on the carbon and Kevlar fibers, but they grew along the nylon-6 fibers {{and to some extent}} along the tungsten wire. The tungsten wire and nylon-6 fiber scaffolds had neurites grow into the gel near the fiber-gel interface in addition to growing along the surface. All fiber gels except Kevlar showed a significant increase in neurite extension compared to non-fiber gels. There was no difference in the neurite extension between the non-conductive and the conductive fibers.|$|E

London sprawls low in the left-hand corner. The strongest glass cannot exhaust the skill and ingenuity of the maker of this drawing (an artist who, Mr Wagginhorne told me, was mad, poor thing--a man in a frenzy distemper--his very words). For when you peer close into this London, it takes {{the shape of a}} tusked, black, hairy boar, sprawling with hoofs outspread, fast asleep. And between them, and even actually diapering the carcass of the creature, is a perfect labyrinth of life--a high crowned king and queen, honey-hiving bees, an old man with a beard as if in a swoon, robbers with swords, travellers with beasts and torches, inns, a cluster of sharp-coloured butterflies (of the same proportion) fluttering over what looks like a clot of dung, a winding river, ships, trees, tombs, wasted unburied bodies, a child issuing from an egg, a phoenix taking flight: and so on. There is no end to this poor man's devices. The longer you look, the more strange things you discover.

[...] But these late London days, while her mind was in this unsatisfactory state, studying to deceive itself, had one great pleasure --the letters which came at intervals of two or three days from her loved friend. Even to her eyes they looked beautiful. The girl of the period, when she writes to her friend, usually dips the handle of her sunshade in a basin of ink, and scrawls characters monstrous in size and form, an insult to the paper-maker's art and shocking to man's aesthetic feelings.

60|$|Upon my entrance, Usher {{arose from}} a sofa {{on which he}} had been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it, I at first thought, of an {{overdone}} cordiality--of the constrained effort of the ennuyé man of the world. A glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect sincerity. We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not, I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe. Surely, man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood. Yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable. A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large, liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than <b>web-like</b> softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten. And now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke. The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even awed me. The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather than fell about the face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity.|$|E
