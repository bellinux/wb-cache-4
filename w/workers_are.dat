5|$|A queen will {{mate with}} one or more males, and during colony {{foundation}} she will hunt for food until the brood have fully developed. The life cycle of the ant from egg to adult takes several months. Myrmecia workers exhibit greater longevity in comparison to other ants, and <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> also able to reproduce with male ants. Myrmecia {{is one of the most}} primitive group of ants on earth, exhibiting differentiated behaviours from other ants. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> solitary hunters and do not lead other workers to food. Adults are omnivores that feed on sweet substances, but the larvae are carnivores that feed on captured prey. Very few predators eat these ants due to their sting, but their larvae are often consumed by blindsnakes and echidnas, and a number of parasites infect both adults and brood. Some species are also effective pollinators.|$|E

The city's many returning expatriates, investors and international community <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> among these establishments' main customers.

5|$|Since <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> {{required}} {{to live with}} their employers, they are vulnerable to working long hours; according to Amnesty International and welfare groups, some workers routinely work 16 to 18 hours a day and have no escape from abuse.|$|E
5|$|Suicidal defences by <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> {{also noted}} in a Brazilian ant, Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the {{security}} of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.|$|E

30|$|Before 1978, the {{construction}} industry used the relative easy production methods with brick and concrete structures, combining semi-industrial and on-site prefabrication. Enterprises <b>were</b> state-owned. <b>Workers</b> <b>were</b> both fixed and temporary workers. The fixed <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> the major part of {{the construction}} industry (Qi, 2011). Temporary <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> recruited from rural masons, carpenters and stunners, usually for tasks.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{the workers}} of more {{advanced}} social insects such as honeybees, bumblebee <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> fertile, and can lay unfertilised haploid eggs (with {{only a single}} set of chromosomes) that develop into viable male bumblebees. Only fertilised queens can lay diploid eggs (one set of chromosomes from a drone, one from the queen) that mature into workers and new queens.|$|E
5|$|Workers form {{foraging}} {{columns in}} search of food. They forage into buildings, eucalyptus trees, ground areas or on low vegetation. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> both diurnal and nocturnal, {{but they are not}} active throughout any 24-hour period. Low activity occurs during clear sunny days; however, colonies are extremely active shortly after rain.|$|E
5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them. Suicidal defenses by <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance from the outside each evening.|$|E

5|$|Banded sugar ants are the {{dominant}} group of nocturnal ants in their range. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> mostly encountered at dusk when they are foraging for food on marked trails or on Casuarina and Eucalyptus trees. These ants also forage during the day, but they are more frequently seen at night. They are also more active during the warmer seasons, especially summer. Banded sugar ants use multiple social techniques to make other ants follow them to a food source; this includes a worker carrying another worker, tandem running, or simply leaving a pheromone trail to the source. Around 2–35% of foraging workers engage in tandem running.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Consumer {{spending}} comprises 68% of the U.S. {{economy in}} 2015. In August 2010, the American labor force consisted of 154.1 million people.

About 12% of <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> unionized, compared to 30% in Western Europe. The World Bank ranks the United States first in the ease of hiring and firing workers. The United States is ranked among the top three in the Global Competitiveness Report as well. It has a smaller welfare state and redistributes less income through government action than European nations tend to.|$|E

5|$|Dunderdale also {{announced}} soon after being sworn {{in that she}} wanted to end a year-long strike on the Burin Peninsula that involved 15 home care workers. The government had been called on to settle the dispute but had refused to get involved seeing the <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> not direct employees of provincial government. Within 5 days of taking office Dunderdale's government reached an agreement with the workers which they unanimously accepted ending the 377-day strike.|$|E

5|$|In rural areas, women {{traditionally}} work alongside {{their family}} to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain {{the rights of}} women in factories, labor unions and organizations were built. In their homes, women take care of their children and cook.|$|E

5|$|In the thelytokous ant Platythyrea punctata, colonies are clonal; therefore, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> all equally related genetically, {{and worker}} {{policing}} {{is not expected}} {{as there is no}} genetic conflict. However, one would expect severe effects on the condition of the colony if reproductive workers were left unchecked. For example, more time spent on individual reproduction would be predicted to detract from care of the queen's offspring. In studies of these ants, workers did actually display worker policing, as evidenced by increased aggression towards reproductive workers. Worker policing here is favored for group efficiency.|$|E
5|$|India's {{labour force}} is growing by 2.5% every year, but {{employment}} is growing only at 2.3% a year. Official unemployment exceeds 9%. Regulation and other obstacles have discouraged {{the emergence of}} formal businesses and jobs. Almost 30% of <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> casual workers who work only when {{they are able to}} get jobs and remain unpaid {{for the rest of the}} time. Only 10% of the workforce is in regular employment. India's labour regulations are heavy even by developing country standards and analysts have urged the government to abolish them.|$|E
5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to their parent nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E
