In practice, the Government did not {{initially}} advertise the weekly rental, but emphasised the lease with the right to buy. The Act specified that workers could be male or female, but women were discouraged from applying for the houses because the Government was concerned that [...] "houses of ill-repute" [...] might be established.|$|E

The Ronzani Ballet Troupe performed October 6 - November 7. McKean Buchanan played one week. The theater was closed the week of December 7 to remodel its interior. When it reopened, on December 14, James M. Nixon was [...] "equestrian director", R. White was [...] "director of the arena", and Van Amburgh & Co. presented its [...] "grand equestrian, zoological, and hippo-dramatic company". The Van Amburgh run closed March 31. On April 5, the house reverted to drama for a four-week engagement by Emma Waller and her husband, Daniel Waller. (The acting manager was N. L. Griffin and the stage manager F. C. Wemyss.) They closed May 1, 1858, and E. A. Marshall ended his association with the Broadway Theatre. It was then offered for nightly or <b>weekly</b> <b>lease.</b> A testimonial to Thomas D. Rice was held May 14, [...] and a benefit for H. B. Phillips on May 22. Lola Montez lectured May 24 and continued for about two weeks, sometimes acting with A. W. Fenno.|$|E
