5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|Yvo of Chartres {{exercised}} {{a pronounced}} {{influence on the}} development of canon law (he died 1115 or 1117). <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> to Paul Fournier a study of his juridical activity.|$|E
60|$|The log-house {{was full}} of smoke, to which <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> our {{comparative}} safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears.|$|R

60|$|Our {{choice of}} a sailing-vessel in which to make the passage was due in a great part to our desire to keep company as long as {{possible}} with Captain Chesters and his wife, to whom we truly believed <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> each other.|$|R
25|$|The Chapel of the Virgin {{was built}} in 1687, {{following}} the plans of the architect Libéral Bruant, to whom <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> the Hotel des Invalides and the Hôpital de la Salpêtrière.|$|E
25|$|On the {{occasion}} of his 80th birthday celebration, he was presented with a two volume work, entitled Was wir Ernst Haeckel verdanken (What <b>We</b> <b>Owe</b> to Ernst Haeckel), edited {{at the request of}} the German Monistenbund by Heinrich Schmidt of Jena.|$|E
25|$|The {{classic example}} is the ear {{ossicles}} of mammals, which we know from paleontological and embryological studies originated in {{the upper and lower}} jaws and the hyoid bone of their synapsid ancestors, and further back still were part of the gill arches of early fish. <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> this esoteric knowledge to the comparative anatomists, who, a century ago, were {{at the cutting edge of}} evolutionary studies. The word exaptation was coined to cover these shifts in function, which are surprisingly common in evolutionary history. The origin of wings from feathers that were originally used for temperature regulation is a more recent discovery (see feathered dinosaurs).|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember {{what you}} felt weeks ago," [...] she began, with beseeching earnestness; [...] "remember what we both felt,--that <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> {{ourselves}} to others, and must conquer every inclination which could make us false to that debt. We {{have failed to}} keep our resolutions; but the wrong remains the same." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zandberg told South African media blogsite GrubStreet {{that while}} The Citizen had makeovers before, {{it was never}} {{to the extent of}} this one: [...] "If you put The Citizen next to other papers, it felt tired. We thought that <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> our readers a face lift, a better product and a better experience." ...|$|R

25|$|During {{this period}} Cousin {{seems to have}} turned with fresh {{interest}} to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation {{under the influence of}} Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work in this line, we have, besides the Des Pensées de Pascal, 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal (1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de Sable (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de Hautefort (1856). Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
25|$|After {{the accord}} of Melfi, Pope Niccolo II {{gave to the}} Normans the {{government}} of Calabria and Puglia. The Normans were very democratic and enterprising. <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> to them {{the creation of the}} Abbey of Sant' Eufemia Lamezia, the construction of the Sanctuary of the Madonna of Dipodi, the fortification of the Amato Plains and the introduction of the sugar cane. Under Norman rule the Amato Plains enjoyed peace and prosperity. Under their rule Pope Callistro II personally visited all the towns of the Amato Plains. During this visit he inaugurated the Sanctuary of Dipodi, consecrated the Cathedral of Nicastro, the Church of Mileto and then he went to Catanzaro to consecrate the Church Maggiore.|$|E
25|$|They declare openly {{that their}} God hath given them {{this country of}} land, and {{that sooner or later}} they must and will have {{possession}} of our lands for inheritance; and, in fine, they have conducted themselves on many other occasions, and such a manner, that we believe it a duty <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> to ourselves, our wives, and children, to the cause of public morals, to remove them from among us, as we are not prepared to give up our pleasant places and goodly possessions to them or to receive into the bosom of our families, as fit companions for wives and daughters, the degraded and corrupted free Negroes and mulattos that are now invited to settle among us.|$|E

60|$|At last--at {{last and}} for the first time in {{copyright}} history we are ahead of England! Ahead of her in two ways: by length of time and by fairness to all interests concerned. Does this sound like shouting? Then I must modify it: all we possessed of copyright-justice before the fourth of last March <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> to England's initiative.|$|R
50|$|<b>We</b> also <b>owe</b> Deschamps Recherches sur le théâtre français (1735, 3 vol. in-8°).|$|R
25|$|The {{names of}} those who {{suffered}} the indignity of imprisonment were Arthur Tooth, Vicar of St. James', Hatcham; R. W. Enraght, Rector of Holy Trinity, Bordesley; T. Pelham Dale, Rector of St. Vedast, Foster Lane, in the City of London; Sidney Faithorn Green, Rector of St John's, Miles Platting; and James Bell Cox, Vicar of St. Margaret's, Liverpool.... To these brave priests and many others who suffered <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> a great tribute of thankfulness and praise, for it was through their determination to stand by the Church in her hour of peril that we have won the tolerance and liberty we have today. The Act of Parliament under which these priests suffered {{is still on the}} Statute Book, but for all practical purposes it is dead.|$|E
25|$|Stubbs, that <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> a {{distinguishing}} feature of parish life still active today – the parish choir. Organ {{music has been}} part of parish life almost from the beginning, as was a parish choir, although from available records the quality of the early music program was not high. It is said that shortly after he became rector, Elisha Brooks Joyce received complaints {{about the quality of the}} music, so that he appointed George Wilmot, the parish’s first professional chorister. A decade later Wilmot was appointed the first music director and in 1893 he established a formally vested men’s and boys’ choir, which first performed for the Easter Service in 1894. The present Christ Church music program inherits the legacy established by Wilmot.|$|E
25|$|Datames {{appears to}} have {{obtained}} the highest reputation in his day for courage and ability in war, which caused his fame to extend even among the Greeks, {{though he did not}} come into personal collision with them. Cornelius Nepos (to whose biographical sketch <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> the only connected narrative of his life) calls him the bravest and most able of all non-Greek and non-Roman generals, except Hamilcar and Hannibal; but there is much confusion in the accounts transmitted to us, {{and it is difficult to}} assign the anecdotes of him recorded by Polyaenus to their proper place in his history. The chronology of the events related by Nepos is also very obscure; but according to that author and Diodorus it would appear that Datames must have died before Artaxerxes, probably 362 BC.|$|E
6000|$|In {{less than}} an hour she had traversed a {{distance}} of four miles, and arrived at a latticed cottage in a secluded spot. An elderly woman, scarce awake, answered her knocking. Margery delivered up the butter, and said, 'How is granny this morning? I can't stay to go up to her, but tell her I have returned what <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> her.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "From what I've {{heard about}} Mr. Harding, I don't {{think he would}} have presumed upon it," [...] Mrs. Mowbray replied. [...] "Besides, it looks as if <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> Lance's life to him and his {{companion}} and I really don't see why you object to the man. Of course, it was tactless of him to plow up our trail, but he was within his rights." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back? I doubt if the most ancient amongst them is much older than the century. It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, of course, this sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
25|$|This {{literature}} is remarkable {{for being in}} the vernacular (Old English) in the early medieval period: almost all other written literature was in Latin at this time, but due to Alfred's programme of vernacular literacy, the oral traditions of Anglo-Saxon England ended up being converted into writing and preserved. <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> much of this preservation to the monks of the tenth century, who made – {{at the very least}} – the copies of most of the literary manuscripts that still exist. Manuscripts were not common items. They were expensive and hard to make. First, cows or sheep had to be slaughtered and their skins tanned. Then people had to decide to use this leather for manuscripts rather than for any of the other things leather can be used for. The leather was then scraped, stretched, and cut into sheets, which were sewn into books. Then inks had to be made from oak galls and other ingredients, and the books had to be hand written by monks using quill pens. Every manuscript is slightly different from every other one, even if they are copies of each other, because every scribe had different handwriting and made different errors. We can sometimes identify individual scribes from their handwriting, and we can often guess where manuscripts were written because different scriptoria (centres of manuscript production) wrote in different styles of hand.|$|E
500|$|Kealoha {{represents}} many Hawaiian men and {{men from}} Hawaii {{who served in}} the Civil War who knew what they were getting into, who took a risk, and we all are the beneficiaries of that work and risk that they took ... <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> it to them to recognize that service.|$|E
6000|$|... "His enthusiasm, his courage, {{and devotion}} {{have been quite}} marvellous. And though <b>we</b> shall {{primarily}} <b>owe</b> {{the success of our}} enterprise to you, my dear, yet His Majesty feels as I do, that <b>we</b> also <b>owe</b> much to Monsieur de Stainville. Ah! mon Dieu! {{what it is to be}} young!" ...|$|R
60|$|We {{stopped at}} Mrs. Carson's, paid her what <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> her, and engaged {{her to go}} up to the tavern and put things in order. She was very sorry we were going, but hoped we would come back again some other summer. We said that it was quite {{possible}} that we might do so; but that, next time, we did not think we would try to have a tavern of our own.|$|R
60|$|To our consternation, {{the water}} in the breaker became lukewarm, brackish, and {{slightly}} putrescent; notwithstanding we kept our spare clothing piled upon the breaker, to shield it from the sun. At last, Jarl enlarged the vent, carefully keeping it exposed. To this precaution, doubtless, <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> more than <b>we</b> then thought. It was now deemed wise to reduce our allowance of water to the smallest modicum consistent with the present preservation of life; strangling all desire for more.|$|R
500|$|She {{was awarded}} a {{lifetime}} membership in the American Library Association, and the ALA named an annual award for the best gay or lesbian novel the Barbara Gittings Award. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) also named an activist award for her. At her memorial service, Matt Foreman, {{the executive director of}} the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force said, [...] "What do <b>we</b> <b>owe</b> Barbara? Everything." ...|$|E
500|$|On the signing, Governor Henry said [...] "Although {{the events}} of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and {{in the minds of}} Oklahomans who {{remember}} that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of {{the events of}} that day ... <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> it to the victims, the survivors and all of the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still means to this state and this nation." ...|$|E
500|$|Flags at CIA {{headquarters}} in Langley, Virginia, flew at half-staff. In {{a message to}} CIA employees, CIA Director Leon Panetta said: [...] "Those who fell yesterday were far from home {{and close to the}} enemy, doing the hard work that must be done to protect our country from terrorism. <b>We</b> <b>owe</b> them our deepest gratitude." [...] In an article published by the Washington Post, Panetta strongly defended the CIA officers against criticism, and disputed that lax security measures or blind trust in the informant enabled the attacker to succeed.|$|E

5000|$|The war in Europe {{ended with}} victory and nobody {{could have done}} that better than Marshal Zhukov - <b>we</b> <b>owed</b> him that credit. He is a modest person, and so we can't undervalue his {{position}} in our mind. When we can come back to our Motherland, there must be another type of Order in Russia, an Order named after Zhukov, which is awarded to everybody who can learn the bravery, the far vision, and the decisiveness of this soldier.
