Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric E-layer diminishes much more strongly than that of the F-layer. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.|$|E

40|$|The <b>winter</b> polar <b>vortex</b> in the Southern Hemisphere {{stratosphere}} {{is characterized}} by prominent quasi-stationary planetary waves: zonal wavenumber 1 (wave 1) and the eastward-traveling wave (wave 2). Quasi-periodic variations of the polar vortex are investigated {{in terms of the}} wave–wave interaction between wave 1 and wave 2 with both the NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset from 1979 to 2002 and a spherical barotropic model. A typical case shows that the transient wave 1 generated by the wave–wave interaction has comparable amplitude to those of the stationary wave 1 and the traveling wave 2, and has a node around 608 S, where these primary waves have large amplitude. The transient wave 1 travels eastward with the same angular frequency as that of the traveling wave 2. The polar night jet also vacillates with the same frequency such that it has its minimum when the stationary wave 1 and the transient wave 1 are in phase at the polar side of the node. The vacillation is basically due to quasi-periodic variations of the wave driven by the interference between the stationary and traveling wave 1 s. Similar periodic variations of the polar vortex are obtained in the model experiment here, in the circumstance that stationary wave 1 generated by surface topography has comparable amplitude to the eastward-traveling wave 2 that is generated by the barotropic instability of a forced mean zonal wind.

40|$|The {{main issue}} of this thesis has been to {{increase}} {{our understanding of the}} mechanisms by which the stratosphere can affect the tropospheric climate. The dynamical coupling of tropospheric and stratospheric circulation in the northern hemisphere was investigated by applying the new approach single wave analysis which combines a well-known theoretical concept of the coupling mechanism with the statistical analysis of observational datasets. The isolated features were used to interpret both the coupled modes of variability in tropospheric and stratospheric geopotential height fields and the changes in the estimated probability density function of these modes. The prominent result of this thesis is that winter seasons characterized either by an anomalously strong or weak polar <b>winter</b> <b>vortex</b> exhibit different tropospheric circulation regimes. Only {{in the case of a}} strong stratospheric polar vortex does a downward control of the tropospheric circulation by reflection of waves of zonal wave number (ZWN) one occur. This downward influence on the structure of tropospheric waves is considerably less than the influence of tropospheric disturbances on the structure of stratospheric waves of ZWN 1 and 2. This result confirms our understanding of the coupling of stratosphere and troposphere: Waves in the stratosphere originate in the troposphere, whereas the disturbances in the tropospheric circulation result mainly from internal processes. However, the findings also reveal that the two circulation regimes, characterized either by an preferred exaggeration of an anomalously strong or weak polar <b>winter</b> <b>vortex,</b> exhibit different tropospheric variability structures and are of high relevance to interannual and interdecadal climate variability.

In addition, with a 15. 95 -day period, Titan is a slow rotator compared to Earth. While the mean zonal terrestrial winds are geostrophic, Titan's are mostly cyclostrophic, whipping around the moon {{in as little as}} 1 day. Despite the different dynamical regime, Titan's winter stratosphere exhibits several characteristics that should be familiar to terrestrial meteorologists. The cold winter pole near the 1 -mbar level is circumscribed by strong winds (up to 190 m/s) that act as a barrier to mixing with airmasses at lower latitudes. There is evidence of enhancement of several organic species over the winter pole, indicating subsidence. The adiabatic heating associated with this subsidence gives rise to a warm anomaly at the 0. 01 -mbar level, raising the stratopause two scale heights above its location at equatorial latitudes.

Among the new features noted is a persistent maximum in dust mass mixing ratio at 15 – 25 km above the surface (at least on the nightside) during northern spring and summer. The water ice distribution is very sensitive to the diurnal and seasonal variation of temperature and is a good tracer of the vertically propagating tide...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{vorticity}} (PV) gradients {{defining the}} lower stratospheric vortex during the 1992 - 1993 winter were anomalously strong and persistent {{compared to those}} during the last 16 Arctic winters. For approximately equal to 3 months PV gradients were closer to typical Antarctic values than to most Arctic values. Air motion diagnostics computed for 3 -dimensional air parcels confirm that the 1992 - 1993 Arctic lower stratospheric vortex was substantially more isolated than is typical. Such isolation will delay and reduce the export of the higher ozone typical of the <b>winter</b> lower stratospheric <b>vortex</b> to mid-latitudes. This {{may have contributed to}} the record-low total ozone amounts observed in northern mid-latitudes in 1993...|$|R
40|$|Titan, after Venus, is {{the second}} example of an {{atmosphere}} with a global cyclostrophic circulation in the solar system, but a circulation that has a strong seasonal modulation in the middle atmosphere. Direct measurement of Titan's winds, particularly observations tracking the Huygens probe at 10 degS, indicate that the zonal winds are generally {{in the sense of}} the satellites rotation. They become cyclostrophic approx. 35 km above the surface and generally increase with altitude, with the exception of a sharp minimum centered near 75 km, where the wind velocity decreases to nearly zero. Zonal winds derived from the temperature field retrieved from Cassini measurements, using the thermal wind equation, indicate a strong <b>winter</b> circumpolar <b>vortex,</b> with maximum winds at mid northern latitudes of 190 ms-' near 300 km. Above this level, the vortex decays. Curiously, the zonal winds and temperatures are symmetric about a pole that is offset from the surface pole by approx. 4 degrees. The cause of this is not well understood, but it may reflect the response of a cyclostrophic circulation to the offset between the equator, where the distance to the rotation axis is greatest, and the solar equator. The mean meridional circulation can be inferred from the temperature field and the meridional distribution of organic molecules and condensates and hazes. Both the warm temperatures in the north polar region near 400 km and the enhanced concentration of several organic molecules suggests subsidence there during winter and early spring. Stratospheric condensates are localized at high northern latitudes, with a sharp cut-off near 50 degN. Titan's <b>winter</b> polar <b>vortex</b> appears to share many of the same characteristics of winter vortices on Earth-the ozone holes. Global mapping of temperatures, winds, and composition in he troposphere, by contrast, is incomplete. The few suitable discrete clouds that have bee found for tracking indicate smaller velocities than aloft, consistent with the Huygens measurements. At low latitudes the zonal winds near the surface appear not to be westward as on Earth, but eastward. Because the net zonal-mean time-averaged torq exerted by the surface on the atmosphere should vanish, this implies westward flow o part of the surface; the question is where. The latitude contrast in tropospheric temperatures, deduced from radio occultations at low, mid, and high latitudes, is small approx. 5 K at the tropopause and approx. 3 K at the surface...|$|R
