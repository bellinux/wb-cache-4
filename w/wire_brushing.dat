When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle <b>wire</b> <b>brush,</b> as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause rust spots to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. <b>Wire</b> <b>brushes</b> are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs.

5000|$|Many modern reproductions do {{not have}} natural hamon because they are {{thoroughly}} hardened monosteel; {{the appearance of a}} hamon is reproduced via various processes such as acid etching, sandblasting, or more crude ones such as <b>wire</b> <b>brushing.</b> Some modern reproductions with natural hamons are also subjected to acid etching to enhance their hamons' prominence. A true hamon can be easily discerned by the presence of a [...] "nioi," [...] which is a bright, speckled line a few millimeters wide, following the length of the hamon. The nioi is typically best viewed at long angles, and cannot be faked with etching or other methods. When viewed through a magnifying lens, the nioi appears as a sparkly line, being made up of many bright martensite grains, which are surrounded by darker, softer pearlite.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{inclusions}}: linear inclusions and rounded inclusions. Inclusions can be either isolated or cumulative. Linear inclusions occur when there is slag or flux in the weld. Slag forms from the use of a flux, which is why this type of defect usually occurs in welding processes that use flux, such as shielded metal arc welding, flux-cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding, but it can also occur in gas metal arc welding. This defect usually occurs in welds that require multiple passes and there is poor overlap between the welds. The poor overlap does not allow the slag from the previous weld to melt out and rise {{to the top of the}} new weld bead. It can also occur if the previous weld left an undercut or an uneven surface profile. To prevent slag inclusions the slag should be cleaned from the weld bead between passes via grinding, <b>wire</b> <b>brushing,</b> or chipping.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: External bonding {{of steel}} plates to {{structural}} concrete members has widely gained popularity in recent years, particularly for repairing and strengthening reinforced concrete beams. The {{success of this}} bonding technique depends {{on the effectiveness of}} the surface preparation of the steel and concrete beams. Studies have shown that most of the beams strengthened using this technique usually fail prematurely by debonding. In this study, concrete beams with different types of surface preparations were investigated, such as no surface preparation (NSP), <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> (WB), scabbling (SC) and hand chipping (HC). The quality of the surface preparation established was measured based on the flexural performance of the externally strengthened steel-concrete beams. Eight (8), 250 x 450 x 3600 mm reinforced concrete beams were prepared and strengthened with glued steel plates on their soffits. All the specimens were tested under two-point static loading and failure modes were observed. The results showed that beams with rougher surface preparation have a high bond strength as compared to smoother surface preparations. The increase in the average capacity of strengthened beams with the surface prepared by hand-chipping, scabbling, <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> was found to be 75. 3 %, 67. 5 % and 46. 9 % respectively, compared to the capacity of the beam strengthened without surface preparation...|$|E

40|$|An {{ultrafine}} grain {{surface layer}} with average crystallite size of 28 nm was produced on annealed mild steel through a <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process. The effects of {{grain size reduction}} on the inhibition performance of sodium phosphate were investigated using polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. The crystal grain size of wire brushed surface was analyzed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The electrochemical tests were conducted in artificial sea water (ASW) in the presence and absence of 250 mg/lit sodium phosphate (SP). The wire brushed surface indicated considerable deformed plastic flows and high surface roughness. Due to the accumulated strains, a deformed layer with thickness of 20 ± 5 μm was produced and the crystal grain size of severe deformed zone was about 28 nm. Wire brushed surface increased uniform corrosion rate of mild steel due to enhanced surface roughness and preferential sites to adsorption of corrosive ions. However, the wire brushed surface showed {{a positive effect on}} inhibition performance of sodium phosphate. The electrochemical results revealed that average inhibition efficiency increased from 65 to about 80 percent in ASW solution containing 1. 5 mM Na 3 PO 4 for coarse grained samples in comparison to that of ultra-fined grain samples respectively. The <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> process encouraged passivity on the surface in SP-containing solution due to a high density of nucleation sites which increased the adsorption of phosphate ions leading to a high fraction of passive layers and low corrosion rates...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> {{hammering}} on {{low cycle fatigue}} behaviour of AISI 316 austenitic stainless steel has been investigated on turned samples through an experimental study combining strain controlled fatigue tests, scanning electron microscope examination and X-ray diffraction analysis.

40|$|New {{problems}} arise in urban weed control on hard surfaces {{as a direct}} response {{to the use of}} new methods and reduced economical resources. Weed established on hard surfaces involve esthetic, functional as well as technical problems. Numerous of hard surfaces in urban areas in Sweden were constructed when chemical weed control was permitted without restrictions. The aim of this investigation was to study the number of treatment and labor required for different methods of urban weed control. The energy use and the amount of carbon dioxide emission for the methods were also calculated. The experiments were carried out (May until November, in l 996) in two cities in southern Sweden; Lund and Ystad. The investigated methods, which were studied as single methods and in different combinations, was flaming, brushing (wire brush and steel brush), sweeping, acetic acid, glyphosate and manual weeding. This study shows that manual weeding and the use of glyphosate needed least amount of treatment (2 times) per year while wire brush combined with sweeper needed the largest amount (8 times). Calculated per treatment manual weeding was the least energy consuming method while <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> with truck was the most energy consuming. With the exception of manual weeding glyphosate (manual spraying and sweeping) gave the least energy consuming and the least carbon dioxide generating method over the season while <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> with truck was both the greatest energy consuming method and the greatest emittor of carbon dioxide. Neither an energy analysis nor a calculation of carbon dioxide emission can answer the question which one of the methods has the least environmental impact. The energy consumption and the carbon dioxide emission should be looked upon as one of many parameters in a more extensive basis of resolution. If used on other locations it is needed to deduct a recalculation based upon the local circumstances. Future weed control will involve the use of different methods such as chemical, mechanical and thermal methods. Weed control has to be a result of a combination of preventive and different direct weed control methods. In a sustainable society weed control according to requirements is recommended...|$|E
40|$|Post {{machining}} operations such as borescope inspection {{can cause}} linear indications {{down the length}} of the bore of fill stems. Often these indications are removed or obscured using rotary <b>wire</b> <b>brushing.</b> This study evaluated the effect this mechanical operation may have on pinch weld quality when relatively cold welds were made.

On average, the bond rating was a higher value (worse) for the brushed areas than the unadulterated areas for both Type 304 L and 21 - 6 - 9 stems.

40|$|International audienceThe {{localised}} {{corrosion resistance}} of {{austenitic stainless steels}} is strongly influenced {{by the quality of}} finished surface. EDM machining induces substantial changes by the high thermal gradients generated by electric sparks. Experimental techniques such as roughness measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive microanalysis (EDX) and X-ray diffraction technique, reveal microgeometrical, microstructural, chemical and mechanical changes. These changes lead to white and heat-affected layers with a depth less than 100 μm. The white layer is a melted material characterised by dendritic structure and constituted by austenite, chromium carbide and ε-carbide. The heat-affected layer is characterised by very large grain size comparatively to the bulk material. Electrochemical test coupled with metallographic examinations using SEM reveals a weakening of the resistance to pitting and intergranular corrosion comparatively to diamond polished surface. This weakening is correlated to differences in structure and chemical composition of white layer. Susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking has been attributed to the field of tensile residual stresses resulting from thermal effects. The removal of the white layer material by polishing or <b>wire</b> <b>brushing</b> restores the corrosion resistance of the AISI 316 L SS...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hammering}} by <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> {{as a method}} of improving low cycle fatigue life of highly ductile austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 have been investigated through an experimental study combining imposed strain fatigue tests and assessment of surface characteristic changes under cyclic loading by SEM examinations and XRD analysis. It has been shown that the fatigue life of <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammered surface was increased by 307 % at an imposed strain rate of 0. 2 % and only 17 % at an imposed strain rate of 0. 5 %, comparatively to the turned surface. This increase in fatigue life is explained in terms of fatigue damage that is related to crack networks characteristics and stability which are generated during fatigue on both turned and <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammered surfaces. The improvement of brushed surface is attributed {{to the role of the}} surface topography, the near surface stabilized compressive residual stresses and superﬁ-cial cold work hardening on the fatigue crack network nucleation and growth. It is found that <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammering produces a surface texture that favors, under cyclic loading, nucleation of randomly dispersed short cracks of the order of 40 lm in length stabilized by the compressive residual stress ﬁeld that reached a value of r 0 = 749 MPa. In contrast, turned surface showed much longer unstable cracks of the order of 200 lm in length nucleated in the machining groves with high tendency to propagate under the effect of tensile residual stress ﬁeld that reached value of r 0 = 476 MPa. This improvement is limited to strain rates lower than 0. 5 %. At higher strain rates, a cyclic plastic deformation induced martensitic phase alters furthermore the fatigue behavior by producing high cyclic strengthening of the bulk mate-rial. This phenomenon lead to a reduction in strain imposed fatigue life. It has also been established that <b>wire</b> <b>brush</b> hammering can be used as an onsite surface treatment to improve the residual fatigue life of components subjected to cyclic loading.
