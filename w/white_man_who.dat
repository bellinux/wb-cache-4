25|$|Many of the Mexicans {{who were}} native {{to what would}} become a state within the United States were {{experienced}} miners, and they had great success mining gold in California. Their success aroused animosity by white prospectors, who intimidated Mexican miners {{with the threat of}} violence and committed violence against some. Between 1848 and 1860, white Americans lynched at least 163 Mexicans in California alone. On July 5, 1851, a mob in Downieville, California, lynched a Mexican woman named Josefa Segovia. She was accused of killing a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had attempted to assault her after breaking into her home.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{military}} leadership of Toussaint, the forces made up mostly of former slaves succeeded in winning concessions from the British and expelling the Spanish forces. In the end, Toussaint essentially restored control of Saint-Domingue to France. Louverture was very intelligent, organized and articulate. Having made himself {{master of the}} island, however, Toussaint {{did not wish to}} surrender too much power to France. He began to rule the country as an effectively autonomous entity. Louverture overcame a succession of local rivals, including: the Commissioner Sonthonax, a French <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> gained support from many Haitians, angering Louverture; André Rigaud, a free man of color who fought to keep control of the South in the War of Knives; and Comte d'Hédouville. Hédouville forced a fatal wedge between Rigaud and Louverture before he escaped to France. Toussaint defeated a British expeditionary force in 1798. In addition, he led an invasion of neighboring Santo Domingo (December 1800), and freed the slaves there on January 3, 1801.|$|E

His ironic lyrics ask in the chorus, [...] "Lord tell me why a white man / Ain't worth nothin' in this world no more." [...] The guitar-based [...] "I Want My Crown" [...] was recorded with an 11-piece band and has an aggressive blues style, rumba-rock groove, and growling vocals. The song is an indictment of politicians as [...] "Judas men" [...] who sided with oil barons and Republicans, and their greed that leads to war.

500|$|Knight {{states that}} Clarence13X's {{psychiatric}} results were not processed for an unusually long time; he posits that the delay {{was due to}} FBI involvement and argues that Clarence13X was a political prisoner. In November 1965, Clarence13X was ruled incompetent to stand trial and committed to the New York State Department of Mental Hygiene, which placed him at the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. After he declared himself Allah and a [...] "Master Gambler", the doctors concluded that he had schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type with delusions of grandeur; he faced indefinite commitment.

As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If I could find a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E

The Lions soon confront the Geminis and their men, and in the ensuing fight, Poison Dagger assassinates the Geminis and the Lions capture the gold. Jack later arrives to investigate the incident and learns that the Geminis were poisoned with mercury-tipped weapons, leading him to the blacksmith. The Lions' theft prompts the governor to send his Jackal troops to recover the shipment or destroy the village. Zen-Yi asks the blacksmith to craft him a new suit of weaponized armor. The Lions suspect that the blacksmith is helping Zen-Yi and have him tortured for information. The blacksmith refuses to talk, and Brass cuts off [...] his forearms. Jack, who had been following the blacksmith, saves him from bleeding to death. While the blacksmith recovers, he tells Jack of his past as an emancipated American slave who accidentally killed a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> refused to let him go. He fled America by boat and went to China, where monks trained him to use his body's energy to perform superhuman feats. Jack {{with the aid of}} the blacksmith crafts his greatest weapon: a pair of iron forearms that he can animate using this energy.|$|E
500|$|Beyond cricket, Headley's {{success was}} {{regarded}} as important. Of Headley's meeting with the king of England in 1939, the West Indian writer Frank Birbalsingh said: [...] "That one of us—a black man—could shake {{the hand of a}} king introduced possibilities formerly undreamt of in our colonial backwater of racial inferiority, psychological subordination and political powerlessness." [...] Manley notes that Headley rose to success at a time of political awakening in Jamaica, when the black majority of the population were increasingly determined to end the minority rule of landowners and challenge the racism of the time. According to Manley, the middle classes saw in Headley [...] "the reassurance which they needed. He demonstrated black capacity." [...] The white upper classes were proud of his achievements as a West Indian, but Manley writes [...] "it was to the black masses that Headley had the deepest significance... became the focus for longing of an entire people for proof: proof of their own self-worth, their own capacity. Furthermore, they wanted this proof to be laid {{at the door of the}} <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> owned the world which defined their circumstances." [...] Manley sees the title of [...] "Atlas" [...] not just in sporting terms, but in his carrying [...] "the hopes of the black, English-speaking Caribbean man... He was black excellence personified in a white world and in a white sport." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{his second}} season at Nelson, Constantine joined the first West Indies team to tour Australia in the 1930–31 season. The side felt some {{trepidation}} over how the black members of the side would be received, but the tour passed off without incident; Constantine later praised the reception the team was accorded. The West Indians were captained by Jackie Grant, a <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had played for Cambridge University but was unfamiliar with his team. Constantine considered this unsatisfactory, and felt it affected the team's performances. The West Indies were heavily defeated in the five-Test series, losing the first four matches before winning the last. Constantine achieved little in the series, scoring 72 runs at 7.20 and taking eight wickets at 50.87. In other first-class games, he was more successful and, although Headley performed very well, it was Constantine who proved most popular with spectators. Even before the Tests began, his fielding drew praise from the press and he was described in The Sydney Mail as the fastest bowler seen in Australia for years. Monty Noble, a former Australian captain, writing in the Sydney Sun described one innings of 59 runs as [...] "sensational" [...] {{and one of the}} best played in Australia since the war. Constantine scored a century in 52 minutes against Tasmania, played five other innings over fifty and took three five-wicket returns. In 1950 Donald Bradman, who played against Constantine that season, described him as the greatest fielder he had seen. In all first-class matches, Constantine scored 708 runs at an average of 30.78 and took 47 wickets at 20.21; he led the team's bowling averages and came fourth in batting.|$|E
500|$|During this period, Pierce {{worked as}} set {{decorator}} on films The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Cheap Detective (1978). The year after The Town That Dreaded Sundown, Piece directed and co-wrote Grayeagle, a Western {{based on a}} Cheyenne legend of a white man whose child (with an Indian wife) is kidnapped by a young warrior named Grayeagle. Pierce appeared in the film as Bugler, a half-insane <b>white</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> takes on a Shoshone identity. He then wrote and directed The Norseman (1978), which starred Lee Majors as a Viking prince who traveled to America to rescue his father from Indians. Working with a multimillion-dollar budget, Pierce shot the film in the Florida locations Hillsborough River State Park and New Port Richey. The next year he co-wrote and directed The Evictors (1979), another documentary-style horror film about a young couple who move into a rural Louisiana farmhouse and find their lives endangered {{by a series of}} strange events. Pierce was inspired to write the script after reading a true story in a detective magazine about a Kansas family who murdered somebody trying to evict them from the property. In order to match the late-evening sunlight in his cinematography at the farmhouse set, Pierce set up reflectors outside and deflected the sunlight through the windows, which were fitted with sheer white curtains to give the actors an eerie glow. The Evictors was little-seen and did not do financially well, which was a disappointment to distributor American International Pictures, but Pierce believed it one of his better films. He also considered it his most downbeat film, and said of the unhappy ending, [...] "I probably just didn't have any other way to end it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Delany {{supported}} the Democratic candidate Wade Hampton in the 1876 gubernatorial election. Partly {{as a result}} of black swing votes encouraged by Delany, Hampton was elected. Much more significant to his victory was the intimidation and violence practiced by [...] "rifle clubs" [...] and the Red Shirts, a paramilitary group of mostly <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> <b>who</b> worked to suppress black voting at the polls. Historian George C. Rable described them as acting as [...] "the military arm of the Democratic Party." [...] By 1876, there were estimated to be 20,000 <b>white</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were members of rifle clubs in the state. More than 150 blacks were killed in violence related to the election.|$|R
