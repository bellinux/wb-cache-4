5|$|Traditionally {{the work}} was {{ascribed}} to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text. The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined {{to believe that the}} work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194. Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. <b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.|$|E
5|$|After an interregnum {{prompted}} by Eorpwald's assassination, Sigeberht returned from Gaul to become {{ruler of the}} East Angles. It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means, because his prowess as a commander was later remembered. During his reign, part of the kingdom was governed by Ecgric his 'kinsman', a relationship described by the Latin term cognatus. This may mean that Ecgric was a son of Rædwald. However, the historian Steven Plunkett is amongst those that consider Ecgric {{to be the same}} person as Æthelric, named in the East Anglian tally (in the Anglian collection) as a son of Eni, Rædwald's brother. <b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> pagan Ecgric was, Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled, because the influence of his religious patronage was felt throughout his kingdom.|$|E

25|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> architect, {{nevertheless}} a great mansion arose. Today {{only one}} {{other part of the}} Tudor mansion survives: the great tower in the centre of the east facade (see illustration above). With its central arch (once giving access to the court beyond) and three floors of oriel windows above, the tower is slightly reminiscent of the entrance at Hampton Court. Flanked today by two wings in a loose Georgian style – each topped by an Italianate pavilion tower, this Tudor centrepiece of the facade appears not in the least incongruous, merely displaying the accepted appearance of a great English country house, which has evolved over the centuries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> {{architect}} was, the {{new south}} wing was intended to transform Brympton d'Evercy from a country manor to a grand house. Of ten bays, the two storied building housed on its ground floor the finest and most lavishly decorated rooms of the house. Known as the state apartments, they follow an arrangement common in houses built before circa 1720 where important guests were received and stayed. Basically they were a large bedroom suite or apartment, with all the rooms on an , connected by large double doors creating an enfilade. The first, largest and grandest room, known as the salon, was intended for the visiting dignitary to grant audience to the household, all of whom would be permitted access to this room. The following room was a large withdrawing room, slightly less grand; here the honoured guest would receive more privately than in the saloon. The next room followed the same pattern, each space becoming more intimate and private as the enfilade progressed. The final, and most private room, was the state bedroom: beyond this were two small closets for staff and private ablutions. This suite pattern of Baroque apartments exists in large houses all over England; in the very largest, such as Blenheim Palace, {{it was possible to}} have two such suites branching off from either side of the saloon. However Brympton d'Evercy was not a large or very grand house. Why Brympton d'Evercy needed a suite of state apartments has never been truly answered. It has often been said they were built for an intended visit of Queen Anne, but they were at the very least ten years old when she ascended the throne, and she certainly never visited the house. The state bed remained in situ until 1956, but was never slept in by a sovereign. Circa 1720 the fashion for state rooms became antiquated, and they were often transformed for more general and frequent use. This was true at Brympton d'Evercy: the saloon became the Drawing room, the following room became known as the Oak or small drawing room, the next room the dining room, and only the state bedroom remained in solitary magnificence, slept in by honoured, but non-royal guests. At Brympton d'Evercy these {{were more likely to be}} talented cricketers than esteemed potentates.|$|E
500|$|The hit single [...] "Basket Case", which {{appeared}} on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder.

500|$|Though impressive, the {{original}} palazzo {{would have been}} no rival to the Florentine Medici residences in terms of either size or content. <b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> architect of the Palazzo Pitti was, he was moving against the contemporary flow of fashion. [...] The rusticated stonework gives the palazzo a severe and powerful atmosphere, reinforced by the three-times-repeated series of seven arch-headed apertures, reminiscent of a Roman aqueduct. The Roman-style architecture appealed to the Florentine love of the new style all'antica. [...] This original design has withstood the test of time: the repetitive formula of the façade was continued during the subsequent additions to the palazzo, and its influence can be seen in numerous 16th-century imitations and 19th-century revivals. Work stopped after Pitti suffered financial losses following the death of Cosimo de' Medici in 1464. [...] Luca Pitti died in 1472 with the building unfinished.|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{was also}} an {{advocate}} and supporter of Asian-American cinema, famously coming {{to the defense of}} the cast and crew of Justin Lin's Better Luck Tomorrow (2002) during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian-Americans and Americans. Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing to a bunch of white filmmakers: how could you do this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} <b>whoever</b> <b>the</b> hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E

The project was originally designed as a part of Trenier's promotional strategy to transform D'Angelo's image and public appeal. On the video's concept, Trenier stated, [...] "the idea was, it would feel like one-on-one with <b>whoever</b> <b>the</b> woman was." [...] D'Angelo, who had been under intense physical workout with personal trainer Mark Jenkins, was initially anxious to appear naked in the video upon hearing Trenier's proposal. In a 2008 interview for Spin, Jenkins discussed D'Angelo's reluctance at the time to the idea for the video, stating [...] "You've got to realize, he'd never looked like that before in his life. To somebody who was so introverted, and then, in a matter of three or four months, to be so ripped-everything was happening so quickly." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2001, MLB {{formed a}} scoring {{committee}} {{to evaluate the}} performance of official scorers. In 2008, the scoring committee was given the authority to enforce the portion of rule 10.01(a) which allows the league to change a scoring decision that is [...] "clearly erroneous". The committee has used this authority on only a few occasions, having overturned three scoring decisions in the 2009 season. The scoring committee came under some scrutiny after a game on August 31, 2008. Milwaukee pitcher C.C. Sabathia threw a disputed 7–0 one-hit shutout at Pittsburgh. Milwaukee manager Ned Yost argued that the hit recorded by Pittsburgh should have been recorded as an error by the pitcher, but Pittsburgh official scorer Bob Webb disagreed. Yost commented, [...] "That's a joke. That wasn't even close. <b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> scorekeeper was absolutely denied major league baseball a nice no-hitter right there." [...] The official scorer had argued that the batter {{was too close to}} first base to be put out by a clean play. Milwaukee appealed the ruling to the scoring committee, but on September 3 the committee reviewed the footage and supported the ruling by Webb, saying the ruling was not [...] "clearly erroneous" [...] as required by rule 10.01(a).|$|E
500|$|<b>Whoever</b> <b>the</b> architect, Belton follows {{closely the}} design of Clarendon House, {{completed}} in 1667. This great London town house (demolished c. 1683) {{has been one of}} the most admired buildings of its era due to [...] "its elegant symmetry and confident and common-sensical design". Sir John Summerson described Clarendon House as [...] "the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner" [...] and Belton as [...] "much the finest surviving example of its class". John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This dream team was headed by the master mason William Stanton who oversaw the project. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter's London churches, while the chief joiner John Sturges had worked at Chatsworth under William Talman. The wrought-ironworker John Warren worked under Stanton at Denham Place, Buckinghamshire, and the fine wrought iron gates and overthrow at Belton may be his. Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton.|$|E
500|$|Representing {{as he did}} a {{state in}} the Deep South, Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance {{on the issues that}} were tearing the nation apart. The {{occasion}} arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union. Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas, and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it. Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two-hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general, following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as [...] "probably his most effective speech in the Senate." [...] One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave-holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule. Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by [...] "the people," [...] he said: [...] "States have conferred, and may at any time confer, their whole political power on a minority. They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate, upon the payment of tax, upon militia duty, or upon the color of skin; but <b>whoever</b> <b>the</b> State chooses to confer her political authority upon, are the people." [...] He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave-holding states, although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession. He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened: [...] "It is not for me to indicate the path she [...] may, in her wisdom, pursue; but, sir, ... my whole heart is with her, and she will find me treading it with undivided affections." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} clear {{reference to}} the Avar ethnonym comes from Priscus the Rhetor (died after 472 AD).

In turn, the Avars had been driven off by people fleeing [...] "man-eating griffins" [...] coming from [...] "the ocean" [...] (Priscus Fr 40).
