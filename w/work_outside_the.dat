China has seen a decrease in domestic violence due to government-supported grassroots programs to counter these practices. Women in rural areas remain largely uneducated.|$|E

5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against the prejudices which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, the Engineering Experiment Station was {{producing}} useful technology, and the station needed {{a method to}} conduct contract <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> state budget.

The IDC was created as a non-profit contract organization for the EES, which allowed the EES to receive federal contracts while still retaining its relationship with Georgia Tech and the State of Georgia. It {{was created by the}} Chancellor of the University System and the president of Georgia Power Company, and the Engineering Experiment Station's director {{was a member of the}} council. The IDC later became the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, which currently serves as the sole contract organization for all Georgia Tech faculty and departments.

5|$|World War II had a {{significant}} impact on changing family roles. Because of the draft, workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women, mainly in nontraditional positions. This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for <b>work</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> home. Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period. Not only had many women found a new sense of independence, but cultural shifts were underway, including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control. Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages.|$|E
