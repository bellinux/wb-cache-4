In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I can assure you that it is no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E

I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't {{understand why you}} did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but you chose to put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E

As well as capturing all the {{guns on the}} Schellenberg the Allies captured all the regimental colours (apart from de la Colonie's Grenadiers Rouge Régiment), their ammunition, baggage and other rich booty. But the large casualty figures caused some consternation throughout the Grand Alliance. Although the Dutch cast a victory medal showing Baden on the obverse and a Latin inscription on the other side, {{there was no mention}} of the Duke of Marlborough. The Emperor, though, wrote personally to the Duke: [...] "Nothing can be more glorious than the celerity and vigour <b>with</b> <b>which...</b> <b>you</b> forced the camp of the enemy at Donauwörth". With the town abandoned that night by Colonel DuBordet, the Elector, who had arrived within sight of the battle with reinforcements only to see the flight and massacre of his best troops, drew his garrisons out of Neuburg and Ratisbon, and fell back behind the river Lech near Augsburg.|$|E

500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off in the far distance against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

2500|$|In 1801, David Hartley first {{postulated}} that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|E

[...] He [...] also admonished her for speaking directly and honestly in her own defense [...] instead of hiring an attorney, which would have allowed her case [...] to [...] have been presented in a [...] "far more favorable light'.

2500|$|A {{requirement}} that a defendant {{who headed the}} [...] "Pure American Freedom Party" [...] and was convicted of possessing an unregistered firearm avoid associating with other skinheads and neo-Nazis was upheld. Similar conditions have been upheld in other cases involving firearms and explosives violations, including the case of James Ross, who passed out flyers for National Alliance, owners of Resistance Records, the creators of the video game Ethnic Cleansing. Likewise, a condition preventing a that a defendant convicted of unlawfully importing firearms into the United Kingdom from participating in any American Irish Republican movement, from belonging [...] to any Irish organization, from participating in any Irish Catholic [...] organization, from visiting any Irish pubs, and from accepting [...] employment that would directly or indirectly associate him with any [...] Irish organization, was upheld. In the Smith case, a defendant convicted of unlawfully wearing a military uniform {{as part of an}} anti-war skit was ordered to [...] "forego any association whatever with the Students for Democratic Society [...] Organization," [...] and to [...] "Discontinue your association with the members of [...] the Humanists group <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> violated the law."

2500|$|The Persian king Ardesher advised his lawyers, secretaries, officers, and husbandmen to [...] "marry near {{relatives}} for {{the sympathy}} of kinship is kept alive thereby." [...] The same motivation {{is given in}} ancient Arabic sources referring {{to the practice of}} marriage between paternal cousins prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The Kitab al-Aghani similarly features the story of Qays ibn Dharih, who was not allowed by his father to marry a beautiful maiden from another tribe because, {{in the words of the}} father felt that as rich and wealthy man he did not want his son to take the side of a stranger. There is the related consideration that a man who grows up with a cousin in the intimate setting of one extended family knows her and so may develop his own liking or love for her. There is also the benefit of knowing the qualities of the spouse: a Syrian proverb reads, [...] "Ill luck which you know is better than good luck <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> get acquainted." [...] Keeping property in the family is a final reason for cousin marriage. One of the earliest examples of this is the five daughters of Zelophehad from ancient Israel (...) who upon inheriting from their father all married their father's brother's sons. The Quranic law dictating that daughters receive a portion of the inheritance appears to have had the effect of increasing cousin marriage rate.|$|E
