500|$|Imagination is {{generally}} thought of by historians {{of science fiction}} {{as one of the}} weaker magazines of the 1950s, despite its relative longevity. Donald Tuck, in his Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, dismissed the novels it published, saying, [...] "not many were noteworthy, most being in the interplanetary/space opera/adventure field", and Brian Stableford, a science fiction writer and critic, described it as dealing [...] "primarily in routine space opera." [...] James Blish, writing under the pseudonym [...] "William Atheling, Jr.", which he used for some of his critical writing, remarked that it was a [...] "widely unread" [...] magazine. Hamling's editorial policy was consciously slanted against intellectualism. In the November 1951 issue he commented that [...] "science fiction was never meant to be an educational tour de force. The so-called adult story is nothing more than an attempt to show the reader how dumb he is and how smart the editor is." [...] Imaginations approach, he said, was to publish entertainment: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> little relaxation. And entertaining reading is one way to get it." [...] Some readers agreed with Hamling; a 1952 issue of Rhodomagnetic Digest, a fanzine, contains approving commentary on Hamling's editorial by Gregg Calkins, a fan of the period.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E

2500|$|During two {{televised}} debates, Giuliani framed {{himself as}} an agent of change, saying, [...] "I'm the reformer", that [...] "If we keep going merrily along, this city's going down", and that electing Dinkins would represent [...] "more of the same, more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down". Giuliani pointed out that Dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and of several other ethical missteps, in particular a stock transfer to his son. Dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off, denied other wrongdoing, and said that [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mayor, not a prosecutor", and that Giuliani refused to say [...] "the R-word—he doesn't like to admit he's a Republican."

[...] Also on 29 May, Australian Prime Minister John Howard rejected criticisms that Australian troops had not secured Dili quickly enough, saying that the crisis was possibly more dangerous than the violence following independence from Indonesia in 1999, and that [...] "We cannot have a situation around the world and particularly in our region where Australia is told to respect the independence of a country and that it's a bully boy if it seeks to express a view or to intervene, but when something goes wrong Australia is then criticised for not having, quote, intervened earlier." ...|$|E

5000|$|The most {{important}} Zen master {{in the last}} 500 years, Hakuin Zenji had a saying that [...] "Buddhas are like water and ordinary people are like ice". In Zen yoga practice, postures and movements are used to bring the body into focus {{so that we can}} notice any tightnesses or restrictions. The student is then directed to bring their non-judgemental attention to these blocked or closed areas, and it's this simple awareness that causes the ice to begin to melt. All <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> attitude of curiosity and non-judgemental kindness.|$|R

The same year Najam Sethi described Sharif's government as [...] "it is corrupt, absolutely, astronomically corrupt, including the Prime Minister". In 2009, The New York Times commenting on Sharif's relationship with the U.S wrote that [...] "Bhutto and her Pakistan Peoples Party were considered more amenable allies for Washington" [...] adding that [...] "more nationalistic and religiously oriented, he (Sharif) and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-N, have traditionally found common cause with the religious parties". Pervez Hoodbhoy described [...] "Sharif {{as a reflection of}} (the) Pakistani society" [...] adding that [...] "he is silent on what matters most: the insurgency. What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> leader." [...] Celia W. Dugger, writing in 1999, described Sharif's Raiwind Palace as [...] "walls paneled in silken fabrics and rococo chairs laden with so much gold leaf they looked like they belonged in the court of Louis XIV or a bordello", drawing comparison between Sharif's lifestyle and that of the [...] "Mughals".|$|E

6000|$|Taking, first, {{dreams of}} the unknown past, we find a large modern {{collection}} of these attributed to a lady named [...] "Miss A---".

What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dream or vision of the unknown past, corroborated by a document not known to exist at the time when the vision took place and was recorded.
