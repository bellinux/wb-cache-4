500|$|As a trapshooter, he {{ranked as}} one of the all-time greats, and was {{enshrined}} in the Trapshooting Hall of Fame. [...] He organized the first national trapshooting organization, a forerunner to today's Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA). Sousa remained active in the fledgling ATA for some time after its formation. Some credit Sousa as the father of organized trapshooting in United States. He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting. Sousa was a regular competitor representing the United States Navy in trapshooting competitions, particularly against the United States Army. [...] Available records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35,000 targets during his shooting career. A quote from his Trapshooting Hall of Fame biography says it best: [...] "Let me say that just about the sweetest music to me is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>call,</b> 'pull,' the old gun barks, and the referee in perfect key announces, 'dead'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who {{hails from}} Rajpipla in the Gujarat, {{publicly}} {{came out as}} gay. He was quickly anointed by the Indian and the world media as the first openly gay royal. He was disinherited as an immediate reaction by the royal family, though they eventually reconciled. He appeared on the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 24, 2007, and on BBC Three's Undercover Princes. In 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest {{said that he was}} apprehensive about returning to India. He said, [...] "Indian media has exposed me so much that now <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> my friends back home, their parents do not let them talk to me".|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers wrote, and Miller later confirmed, that a {{recurring}} theme in the lyrics of Real Nighttime was life after college, which Miller paired with the intuition that [...] "freedom had a strong aspect of being bad news." [...] The song [...] "24" [...] placed the narrator at the cusp of a quarter-life crisis, as a self-conscious young adult whose mixed feelings established that he [...] "doesn't know where he fits, or to how to live on his own, in a post-collegiate milieu." [...] The theme continued with allusions to finding one's own direction and leaving the nest, as in [...] "Curse of the Frontier Land" [...] ("A year ago we called this a good time"), and [...] "I Mean It This Time" [...] ("Give me all the gin I need, for I may not be this strong <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> my parents and tell them they've been wrong.") ...|$|E

2500|$|Outside the {{critical}} reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter {{is built around}} the polemic between Gârbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, {{over the issue of}} what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as sal (for salut, [...] "hello"), vb (vorbim, [...] "we'll talk") and ms (mersi, [...] "thanks"). Gârbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: [...] " [...] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> him using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, {{for the first time in}} life, an inexplicable creature." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{reported}} in a Baraita that the House of Shammai taught that heaven was created first and the earth was created afterwards, as [...] says, [...] "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." [...] But the House of Hillel taught that the earth was created first and heaven was created afterwards, as [...] says, [...] "In {{the day that the}} Lord God made earth and heaven." [...] The House of Hillel faulted the House of Shammai for believing that one can build a house's upper stories and afterwards builds the house, as [...] calls heaven God's [...] "upper chambers," [...] saying, [...] "It is He Who builds His upper chambers in the heaven, and has founded His vault upon the earth." [...] The House of Shammai, in turn, faulted the House of Hillel for believing that a person builds a footstool first, and afterwards builds the throne, as [...] calls heaven God's throne and the earth God's footstool. But the Sages said that God created both heaven and earth at the same time, as [...] says, [...] "My hand has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand has spread out the heavens: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>call</b> to them, they stand up together." [...] The House of Shammai and the House of Hillel, however, interpreted the word [...] "together" [...] in [...] to mean only that heaven and earth cannot be separated from each another. Resh Lakish reconciled the differing verses by positing that God created heaven first, and afterwards created the earth; but when God put them in place, God put the earth in place first, and afterwards put heaven in place..|$|E
