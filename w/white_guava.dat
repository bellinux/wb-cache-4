The antioxidant activity values determined by 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picryhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays were 10. 28 mg fresh weight (fw) /mg DPPH and 78. 56 mg Trolox equivalent (TE) /g fw for <b>white</b> <b>guava</b> and 7. 82 mg/mgDPPH, fw and 111. 06 mMTE/g fw for red guava. Ascorbic acid contents were 130 and 112 mg/ 100 g fw total phenolics contents 145. 52 and 163. 36 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) / 100 g fw and total flavonoids contents 19. 06 and 35. 85 mg catechin equivalents (CE) / 100 g fw, in white and red guava, respectively. Volatile compounds in guava were analyzed by the solid-phase microextraction (SPME) /gas chromatography (GC) /mass spectrometry (MS) method.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ascorbic acid {{is a very}} {{important}} compound for plants. It has essential functions, mainly as an antioxidant and growth regulator. Ascorbic acid biosynthesis has been extensively studied, but studies in fruits are very limited. In this work we studied the influence of five enzymes involved in synthesis (L-galactono- 1, 4 -lactone dehydrogenase, GalLDH, EC 1. 3. 2. 3), oxidation (ascorbate oxidase, EC 1. 10. 3. 3, and ascorbate peroxidase, APX, EC and recycling (monodehydroascorbate reductase, EC 1. 6. 5. 4, and dehydroascorbate reductase, DHAR, EC 1. 8. 5. 1) on changes in ascorbic acid content during development and ripening of mangoes (Mangifera indica L. cv. Keitt) and during the ripening of <b>white</b> pulp <b>guavas</b> (Psidium guayava L. cv. Paloma). RESULTS: It was found that there was a balance between the activities of GalLDH, APX and DHAR, both in mangoes and guavas. CONCLUSIONS: Equilibrium between the enzymatic activities of synthesis, catabolism and recycling is important for the regulation of ascorbic acid content in mango and guava. These results have contributed to understanding some of the changes that occur in ascorbic acid levels during fruit ripening. (C) 2008 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

Foram utilizados no teste de inibição do crescimento micelial, os extratos aquosos de alecrim (Rosmarinus officinalis), erva baleeira (Cordia verbenacea), joá (Solanum sisymbriifolium), quebra-pedra (Phyllanthus corcovadensis), erva botão (Eclipta alba) e açafrão da índia (Curcuma longa) obtidos por meio do processo de infusão; óleo essencial de alecrim de vargem (Família Lamiaceae), alecrim pimenta (Lippia sidoides), alfavaca cravo (Ocimum gratissimum), lippia (Lippia citriodora), goiaba branca (Psidium guajava), capim santo (Cymbopogon citratus); óleo resina de copaíba (Copaifera langsdorffi); hidrolatos de alecrim de vargem, goiaba vermelha (Psidium guajava), lippia, capim santo, goiaba branca, alfavaca cravo; manipueira de (Manihot esculenta). Também foram testados esses mesmos hidrolatos e os óleos essenciais na germinação dos esporos do fungo. Todos os tratamentos foram realizados in vitro, cultivando-se o fungo em meio de cultura BDA acrescido de 100 &# 956;L dos compostos vegetais. No teste de inibição da germinação, todos os óleos essenciais impediram a germinação do fungo. No entanto, os hidrolatos não tiveram esse efeito. No teste de crescimento micelial, os óleos essenciais de todas as plantas inibiram completamente o crescimento do fungo, exceto o óleo da goiaba branca. Os extratos aquosos, a manipueira, o óleo resina e os hidrolatos, também não foram eficientes sobre o crescimento do patógeno. Esses resultados indicam o potencial antifúngico de alguns óleos essenciais de plantas medicinais. The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate the effect of extracts and essential oils of fourteen medicinal and or native plants popularly known in the North of Minas Gerais, on the germination of spores and the mycelial growth of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides fungus. The following {{were used in the}} mycelial growth inhibition test: the watery extracts of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), Cordia verbenacea, Solanum sisymbriifolium, Phyllanthus corcovadensis, Eclipta alba, and Curcuma longa obtained through the infusion process; essential oils of "alecrim de vargem" (Lamiaceae Family), Lippia sidoides, Ocimum gratissimum, Lippia citriodora, <b>white</b> <b>guava</b> (Psidium guajava), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus); copaíba oil resin (Copaifera langsdorffi) as well as hydrolates of "alecrim de vargem", red guava (Psidium guajava), Lippia citriodora, lemongrass, <b>white</b> <b>guava,</b> Ocimum gratissimum; and cassava manipueira (Manihot esculenta). The same hydrolates and essential oils were also tested on the germination of the fungus spores. All the treatments were carried out in vitro, cultivating the fungus in PDA supplemented with 100 &# 956;L of the vegetal compounds. In the germination inhibition test, all the essential oils prevented the germination of the fungus. However, the hydrolates did not have this effect. In the mycelial growth test, the essential oils of all of the plants completely inhibited the fungus growth, except the <b>white</b> <b>guava</b> oil. The watery extracts, the cassava manipueira, the oil resin and hydrolates were also not efficient in preventing the growth of the pathogen. These results indicate the fungitoxic potential of some essential oils of medicinal plants. CNP...|$|E

40|$|Guava is {{considered}} to be an excellent source of antioxidant compounds due to the high content of lycopene and vitamin C. The international guava market is dominated mainly by white pulp fruit, differing from the Brazilian market, which pays a high price for guava cultivars with dark red pulp fruit. The goal {{of the present study was}} to analyze the content of Brazilian guava accessions contrasting for pulp colors to support the breeding program of guava, focusing on cultivars producing fruits with a high content of functional impounds. Sixty guava accessions established in a field germplasm bank, at Embrapa Tropical Semi-Arid, Petrolina, Pernambuco State, Brazil, were evaluated for total antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, lycopene and beta-carotene, titrable acidity, soluble solids and total soluble sugars. The accessions, including <b>guavas</b> of <b>white</b> (n= 10), red (n= 23) and pink pulp (n= 27), were grown in a block design experiment, with two replications/ accession. An ANOVA was performed, decomposing the degrees of freedom for the three pulp color groups in order to test the contrast to the nine evaluated compounds. The accessions presented high variability (p< 0. 01) for all compounds. <b>Guava</b> <b>white</b> pulp did not presented variability for the majority of compounds, except soluble solids, while guava red and pink pulps presented high variability (p < 0. 01) for most compounds, except flavonoids in pink pulp guava and flavonoids, beta-carotene, soluble solids and total sugars in red pulp fruit. The white*red and pink pulp contrast was significant (p< 0. 01) for most compounds, except for titrable acidity and soluble solids, with the greater mean values found in the accessions of pink red pulp, except for total soluble sugars. The red*pink contrast was also significant (p< 0. 01), except for titrable acidity and soluble solids, with greater values found in the accessions of red pulp fruit, except for lycopene and total soluble sugars. The compounds mean values were, approximately, 1. 5, 1. 4, 1. 7, 1. 8, 2. 7 and 3. 1 times greater for antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, flavonoids, lycopene and beta-carotene, respectively, quantified in the pink and red pulp guava accessions when compared to white pulp. These results indicated that pink and red pulp guavas have a potential of greater beneficial contribution to the human diet than <b>white</b> pulp <b>guava.</b> 201...|$|R
