25|$|The musical, Closer to Heaven, {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in London, in 2001, with {{financial}} backing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. Reviews were mixed and although the run was initially extended, it closed earlier than expected, due to poor ticket sales, in October 2001. Around {{the time of the}} London closure, Tennant said that they were in talks to take the musical to various locations in Europe (particularly Germany, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> market for Pet Shop Boys) and to take it to New York. Nothing further was issued by the Pet Shop Boys or Really Useful Group regarding these performances; in 2005, a series of performances were staged in the Brisbane Powerhouse, Australia, though they were arranged independently of Pet Shop Boys and the Really Useful Group.|$|E
25|$|Griffin {{averaged}} 22.7 points, 14.4 {{rebounds and}} 2.3 assists per game {{during the regular}} season and earned All-American First Team honors. He led the NCAA in rebounding and was also the Big 12 scoring and rebounding leader. Griffin recorded at least 20 points and 15 rebounds 15 times, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Big</b> 12 record. He also set school and Big 12 single-season records for most rebounds (504), rebounding average (14.4), and double-doubles (30), and his free throw attempts (324) were the most by a Sooner in a single-season. With 30 double-doubles during the season, he was one short of the NCAA record of 31 set by David Robinson in 1986–1987. His total of 504 rebounds were the most in a season by an NCAA Division I player since Indiana State's Larry Bird had 505 in 1978–79 and his rebounding average of 14.4 was the highest since Wake Forest's Tim Duncan averaged 14.7 in 1996–97.|$|E
500|$|Another {{inspiration}} for the episode came from California's Proposition 187, which proposed the rescinding of employment rights and benefits from illegal immigrants. Cohen decided to name the referendum [...] "Proposition 24" [...] because 24 was the number he had on his Little League Baseball uniform. Cohen commented that [...] "the main theme of the episode is illegal immigration and anti-immigration sentiment, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> issue here in California. So both the intro with the bear and the main theme are yanked from the California headlines." ...|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street {{has used}} many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big,</b> ambidextrous stunt".|$|E
500|$|In Lightning Returns, Juba criticized Lightning's lack of {{personal}} growth during the narrative, and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her [...] "downright unlikable." [...] VanOrd argued that Lightning is not [...] "interesting {{in and of}} herself" [...] {{and that she had}} turned into [...] "a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices", whose stoicism makes it difficult for the player to connect with her. Parrish, writing for USGamer, stated that Lightning had become [...] "downright apathetic", showing [...] "no personality whatsoever", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes. By contrast, Parkin commented that certain side quests, such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable. Similarly, Destructoid's Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less [...] "flat and lifeless now, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> improvement." [...] Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in XIII and XIII-2, fit her role as a god's servant in Lightning Returns. Tech Reviewer, in a feature about the portrayal of female characters in video games, was impressed with the character's depth and portrayal.|$|E
500|$|On 9 May 2012, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{reported}} Lapinskas {{would be}} leaving EastEnders. His character departed 30 August 2012. Of his exit, Lapinskas said [...] "I'm having a fantastic time working on EastEnders and {{playing the role of}} Anthony Moon. Working with David Essex, Tony Discipline and the EastEnders cast has been an absolute pleasure. Although I will really miss EastEnders and everyone involved, I am very excited about future projects and what is next for me as an actor." [...] Lapinskas revealed that Anthony's exit plot sees him make a [...] "big mistake". Anthony realises how much he loves Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks) but is unsure how to deal with her brother and father Joey (David Witts) and Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) respectively. Speaking to Soaplife, Lapinskas said [...] "Joey manipulates Anthony into challenging Derek, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> mistake. I can't give too much away, but I can tell you that after going up against Derek, Anthony {{has no choice but to}} leave the Square." [...] Magazine reports claim that Anthony packs his bags after losing everything to Joey and Derek, revising his gambling problem. Lapinskas hopes that Anthony will return someday. In an interview with Inside Soap, Lapinskas said that EastEnders was his first job outside of drama school and added that he has learnt a lot from the people he worked with. He also added [...] "I was quite disappointed when I found out Anthony {{would be leaving}}, I'd have liked to do a lot more stuff with him. It's a shame to not be a part of what's coming up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tiana is {{loosely based}} on both Princess Emma, the heroine of Baker's novel, and the princess who appears in the Grimm fairy tale. Clements {{described}} Baker's The Frog Princess as [...] "a kind of fairy tale with a twist" [...] because in it [...] "the princess kissed the frog and instead of him turning into a prince she turned into a frog." [...] Clements and Musker pitched {{the idea for the}} film to Walt Disney Animation Studios CEO John Lasseter [...] "as a hand-drawn film with an African American heroine", conceiving Tiana [...] "as someone who would never have been a big fan of Disney fairy tales." [...] The character was inspired by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, who Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans. Clements elaborated, [...] "There's a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … we met with her and we talked with her and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> element of the movie." ...|$|E

Fortunately he heard the fellow just in time, and was in the act of rising when he struck him, and the blade fell just behind the shoulder and penetrated its full depth between the shoulder-blade and the ribs. He says he is getting round again nicely; his shoulder is still bandaged, and hurts him sharply at times, but he is going up the river in a steamboat, and will be two or three weeks on board, and he expects to be quite well by the time he lands; then he will be at the edge of what they call the plains.' ...|$|E

This line that runs along the bottom of the other map I take to be the Gila, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> river which runs right through the Indian country, and falls into the Rio Grande. I have gone up it from that side two or three hundred miles. We were a strong party, but we had to fight our way back again, and lost pretty near half our number. You see by the map it lies {{on the north side of}} the Gila. But as the Gila is eight or nine hundred miles long, that don't help us a great deal, and the map wouldn't be any good to us if it was not for this mark here up near the top. You see all these things are meant for {{mountain}}s, but as one mountain on a map is just like another, we should be downright done if it was not for this mark. Do you see there are three little jags here close together? Now I take it those three jags are meant for a mountain the Indians call the Three Sisters, which is a mountain with three peaks close together. I never saw it myself, but I have spoken with miners who have seen it from the north. Now, here you see, to the south of the Three Sisters, is a cross, and I take it that's the mine. You see there is a black line waving about among the mountains that stops at that point. I guess that is the line they traveled by." ...|$|E
