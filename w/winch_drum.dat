60|$|After that, {{however, the}} work became harder still, {{for the big}} {{cylinders}} must be fed, and {{it was with a}} sensation of thankfulness that he had not broken down beneath the strain Austin dragged himself up the ladder when a message was brought him that he was wanted to drive the after winch. It was raining heavily, but he found it a relief to feel the deluge beat upon his beaded face and scorched skin, though he could scarcely see the mangroves to which the wire that ran from the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> led. It was shackled to a big bridle, a loop of twisted steel that wound in and out among a rood or two of the stoutest trees. The winch was also powerful, and it remained to be seen whether it would heave the Cumbria out of her miry bed, or pull that portion of the watery forest up bodily. A great cable that slanted back towards him rose out of the water forward in a curve, and he could dimly see Jefferson's lean figure outlined against the drifting mist high up on the bridge. On the forecastle beyond it more shadowy men stood still, and Austin wondered whether their hearts beat as his did while they waited. The man beside him stooped ready, with body bent in a rigid curve, and bare, stiffened arms, clenching the wire that led to the winch-drum. There was a minute's waiting, and then Jefferson, moving along the bridge, flung up a hand.|$|E

50|$|A mixture {{between an}} {{inclined}} lift and a funicular with two cars {{was the second}} Angels Flight in Los Angeles. The funicular closed in 1969 and was reinstalled in 1996 using separate cables for each car, which were winched on separate <b>winch</b> <b>drums</b> in the station at the top. The <b>winch</b> <b>drums</b> were connected to the drive motor and the service brake by a gear train. The system failed because of gear train breakage, causing a fatal accident in 2001. The funicular was then closed until 2010, and since 5 September 2013.|$|R
5000|$|A {{band brake}} {{is a primary}} or {{secondary}} brake, consisting of a band of friction material that tightens concentrically around a cylindrical piece of equipment to either prevent it from rotating (a static or [...] "holding" [...] brake), or to slow it (a dynamic brake). This application is common on <b>winch</b> <b>drums</b> and chain saws and is also used for some bicycle brakes.|$|R

50|$|Draglines {{fall into}} two broad categories: those {{that are based on}} standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site. Most crawler cranes, with an added <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the front, can act as a dragline. These units (like other cranes) are {{designed}} to be dismantled and transported over the road on flatbed trailers. Draglines used in civil engineering are almost always of this smaller, crane type. These are used for road, port construction, pond and canal dredging, and as pile driving rigs. These types are built by crane manufacturers such as Link-Belt and Hyster.|$|E
5000|$|The {{inclined}} lift, or inclined elevator—occasionally inclinator—is not a funicular, {{since it}} has only one car carrying payload on the slope. The car is either winched up to the station {{on the top of}} the incline where the cable is collected on a <b>winch</b> <b>drum,</b> or the single car is balanced by a counterweight and operated the same way as a funicular with two cars. Many inclined lifts were constructed along the pressure lines of storage power plants for transporting building materials. Examples are the Gelmerbahn leading to the Gelmersee and the Funicolare Piora-Ritom leading to Lago Ritom, both in Switzerland.|$|E

50|$|During {{this period}} James Martin’s nephew, John Felix Martin (1844-1916) and Fred May joined him in partnership, with the {{business}} now trading as James Martin & Co. The company moved into the production of large pumping equipment, heavy ore crushing plant and <b>winch</b> <b>drums.</b> In 1885, May left the company and founded May Brothers & Co. with his brother Alfred. By 1888 James Martin had acquired more land {{to the south of}} the foundry having secured a contract for the manufacture of 52 locomotives for the South Australian Railways This was followed two years later by a contract for a further 92 engines. Employee numbers had grown to 420 by 1888 and by the early 1890s had reached 700.|$|R
5000|$|A winch is a {{mechanical}} device {{that is used}} to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the [...] "tension" [...] of a rope or wire rope (also called [...] "cable" [...] or [...] "wire cable"). In its simplest form it consists of a spool and attached hand crank. In larger forms, winches stand at the heart of machines as diverse as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. The spool can also be called the <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> More elaborate designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or internal combustion drives. Some may include a solenoid brake and/or {{a mechanical}} brake or ratchet and pawl device that prevents it from unwinding unless the pawl is retracted.|$|E
50|$|The series drogue {{does not}} have to be {{adjusted}} during a storm. Neither do other storm drogues if they are fully deployed and they adhere to the constant rode tension theory. As sea conditions requiring a drogue are usually hazardous to be on deck, it’s usually smart to fully deploy all of the rode associated with a storm drogue. Also, the series drogue can be deployed safely with one hand from the cockpit as can any other storm drogue. Recovering a series drogue before the storm abates takes effort, but the process is safe and straightforward. It can be winched in on sheet winches if the cones are small enough to travel around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> without jamming. The series drogue is currently made by three manufacturers, one in Australia, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. Any sailmaker can make one and you can make one yourself, though it is a tedious job.|$|E
50|$|Similar to the Citroën Kégresse P14, {{there was}} a frontal <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> {{installed}} {{in front of the}} front bumper, with a protruding hand crank access in the middle to start the engine. The winch was driven by motor power. Both on the sides as on the backside platform there were numerous storage compartments for small equipment, accessible from the outside. The driver cabin had a left sided steering wheel, and was open on both sides, with a simple cloth structure providing some protection against the elements. On a glance there is very little difference between the Citroën P14 Kégresse and the FN Kégresse 3T, apart from the rooftop of the drivers cabin, which is straight in the Citroën but is inclined forward in the FN Kégresse 3T {{as well as in the}} Minerva CM-3 it was based on. Different from the Minerva CM-3 was the placement of the spare tire: on the sides in the latter but on the FN Kégresse 3T it was placed on the rooftop. Neither version of the FN Kégresse 3T was armoured. They were unarmed except for the crew's individual weapons.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the launch system is a large winch, around which the launch cables are wound. This winch is driven by {{hydraulic}} turbines. The two launch cables {{are attached to the}} winch on its ends, and run through two grooves on top of the launch track. The cables are attached to the sides of the catch-car, which runs in a trough between the grooves. A third, single retractor cable is attached {{to the rear of the}} catch-car, it runs around a pulley wheel at the rear end of the launch track and returns to the hydraulic building along the bottom of the launch track, where it is wound in the opposing direction on the <b>winch's</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|R

40|$|Proper winding of {{the steel}} rope around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service life of the rope, {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body and}} the sides of the drum if the winding of the rope is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of the rope while lowering the load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in the process of winding and unwinding the rope around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> Friction force is in its highest intensity when the rope passes from one layer to another, if the winding of the rope is multilayered. As the result of the research, certain mechanisms of winding of the rope from the aspects of the friction force were obtained, and the effects of the forces {{on the sides of the}} drum were analyzed...|$|E
40|$|A Zimbabwian {{designer}} {{has been}} testing a two-wheeled winch tractor on small farms {{for the last}} few years, with encouraging results. Small farmers in tropical regions with distinct dry and rainy seasons often experience great difficulty in field preparation. During the dry season, animal-powered tillage is usually not possible, as the animals become weak due to the shortage of green fodder and deep ploughing in dry soil usually needs a heavy tractor, which is too expensive. A small tractor incorporating a winch and anchor permits a light- weight machine to exert a high pull which can be used for deep ploughing during the dry season. Two people are required to operate a winch tractor, a driver and a plough controller. The plough is attached {{to the end of the}} winch chain which is wrapped around the <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the traction unit. As the tractor driver propels his machine forward the winch chain unwinds from the drum and the plough remains at rest. When the chain is unwound from its drum the driver disengages the power from the wheels and engages it to the <b>winch</b> <b>drum.</b> The tension in the chain digs the tractor anchor into the ground and then, as the chain re winds onto its <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> the plough is controlled by its operator as it is pulled up to the anchored tractor unit The two processes of driving the traction unit forward and then pulling the plough up to the anchored traction unit are repeated across the length of the field, until the machine is turned at the ends of the field. The area ploughed in a day is similar to when using animals and the fuel consumed is similar to that used when ploughed with a medium-sized tractor. The deep ploughing obtained from using the winch tractor permits the crop to be planted at the start of the rainy season and also encourages soil moisture conservation and plant root establishment.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} the construction element position of ship <b>winch</b> <b>drum</b> on the effects of torque transmission by friction in the mechanization welding process. The driving and driven wheels (construction elements) were examined for the general case of the load distribution. Based on this examination, the construction of the device that should provide the reliable torque transmission and the movement of the drum in the process of its welding are proposed. This construction is characterized by a high level of flexibility and ability to change the friction torque based on changing drum position in regard to the driving and driven wheels (construction elements). With this new construction, problems related to the movement synchronization are avoided, unlike the all previously known constructions of this type, which lead to the positive impact on the wear intensity of friction gears...|$|E
