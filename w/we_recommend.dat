500|$|Maloney drew {{criticism}} {{for the fact}} that he bought a house in Cold Spring before the election, never having previously lived in the district. On June 11, former President Bill Clinton announced his endorsement of Maloney, saying [...] "I support Sean because I know he’ll be an outstanding member of Congress." [...] On October 21, The New York Times endorsed Maloney, stating that his opponent [...] "has favored limiting contraception coverage for employees and voted to defund Planned Parenthood. Mr. Maloney promises to support health care reform, help the middle class and oppose tax cuts for the rich. <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> Mr. Maloney." [...] Maloney also was endorsed by Planned Parenthood, and the AFL-CIO and New York State United Teachers Union.|$|E
500|$|This was {{followed}} by an October 1801 anonymous review in the Monthly Mirror that argued, [...] "It is a matter to be lamented, that, in times like the present, a work of letters can rarely be reviewed upon the ground of its own proper merits... In the consideration of this romance, the judicious critic cannot but feel that one rule of good writing has been studiously observed. His work will not incur the censure passed by the late Mr. Collins upon his Persian Eclogues, namely, that, from erroneous manners, they were 'Irish.'" [...] The review continued, [...] "He tells us it is metrical... He will excuse our ears, but we cannot agree with him. Among the sins of our youth, we, like him, have traded in desultory versification, but have long been brought back to lyrical rhyme, and heroic blank verse. The reasons are obvious... <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> his beauties to the esteem, and his faults to the forgetfulness, of every reader. Upon the whole, he has our thanks for much amusement, and some information." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reviews for}} Book of Household Management were positive. The {{critic for the}} London Evening Standard {{considered}} that Isabella had earned herself a household reputation, remarking that she had [...] "succeeded in producing a volume which will be, for years to come, a treasure to be made much of in every English household". The critic for the Saturday Review wrote that [...] "for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters, <b>we</b> <b>recommend</b> Mrs Beeton with few misgivings". The anonymous reviewer for The Bradford Observer considered that [...] "the information afforded... appears intelligible and explicit"; the reviewer also praised {{the layout of the}} recipes, highlighting details relating to ingredients, seasonality and the times needed. Writing in The Morning Chronicle, an anonymous commentator opined that [...] "Mrs Beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of housekeepers, or facilitates the many little troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and mother. She may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every other on the same subject." [...] For the 1906 edition of the book, The Illustrated London Newss reviewer considered the work [...] "a formidable body of domestic doctrine", and thought that [...] "the book is almost of the first magnitude".|$|E

500|$|The novel, like Bang's {{other works}} such as Stuk (1887), Tine (1889), and Ludvigsbakke (1896), is still widely read in Denmark, {{confirming}} the author as one of Denmark's leading novelists. At the time of release in Denmark in 1886, the daily newspapers were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen. Writing in Politiken, Edvard Brandes, after referring to the novel's [...] "outrageous style", welcomed it as a [...] "quite excellent novel" [...] which was [...] "so specially Danish". He concluded by calling {{for it to be}} widely read as [...] "the best new literature we have seen this autumn". In Social-Demokraten, C.E. Jensen found that Bang [...] "depicts the infinitely simple existence and everything it covers with the finest and most sensitive art... His style gives the reader an impression of reality's monotony, allowing him to imagine the emotions hidden behind it." [...] Vilhelm Møller of Nutiden i Billeder og Text praised Ved Vejen as the best of the four stories in Stille Eksistenser, [...] "containing all Bang's qualities in good measure and very few of the weaknesses which have disrupted his earlier work. It can certainly be favourably compared with all the novels of the past year." [...] Only Berlingske Tidendes (unnamed) critic was dismissive, commenting: [...] "The story Ved Vejen is weak in content and often unreadable in form... <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> the author to be less nervous, less jumpy and less impressionistic." ...|$|E
2500|$|At its {{convention}} in Chicago in 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions resolved that [...] "eight hours shall constitute a legal day's labour from and after May 1, 1886, and that <b>we</b> <b>recommend</b> to labour organisations throughout this jurisdiction that they so direct their laws as {{to conform to}} this resolution by the time named." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 17 July 1988 it {{was taken}} over by the {{independent}} Coronet Cinemas chain and was re-named Coronet Cinema. Its decline was remarked on by the Time Out Guide of 1995.

30|$|Consultants {{performed}} {{two-thirds of}} the hysteroscopies. The overall failure rate was 6.9 %, mainly due to cervical stenosis. <b>We</b> <b>recommended</b> changes to the database, a new local protocol and a re-audit in 6  months.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2013, the Ohio Fire Chiefs' Association (OFCA) {{published}} an official position paper supporting {{the use of}} photoelectric technology in Ohioan residences. The OFCA's position states, [...] "In the interest of public safety {{and to protect the}} public from the deadly effects of smoke and fire, the Ohio Fire Chiefs' Association endorses the use of Photoelectric Smoke Alarms … In both new construction and when replacing old smoke alarms or purchasing new alarms, <b>we</b> <b>recommend</b> Photoelectric Smoke Alarms." ...|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, in 2005, the United Kingdom House of Commons Science and Technology Committee {{recommended}} {{the creation of}} a Forensic Science Advisory Council to regulate forensic evidence in the UK and observed that: The absence of an agreed protocol for the validation of scientific techniques prior to their being admitted in court is entirely unsatisfactory. Judges are not well-placed to determine scientific validity without input from scientists. <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> that one of the first tasks of the Forensic Science Advisory Council be to develop a [...] "gate-keeping" [...] test for expert evidence. This should be done in partnership with judges, scientists and other key players in the criminal justice system, and should build on the US Daubert test.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the number}} of {{children}} with intersex conditions referred to Lawson Wilkins' new pediatric endocrinology clinic at Hopkins increased, it was recognized that doctors [...] "couldn't tell by looking" [...] at the external genitalia, and many errors of diagnosis based on outward appearance had led to anomalous sex assignments. Although it seems obvious now that a doctor could not announce to an eight-year-old boy and his parents that [...] "we have just discovered that you are 'really' a girl, with female chromosomes, and ovaries and uterus inside, and <b>we</b> <b>recommend</b> that you change your sex to match your chromosomes and internal organs," [...] a few such events occurred around the world as doctors and parents tried to make use of new information.|$|E

2500|$|On 27 July 2009, Israel’s Defence Minister Ehud Barak {{during a}} press conference with Robert Gates, the US Defense Secretary, in Jerusalem, warned Iran that a {{military}} strike on its nuclear facilities was still an option: [...] "We clearly believe that no option should {{be removed from the}} table. This is our policy; we mean it. <b>We</b> <b>recommend</b> to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone." [...] The same day, Israel's Ambassador to US, Gabriela Shalev, during a special UN Security Council session held to discuss the situation in the Middle East, called Iran the [...] "biggest supporter of terrorism." [...] The Islamic Republic's nuclear program and its support of terrorism pose a threat to the entire Middle East." ...|$|E

All of the interpreters <b>we</b> <b>recommend</b> can read blorb files. A filename ending [...]zblorb is a story file intended for a Z-machine in a Blorb wrapper, while a filename ending [...]gblorb is a story file intended for a Glulx in a Blorb wrapper. It is not common but IF files are sometimes also seen without a Blorb wrapping, though this usually means cover art, help files, and so forth are missing, like a book with the covers torn off. Z-machine story files usually have names ending [...]z5 or [...]z8, the number being a version number, and Glulx story files usually end [...]ulx.|$|E
