40|$|Dystroglycanopathies are {{a genetically}} and {{clinically}} heterogeneous group of muscular dystrophies that {{are characterized by}} reduced glycosylation of α-dystroglycan.

40|$|Hypothesis: In this study, {{we aim to}} {{test whether}} {{scapular}} winging results in {{a significant change in}} glenohumeral translation in the initial phase of the throwing motion. Methods: Six shoulders underwent an abbreviated throwing motion (ATM) from late cocking to the end of acceleration by use of a validated robotic system. The intact specimens were tested to establish a baseline. The position of the scapula was then affected to simulate scapular winging by placing a cylindrical wedge under the inferior angle of the scapula, and the ATM was performed again. For both conditions, the average glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations were plotted over time to calculate the area under the curve, {{as a representative of the}} overall glenohumeral translations and scapular rotations observed during the ATM. Results: Throughout the motion, the <b>winged</b> <b>scapulae</b> showed, on average, 7. 7 ° more upward rotation, 1. 6 ° more internal rotation, and 5. 3 ° more anterior tipping as compared with the baseline. The scapular position relative to the hanging arm was significantly different between the baseline and scapular winging conditions in all arm positions, except for maximal external rotation and the neutral position. Comparing the area under the curve at baseline and with scapular winging indicated that scapular winging significantly increased anterior translation of the glenohumeral joint whereas translation in the superior/inferior and medial/lateral directions did not result in a change in translation. Discussion: These results may suggest a more important role of abnormalities in scapular position in predisposing throwing athletes to shoulder injuries of the anterior capsulolabral structures and consecutive glenohumeral instability.

50|$|A lesion of {{the nerve}} paralyses the serratus {{anterior}} to produce <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> {{which is most}} prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall. However, even winging may not be evident until the trapezius stretches enough to reveal an injury several weeks later.|$|E
50|$|Though {{the most}} common causes of a <b>winged</b> <b>scapula</b> is due to serratus {{anterior}} palsy, and less commonly trapezius and rhomboid palsy, there are still other circumstances that present the ailment. These incidences include direct injuries to the scapulothoracic muscles (i.e. trapezius and rhomboid muscles), and structural abnormalities (e.g. rotator cuff pathology, shoulder instability, etc.).|$|E
50|$|A <b>winged</b> <b>scapula</b> (scapula alata) is a {{skeletal}} {{medical condition}} in which the shoulder blade, or shoulder bone, protrudes from a person’s back in an abnormal position. In rare conditions {{it has the potential}} to lead to limited functional activity in the upper extremity to which it is adjacent. It can affect a person’s ability to lift, pull, and push weighty objects. In some serious cases, the ability to perform activities of daily living such as changing one’s clothes and washing one’s hair may be hindered. The name of this condition comes from its appearance, a wing-like resemblance, due to the medial border of the scapula sticking straight out from the back. Scapular winging has been observed to disrupt scapulohumeral rhythm, contributing to decreased flexion and abduction of the upper extremity, as well as a loss in power and the source of considerable pain. A <b>winged</b> <b>scapula</b> is considered normal posture in young children, but not older children and adults.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about ethnic {{differences}} in developing countries such as South Africa, {{particularly with regard to}} prevalence of postural deviations and body composition profiles. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the prevalence rate for postural deviations and body composition status among two racial groups in South Africa. The sample (n = 216) consisted of 89 African girls and 127 Caucasian girls. Anthropometric (BMI and percentage body fat) and body posture measurements were performed. A posture grid and the New York Posture test were used for all postural assessments. Independent t-tests and effect sizes demonstrated that in the 11 and 13 year old group the Caucasian group had a significantly higher (p< 0. 05) BMI and percentage body fat than the African group. There were no statistical and practical significant differences in prevalence rate between age groups. The African group had higher prevalence rates in most of the deviations, with <b>winged</b> <b>scapulae,</b> kyphosis, protruding abdomen and lordosis demonstrating a statistical significance (p< 0. 05) and practical significance (large effect) with regard to the Caucasian group. The higher prevalence rate for uneven shoulders in the Caucasian group was statistically significant (p< 0. 05) and also visible (medium effect) with regard to the African group. The higher prevalence rate for pronated feet in the African group was statistically significant (p< 0. 05), and also visible (medium effect) with regard to the Caucasian group. The prevalence rate was high in both groups and the lack of awareness and the results of this study should support the development of more responsible educational and screening programmes in both rural and urban school environments. The identification of postural deviations is important for prevention, to encourage a healthier posture for children and to prevent resulting painful syndromes. [URL]...|$|R
50|$|Patients with spinal {{accessory}} nerve palsy often exhibit signs of lower {{motor neuron disease}} such as diminished muscle mass, fasciculations, and partial paralysis of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Interruption of the nerve supply to the sternocleidomastoid muscle results in an asymmetric neckline, while weakness of the trapezius muscle can produce a drooping shoulder, <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> and a weakness of forward elevation of the shoulder.|$|E

50|$|A <b>winged</b> <b>scapula</b> due to serratus {{anterior}} palsy is rare. In {{one report}} (Fardin et al.), {{there was an}} incidence of 15 cases out of 7,000 patients seen in the electromyographical laboratory. In another report (Overpeck and Ghormley), {{there was only one}} case out of 38,500 patients observed at the Mayo Clinic. In yet another report (Remak), there were three diagnoses of serratus anterior paralysis throughout a series of 12,000 neurological examinations.|$|E
50|$|The serratus {{anterior}} is {{innervated by}} the long thoracic nerve (Nerve of Bell), {{a branch of the}} brachial plexus. The long thoracic nerve travels inferiorly {{on the surface of the}} serratus. The nerve is especially vulnerable during certain types of surgery (for example, during lymph node clearance from the axilla (e.g., in case of axillary dissection in a surgery for breast cancer)). Damage to this nerve can lead to a <b>winged</b> <b>scapula.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since {{there is}} a variety of classifications of <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> {{there is a}}lso more than one type of treatment. Massage Therapy is an {{effective}} initial approach to relax the damaged muscles. In more severe cases, Physical Therapy can help by strengthening effected and surrounding muscles. Physical therapy constitutes treatment options if there is weakness of the glenohumeral joint muscles, but if the muscles do not contract clinically and symptoms continue to be severe for more than 3-6 months, surgery may be the next choice. Surgery by fixation of the scapula to the rib cage can be done for those with isolated scapular winging. Some options are neurolysis (chordotomy), intercostal nerve transfer, scapulothoracic fusion, arthrodesis (scapulodesis), or scapulothoracis fixation without arthrodesis (scapulopexy).|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} of <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> {{damage to the}} serratus {{anterior}} muscle causes the deformation of the back. The serratus anterior muscle attaches to the medial anterior aspect of the scapula (i.e. it attaches on the side closest to the spine and runs {{along the side of}} the scapula that faces the ribcage) and normally anchors the scapula against the rib cage. When the serratus anterior contracts, upward rotation, abduction, and weak elevation of the scapula occurs, allowing the arm to be raised above the head. The long thoracic nerve innervates the serratus anterior; therefore, damage to or impingement of this nerve can result in weakening or paralysis of the muscle. If this occurs, the scapula may slip away from the rib cage, giving it the wing-like appearance on the upper back. This characteristic may particularly be seen when the affected person pushes against resistance.The person may also have limited ability to lift their arm above their head.|$|E

Objective: To qualitatively identify the postural abnormalities which occur most frequently among children aged OBJECTIVE: Reven and ten years, comparing boys and girls, and to evaluate these subjects' lumbar flexibility. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-one children were photographed in the sagittal and frontal planes. The variables analyzed were: ankle (valgus and varus), tibiotarsal angle (opened and closed), knee (hyperextension and semiflexion, valgus and varus), pelvis (anteversion and retroversion; lateral pelvic inclination), trunk (antepulsion and retropulsion), lumbar spine (hyperlordosis and rectification), thoracic spine (hyperkyphosis and rectification), cervical spine (hyperlordosis and rectification), scoliosis, shoulder (imbalance and protraction), scapula (winged, abducted and adducted) and head (tilt and protraction). The lumbar flexibility was assessed using Schöber's index. RESULTS: The boys had greater incidence of <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> shoulder imbalance, protraction of shoulders and head and cervical hyperlordosis than the girls did.

40|$|SummaryScapular winging {{secondary}} to serratus anterior muscle palsy {{is a rare}} pathology. It is usually due to a lesion in the thoracic part of the long thoracic nerve following violent upper-limb stretching with compression on the nerve by the anterior branch of thoracodorsal artery at the “crow's foot landmark” where the artery crosses {{in front of the}} nerve. Scapular winging causes upper-limb pain, fatigability or impotence. Diagnosis is clinical and management initially conservative. When functional treatment by physiotherapy fails to bring recovery within 6 months and electromyography (EMG) shows increased distal latencies, neurolysis may be suggested. Muscle transfer and scapula-thoracic arthrodesis are considered as palliative treatments. We report a single-surgeon experience of nine open neurolyses of the thoracic part of the long thoracic nerve in eight patients. At 6 months’ follow-up, no patients showed continuing signs of <b>winged</b> <b>scapula.</b> Control EMG showed significant reduction in distal latency; Constant scores showed improvement, and VAS-assessed pain was considerably reduced. Neurolysis would thus seem to be the first-line surgical attitude of choice in case of compression confirmed on EMG. The present results would need to be confirmed in larger studies with longer follow-up, but this is made difficult by the rarity of this pathology. Level of evidenceIII...|$|E
40|$|Postural {{alterations}} {{are often}} found in children and teenagers. In this stage of development, the posture undergoes many adjustments and adaptations due to changes {{of the body and}} to demanding psychosocial factors. PURPOSE: To identify which postural alterations occur most often in students between 7 and 10 years of age, to identify preventive measures, and to provide information to parents and teachers about the problem of bad posture. METHODS: Thirty three girls in each of 4 age groups between 7 and 10 years of age were assessed, resulting in a sample of 132 subjects. Photos of each girl in the sagittal and frontal planes were examined for postural deviations. RESULTS: The main postural deviations found were knock-knee, medial rotation of the hip, antepulsion, pelvic anteversion, knee hyperextension, lumbar hyperlordosis, valgus ankle, imbalanced shoulders, lateral pelvic inclination, scoliosis, trunk rotation, thoracic hyperkyphosis, <b>winged</b> <b>scapula,</b> shoulder protraction, abducted scapula, medial rotation of shoulders, and head tilt. CONCLUSION: High incidences of postural alterations occur in children of school age. Some of these reflect normal postural development, and get corrected during the child's growth. On the other hand, some alterations are asymmetries that can be caused by daily demands on the body and can result in negative impacts on the quality of life during childhood and adulthood.
