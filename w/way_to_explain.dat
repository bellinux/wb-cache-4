5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E

25|$|The idea {{of scale}} transformations and scale {{invariance}} is old in physics. Scaling arguments were commonplace for the Pythagorean school, Euclid {{and up to}} Galileo. They became popular again {{at the end of}} the 19th century, perhaps the first example being the idea of enhanced viscosity of Osborne Reynolds, as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> turbulence.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how {{medications}} work, pharmaceutical manufacturers {{may provide}} {{mechanism of action}} animations, often through websites dedicated to specific prescription drugs. These medical visualizations typically do not represent cellular structures in a fully accurate or proportional way. Instead, mechanism of action animations may visually simplify the interaction between drug molecules and cells. These medical animations may also explain the physiological origins of the disease itself.|$|E

25|$|Although {{transitional}} fossils {{elucidate the}} evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due {{to the special}} circumstances required for preservation of living beings, {{only a very small}} percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> off the lack of 'snapshot' fossils that show crucial steps between species.|$|E
25|$|Huxley was {{certainly}} not slavish in his dealings with Darwin. As shown in every biography, they had quite different and rather complementary characters. Important also, Darwin was a field naturalist, but Huxley was an anatomist, {{so there was a}} difference in their experience of nature. Lastly, Darwin's views on science were different from Huxley's views. For Darwin, natural selection was the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> evolution because it explained a huge range of natural history facts and observations: it solved problems. Huxley, on the other hand, was an empiricist who trusted what he could see, and some things are not easily seen. With this in mind, one can appreciate the debate between them, Darwin writing his letters, Huxley never going quite {{so far as to say}} he thought Darwin was right.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} half of the 20th century, {{following}} the work of Noam Chomsky, linguistics was dominated by the generativist school. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how human beings acquire language and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is modularist and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of Zellig Harris to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called Universal Grammar, and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

25|$|This {{version of}} the musical updates the story to modern day and has Hedwig {{performing}} on the abandoned set of Hurt Locker: The Musical, which closed the prior evening midway through its first performance. Hedwig explains that because it closed so quickly, {{she was able to}} convince one of the producers to allow her to use what would have been an otherwise empty and unused stage. Faux Playbills for the musical are littered throughout the theater and discuss various elements of the musical, which Hedwig occasionally mentions offhand throughout the musical. Director Michael Mayer stated that they {{came up with the idea}} for Hurt Locker: The Musical as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> Hedwig's presence in a Broadway theater. It was also used as a way to update the script to modern day as well as explain how Hedwig would be able to use such stage settings. Various newspapers have commented favorably on the faux Playbills, both an element of the musical and as a piece separate from the musical itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of this myopathy is very varied. Many mutations {{occur in}} the region of actin’s indentation near to its nucleotide binding sites, while others occur in Domain 2, or in the areas where interaction occurs with associated proteins. This goes some <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the great variety of clumps that form in these cases, such as Nemaline or Intranuclear Bodies or Zebra Bodies. Changes in actin’s folding occur in nemaline myopathy as well as changes in its aggregation and there are also changes in the expression of other associated proteins. In some variants where intranuclear bodies are found the changes in the folding masks the nucleus’s protein exportation signal so that the accumulation of actin's mutated form occurs in the cell nucleus. On the other hand, it appears that mutations to ACTA1 that give rise to a CFTDM have a greater effect on sarcomeric function than on its structure. Recent investigations have tried to understand this apparent paradox, which suggests there is no clear correlation between the number of rods and muscular weakness. It appears that some mutations are able to induce a greater apoptosis rate in type II muscular fibres.|$|E
500|$|Wright's {{views on}} the role of genetic drift in the {{evolutionary}} scheme were controversial almost from the very beginning. One of the most vociferous and influential critics was colleague Ronald Fisher. Fisher conceded genetic drift played some role in evolution, but an insignificant one. Fisher has been accused of misunderstanding Wright's views because in his criticisms Fisher seemed to argue Wright had rejected selection almost entirely. To Fisher, viewing the process of evolution as a long, steady, adaptive progression was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the ever-increasing complexity from simpler forms. But the debates have continued between the [...] "gradualists" [...] and those who lean more toward the Wright model of evolution where selection and drift together play an important role.|$|E

500|$|The {{time-space diagram}} of Rule 90 is a plot {{in which the}} th row records the {{configuration}} of the automaton at step [...] When the initial state has a single nonzero cell, this diagram has the appearance of the Sierpiński triangle, a fractal formed by combining triangles into larger triangles. Rules 18, 22, 26, 82, 146, 154, 210 and 218 also generate the same diagram. One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> this structure uses the fact that, in Rule 90, each cell is the exclusive or of its two neighbors. Because this is equivalent to modulo-2 addition, this generates the modulo-2 version of Pascal's triangle. The diagram has a 1 wherever Pascal's triangle has an odd number, and a 0 wherever Pascal's triangle has an even number. This is a discrete version of the Sierpiński triangle.|$|E
500|$|He concludes by {{suggesting}} that the riot is now something it was not: [...] "The riot has become the key event in turning Richard from a mere hockey player to a symbol of political resistance (even if Richard himself was publicly apolitical and, according to this book, definitely not for an independent Quebec) … According to this popular narrative, {{for the first time}} the people of Quebec stood up for themselves; especially English Canada delights in anachronistically announcing that this was the beginning of the 1960s Quiet Revolution." [...] Perhaps the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> how the interpretation of the riot changed is by looking at the change in the public perceptions of its antagonist: [...] "It was necessary to overlook some of [...] character traits and to rewrite several episodes of his career" [...] in order to elevate him into a mythical figure.|$|E

She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may {{grow up to be}} {{like the rest of the}} family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that [...] "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [...] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment." [...] Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé. In the episode [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time.

500|$|Paramount gave Bennett {{the green}} light to write Star Trek III the day after The Wrath of Khan opened, the fastest go-ahead the {{producer}} had received. He began writing the screenplay, noting that [...] "seventeen other people could have written [...] " [...] after the hints at Spock's resurrection in the previous film. Bennett and Nimoy used the open thread of Spock mind melding with McCoy at the end of The Wrath of Khan as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> Spock's restoration. The idea and name of the Vulcan [...] "katra" [...] came from Bennett's discussions with Nimoy. The actor referred the producer to an episode of the television series, [...] "Amok Time", that suggested to Bennett a high level of [...] "spiritual transference" [...] among the Vulcans. Bennett admitted that the idea of Kirk and company going back to the Genesis planet to recover Kirk's [...] "noble self" [...] stemmed from a poem he read in a Star Trek fan magazine. The film's production acknowledged certain expectations from fans—Nimoy remarked that if Spock had not been resurrected and, instead, [...] "Captain Kirk turn to the camera and [...] 'Sorry, we didn't find him,' people would throw rocks at the screen." [...] A major issue Bennett wrestled with was how to introduce the story for people who had not seen The Wrath of Khan. Bennett said that his television producer mentality [...] "won out"; he added a [...] "previously in Star Trek..." [...] film device, and had Kirk narrate a captain's log, describing his feelings and sense of loss. Aware of the story's predictability, Bennett decided to have the USS Enterprise destroyed, and intended this plot element be kept a secret.|$|E
