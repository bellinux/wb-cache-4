5|$|It {{was during}} the first half of the twentieth century that the first women's fraternities were established. The {{university}} first admitted women to graduate programs in 1920, although undergraduate women were not allowed at the university until much later. With these graduate <b>women</b> <b>came</b> several female Greek organizations, referred to alternately as sororities or women's fraternities. The first sorority to establish a chapter at the university was Chi Omega, whose chapter was founded in 1927. A Kappa Delta chapter followed in 1932, and a chapter of Zeta Tau Alpha was established twenty years later in 1952.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{belief in}} the limited intellectual and moral capacity of <b>women</b> <b>came</b> into conflict with a desire, intensified after the Reformation, for women to take greater personal moral responsibility, particularly as wives and mothers. In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even {{to be able to}} independently read the Bible, but most commentators of the period, even those that tended to encourage the education of girls, thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys. Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters. In the lower ranks of society, girls benefited from the expansion of the parish schools system that took place after the Reformation, but were usually outnumbered by boys and often taught separately, for a shorter time and to a lower level. Girls were frequently taught reading, sewing and knitting, but not writing. Among the nobility there were many educated and cultured women, such as Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|E
5000|$|Of the ten {{types of}} women in the poem, nine are {{delineated}} as destructive: the dirty <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a pig; the cunning woman originates from a fox, the incessantly curious and high-maintenance <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a dog, the lazy or apathetic <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from earth or soil, the capricious woman of mood swings comes from seawater, the stubborn <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ass, the untrustworthy and uncontrollable <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a ferret, the overly proud <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from a mare, and the worst and ugliest type of <b>woman</b> <b>comes</b> from an ape or monkey.

The bee reference is considered homage to the earlier poem of Hesiod entitled Theogony, which uses the metaphor of women and men as bees in one part.|$|R

Other women, who Tracy did not have a relationship with, have released voice mails to the news media.

Biba was also the first store that let customers try makeup before buying it.

25|$|On 23 October 1827, John Palmer was at Lahaina, Hawaii. There local <b>women</b> <b>came</b> {{on board}} and bartered sexual favors for goods, in {{violation}} of the local government's prohibition of such activities. When Clark took a boat ashore, Maui Governor Hoapili, responding to concerns of Christian missionaries living there, seized Clark and the sailors manning the boat. Hoapili agreed to release the men on the understanding that Clark would land the women at Lahaina. Clark had left instructions with the mate to fire some shots if Clark had not returned in an hour. Before Clark returned to John Palmer the mate fired five 9-pounder shots towards the house of the missionary William Richards, some of which landed in the yard without doing serious damage. Richards and his wife took shelter in the basement. Clark and his men returned to John Palmer and then sailed off without landing the women.|$|E

By this point, a number {{of the party}} guests had left, and the residents of the house, including David Evans, were asking the remaining guests to leave because they were concerned that the noise would cause neighbors to complain to police. When the strippers left the bathroom and the house for the second time, a resident locked the door so they (and the guests who had left the house) could not get back in.|$|E
