500|$|Despite her world-famous role, Smith {{is rarely}} {{recognized}} in public, which {{she does not}} mind, saying, [...] "it's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in the midst of}} all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice." [...] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian, she commented: [...] "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} a reprise was Aspinall's, who thought that as there was a [...] "welcome song", there should also be a [...] "goodbye song". The song {{contains}} broadly the same melody as the opening version, but with different lyrics and omitting the [...] "It's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here" [...] section. At 1:18, {{it is one of}} the Beatles' shorter songs (the shortest is [...] "Her Majesty" [...] at 0:23). The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967, two months after the version that opens the album. At the end of the track, Martin's pre-recorded applause sample segues into the final track of the album, [...] "A Day in the Life".|$|E

500|$|As Pausch {{walked into}} the {{standing}} ovation, he {{tried to stop the}} applause, get the audience to sit down, and begin the speech by commenting [...] "make me earn it", to which one member of the audience responded [...] "you did". He then commented on the irony of his [...] "last lecture" [...] in a series that used to be the [...] "Last Lecture" [...] series, but was renamed [...] "Journeys": [...] "It's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here. What Indira didn’t tell you is that this lecture series used to be called the 'Last Lecture'. If you had one last lecture to give before you died, what would it be? I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux. According to the actress, [...] "That {{was a lot of}} fun; I thought it was funny as well [...] It really was <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to stretch and play this driven woman who has a goal and is going to reach it, and in the meantime she's going to be sexy doing it. That {{was a lot of fun}} for me because the show [...] isn't realistic so, as actors, we get to play with different types of things." [...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
500|$|When {{she first}} arrived in Genoa City, Angelina set her eyes on Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), whom she {{developed}} a huge crush on. Of her crazy crush, DeGarmo said: [...] "Ooh, she wants him bad! Angie has her eyes, her heart and her body set on landing Kevin — and it scares him to death." [...] She said that Kevin was too sweet and nervous, and is weakened to Angelina's preying on him. [...] "She loves seeing him squirm" [...] DeGarmo stated. Of working with Rikaart, she said: [...] "Greg and I can't stop laughing during our scenes together." [...] During an interview with MSN, she stated: [...] "I've had the great pleasure sharing the screen with Mr. Greg Rikaart. Angelina gets {{a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin, and she's not afraid not to show it. It's a blast, because she makes him incredibly nervous [...] The sparks that fly on screen are just hilarious. It's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of." [...] Just before Kevin was set to marry his girlfriend Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson), Angelina persuaded him to help her escape town, as she was in danger. They returned home safe.|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the fame}} of Lisa Simpson, Smith is rarely {{recognized}} in public, {{as it is}} Lisa who appears on screen. However, Smith does not mind. She said, [...] "it's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in the midst of}} all this hype about the show, and people enjoying the show so much, and to be totally a fly on the wall; people never recognise me solely from my voice." [...] In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that [...] "It's the best job ever. I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life." [...] Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992, she considers it unimportant, saying [...] "there's part of me that feels it wasn't even a real Emmy." [...] The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and, at the time, a juried award without nominations. Still, Smith considers her work on the show a success. [...] "If I had to be associated with one character in fiction," [...] she said, [...] "I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson." [...] Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa: [...] "Yeardley has strong moral views about her character. There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says, 'No, I wouldn't say that.'" [...] Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show, particularly in the episode [...] "Lisa's Substitute", as able [...] "to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic." ...|$|E
500|$|Formby {{continued}} filming with ATP, and {{his second}} film of 1940, Spare a Copper, was again focused on {{an aspect of the}} war, this time combating fifth columnists and saboteurs in a Merseyside dockyard. Cinema-goers had begun to tire of war films, and his next venture, Turned Out Nice Again returned to less contentious issues, with Formby's character caught in a domestic battle between his new wife and mother. Early in the filming schedule, he took time to perform in an ENSA show that was broadcast on the BBC from Aldwych tube station as Let the People Sing; he sang four songs, and told the audience, [...] "Don't forget, it's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> British!" [...] Towards the end of 1940 Formby tried to enlist for active military service, despite Beryl informing him that by being a member of ENSA he was already signed up. The examining board rejected him as being unfit, because he had sinusitis and arthritic toes. He spent the winter season in pantomime at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, portraying Idle Jack in Dick Whittington. When the season came to an end the Formbys moved to London and, in May 1941, performed for the royal family at Windsor Castle. He had commissioned a new set of inoffensive lyrics for [...] "When I'm Cleaning Windows", but was informed that he should sing the original, uncensored version, which was enjoyed by the royal party, particularly Queen Mary, who asked for a repeat of the song. King George VI presented Formby with a set of gold cuff links, and advised him to [...] "wear them, not put them away".|$|E

500|$|Musician Harry Connick Jr., {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Leo. He {{received}} a call from co-creators Kohan and Max Mutchnick asking him to appear on Will & Grace, and agreed to do it after learning that it was his wife's favorite show. According to Debra Messing, who plays Grace, Kohan and Mutchnick had a specific vision of Grace's husband from the start. They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's what we got with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing." [...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before. I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I think that really being in love markedly changes Grace. That sexual energy in a great way has shaken things up, because it is the greatest threat to the friendship of Will and Grace to date." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1967 NBA Finals, the Sixers were {{pitted against}} Chamberlain's old team, the San Francisco Warriors of his {{one-time}} backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry. The Sixers {{won the first}} two games, with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting, but San Francisco won two of the next three games, so Philadelphia was up 3–2 prior to Game 6. In Game 6, the Warriors were trailing 123–122 with 15 seconds left. For the last play, Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry. However, the Sixers foiled it: when Barry ran past Thurmond's pick {{and drove to the}} basket, he was picked up by Chet Walker, making it impossible to shoot; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain, which made it impossible to pass. Barry botched his shot attempt, and the Sixers won the championship. Chamberlain said: [...] "It is <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of the greatest team in basketball... being a champion is like having a big round glow inside of you." [...] He contributed with 17.7 ppg and 28.7 rpg against fellow future Hall-of-Fame pivot Nate Thurmond, never failing to snare at least 23 rebounds in the six games. Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history. In 2002, writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season, Season of the 76ers, centering on Chamberlain. In the 1967–68 NBA season, matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers' sole surviving owner, Irv Kosloff. This conflict had been going along for a while: in 1965, Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25% of the franchise once he ended his career. Although there is no written proof for or against, ex-Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right; in any case, Kosloff declined the request, leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967. Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce, and later signed a one-year, $250,000 contract.|$|E

In fact, we know nothing about the matter, and had best not talk of things that we do not understand. As for these things being too <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> true--that is an argument which only deserves a smile.
