5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording.

The Diary conveys a strong sense of on-the-spot immediacy, reinforced by the diarist’s excellent ear. He wrote as if he were seated next to the principals and holding an audio recorder. Anyone who attempts to understand <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> Lincoln’s mind as he took office and as he made the fateful decisions leading to war is bound to find the Diary intriguing.|$|R

[...] Edward Howard, lyricist of the song, adds, [...] "It was a spiritual thing for me... <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> my mind at the time was Donny, because Donny was a very troubled person.

40|$|Sending {{a signal}} {{from one place to}} another is the {{accepted}} medium for communications. Thus communicating internationally through radio frequencies is a way of using others’ sovereign spaces. A simple wave could travel beyond the physical borders of a state, and whether it is allowed or not to do so it continues on its way. Therefore, any sovereign space has the right to understand <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> their sovereign space. In this respect placing what De Landa (cf. 1991) would term a ‘machinic phylum’ to search the electromagnetic spectrum is an option, and any other sovereign power may choose to do so. These activities mostly go beyond the sovereign rights of states since there is no sovereign claim over the content conveyed through air. Consequently, interception or radiolocation (radar) activities could abuse the sovereign rights of others while exceeding one’s own...|$|R
