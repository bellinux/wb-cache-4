2500|$|In 2003, Turkeltaub et al., reported: [...] "The {{complexities}} of pediatric brain imaging have precluded studies that trace the neural development of cognitive skills acquired during childhood. Using {{a task that}} isolates reading-related brain activity and minimizes confounding performance effects, <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> out a cross-sectional {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study using subjects whose ages ranged from 6 to 22 years. We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and Inferior frontal gyrus and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortica areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities. These findings inform current reading models and provide strong support for Orton's 1925 theory of reading development." ...|$|E

This was the reason <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left.

2500|$|Denying its {{involvement}} in the attacks, a Taliban spokesman said in a statement, [...] "they (India) send secret military experts to Afghanistan and they train the Afghan army. Had <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> out the attack, we would have claimed responsibility for it with pride since we have good reasons for it." [...] The Taliban spokesman also implicated Pakistan instead and further stated that the attack had {{its roots in the}} regional Indo-Pakistan rivalry. On 8 July, Afghanistan stated that it had no doubts that the attack was carried out in collaboration with [...] "foreign intelligence agencies", again an implicit reference to Pakistan's ISI. Prime minister of Pakistan Yousaf Raza Gillani denied any involvement of ISI in the attack and also remarked that his country had no interest in destabilising Afghanistan. Subsequently, there have been reports of Afghan officials blaming Pakistan directly and explicitly for the attack on the Indian embassy. Indian security analysts at the Institute of Conflict Management have claimed that [...] "the ISI-backed Taliban will not allow any Indian consolidation in Afghanistan, nor will they allow any stability in Kabul." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{their initial}} duty at Pensacola, the 33rd {{was ordered to}} report to Corinth, Mississippi, for duty with General Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Mississippi. Arriving just after the Confederate loss at Shiloh (in which Johnston was killed and {{replaced}} in command by General P.G.T. Beauregard), the 33rd {{was assigned to the}} brigade commanded by Colonel Alexander T. Hawthorn, which was part of the Army's 3rd Corps. In July 1862 Hawthorn's brigade became part of a division commanded by Major General William Hardee, and the following month the 33rd was transferred to a brigade (still in Hardee's division) commanded by Brigadier General Sterling Wood. Private Matthews reported being [...] "strung out in muddy ditches in S.A.M. Wood's brigade," [...] in May 1862, and also indicates that he and his comrades traded in their Pensacola muskets for [...] "new painted Enfield Rifles out of the boxes, with Minie balls cartridges, new bayonets and scabbards."

2500|$|A communiqué, {{released}} to the press by British GHQ, was not favourably received by the Australians. [...] "Yesterday evening, south of Armentières, <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> out some important raids on a front of two miles in which Australian troops took part. About [...] prisoners were captured". Australian losses, and doubts about the judgement of higher commanders, damaged relations between the AIF and the British, with further doubts about the reliability of British troops spreading in Australian units. In 2008, Grey wrote that McCay also made errors in judgement {{that contributed to the}} result, citing McCay's order not to consolidate the initial gains and that poor planning, ineffective artillery support and Australian lack of experience of Western Front conditions, contributed to the failure. A number of senior Australian officers were removed after the débâcle and the 5th Australian Division remained incapable of offensive action until late summer, when it began trench-raiding. In October the 6th Bavarian Reserve Division, with morale high after the defensive success at Fromelles, was sent to the Somme front and never recovered from the ordeal; Bavarian Reserve Regiment 16 spent ten days in the line and lost [...]|$|E

2500|$|In November 1918, Redbird Smith {{died at the}} age of 68. On the day of Redbird Smith's funeral, a {{large white}} crane flew from the east at sun rise and lit in a tree next to the stomp ground. According to John Smith, the most {{influential}} Nighthawk leader among Redbird Smith's sons, [...] "We were up in the stomp ground fixing to have services for my father when this crane was sitting in the tree near the stomp ground. C.P. Cornelius said, 'You watch and see if that crane isn't down by the graveyard when we bury your father.' [...] Pretty soon the crane flew off and lit in a tree just west of the graveyard. When <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> my father's coffin down to the graveyard, the crane sat there in that tree and hollered. After we buried my father, the crane sat there until sundown and then flew off to the west." [...] This event was reported by the Cherokee as an omen, for a crane is very wild and hardly ever can one approach within fifty yards of it without flying away.|$|E

He also said: [...] "Rehavam Ze'evi, Israel has restored your honor with the operation <b>we</b> <b>carried</b> out yesterday". Naveh said that [...] "The message of the operation is clear. The blood of an Israeli minister will not be forfeited and the perpetrators will be hunted down". Israeli officials said the crossing points, already closed for the Jewish holiday of Purim, would remain closed for at least a few days. Ze'evi's son, Palmach Ze'evi, said that [...] "For four years the killers sat half an hour away from Jerusalem and we didn't settle the score. But today things are changing", but described Olmert's actions as [...] "underhanded opportunism". Yisrael Beiteinu chairman Avigdor Lieberman said [...] "I bless Israel for taking this step. The actions are correct and honorable". He claimed that Israel {{had no choice but to}} go into the jail in reaction to statements by the PA that it planned to release the men, and added [...] "I don't understand why they need to lay siege to the jail - they need to completely destroy it without leaving a single stone standing".|$|E
