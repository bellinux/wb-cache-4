Collecting fees from the public can aid finance for improving waste management service. This study evaluates willingness to pay (WTP) by 401 households, selected using a stratified sampling method from all 15 wards of Gorkha municipality of Nepal for improved <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service</b> and the factors influencing it. We employed a contingent valuation method to elicit households’ WTP, logit regression model to determine factors influencing WTP and tobit regression model to determine factors influencing the maximum amount households {{are willing to pay}} for improved <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service.</b> Majority of households (61 %) are willing to pay an average amount of NRs. 73. 38 (0. 72 US$) per month.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the effects of intermunicipal {{cooperation}} and privatization on the delivery costs of urban solid waste services. The results of our empirical analysis, which we conducted among a sample of very small municipalities, indicate that small towns that cooperate incur lower costs for their <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service.</b> Cooperation also raises collection frequency and improves the quality of the service in small towns. By contrast, the form of production, whether it is public or private, does not result in systematic differences in costs. Interestingly, the degree of population dispersion has a significant positive relation with service costs. No evidence of scale economies is found because, it would seem, small municipalities exploit them by means of intermunicipal cooperation. Key words: local government, intermunicipal cooperation, privatization, contracting-out, solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This Article {{focused on}} privatised <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service</b> {{delivery}} in Arua Municipal Council (AMC). It provides {{insights into the}} current system of <b>waste</b> <b>collection,</b> explores the Concept of sustainability and highlights the recommendations. It was exploratory single case study embedded. The sampling methods were stratified random and purposive, based on the Integrated Sustainable Waste Management (ISWM) Model. Assessment Indicators were developed as an analytical tool in order to measure the sustainability of the waste services. The system is deemed sustainable if the technical, financial, social, environmental and institutional goals are achieved. Data collection methods involved questionnaires, interviews, Observation and documentary review. The findings indicated that there are two systems of waste collection; door-to-door and communal systems. The <b>collection</b> <b>services</b> are not sustainable because not all the goals as per the ISWM Model were achieved. The Author recommends; availability of appropriate and sufficient equipments and facilities, mobilisation of financial resources, public education and awareness on sound SWM, waste segregation, regulatory framework on SWM, strengthening of the monitoring system, community involvement in SWM and encouraging competition among private <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> operators...|$|R

40|$|The {{cooperative}} inter-municipal <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> {{can be a}} real {{added value}} in terms of costs reduction and high performance services. The chapter proposes a Multi Agent Approach to support the inter-municipal infrastructure. The Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is an approach suitable to implement a distributed physi- cally problem as the inter-municipal <b>waste</b> <b>collection.</b> The architecture of the approach is formalized by work-flow analysis: a static view by IDEF 0 diagram and a dynamic view by UML activity diagram. This analysis promotes the cooperation among municipalities to manage the <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service</b> in an optimal way. According to Italian laws, the municipalities are responsible for organizing the man- agement of municipal waste in agreement with the principles of transparency, efficiency, effectiveness and inexpensiveness. The coordination protocol among the agents allows to divide the costs among the municipalities in an efficient way. Finally, a discrete event simulation environment is developed to test the proposed MAS architecture...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—EU and UK Government {{targets for}} minimising and {{recycling}} household waste {{has led the}} responsible authorities to research the alternatives to landfill. In the work reported here the local <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> authority (Charnwood Borough Council) has adopted the aspirational strategy of becoming a “Zero Waste Borough ” to lead the drive for public participation. The work concludes that the separate <b>collection</b> of food <b>waste</b> {{would be needed to}} meet the two regulatory standards on recycling and biologically active wastes. An analysis of a neighbouring Authority (Newcastle-Under-Lyne Borough Council (NBC), a similar sized local authority that has a successful weekly food <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service</b> was undertaken. Results indicate that the main challenges for Charnwood Borough Council would be gaining householder co-operation, the extra costs of collection and organising alternative treatment. The analysis also demonstrated that there was potential offset value via anaerobic digestion for CBC to overcome these difficulties and improve its recycling performance...|$|R

40|$|Local level waste {{authorities}} and their officials directly interact {{and serve the}} people on behalf of higher governments. Given the influential positions they have {{on the quality of}} life of the citizens, these local waste authorities deserve more attention from researchers. This study throws light on the factors related to local waste management and administrators that have caused waste management failures in three mainland Chinese cities. Based on a survey conducted in 2002 - 2003, it was found that waste administrators in these cities are not professionally competent in their jobs and they are also not confident in using economic instruments to address waste management issues in their cities. These local waste authorities are generally under-funded, and funding politics has to some extent eroded the incentives to carry out the instructions of higher waste authorities. The community at large also does not respect local waste management work. The residents frequently litter, are unobservant of <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> times and are unwilling to pay for <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> <b>service.</b> All of these are handicapping environmentally sound waste management.
