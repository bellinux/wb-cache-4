She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 19 June 2006 {{as the first}} character to be introduced to the series by series producer, Bryan Kirkwood.

However, Metcalfe returned to screens on 17 February 2015 in a surprise, unannounced twist which saw Mercedes revealed as alive and well, living in Nice, France.

25|$|In her works, Abramović affirms her {{identity}} through {{the perspective of}} others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased.

Abramović's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows the spectators to do as they please <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> pushing the limits of what one would consider acceptable. This type of representation also reflects key political issues such as BDSM, which complicates and questions the relation between art versus sexuality and public discourse.|$|E
