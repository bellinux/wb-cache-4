5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
500|$|Aldous Huxley {{wrote in}} 1957 that Goya lacked Rubens' ability {{to fill the}} canvas with an ordered composition; but he {{considered}} The Third of May a success because Goya [...] "is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able to express what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with maximum force and clarity".|$|E
500|$|Dick Enberg {{hosted the}} post-match {{ceremony}} during which a victorious del Potro requested to address his fans in Spanish. Enberg declined the request {{saying that he}} was running out of time, but went on to list the corporate sponsored prizes del Potro won. A couple of minutes later, del Potro made the same request again, and only then did Enberg relent saying, [...] "Very quickly, in Spanish, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> hello to his friends here and in Argentina." [...] An emotional del Potro finally spoke a few sentences in Spanish to a cheering crowd. Many viewers expressed disappointment with Enberg and broadcaster CBS over the interview. A CBS executive later defended Enberg, noting that the contract with the United States Tennis Association required that certain sponsors receive time during the ceremony.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on March 29, 1910 and was met with some positive reviews. The film was known to have an alternate or working title of The Liar and the Thief, which is credited by Bowers and appears in an index in the Moving Picture World. Another reference for the film instead shortens the name to Done it Again. Two reviews for the film would appear in Moving Picture World, with the first praising the release and using a testimonial by Ray Norton to support {{that it is a}} good comedy. The second review was more nuanced and descriptive by highlighting the original plot and stating, [...] "The acting is sympathetic - one almost <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> vigorous, and the photographer has performed his part satisfactorily. The combination of these elements has contributed {{to the success of the}} picture." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] was {{recorded}} in 2008 at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. Speaking to Nick Levine of Digital Spy, Rihanna explained: [...] "I went into the studio making music my way. I found myself all at once." [...] In an interview on This Morning, Rihanna said that the song is not necessarily about a specific personal experience, but rather the general feelings of mental anguish, anxiety and confusion. Rihanna further explained {{that she wanted to}} record the song because she felt that listeners would be able to relate to the subject matter. When Good Girl Gone Bad was repackaged, Rihanna approached L.A. Reid, boss of Def Jam, suggesting to release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as a single and follow-up to [...] "Take a Bow". Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She's at that place where she can do that." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1927 Holst was {{commissioned}} by the New York Symphony Orchestra to write a symphony. Instead, he wrote an orchestral piece Egdon Heath, inspired by Thomas Hardy's Wessex. It was first performed in February 1928, a month after Hardy's death, at a memorial concert. By this time the public's brief enthusiasm for everything Holstian was waning, and the piece was not well received in New York. Olin Downes in The New York Times opined that [...] "the new score seemed long and undistinguished". The day after the American performance, Holst conducted the City of Birmingham Orchestra in the British premiere. The Times acknowledged the bleakness of the work but allowed that it matched Hardy's grim view of the world: [...] "Egdon Heath {{is not likely to}} be popular, but it says what the composer <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> whether we like it or not, and truth is one aspect of duty." [...] Holst had been distressed by hostile reviews of some of his earlier works, but he was indifferent to critical opinion of Egdon Heath, which he regarded as, in Adams's phrase, his [...] "most perfectly realized composition".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly arrange it. Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E
500|$|When {{the album}} was reissued, Rihanna {{approached}} L.A. Reid, the head of Def Jam Recordings and suggested {{that she wanted to}} release [...] "Disturbia" [...] as the next single. Speaking to MTV News, Reid said, [...] "It was the first time Rihanna actually came to me and said, 'Here's the song I want to put out.' She played me the song. That was her taking control [...] She understands what hits are, and she knows what she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She's at that place where she can do that." [...] It was solicited to US contemporary hit radio on June 17, 2008, and was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom on July 22, 2008. [...] "Disturbia" [...] earned Rihanna an award for Best International Song at the 2009 NRJ Music Awards. It peaked at number one in Belgium (Flanders) and New Zealand and became a top-ten hit in over twenty countries worldwide. The single topped the US Billboard Hot 100 chart for two consecutive weeks, and became Rihanna's third number one single from Good Girl Gone Bad and fourth overall on the Hot 100 chart. The music video for [...] "Disturbia" [...] was directed by Anthony Mandler and portrays Rihanna in various locations such as in a prison cell and gas chamber.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} was not universally affirmative, but Richard Corliss of Time stated that Spielberg [...] "has energized each frame with allusive legerdemain and an intelligent density {{of images and}} emotions." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called the film [...] "a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable." [...] Julie Salamon of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film as [...] "an edgy, intelligent script by playwright Tom Stoppard, Spielberg has made an extraordinary film out of Mr. Ballard's extraordinary war experience." [...] J. Hoberman from The Village Voice decried that the serious subject was undermined by Spielberg's [...] "shamelessly kiddiecentric" [...] approach. Roger Ebert gave a mixed reaction, [...] "Despite the emotional potential in the story, it didn't much move me. Maybe, like the kid, I decided that no world where you can play with airplanes can be all that bad." [...] On his TV show with Gene Siskel, Ebert said that the film [...] "is basically {{a good idea for}} a film that never gets off the ground." [...] Siskel added, [...] "I don't know what the film is about. It's so totally confused and taking things from different parts. On one hand, if it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something about a child's-eye view of war, you got a movie made by John Boorman called Hope and Glory that was just released that is much better, and much more daring in showing the whimsy that children's view of war is. On the other hand, this film wants to hedge its bet and make it like an adventure film, so you've got like Indiana Jones with the John Malkovich character helping the little kid through all the fun of war. I don't know what Spielberg wanted to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the poem}} is {{concerned}} primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator, {{it can be difficult}} to interpret. Laurence Perrine wrote, [...] " [...] presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person's head within a certain time interval, in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical". This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic. On the surface, [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle-aged man who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something but is afraid to do so, and ultimately does not. The dispute, however, lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking, whether he is actually going anywhere, what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and to what the various images refer.|$|E
2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I mean, if you want {{to put it in the}} worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E

2500|$|On October 22, 1999, {{approximately}} {{one month after}} his death, The Washington Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Media tune out torture death of Arkansas boy." [...] The story contrasted the lack of coverage of the Dirkhising case with the treatment the murder of Matthew Shepard received. The story quoted Tim Graham, director of media studies at Media Research Center, a Conservative media watchdog group that frequently criticizes liberal bias, as saying, [...] "Nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything negative about homosexuals. Nobody wants to {{be seen on the}} wrong side of that issue." [...] Brent Bozell, media critic and director of the Media Research Center, accused the media of deliberately spiking the story. Bozell wrote, [...] "Had he been openly gay and his attackers heterosexual, the crime would have led all the networks. But no liberal media outlet has as its villains two gay men." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Perkins {{told her}} agent, Debi Allen, {{about the idea}} and a meeting with a BBC comedy {{commissioner}} followed shortly after. Perkins was advised to work her idea into a six-part sitcom, which she initially resisted doing as she saw it more as a comedy drama instead. A sitcom required [...] "a 'sit' or precinct" [...] and Perkins eventually decided to locate the show in a veterinary surgery, as it features {{people from all walks}} of life. After the first episode was commissioned, a table-read was organised for December 2011. In April 2012, Perkins was filming World's Most Dangerous Roads in Laos, when she was told her sitcom had been commissioned for a full series. From April to July, Perkins wrote the remaining episodes. Perkins later called Heading Out [...] "a midlife crises sitcom", explaining [...] "It's more about how awkward it is to tell your parents anything, as opposed to just the gay issue. Essentially, when you come out to your parents, you have to tell them, 'I'm having sex!'. And no one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Planet of the Apes premiered in February 1968. The {{film was}} a hit upon its release, {{as well as a}} {{critical}} and commercial success. In the opening credits, Harrison was billed under the tag [...] "introducing Linda Harrison"; although she had appeared in three previous films. Zanuck wanted to draw attention to Harrison because he felt the role would catapult her to stardom. Harrison impressed audiences with her hourglass figure, long dark hair, and large brown eyes, which, in the absence of spoken dialogue, did most of her acting, though some critics were unimpressed. Renata Adler of the New York Times dismissed Harrison as “Heston's Neanderthal flower girl. She wiggles her hips when she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something." [...] The success of Planet of the Apes spawned four sequels, an animated cartoon series, a live-action TV series, a [...] "reboot" [...] by Tim Burton, and three prequels to the original film. Heston and Harrison appeared in the first sequel, Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Three decades later, Harrison had a brief cameo in the 2001 reboot, which also featured Heston.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, O'Neal reiterated {{his belief}} that Bryant {{deserved}} the MVP award. Bryant {{went on to win}} the award for the first time in his career that season. During the offseason, O'Neal was at a party, and got up to rap in front of the crowd. O'Neal mentioned Bryant multiple times in the rap, saying that [...] "Kobe couldn't do it without me", referring to Bryant and the Lakers loss in the 2008 NBA Finals to the Boston Celtics. He also rapped, [...] "Kobe, tell me how my ass tastes". During the rap, O'Neal also blamed his divorce on Bryant's comments to investigators in 2004 about O'Neal paying off women. Bryant commented that he [...] "didn't take (O'Neal's rap) any kind of way whatsoever." [...] O'Neal later said he was freestyling and that [...] "it was all done in fun. Nothing serious whatsoever ... I'm totally cool with Kobe. No issue at all." [...] Rap artist Snoop Dogg, a Laker fan, agreed that [...] "Shaq has all access and the right to do and say what he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in fun, in the spirit of rap." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there is}} a second problem about the interaction. Namely, the {{question}} of how the interaction takes place, where in dualism [...] "the mind" [...] is assumed to be non-physical and by definition outside of the realm of science. The mechanism which explains the connection between the mental and the physical would therefore be a philosophical proposition as compared to a scientific theory. For example, compare such a mechanism to a physical mechanism that is well understood. Take a very simple causal relation, such as when a cue ball strikes an eight ball and causes it to go into the pocket. What happens in this case is that the cue ball has a certain amount of momentum as its mass moves across the pool table with a certain velocity, and then that momentum is transferred to the eight ball, which then heads toward the pocket. Compare this to the situation in the brain, where one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a decision causes some neurons to fire and thus causes a body to move across the room. The intention to [...] "cross the room now" [...] is a mental event and, as such, it does not have physical properties such as force. If it has no force, then it would seem that it could not possibly cause any neuron to fire. However, with Dualism, an explanation is required of how something without any physical properties has physical effects.|$|E
