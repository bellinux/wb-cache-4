5|$|As <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Brushstrokes works, {{it is in}} part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from the depiction of the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E

Avoiding Philip's army, Crista was able to enter the city by night unobserved. The {{following}} night, catching Philip's forces by surprise, he attacked and routed their camp. Philip, escaping to his ships in the river, made his way over the mountains and back to Macedonia, having burned his fleet and left behind many thousands of his men that had died or been taken prisoner, along <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> armies' possessions.

5|$|In late 1143, Stephen faced a {{new threat}} in the east, when Geoffrey de Mandeville, the Earl of Essex, rose up in {{rebellion}} against the King in East Anglia. Stephen had disliked the baron for several years, and provoked the conflict by summoning Geoffrey to court, where the King arrested him. Stephen threatened to execute Geoffrey unless the baron handed over his various castles, including the Tower of London, Saffron Walden and Pleshey, all important fortifications because they were in, or close to, London. Geoffrey gave in, but once free he headed north-east into the Fens to the Isle of Ely, from where he began a military campaign against Cambridge, {{with the intention of}} progressing south towards London. <b>With</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> other problems and with Hugh Bigod in open revolt in Norfolk, Stephen lacked the resources to track Geoffrey down in the Fens and made do with building a screen of castles between Ely and London, including Burwell Castle.|$|E
5|$|Lord Hailsham {{left his}} {{position}} in 1938 due to his failing health, {{and was replaced by}} Lord Maugham, who was appointed on 15 March. His appointment was done on Schuster's advice and was considered quite a surprise as he had no real political experience; even Maugham himself admitted he had not expected to be offered the job. Schuster and Maugham had a difficult relationship, especially after the start of the Second World War in 1939, due to their differing political opinions. Schuster did not play an active part in policy decisions in this period, partially because of his disagreements with Maugham and partially because Maugham preferred to work on legislation and policy changes himself. Schuster later said that he got on <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Lord Chancellors except one—Maugham.|$|E

25|$|Though certain {{fragments}} of the original Smile recording sessions subsequently leaked from 1967–2011 via studio albums, compilations and bootlegs, a comprehensive and official package had not been compiled by Capitol Records, {{largely due to the}} logistics in organizing the hundreds of convoluted song components and out of respect for Wilson who was once deeply disturbed by some of the recordings, associating the album <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> failures.|$|E

If both of the armies had been able to execute their plans simultaneously, it would have resulted in a mutual counterclockwise movement as they attacked each other's left flank.|$|E
