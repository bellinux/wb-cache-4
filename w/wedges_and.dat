5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E

25|$|The main chapel with an axial portal, {{consists}} of pilasters and corebls surrounding the main door, then gabled trim and a pronounced superior semi-circular pediment, which encircles an ocular hexagonal window. This Baroque era landmark, {{is marked by}} plain pilasters, <b>wedges,</b> <b>and</b> cyma line with angular pinnacles. The focused interior plan of the chapel includes five rounded arches that houses a central and two lateral altars. The pulpit is a basic with a hexagonal screen of wooden balusters.|$|E
25|$|Ethnically {{originated}} creations include chicken Vesuvio, {{with roasted}} bone-in chicken cooked {{in oil and}} garlic next to garlicky oven-roasted potato <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> a sprinkling of green peas. Another is the Puerto Rican-influenced jibarito, a sandwich made with flattened, fried green plantains instead of bread. There is also the mother-in-law, a tamale topped with chili and served on a hot dog bun. The tradition of serving the Greek dish, saganaki while aflame, has its origins in Chicago's Greek community. The appetizer, which consists of a square of fried cheese, is doused with Metaxa and flambéed table-side.|$|E

25|$|Sexagesimal numerals were a mixed radix {{system that}} {{retained}} the alternating base10 and base6 {{in a sequence}} of cuneiform vertical <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> chevrons. By 1950BC, this was a positional notation system. Sexagesimal numerals came to be widely used in commerce, but were also used in astronomical and other calculations. This system was exported from Babylonia and used throughout Mesopotamia, and by every Mediterranean nation that used standard Babylonian units of measure and counting, including the Greeks, Romans and Egyptians. Babylonian-style sexagesimal numeration is still used in modern societies to measure time (minutes per hour) and angles (degrees).|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two ski poles, except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two ski poles. Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E

50|$|A gap wedge is {{the next}} higher-lofted wedge after the {{pitching}} <b>wedge,</b> <b>and</b> is usually used in a similar manner.

500|$|The {{other two}} periods of human {{habitation}} are discernible mainly {{by the presence}} of a large shell midden on the site; testifying to the abundant shellfish and game in the area. [...] The earliest of the periods, the [...] "Locarno Beach" [...] type, used many different types of stone tools, including microblades, adzes, and other shaped or sharpened objects. [...] The next culture type, dating from around 2500 years ago and known as the [...] "Gulf of Georgia" [...] type, is characterized by an increased use of bone tools, such as <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> awls made from antlers, as well as different kinds of wood. This culture type's presence on the site ends with the arrival of Europeans, and the colonization of Vancouver Island — altogether, around 1000 indigenous artifacts were recovered from the site during two separate archaeological digs.|$|E
500|$|Chevron-carved {{voussoirs}} (<b>wedges)</b> <b>and</b> three stone human heads, weathered by {{time and}} also probably from the 12th century, have been repositioned over the doorway, {{which is at}} the west end of {{the south side of the}} church. The wedges probably come from a former chancel arch and apse, removed (as in other churches in Anglesey) to make the chancel larger. The doorway has been enlarged at some point, most likely during the early part of the 19th century. On the north side, a doorway was added in the 18th century, but it was subsequently blocked and a window inserted instead. One writer has speculated that this might have been a leper niche and window. There are two other modern windows in the north wall, and all three are at different heights. There is a bellcote at the west end, housing a bell (probably from the 18th century). The roof has been described as being [...] "clearly one of the earliest on the island".|$|E
500|$|Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, {{the track}} was a walkway {{consisting}} mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, {{driven into the}} underlying peat. The planks, which were up to [...] wide, [...] long and less than [...] thick, were cut from trees up to 400years old and [...] in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden <b>wedges,</b> <b>and</b> mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed {{on top of the}} first one to bring the plank above it level {{with the rest of the}} walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the full diameter of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found.|$|E
50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} bottom brackets), and doors. A wedge-type door stop (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door <b>and</b> the <b>wedge,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>wedge</b> <b>and</b> the floor (or other surface).|$|R

2500|$|To {{minimize}} image aberrations {{the angle}} {{plane of the}} glass wedges has to be placed orthogonal to the angle plane of the air-wedge. Because intensity of Fresnel reflections from a glass surface are polarization and angle dependent, {{it is necessary to}} keep the air-wedge plane nearly perpendicular to the incident beam (±5deg) to minimize instrumentally induced intensity variation. This is very important when coupling the air-wedge interferometer to imaging optics. The air-wedge interferometer has a very simple design and requiring only 2 standard BK7 glass <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> 1 mirror holder (Fig.3).|$|E

2500|$|Innis {{points out}} that the tablets were not well suited to pictographic writing because making {{straight}} lines [...] "tended to pull up the clay." [...] Therefore Sumerian scribes used a cylindrical reed stylus to stamp or press <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> lines on the moist tablet. Scribes gradually developed cuneiform signs to represent syllables and the sounds of the spoken language. Innis writes that as a heavy material, clay was not very portable and so was not generally suited for communication over large areas. Cuneiform inscription required years of training overseen by priests. Innis contends therefore, that as a writing medium, clay tended to favour decentralization and religious control.|$|E
2500|$|The queue {{contains}} several interactive features. In the “spike room”, {{the ceiling}} {{appears to be}} retained by several upright bamboo poles. When the key supporting pole is pushed, guests are startled by sounds of the ceiling dropping as the spikes begin to descend slowly toward them. In the next area, large stone blocks released from the ceiling (triggered by the diamond-shaped stones below) are barely kept in place by wooden <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> supports. Further on, in the Rotunda Calendar, pulling on a rope triggers responses from Dr. Dunfor Pullit, an out-of-sight archeologist supported by the rope beneath the sarcophagus stone. Various crates throughout the queue contain some significant features; one marked with the number [...] "990 6753" [...] refers to {{the number on the}} crate holding the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Another crate is marked [...] "Deliver to Club Obi Wan", referring to a fictional club at the beginning of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, itself a reference to the character Obi Wan Kenobi from Star Wars.|$|E
2500|$|The socialite was {{influenced}} by minister Marty Angelo in jail, referring to a [...] "new beginning" [...] {{in an interview with}} talk-show host Larry King on June 28, 2007 (two days after her release) and quoting from Angelo's autobiography (Once Life Matters: A New Beginning). On June 9, Angelo unsuccessfully petitioned Sauer to let him serve the remainder of Hilton's sentence if the judge would release her to an alternative treatment program. Hilton told King during the interview that she had taken Adderall for ADHD since childhood. Due to her incarceration, The Simple Life finished its run {{at the end of its}} fifth season in July 2007. In early August, Hilton signed a licensing agreement with Antebi for a signature footwear line (Paris Hilton Footwear, featuring stilettos, platforms, flats, <b>wedges</b> <b>and</b> a sports collection) which was expected to reach stores in 2008. In mid-August, she introduced a line of tops, dresses, coats and jeans at the Kitson Boutique in Los Angeles. Hilton called the event [...] "a dream come true", describing the clothing line as [...] "fun, bright and flashy". In December 2007 she posed nude (covered with gold paint) to promote [...] "Rich Prosecco", a canned version of the Italian sparkling wine, traveling to Germany to appear in print ads for the wine.|$|E
