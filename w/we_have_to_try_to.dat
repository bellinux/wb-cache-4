One of the simplest ways is to station two range-finders in the tops, as far away from each other as possible. Each man gets a bead on the enemy with his glasses, and then proceeds to get the angle between the bead and an imaginary line drawn between his station and that taken by the other fellow. The three points--that is, the two range-finders and the enemy--form a triangle, and having one line and the two angles to work on, the working out of the problem gives the distance the gunners are hunting for." ...|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor work {{is focused}} on {{possibilities}} of physiotherapy by a laterally flat foot, a deep stabilisation system and their mutual interference.

In this paper, we show that explanatory reduction cannot be defended on metaphysical grounds. Nevertheless, indispensability arguments for reductive explanations can be developed, taking into account actual scientific practice and the role of epistemic interests. Reductive explanations might be indispensable to address some epistemic interest answering a specific explanation-seeking question in the most accurate, adequate and efficient way. Just like explanatory pluralists often advocate the indispensability of higher levels of explanation pointing at the pragmatic value of the explanatory information obtained on these higher levels, we argue that explanatory reduction – traditionally understood as the contender of pluralism – can be defended in a similar way. The pragmatic value reductionist, lower level explanations might have in the biomedical sciences and the social sciences is illustrated by some case studies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Successful {{commercial}} operation of KTX {{in the high}} speed line (HSL), conventional line (CL) and at the interfaces between HSL and CL had been started since April 1 st, 2004. During KTX project of 12 years, Korea high speed railroad technology had overcome many technical difficulties and acquired many precious experiences in terms of interfaces of R/S and infrastructures. Those things were adapted and integrated to develop {{the next generation of}} KTX which has technically compatible system for existing infrastructures. The new high speed train had successfully completed the 350 km/h test run quite recently and now is commissioning to verify the full system reliability and safety. The major characteristics of KTX and the next generation of KTX will be compared and various technical experiences will be shared. And the strategic plan to export the next generation of KTX to the world market will be introduced. As it does, according to opening the KTX from Seoul to Busan, we have to think what the next step is. Like other countries of developing the high speed rail system, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> export some kinds of system for further technology and industry development...|$|E

These engagements {{are part of a}} wider creative securities approach that explores the contributions that social practices make to protection of data and information. Our most popular creative security engagement was the participative modelling of risk scenarios in LEGO. Over 300 participants worked with our creative engagement tools and artefacts over the life-time of the project. These creative engagements were designed to bring together stakeholders from different backgrounds to form a collective picture about the information risks in a particular service scenario. One participant summarised the value of the LEGO engagement in this way: “The best thing about this is that normally <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> somehow keep all of this in mind, whereas this [process] allows us to see it all at once‿. As the TREsPASS project progressed we refined our creative security engagements to enable participants to focus on the interactions and relationships within a particular scenario and examine them from different perspectives. This book represents our approach to creative engagements and gives examples of where we have used this approach to positive effect...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the conception of God in John Eriugena's "Periphyseon". My thesis is that in "Periphyseon", we can find two different concepts of God the connection of which is not easily understood. On the one hand there is a conception of God as someone who creates the world in the act of selfcreation and who finally returns to himself as to an end. On the other hand, there is a concept of God as the Trinity of divine persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). In my work, at first I attempt to present both of Eriugena's conceptions of God in more detail. Afterwards, I show how Eriugena himself attempts to connect both concepts. However, I argue that we are not actually able to understand this connection on the basis of Eriugena's explanation; rather, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> infer this connection on our own. This is the aim of the last chapter, in which I try to achieve this - with the aid of Beierwaltes' interpretation - {{on the grounds of the}} dual terms of "creation" and "causation".
