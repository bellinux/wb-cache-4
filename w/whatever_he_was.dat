But <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> however he came across, he was more human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

500|$|Campling {{and other}} critics have commented {{that one of the}} main {{features}} of the show is the ability of the locals to laugh at themselves and their eccentricities. Campling wrote of the Skipton show: [...] "The ability to laugh at itself is one of this country's finest attributes, but the Skipton mob were only too happy to celebrate their insularity." [...] Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian, who reviewed the Dartford episode, said: [...] "Going to a place and insulting it takes guts and careful strategies. Steel made use {{of the fact that he}} is from nearby Swanley, both to signal that he knows the area but also that – <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to say about Dartford – it was better than his hometown." [...] Another journalist, reviewing the Penzance episode in the North Devon Journal commented: [...] "Why do we like programmes that laugh at us? Because, I hope, we laugh at ourselves. We're not ignorant of our stereotypes. West Cornwall? Aaarrrrr!" ...|$|E

He served his country during World War II, marched {{in the civil rights}} movement, led a labor union and vigorously defended Americans’ Second Amendment rights." [...] Former First Lady Nancy Reagan said that she was [...] "heartbroken" [...] over Heston's death and released a statement, reading, [...] "I will never forget Chuck as a hero on the big screen in the roles he played, but more importantly I considered him a hero in life for the many times that he stepped up to support Ronnie in <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing." ...|$|E

This generated longstanding controversy over their differences with B.I.G., and in later interviews, both rappers would downplay the incident: [...] "It {{was one of them}} skits where we was looking at our competition. And when Ghost is saying <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying, we kinda knew who he was talking about, but it wasn't like we was trying to start a beef. It's just sometimes, when you get in the booth and you start saying what you wanna say, it just happened." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. It would take me five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> thinking and <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
