50|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> {{is a form}} {{of thermal}} {{spraying}} where two consumable metal wires are fed independently into the spray gun. These wires are then charged and an arc is generated between them. The heat from this arc melts the incoming wire, which is then entrained in an air jet from the gun.

5000|$|Plasma {{transferred}} wire arc (PTWA) {{is another}} form of <b>wire</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> which deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylinder, or on the external surface of a part of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of Aluminum engine blocks {{without the need for}} heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as [...] "feedstock" [...] for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the type of a wire. After atomization, forced air transports the stream of molten droplets onto the bore wall. The particles flatten when they impinge {{on the surface of the}} substrate, due to the high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact. The stacked particles make up a high wear resistant coating. The PTWA thermal spray process utilizes a single wire as the feedstock material. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" [...] (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.|$|E

The microstructures of coating were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) as well as the powder precursor. Analysis in the coating showed the formation of an amorphous matrix with boron and tungsten carbides randomly dispersed. At high amplifications were identified boron carbides at interface boron carbide/amorphous matrix by TEM. This kind of carbides growth can be attributed to partial crystallization by heterogeneous nucleation. These interfaces have not been reported in the literature by thermal spraying process. The measurements of average microhardness on amorphous matrix and boron carbides were 9. 1 and 23. 85 [*]GPa, respectively. By contrast, the microhardness values of unmelted boron carbide in the amorphous phase were higher than in the substrate, approaching 2. 14 [*]GPa.

Young’s modulus of the coatings depends on the lamella thickness and the oxide content.

The Al 12 Si coating had highest hardness and wear resistance above all coatings.

Organic coating could fail prematurely and result in corrosion progression from coating failure. This paper will discuss the overall framework of experiments to justify the performance of thermal arc spray aluminium coating. In this research 99. 5 % aluminium was used as the coating material in wire form of 2. 3 mm diameter using <b>wire</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> method. Six samples were prepared with different thickness of coating from 200 to 400 microns. Mechanical tests such as Pull-off Test and Bend Test were performed to evaluate the coating performance.

Hardness Test and Surface Morphology Analysis were also performed with coating thickness ranged between 350 - 400 microns to inspect and evaluate the coating properties. The hardness test showed an average value of 209. 7 HV. Surface morphology analysis using FE-SEM indicated low porosity structures and high content of oxide.

Moreover, it has been found that these coatings also lead to low friction and wear. The reason for improved tribological performance is believed to result from a nanocrystalline layer that forms in the sliding contact. In this paper, we use on-line wear measurement to study the dynamics of the running-in process. A pin-on-disk tribometer coupled to a radionuclide wear measurement (RNT) system was used to investigate the friction and wear behavior of <b>wire</b> <b>arc</b> <b>spray</b> (LDS) coatings sliding against chromium coatings under lubricated conditions. After the friction experiments, X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS) and Focused Ion Beam analysis (FIB) was used to characterize the worn surfaces. By introducing a time-dependent Stribeck plot, we analyzed running-in under constant and transient sliding c onditions and observed a strong reduction of friction in the boundary lubrication regime. Wear rates of the LDS disks {{as well as of the}} chromium plated pins are ultra-low. XPS revealed carbon diffusion at room temperature in wear tracks of disks that showed a very low coefficient of friction (CoF) of 0. 01, whereas this carbon diffusion could not be detected in the wear track of a disk without running-in, i. e. a final CoF of 0. 12. As this is the most significant difference found between differently run-in systems, the described carbon diffusion might be relevant for the observed friction behaviour. Running-in behaviour can only be discussed in terms of friction, as, even with RNT, no significant wear could be measured. The comparison of running-in under transient and constant conditions showed only minor differences in the final friction behavior...|$|E
