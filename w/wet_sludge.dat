The waste and wood chips as BA were composted in 300 L mechanically aerated reactors. The range of process conditions tested were: aeration rate from 1. 68 to 13. 04 L/h/kg of wet sludge; BA particle size distribution of < 10 mm, 10 - 20 mm and 20 - 30 mm, and; BA:PSS incorporation ratio of 0. 55 - 1. 11 (kg of wet wood chips/kg of <b>wet</b> <b>sludge).</b> The results showed that a high aeration rate and a high BA:PSS ratio produced a faster stabilization whereas BA of small particles size distribution increased the amount of biodegradable matter and slowed down stabilization. The composting temperature regime was positively correlated to O 2 consumption with a high BA:PSS ratio and a small BA particles size. A low aeration rate, without being O 2 limiting, optimized the composting process since too high or too low an aeration rate favored heat losses through respectively convection and water evaporation. Water loss was positively correlated with temperature regime and a higher BA:PSS ratio as opposed to a small BA particle size distribution. Similarly, medium to high aeration rates favored water removal. The composting process duration was reduced with a high aeration rates of 6. 22 or 9. 8 L/h/kg of <b>wet</b> <b>sludge</b> and a high BA:PSS ratio of 1. 11.

40|$|Sludge from {{wastewater}} treatment plants in five Swedish pulp and paper mills has been burned together with wood in a circulating fluidised bed (CFB) boiler. The sludge was either mechanically dewatered or pre-dried. The mechanically dewatered sludge had to be fed with a pump, but the pre-dried sludge could be fed by the fuel feed system normally used for coal, wood chips or wood pellets. In parallel to the combustion tests in the CFB boiler the sludges were also investigated as single fuels in a small laboratory FB. The Swedish {{pulp and paper industry}} produces three major fractions of sludge: pure fibre sludge, sludge produced by employing a precipitation species like ironaluminiumsulphate, and finally, sludge subjected to biological cleaning. The way of production of the sludge influences its content of, for example, nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine, but the composition of the sludge is also influenced by the pulp and paper process. The present measurements show that the concentrations of nitrogen, sulphur and chlorine in the sludge have a great impact on the corresponding gaseous emissions from combustion. Actions to prevent these emissions could be necessary, depending on the origin of the sludge and treatment process used. In the present project all sludges were burned with wood-pellets as the main fuel under identical operating conditions, typical for a CFB boiler. Wood pellets were chosen as a well defined, low-polluting fuel that makes comparison of emissions from the sludges clear. Co-combustion with wood-pellets has the advantage of enabling operation also with <b>wet</b> <b>sludges</b> that cannot be used as single fuels without pre-drying.

Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl) phosphonium chloride and widely used 1 -butyl- 3 - methylimidazolium methyl sulfate were evaluated to extract lipids from raw and dried sludge (96 % and 2 %, wt. water content, respectively) and {{compared to the}} conventional Soxhlet method using organic solvents. Both these ionic liquids showed suitability for lipid extraction from raw sludge, giving even better results than expected from dried sludge. The [C 4 mim][MeSO 4] ionic liquid reached 18. 5 % and 26. 9 % of lipids, 14. 1 % and 18. 4 % of biodiesel from dried and raw sludge, respectively. The [P(CH 2 OH) 4]Cl ionic liquid gained 23. 4 % and 27. 6 % of lipids, 17. 0 % and 19. 8 % of biodiesel from dried and raw sludge respectively, reaching comparable results to the conventional Soxhlet method (27. 2 % of lipids, 19. 4 % of biodiesel).

Successive leaching of sludge solids with 0. 5 M, 3. 0 M, 3. 0 M; and 6. 0 M HNO{sub 3 } for a total mixing time of 558 h removed 84 % of the {sup 137 }Cs. The use of caustic leaching prior to HNO{sub 3 } leaching, and the use of HF with HNO{sub 3 } in acidic leaching, increased the rate of {sup 137 }Cs dissolution. Gel formation proved {{to be one of the}} biggest problems associated with HNO{sub 3 } leaching of the W- 25 sludge...|$|E
40|$|The AFGD {{process as}} {{demonstrated}} by Pure Air at the Bailly Station offers a reliable and cost-effective means of achieving {{a high degree of}} SO{sub 2 } emissions reduction when burning high-sulfur coals. Many innovative features have been successfully incorporated in this process, and it is ready for widespread commercial use. The system uses a single-loop cocurrent scrubbing process with in-situ oxidation to produce wallboard-grade gypsum instead of <b>wet</b> <b>sludge.</b> A novel wastewater evaporation system minimizes effluents. The advanced scrubbing process uses a common absorber to serve multiple boilers, thereby saving on capital through economies of scale. Major results of the project are: (1) SO{sub 2 } removal of over 94 percent was achieved over the three-year demonstration period, with a system availability exceeding 99. 5 percent; (2) a large, single absorber handled the combined flue gas of boilers generating 528 MWe of power, and no spares were required; (3) direct injection of pulverized limestone into the absorber was successful; (4) Wastewater evaporation eliminated the need for liquid waste disposal; and (5) the gypsum by-product was used directly for wallboard manufacture, eliminating the need to dispose of waste sludge...|$|E
40|$|A {{two-phase}} hollow-fiber (HF) liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) method {{followed by}} gas chromatography {{was developed for}} quantification of 8 major polybrominated diphenyl ethers at trace level in sewage sludge. In this method the porous polypropylene hollow fibers filled with a few microliters of organic solvent, were immersed in aqueous samples of <b>wet</b> <b>sludge</b> which were spiked with the PBDEs at ng/l level. Parameters such as salt concentration, stirring speed, extraction time and pH were optimized and the optimum extraction conditions were then applied to the determination of PBDEs in sewage sludge from Källby sewage treatment plant in Lund. The optimized method allowed detection of 5. 1 µg kg– 1 and 0. 43 µg kg– 1 of BDE- 47 and 183, respectively, in dried sludge. The findings were compatible with the results from recent research on PBDEs level in sewage sludge samples from Sweden. Although BDE- 209 was expected to have the highest level, it was not detected. Limit of detection, photodegradation or/and biodegradation of BDE- 209 during treatment or experiment are major reasons. Low organic solvent consumption, low sample volume requirement, high preconcentration factor, simplicity without using expensive instrument for extraction and excellent sample clean-up are some important factors that make this sample preparation technique very useful for determination of PBDEs in sludge...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} of {{sludge composting}} {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} zeolite addition(occupying the <b>wet</b> weight of <b>sludge</b> and straw 5 % and 10 %) on ammonia volatilization and influence factors. Sludge and straw were raw materials. The results indicated that adding 5 % and 10 % zeolite to the sludge could significantly decrease the NH 3 volatilization cumulative rate of 27. 9 % and 48. 7 %. The pH value of composting with zeolite addition increased 0. 09 ~ 0. 22 compared with the contrast. Electrical conductivity(EC) of composting with zeolite addition maintained lower level which were 1 876. 7 ~ 2 636. 7 uS·cm- 1. Zeolite addition decreased the content of NH 4 +-N by 9. 07 %~ 22. 2 % when compared with the contrast. Zeolite as an additive in sludge composting could decrease the cumulative rate of ammonia volatilization. Thus, zeolite is a new potential additive which will bring prospects of application in sludge composting...|$|R
40|$|The {{beneficial}} use of wastewater sludge is {{to some extent}} restricted {{by the presence of}} human pathogens. Following a risk assessment and monitoring programme {{it was found that the}} pathogen which posed the highest potential risk of infection in treated sludge was Giardia. Giardia cyst concentrations were found to be approximately 900 /g <b>wet</b> weight of <b>sludge</b> following anaerobic digestion, although not all of the cysts may have been infective. In further studies three methods of wastewater sludge disposal or treatment were investigated. Anaerobically digested and mechanically dewatered sludge was stored for up to 60 weeks, incorporated into sandy soil and composted on a laboratory scale. Giardia cysts remained at levels which could be considered a public health concern after storage of sludge for over one year and after composting. However, cysts appeared to be destroyed within 12 weeks following soil amendment. The implications of the presence of Giardia for sludge disposal are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{treatment}} of sewage sludge is an ongoing challenge in wastewater treatment processes. Many advanced technologies are emerging to further reduce the volumes of bio-solids produced. Thermal treatment methods are increasingly applied to help achieve this. They are used for sludge conditioning, {{as in the case}} of thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment for anaerobic sludge digestion, or even used as a complete sludge treatment method, {{as in the case of}} <b>wet</b> oxidation <b>sludge</b> treatment. These processes generally subject sewage sludge to elevated temperature (> 100 degreesC) and pressure (> 1 bar) conditions. In the case of thermal hydrolysis, it has been established the final viscosity of the treated sludge is significantly reduced. However, this change in sludge viscosity as the treatment progresses has not been fully examined. A deeper understanding on the rheological behaviour of sludge under thermal treatment conditions is valuable in the optimization and design of these processes. In this study, the apparent viscosity of thickened waste activated sludge (10 wt% solids) was measured at shear rate of 100 s- 1, in real-time, while the sludge was subjected to high temperature (80 - 145 degreesC) and pressure (5 bar) conditions over 1 hour. At lower temperatures, the apparent viscosity of sludge was found to decrease rapidly in the first 15 minutes before becoming more gradual in the subsequent treatment period. At higher temperatures, the sludge apparent viscosity decreased only gradually with time. At any point in time during the 1 -hour period, the apparent viscosity decreased linearly with increasing temperature...|$|R
