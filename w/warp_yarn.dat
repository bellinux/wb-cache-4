40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for fabricating straight or curved planar or three-dimensional (C channel, for example) fabric for fabrication into composite structures is presented. In the first embodiment, the fill yarns are inserted between layers of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> and a canted or curved reed, {{depending on the}} desired orientation of the fill yarns, is used to compact or 'beat-up' the fill yarns. In the second embodiment, the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> of the fabric are curved using a conical {{or a combination of}} conical and cylindrical rollers to effect differential fabric take-up of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> for obtaining a constant radius of curvature of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> In a third embodiment, a clamping bar fabric take-up device is used to effect the differential fabric take-up of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> for obtaining straight <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> curved <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> with a constant radius of curvature, curved <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> with a non-contant radius of curvature, or some combinations of straight and curved <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> In a fourth embodiment, for forming the flanges of the curved C channel, the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are alternately inserted through adjacent dent wires of the reed to permit vertical weaving of the flanges...|$|R

5000|$|Woolen is a soft, short-staple, {{carded wool}} yarn {{typically}} used for knitting. [...] In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently {{combined with a}} worsted <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> for strength on the loom.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel method for {{segmentation}} of weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> in multicolour yarn-dyed fabric images. A multicolour yarn-dyed fabric is cross-woven by weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> with different colours. When a multispectral imaging system {{is used to}} measure the colour of a multicolour yarn-dyed fabric image, its weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> need to be detected before analysing their colours. Detection of interstices between weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> is firstly conducted. A modified K-means clustering approach is then utilised to separate weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> The number of clusters is fixed to 2. The metric to measure the distance between a pixel and the mean of a cluster is the CIELAB colour difference. The initial means are determined by the expected values of fitted Gaussian distributions to CIExyY colour histograms. Experimental results show that the proposed method is promising for the segmentation of weft and <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> in multicolour yarn-dyed fabrics, with an improved segmentation accuracy and much faster processing speed than K-means clustering in CIEXYZ and CIELAB spaces.

50|$|In warp ikat it is {{only the}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> that are dyed using the ikat technique. The weft yarns are dyed a solid colour. The ikat pattern is clearly visible in the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> wound onto the loom even before the weft is woven in. Warp ikat is, amongst others, {{produced}} in Indonesia; more specifically in Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra by respectively the Dayaks, Torajans and Bataks.|$|R
50|$|Sizing of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> is {{essential}} to reduce breakage of the yarn and thus production stops on the weaving machine. On the weaving machine, the warp yarns are subjected to several types of actions i.e. cyclic strain, flexing, abrasion at various loom parts and inter yarn friction.|$|E
5000|$|Kad/Ekdhoti: A single {{shuttle is}} used for weaving of weft. The colours of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> is {{different}} from that of the weft yarn. It has a narali border and simple buttis like paisa, watana, etc. Kad is also a form of lungi and is used by male Maharashtrians.|$|E
50|$|To {{produce a}} leno weave the loom is {{threaded}} with the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> and a doup yarn together. The doup yarn {{can be of}} similar or lesser weight and strength. The weft is woven in and for each weft shuttle the warp yarns are twisted interchangeably to produce a figure of eight pattern.|$|E
30|$|The {{reason behind}} such {{phenomenon}} {{may be explained}} hypothetically such as that with increasing height of whip roller, tension of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> was increased as a result <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> become straighter and crimp(%) of grey and finished fabric decreased. But when depth of whip roller’s position was decreased at constant height as shown in Fig.  4 b, tension of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> also decreased at long shed area thus warp crimp (%) increased. In finished state, value of crimp (%) was higher than grey state, because in finishing process more tension was applied as fabric had to undergo through more processes thus relaxation was more in finished fabric. The alteration in case of weft density is another cause of such result in warp crimp%.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} fiber yarns that are woven {{together to form a}} hose jacket. The yarns that run lengthwise down the hose are called <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and are usually made from spun polyester or filament nylon. They form the inner and outer surfaces of the jacket and provide abrasion resistance for the hose. The yarns that are wound in a tight spiral around the circumference of the hose are called the filler yarns and are made from filament polyester. They are trapped between the crisscrossing <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> and provide strength to resist the internal water pressure. The spun polyester <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are specially prepared by a yarn manufacturer and are shipped to the hose plant. No further preparation is needed.|$|R
50|$|Desizing is {{the process}} of {{removing}} the size material from the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> after the textile fabric is woven.|$|R
5000|$|Fabrics {{created from}} satin weaves are more flexible, with better draping {{characteristics}} than plain weaves, {{allowing them to}} be formed around compound curves, which is useful in carbon-fiber composites manufacturing.

5000|$|Damask ( [...] ; دمشق) is a {{reversible}} {{figured fabric}} of silk, wool, linen, cotton, or synthetic fibres, with a pattern formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> and one weft yarn, usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave {{and the ground}} in weft-faced or sateen weave. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.|$|E
50|$|Bobbinet tulle is {{constructed}} by {{warp and weft}} yarns in which the weft yarn is looped diagonally around the vertical <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> to form a hexagonal mesh which is regular and clearly defined. Bobbinet netting has a characteristic diagonal fabric appearance, is diagonally stable and slideproof, durable, sheer, the lightest bobbinet weighing no more than 6 g per m2 and has a high strength to weight ratio.|$|E

5000|$|Shedding. Shedding is {{the raising}} of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> to form a loop through which the filling yarn, carried by the shuttle, can be inserted. The shed is the {{vertical}} space between the raised and unraised <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> On the modern loom, simple and intricate shedding operations are performed automatically by the heddle or heald frame, {{also known as a}} harness. This is a rectangular frame to which a series of wires, called heddles or healds, are attached. The yarns are passed through the eye holes of the heddles, which hang vertically from the harnesses. The weave pattern determines which harness controls which <b>warp</b> <b>yarns,</b> and the number of harnesses used depends on the complexity of the weave. Two common methods of controlling the heddles are dobbies and a Jacquard Head.|$|R
40|$|<b>Yarns</b> of <b>warp</b> beams to knit on warp {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> on the beam and hence different lengths of individual <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> on <b>warp</b> beams for {{warp knitting}} were examined. 16 % of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual <b>yarns</b> of a <b>warp</b> beam show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R
5000|$|Satin is a weave that {{typically}} has a glossy surface and a dull back. The satin weave {{is characterized by}} four or more fill or weft yarns floating over a <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> or vice versa, four warp yarns floating over a single weft yarn. Floats are missed interfacings, where the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> lies {{on top of the}} weft in a warp-faced satin and where the weft yarn lies on top of the warp yarns in weft-faced satins. These floats explain the even sheen, as unlike in other weaves, the light reflecting is not scattered as much by the fibres, which have fewer tucks. Satin is usually a warp-faced weaving technique in which warp yarns are [...] "floated" [...] over weft yarns, although there are also weft-faced satins. If a fabric is formed with a satin weave using filament fibres such as silk, nylon, or polyester, the corresponding fabric is termed a satin, although some definitions insist that the fabric be made from silk. If the yarns used are short-staple yarns such as cotton, the fabric formed is considered a sateen.|$|E
50|$|Leno weave (also called Gauze weave or Cross weave) is a weave {{in which}} two warp yarns are twisted around the weft yarns to provide a strong yet sheer fabric. The {{standard}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> is paired with a skeleton or 'doup' yarn; these twisted warp yarns grip tightly to the weft which causes the durability of the fabric. Leno weave produces an open fabric with almost no yarn slippage or misplacement of threads.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the warp}} is held under high tension {{during the entire}} process of weaving and <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> must be strong, yarn for warp ends is usually spun and plied fibre. Traditional fibres for warping are wool, linen, alpaca, and silk. With the {{improvements}} in spinning technology during the Industrial Revolution, it became possible to make cotton yarn of sufficient strength {{to be used as}} the warp in mechanized weaving. Later, artificial or man-made fibres such as nylon or rayon were employed.|$|E
50|$|The sheen and softer feel of sateen is {{produced}} through the satin weave structure. <b>Warp</b> <b>yarns</b> are floated over weft yarns, for example four over and one under. (In a weft-faced satin or sateen, the weft yarns are floated over the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.)</b> Standard plain weaves use a one-over, one-under structure. The long floats produce a surface that is smooth {{to the touch}} and reduces light scattering to increase shine. This weave structure is more susceptible to wear than other weaves.|$|R
40|$|A tapered tubular {{polyester}} sleeve as set forth. It {{has a large}} end 12 and a {{small end}} 14 with a length to be determined. The ratio of taper is also determined by scale factors. All the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> extend to the large end 12. A requisite number of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> 16 extend {{the full length of}} the sleeve. Other <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> exemplified at 18, 22, 26, 28, 30 and 32 extend from the large end but are terminated {{along the length of the}} sleeve. It is then woven with a filling yarn 40 which extends in a full circle along the full length of the sleeve to thereby define the tapered sleeve. The sleeve after fabrication is then placed on a mandrel 42, heated in an oven 44 and is thereafter placed on the arm or other limb of a space suit exemplified at 50...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the loom}} starts, the filler bobbins wind the filler yarn {{in a circle}} through the <b>warp</b> <b>yarns.</b> As soon as the bobbins pass, the loom crisscrosses each pair of {{adjacent}} <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> to trap the filler yarn between them. This weaving process continues at a high speed as {{the lower end of}} the jacket is slowly drawn down through the loom, and the bobbins continue to wrap the filler yarns around the circumference of the jacket in a tight spiral. The woven jacket is wound flat on a take-up reel.|$|R
50|$|Weft {{patterns}} are popularly {{referred to as}} Sapma continuous weft patterns and Tigma discontinuous weft patterns in Bhutan.The continuous weft {{patterns are}} very similar to those featured in other textile throughout South and Southeast Asia. The weft yarn is inserted between intervals of the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> to create continuous weft patterns.The discontinuous weft patterns motifs resemble embroidery are indigenous to Bhutan. Colored pattern yarns are knotted individually to the weft yarns to create geometric motifs which are usually combination of multiple pattern motifs.|$|E
5000|$|Literally, [...] "trama" [...] is the Latin {{word for}} the [...] "weft" [...] or [...] "woof" [...] yarns in the weaving of cloth. This {{probably}} {{is related to the}} basidiocarp trama being [...] "filler" [...] tissue and that analogously the woof yarn in weaving is sometimes called [...] "fill". Furthermore, the trama tends to be soft tissue, and in weaving, the woof yarn is not tightly stretched; it therefore need not as a rule be as strong as the <b>warp</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Gauze is a thin, {{translucent}} fabric with a [...] open weave. In {{technical terms}} [...] "gauze" [...] is a weave structure {{in which the}} weft yarns are arranged in pairs and are crossed before and after each <b>warp</b> <b>yarn</b> keeping the weft firmly in place. [...] This weave structure is used to add stability to fabric, which is important when using fine yarns loosely spaced. However, this weave structure {{can be used with}} any weight of yarn, and can be seen in some rustic textiles made from coarse hand-spun plant fiber yarns.|$|E
