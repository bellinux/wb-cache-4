In the Double Jeopardy! round and in the Daily Double in the Jeopardy! round, the phrasing rule is followed more strictly, with a response not phrased in the form of a question counting as wrong if it is not re-phrased before the host or judges make a ruling. If it is determined that a previous response was wrongly ruled to be correct or incorrect, the scores are adjusted at the first available opportunity. If, after a game is over, a ruling change is made that would have significantly altered the outcome of the game, the affected contestant(s) are invited back to compete on a future show.|$|E

The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters!

In 2000, a statue of Ramsey was erected {{on the corner of the}} street named after him and Portman Road, at the North Stand/Cobbold Stand corner of the stadium. The statue was commissioned by the Ipswich Town Supporters' Club after an initial idea by local fan Seán Salter. On 31 March 2012, the South Stand at Portman Road was renamed to the Sir Alf Ramsey Stand. [...] In 2009, Fabio Capello inaugurated a statue, sculpted by Philip Jackson, of Ramsey at Wembley.

500|$|The {{technical}} aspects of the game were also praised. Although {{by the time of}} its release in late 1999, Planescape: Torment's default 640x480 resolution was not considered particularly advanced, reviewers were pleased with the art design and color of the environments. The game's sound and music were described as [...] "well above the norm" [...] and [...] "superb", and one reviewer stated that his only complaint about the music was that [...] "there wasn't enough of it". Another reviewer stated that Planescape: Torment had [...] "just about the best sound" [...] they had heard in a video game. GamePro stated, [...] "... the characters talk with the talent of real professional voice actors during crucial bits of dialog". The game's graphics were moderately well received, with incite PC Gaming saying that [...] " [...] can be a little lackluster, although some of the spell effects certainly look very good", a statement echoed in NextGen which stated that [...] "mind-blowing spell effects ... <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> you of a two-dimensional Final Fantasy game." ...|$|E

My love wasn't enough'.". Danielle Baudhuin from The Oshkosh West Index noted that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] was musically similar to [...] "Haunted" [...] from the band's debut studio album Fallen, noting how [...] "creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral-like setting". Jim Farber from the Daily News said that [...] "Lacrymosa" [...] <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> older listeners of the 1970s art rock horror band Renaissance. Andree Farias from Christianity Today observed that the song had no connection with the movie Narnia whatsoever classifying it as [...] "just another bitter break-up anthem".|$|E

500|$|After the {{original}} version of [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was released, Carey's official website premiered two other versions of the song, the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix" [...] and the [...] "Pulse Club Remix". While the song's initial release was tepidly received by critics, reviewers were more favorable towards the remixes. The remixes only feature Carey and eliminate the extensive rap verses with which many critics took issue. According to Carey's manager, Randy Jackson, three versions of the song were released in order to monopolize all radio formats and cater to multiple audiences. In an interview with Billboard, Jackson expressed how they would remind Carey's fans of her earlier remixes, which she would always re-do her vocals: [...] "The vintage throwback mix <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> fans of remixes she did years ago, and she's {{had a lot of}} Billboard No. 1 dance hits as well. She went in and re-sang the vocals, knowing that the two verses on this first version of this single with Meek and Ross were going to be hip-hop verses where people were rapping. We wanted to have something for all of her fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} feature by which players could [...] "rewind" [...] time and {{reattempt}} difficult sections of ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System games, which were {{known for their}} difficulty, especially in the notoriously challenging Battletoads. Kotaku figured that Rare added cheats to make the esoteric and [...] "crushingly tough" [...] Spectrum games tolerable, and the Ars Technica review wished that this [...] "rewind" [...] feature had been extended to the Nintendo 64 titles. Critics liked the Snapshot challenges and Polygon {{reported that they were}} crucial for learning basic game mechanics, though less accessible than those of NES Remix. Reviewers complained that the Spectrum game controls were difficult to decipher. The Ars Technica reviewer thought that the compilation did a poor job of explaining each game's controls, and wondered why Rare did not include introductory or how-to videos. Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game. Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> players how difficult games used to be.|$|E

[...] Matthew Horton of BBC joked about {{the climax of the}} song, stating that the album 4 [...] "was named after the four key changes in the final, teetering chorus of 'Love on Top' to ram the point home." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune commended the song for putting a [...] "bounce" [...] in Beyoncé's step. Similarly, Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone named [...] "Love On Top" [...] "a blast" [...] as Beyoncé creates a modern take on old-school Whitney Houston. Hamish MacBain of NME favored the song's up-tempo style, stating that it was much needed after the [...] "ballad-heavy" [...] first half of the album. Priya Elan of the same publication commented that it has [...] "100 watt smile lyrics". Stating that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is reminiscent of 1980s RB&, Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine complimented the song as a [...] "Halcyon love song, perfect to be whisked away to".

As such prayer times everyone knows of the third, sixth and ninth hours, {{the morning and the}} evening hours." [...] It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise Idea as to the composition of the hour of Terce. Most of John Cassian's Institutes III.3 is an exegetical justification for the offices of Terce, Sext, and None, in which he relates each hour to a scriptural passage in which an important event occurs at that hour. In this way, by directing the monks to scripture, the hours acquired an educational benefit. This was also the view held in Ireland, where the psalms selected for Terce focused on the glorification of the risen Christ.|$|E

2500|$|Rolland's {{approach}} is more aggressive, though, than Pottecher's poetic vision of theatre {{as a substitute}} 'social religion' bringing unity to the nation. Rolland indicts the bourgeoisie for its appropriation of the theatre, causing it to slide into decadence, and the deleterious effects of its ideological dominance. In proposing a suitable repertoire for his people's theatre, Rolland rejects classical drama {{in the belief that}} it is either too difficult or too static to be of interest to the masses. Drawing on the ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, he proposes instead [...] "an epic historical theatre of 'joy, force and intelligence' which <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> the people of its revolutionary heritage and revitalize the forces working for a new society" [...] (in the words of Bradby and McCormick, quoting Rolland). Rolland believed that the people would be improved by seeing heroic images of their past. Rousseau's influence may be detected in Rolland's conception of theatre-as-festivity, an emphasis that reveals a fundamental anti-theatrical prejudice: [...] "Theatre supposes lives that are poor and agitated, a people searching in dreams for a refuge from thought. If we were happier and freer we should not feel hungry for theatre. [...] A people that is happy and free has need of festivities more than of theatres; it will always see in itself the finest spectacle".|$|E
2500|$|Amanda Dobbins of New York {{magazine}} {{concluded that}} [...] "the secretly devastating video" [...] for [...] "Someone like You" [...] <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> Adele's ex-lover {{what he has}} done by leaving her. A writer of The Huffington Post praised the simplicity and the sadness in the video. Sarah Dean of the same publication called it an [...] "uncomplicated, moving film" [...] and wrote, [...] "the video is nothing more than Adele wandering around the deserted city of love alone, under its grey skies, singing her sorrowful notes, but because it's her, we don't need any more." [...] That was somehow echoed by Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine who said that the video was [...] "simply constructed as the song's vocal-and-piano arrangement." [...] Marc Hogan of Spin said that the scene in which Adele looks in the camera, [...] "speak for itself" [...] about the sadness in the video. Andrew Matson of The Seattle Times said, [...] "the song of the year now has a simple, perfect video: Adele in Paris, singing and strolling, apparently processing the breakup detailed in the song's lyrics. The look on her face during the 'I wish nothing but the best for you' line is the best, just gutting, a real achievement how she plays it cold but not sarcastic. I think in times of emotional devastation, everyone wants stand on a bridge over the Seine on a cold day, squinting into the wind, sorting it out." ...|$|E

David Sexton of The Evening Standard compared The Hunger Games unfavourably to Kinji Fukasaku's Japanese film Battle Royale, as did several other critics; the novel had earlier faced criticism for its similarities to the novel Battle Royale by Koushun Takami. Jonathan Looms of The Oxford Student argues that it is [...] "unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with Battle Royale" [...] but that it [...] "is a veritable pastiche of other movies" [...] as well, comparing it to The Truman Show, Death Race, the Bourne films, and Zoolander, and that it is common for artists to borrow from and [...] "improve on many sources. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle." [...] It reminded an author at Salon of the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game. The Hunger Games has also been conceptually compared to Robert Sheckley's 1953 short story [...] "Seventh Victim" [...] and its 1965 film adaptation by Elio Petri, The 10th Victim, as the story and film feature a government-endorsed, televised (in the film's case) [...] "Big Hunt", featuring contestants from around the world acting as [...] "hunters" [...] and [...] "victims".|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Hilary Goldstein {{called the}} Xbox Live Arcade release [...] "a mad dash of fun", adding [...] "there's almost no depth to Crazy Taxi, but that's just fine." [...] Goldstein praised {{the fact that}} the port stayed true to the {{original}} source.

[...] Rudden echoed Goldstein's comments in regards to poor visuals, stating it had [...] "ugly character models and boxy traffic cars." [...] Robert Workman from GameZone praised the game for sticking to its Sega roots; he stated [...] "Crazy Taxi isn’t just a nostalgic trip, but also a wondrous stress reliever and an all-around entertaining game."

2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been mixed, based on a score of 59 out of 100 from review aggregator site Metacritic. The Observers review of Echo gave the album three out of five stars, with reviewer Peter Robinson writing, [...] "Unusually for an X Factor graduate, there was actually something at risk if the second album didn't work, but Echo hits its target. A handful of upbeat numbers – including an unexpected foray into frothy high-speed electro – pull Leona {{back from the brink}} of boring." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News agreed, writing [...] "Echo has a sense of fun, and a youthful vim, rarely on display on Spirit. It's faster, harder and way catchier." [...] Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said Lewis's [...] "mezzo-soprano range allows her to take melodies from luxurious low notes to high-flying falsetto, gliding with elegant power and impressive control through all kinds of fluctuations and modulations. [...] The approach of the album's producers is to throw Leona at a song, with multi-tracked vocals shooting off in every direction, until you feel like you're listening to a room full of cloned divas fighting over who gets the top line. It's an exhausting yet strangely exhilarating experience." [...] Heats Karen Edwards awarded the album five stars out of five, saying [...] "From girlie pop to big ballads, this album <b>will</b> <b>remind</b> you what the fuss is all about.
