50|$|A stone <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> {{encloses}} area {{adjacent to}} the structure. Similarly to other castles and fortified houses, the wall probably formed a defensive perimeter and livestock enclosure. The remains of the wall itself are hidden by vegetation.

50|$|A nearby archaeological dig, {{uncovered}} {{a portion of}} the <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> as expected from historical surveys and maps. The mission orchard wall was built with large stones, some 40 to 50 pounds. The dig, performed before new apartments were built, found artifacts from many periods including Ventura County's first courthouse and jail, and its first hospital. The dig also revealed signs of the long history of human settlement in the area around the mission such as beads made of shells harvested from the nearby ocean.|$|E

5000|$|Hadrian's Wall {{was begun}} in AD 122. A fort {{was built in}} stone at the Housesteads Roman Fort site around AD 124 {{overlying}} the original Broad <b>Wall</b> <b>foundation</b> and Turret 36B. The fort was repaired and rebuilt several times, its northern defences being particularly prone to collapse. A substantial civil settlement (vicus) existed to the south, outside the fort, {{and some of the}} stone foundations can still be seen, including [...] "Murder House", where two skeletons were found beneath an apparently newly laid floor when excavated.|$|E
50|$|The region around Fribourg {{has been}} settled since the Neolithic period, {{although}} few remains have been found. These include some flint tools found near Bourguillon, {{as well as}} a stone hatchet and bronze tools. A river crossing was located in the area during the Roman Era. The main activity in the Swiss plateau bypassed the area to the north, however, and was instead centered around the valley of the river Broye and Aventicum. Therefore, only a few remains from the Roman era have been found in Fribourg. These include the traces of a <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> on the plains near Pérolles.|$|E
5000|$|Nagoya Castle {{is known}} for its unique [...] "connected-donjon" [...] style of construction, with the main donjon of five stories on five {{different}} levels and a smaller donjon of two levels joined by an abutment bridge. Evidence that another small donjon was planned for {{the west side of the}} main donjon can be found in traces of an entryway in the upper part of the stone <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> on that side. The entryway to the small donjon was also planned for the west side. However, during the construction, the location was changed to where it is today. Traces of the original entryway remain inside the stone wall.|$|E

5000|$|... 1378 (km) is a first-person shooter {{multiplayer}} {{video game}} developed by Jens M. Stober, {{a student at}} the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design. In his game, Stober had reused some code and gameplay principles of [...] "Frontiers", a game by the artist group gold extra, on which he had also worked as a map designer. [...] The title refers to the length in kilometres of the Inner German border between East and West Germany from 1949 to 1990, then known as the [...] "death strip". It allows players, up to 16 people at the same time, to take the role of either East Germans trying to cross the border or East German border guards shooting anyone attempting to do so. The game was scheduled to be officially released on October 3 (the anniversary of German reunification) 2010, but was delayed due to its controversy. The game was released in December 2010 following [...] "a public discussion with distinguished guests" [...] at the Karlsruhe University, and will have an age rating of 18+. The director of the Berlin <b>Wall</b> <b>Foundation,</b> Axel Klausmeier, denounced the game as [...] "tasteless" [...] as well as [...] "a slap in the face of victims' families", and claimed that {{there was nothing to be}} learned from the game. On the other hand, Adam Rafinski, a lecturer at the Karlsruhe University who supported the game concept, claimed that it is a serious game not to play just as a pastime and players can take a history lesson from it.|$|E
40|$|Steel fabric {{reinforced}} concrete <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> is considered as an innovative construction method in Malaysia to reduce weight on foundation. This type of <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> may require sequ encial analysis in making an effective product that gives advantanges {{in all aspects}} and gives better performance. This research involved laboratory experimental work on three {{reinforced concrete}} <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> samples. The wall is reinforced with steel fabric of size B 7 and concrete Grade 30 mix with steel fabric. The <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> samples were tested under lateral static load with the load applied upper of the wall he ight wall. The support condition was considered as fixed {{at the lower end}} foundation. The ultimate load sustained by the samples is 30 kN with maximum displacement of 35 mm before failure. From the observation, there are failure cracks along the connection and {{at the side of the}} connection that influence the strength of the connection itself. <b>Wall</b> <b>foundation</b> 1 started to crack when load reach the value of 5 kN with maximum deflection of 15. 44 mm while for sample 2, <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> started to crack when applied load reach the value of 5. 97 kN with maximum deflection of 10. 37 mm. Lastly, for sample 3, <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> started to crack when applied load reach the value of 8. 58 kN with maximum deflection of 20. 13 mm. From research the maximum bending stress for sample 1, 2 and 3 is 3. 75 kN/mm 2, 7. 36 kN/mm 2 and 9. 72 kN/mm 2 respectively. Modulus of elasticity for sample 1, 2 and 3 are 8. 78862 xlO- 3 N/mm 2, 9. 9571 xlO- 3 N/mm 2 and 0. 1180 xlO- 3 N/mm 2 respectively. Therefore, maximum modulus of elasticity usually occurs at connection of <b>wall</b> <b>foundation.</b> Besides that, lateral static load has affect on the compressive strength, fracture energy and ductility thus inhabit the crack propagation of the reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>foundation...</b>|$|E
40|$|During the 2007 field season a stone <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> of a {{domestic}} structure was excavated {{at the site of}} Pirque Alto (CP- 11) in the Parotani region of the Department of Cochabamba, Bolivia. Based on its orientation, shape and structure this <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> shows relation to Tiwanaku domestic architecture from the southern Titicaca Basin. This relationship sheds light on the influence of Tiwanaku on peripheral regions like Parotani. Pirque Alto?s (CP- 11) location along three major trade routes makes it an ideal location in which to study cultural influence between different regions of this area. Based on a comparative study of the <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> at Pirque Alto (CP- 11) against those from the Late Formative, Middle Horizon, and Late Intermediate Period in the Titicaca Basin and Moquegua Valley, I argue that the <b>wall</b> <b>foundation</b> at Pirque Alto (CP- 11) shows Tiwanaku influence...|$|E
