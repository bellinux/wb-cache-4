40|$|We {{present a}} novel phase-shifting vectorial-shearing {{interferometer}} with a <b>wedge</b> <b>plate</b> phase-shifter. The interferometer {{is based on}} a modified Mach-Zehnder configuration; the common-path nature makes it capable of testing the wavefront of a short coherence-length light source, such as a laser diode. Vectorial shear (shearing in the x and y directions simultaneously) in an arbitrary direction is introduced by inserting two wedge plates orthogonally in two arms, respectively. One of the wedge plates is split into two parts (parallel part and wedge part); phase shift is produced by moving the wedge part in contact along the parallel part. The moving distance for a 2 pi phase shift is a few millimetres in specific conditions. The <b>wedge</b> <b>plate</b> phase-shifter increases the moving distance for phase shift and makes the control of phase shift relatively easy. We also discuss the lateral shear error and phase shift errors induced by wedge plates. The lateral shear error is small enough to be ignored; the phase shift error is determined mainly by the wedge angle error. Lastly, we give the experimental results of phase-shifting interference fringes in vectorial shear mode...|$|E

Methods: From March 2007 to August 2007, 33 patients (37 cases) with osteoarthritis of the knee and a genu varum deformity underwent a high tibial osteotomy with using an Aescula open <b>wedge</b> <b>plate</b> and an allogenic bone graft. The patients were followed up for more than 1 year. Before and after surgery, the correction angle of the genu varum was measured by the lower extremity scannogram and the posterior tibial slope, the joint space distance and the time to bone union were evaluated. The functional factors were evaluated using the Knee Society Score. Results: The average knee score and function score improved from 52. 19 ± 11. 82 to 92. 49 ± 5. 10 and 52. 84 ± 6. 23 to 89. 05 ± 5. 53, respectively (p < 0. 001). According to the lower extremity scannogram, the mean preoperative varus angle was- 1. 86 ± 2. 76 °, and the average correction angle at the last follow-up was 10. 93 ± 2. 50 ° (p < 0. 001). The tibial posterior slope before surgery and at the last follow-up were 8. 20 ± 1. 80 ° and 8. 04 ± 1. 30 °, respectively (p = 0. 437). The joint space distance increased from 4. 05 ± 1. 30 mm to 4. 83 ± 1. 33 mm (p < 0. 001). The average time to complete bone union was 12. 69 ± 1. 5 weeks.

40|$|International audienceMeasuring guided {{waves in}} {{cortical}} bone arouses a growing interest to assess skeletal status. In most studies, {{a model of}} waveguide is proposed {{to assist in the}} interpretation of the dispersion curves. In all the reported investigations, the bone is mimicked as a waveguide with a constant thickness, which only approximates the irregular geometry of cortical bone. In this study, guided mode propagation in cortical bone-mimicking <b>wedged</b> <b>plates</b> is investigated with the aim to document the influence on measured dispersion curves of a waveguide of varying thickness and to propose a method to overcome the measurement limitations induced by such thickness variations. The singular value decomposition-based signal processing method, previously introduced for the detection of guided modes in plates of constant thickness, is adapted to the case of waveguides of slowly linearly variable thickness. The modification consists in the compensation at each frequency of the wavenumber variations induced by the local variation in thickness. The modified method, tested on bone-mimicking <b>wedged</b> <b>plates,</b> allows an enhanced and more accurate detection of the wavenumbers.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of decoupling between weak orogenic wedges and strong adjacent foreland plates are investigated {{by means of}} lithospheric-scale analogue modeling. Decoupling is implemented in the three-layer models by lubrication of the inclined boundary between a strong foreland and a weak orogenic <b>wedge.</b> <b>Plate</b> boundaries are orthogonal to the convergence direction. Experimental results show that strong decoupling between the foreland and the orogenic wedge leads to underthrusting of the former underneath the orogenic wedge and deformation of the orogenic wedge by folding, shearing, and minor backthrusting. Shortening is mainly taken up along the main overthrust, the decoupled boundary, and within the orogenic wedge, leaving the indenter devoid of deformation. In contrast, strong coupling between the foreland and the orogenic wedge favors buckling, involving both the weak zone and the strong plates. The results of these end-member models have implications for collision zones, for example, the Eastern Alps in Europe, such that the switch from localized deformation within the orogenic wedge during the Oligocene-middle Miocene to orogen-scale uplift and deformation during the late Miocene-Pliocene involving the foreland and indenter plates, respectively, is interpreted as reflecting a change from a decoupled to a coupled system. © 2009 The Geological Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{corrosion}} {{distress and}} failures in post-tensioned tendons {{has been found}} in two major bridges in the State of Florida. Corrosion distress and complete tendon failure has been identified in horizontally oriented tendons that support pre-cast bridge superstructure box segments. In virtually all instances, the observed corrosion has been associated with the presence of grout voids and visual evidence of grout bleed water having been present for indeterminate periods of time. With few exceptions, corrosion induced strand failures have occurred in the immediate vicinity of the anchorage. The anchorage systems in both bridges utilize a proprietary multi-plane anchorage (housing) comprised of ductile cast iron and forged steel <b>wedge</b> <b>plate.</b> The presence of these metals coupled with high strength strands gives rise to concerns relative to galvanic corrosion thus prompting this preliminary investigation focusing on dissimilar metals corrosion. The investigation involves laboratory tests that examine the corrosion aspects of grout bleed water and re-charge water in contact with dissimilar metals comprising the tendon and anchorage system. The preliminary results indicate that the high strength post-tensioned strands are mostly anodic to the anchorage system when exposed to either grout bleed water or recharge water such as that which may be experienced through leakage.

40|$|Purpose: Proximal tibial {{osteotomy}} (PTO) is {{a widely}} used surgical procedure for the treatment in medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee with mal-alignment, particularly in young and active patients.

The main {{aim of this study}} is to make stress analysis and compare the stability of a commonly used anatomic “T” plate and 3 different <b>wedge</b> supported <b>plates</b> and their combinations which are designed by one of the author of this article. Design/methodology/approach: In this biomechanical study, calf tibial models were used in order to compare the stability of the plates under axial compression loading. 2 and 4 holes rectangular shape <b>wedge</b> supported <b>plates,</b> 4 holes reversed “L” shape <b>wedge</b> supported <b>plates</b> or combination of these and 6 holes anatomic “T” plates were used for the models. The compression behaviour of the model was tested by using a universal mechanical testing machine. And, a numerical method, ANSYS finite element code, was used for the stress analysis of the plates.

40|$|Some {{years ago}} we {{developed}} an automatized reflectometric method to measure the surface azimuthal anchoring energy of nematic liquid crystals on an optically isotropic substrate. This method provides a high accuracy and sensitivity but {{requires the use of}} <b>wedge</b> glass <b>plates</b> and a sufficiently high anisotropy of the intensity reflectivity coefficients. This latter condition restricts greatly the number of possible substrates that can be investigated with this technique. Here we develop a new reflectometric method which offers comparable or better accuracy and sensitivity but does not require <b>wedge</b> <b>plates</b> and high anisotropy of the reflectivity coefficients. The method is fully automated and provides a direct measurement of the azimuthal director angle. The experimental procedure exploits the dependence of the reflectivity tensor on the surface director orientation. The measurement of the azimuthal angle does not require any knowledge of the optical parameters of the nematic material and of the optically isotropic substrate, and provides an absolute accuracy better than 0. 2 degrees in the whole range 0 - 360 degrees and a sensitivity better than 0. 1 degrees. This reflectometric method can be also used with weakly anisotropic substrates as well as thin rubbed polymeric layers. In this latter case, the effective uncertainty in the measurement of the director azimuthal angle depends on the substrate anisotropy. A simple and direct experimental procedure to estimate this uncertainty is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Achieving a {{fundamental}} {{understanding of the}} mechanism for fuel/air mixing in compressible mixing flows {{is vital to the}} combustion efficiency of supersonic ramjets (Scramjets). In order to study this fuel/air mixing process an experimental investigation of the behavior of the growth rate of compressible mixing layers has been performed in a Mach 2. 0 supersonic ramjet model combustion chamber using planar laser Rayleigh and Mie scattering visualizations. Hydrogen was injected parallel to the free air stream of a rectangular test section through the base of a plate injector centered in the test chamber. The investigations have been performed for hree different flow conditions at convective Mach numbers of 0. 8, 0. 9 and 1. 0 and have been compared to existing dta from literature. The experiments generally show that the mixing layer growth rate is a decreasing function with increasing level of compressibility, leading to much less mixing and entrainment of the compressible mixing layer in comparison to the incompressible case. In order to test new methods for mixing enhancement we have conducted shock-mixing layer interaction studies in dependence of the compressibility level, expressed by the convective Mach number Mc. A variable <b>wedge</b> <b>plate</b> (wedge angle of 7 ° and 15 °) was located at the top wall of the combustion chamber initiating shock waves which were reflected into the mixing layer.

40|$|A {{nondestructive}} {{technique for}} measuring the birefringence of optical materials such as calcite using <b>wedged</b> <b>plate</b> interferometer is presented. The sample needed {{for measuring the}} refractive index must be polished {{in the form of}} a parallel plate. The method is based on the measurement of the longitudinal displacement of the focus when the parallel plate is inserted in a converging beam of light. The displacement of the focus is a measure of the refractive index of the optical material. In the case of a uniaxial crystal, the displacement of the focus for the extraordinary ray is different from the displacement of the focus for the ordinary ray. Hence the birefringence of the crystal is determined by measuring the difference between the two focii. It is possible to obtain an accuracy up to 0. 0002 in the measurement of birefringence depending on the sample thickness.

The half-aperture configuration has the features of high sensitivity, stabilization and easy alignment. For the whole-field configuration, the interference fringes are displayed in two whole fields. Consequently, the divergent or convergent characteristic and aberration types of a wavefront can be identified visually. The whole-field configuration can be changed to the double-interferometer configuration for continuous test. Both small and large wavefront aberrations can be measured by the double-interferometer configuration. The minimum detectable wavefront aberration (W- 0) (min) comes to 0. 03 lambda.

The quartz <b>wedge</b> or selenite <b>plate</b> enables us to do this. Suppose a doubly refracting mineral section so placed that it is [...] "extinguished"; if now is rotated through 45 degrees it will be brightly illuminated. If the quartz wedge be passed across it so that the long axis of the wedge is parallel to the axis of elasticity in the section the polarization colors will rise or fall. If they rise the axes of greater elasticity in the two minerals are parallel; if they sink the axis of greater elasticity in the one is parallel to that of lesser elasticity in the other. In the latter case by pushing the wedge sufficiently far complete darkness or compensation will result. Selenite <b>wedges,</b> selenite <b>plates,</b> mica <b>wedges</b> and mica <b>plates</b> are also used for this purpose. A quartz wedge also may be calibrated by determining the amount of double refraction in all parts of its length.
