In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as {{a supporter of the}} party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst verbose, was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E

However, {{according to the}} Institute For Local Reliance (ILRS), “Walmart’s sustainability campaign {{has done more to}} improve the company’s image than the environment.” Walmart still only generates 2 percent of U.S. electricity from wind and solar resources. According to the ILRS, Walmart routinely donates money to political candidates <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> environment. The retail giant responded to these accusations by stating [...] "that it is serious about its commitment to reduce 20 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2015".|$|R
40|$|We {{examine whether}} parties punish {{politicians}} <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> party line in roll-call votes. Using data of German {{members of parliament}} over the legislative period 2009 - 2013, we {{take into account that}} the effect of punishment differs along the list of candidates because a candidate is punished more when he loses positions at the threshold of promising list positions. The dataset includes the voting behavior of 257 MPs in 218 roll-call votes. Our results do not show that parties account for the voting behavior by punishing politicians <b>who</b> have <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> party line. Political parties may attract different groups of voters by tolerating politicians <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> according to their own credo. Qualities other than the voting behavior seem to matter to political parties when nominating candidates...|$|R

25|$|Pennington was a {{candidate}} for Indiana's Lieutenant Governor in 1825, but he was defeated. During the campaign and {{as one of the}} most outspoken members of the Indiana General Assembly, Pennington opposed the state's massive plan for internal improvements, especially the construction of the Wabash and Erie Canal. He was among the nine legislators, which included James Whitcomb, <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Mammoth Internal Improvement Act of 1836. He opposed the majority view, claiming their plans would have no direct benefits for his constituents and would only bankrupt the state. Pennington also argued that the arrival of railroads would quickly make plans for a statewide canal system obsolete. His predictions proved to be nearly correct.|$|E

50|$|A {{collective}} action clause (CAC) allows a supermajority of bondholders {{to agree to}} a debt restructuring that is legally binding on all holders of the bond, including those <b>who</b> <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> restructuring. Bondholders generally opposed such clauses in the 1980s and 1990s, fearing that it gave debtors too much power. However, following Argentina's December 2001 default on its debts in which its bonds lost 70% of their value, CACs have become much more common, as they are now seen as potentially warding off more drastic action, but enabling easier coordination of bondholders.|$|R

The governing party strictly enforces party discipline, usually expelling from the party caucus any government Member of Parliament (MP) <b>who</b> <b>votes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> budget. Opposition parties almost always <b>vote</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> budget.

One Republican congressman <b>who</b> <b>voted</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by the exclusion of the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer. Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, prior to Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002. As of the 2002, 2004, and 2006 election cycles, Del Monte has not contributed to Democratic candidates.|$|E
