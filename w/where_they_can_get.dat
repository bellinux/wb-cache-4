Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning.

40|$|The use {{of social}} media for {{learning}} in schools {{is becoming more}} and more widespread and reflected in European context. But existing studies and learning material repositories predominantly consider social media as a new technology They are regarded as a technology enabling users to easily get in contact with other people. This paper puts social media in another context – they are regarded as a “social” innovation rather than a technological one. We see the innovative core of social media in the generation of content by users. This “user generated content” paradigm has started and will continue to change the way people communicate, work and learn. The paper narrates the experience gained in the ongoing EU funded Comenius project “Learn to Teach by social web” (L 2 T) which is exploiting the educational potential given by social media in in the educational field. In doing so, we concretize the discourse around social media for the classroom by investigating the potential of social media in new teaching methods and in learning outcomes. The project involves teachers and students form six European countries. It is the aim of the project to develop a curriculum that teachers who never used social media in classroom teaching before can now prepare themselves for using social media in their classroom teaching. The curriculum is working with examples and best practice in order to illustrate hands-on social media use. Language teaching is a very important example, as social media require – and produce – a very specific use of language. This is reflected in the curriculum. This curriculum is developed by teachers (half of them language teachers= form siy countries in a user generated content process, facilitated by the University of Dortmund, Germany. The first results highlight how social media foster student driven learning and empower teachers to use social media supported learning in classroom teaching. The proposal constitutes a repository of practical experience and a place of confrontation between teachers from different educational and technological backgrounds. Language learning is facilitated in a shared project of students from all participating schools. The approach of the project is to help and motivate teachers in their educational activities by stimulating their interest in new pedagogic approaches, especially “learning by teaching”. The L 2 T project is developing and strengthening communication between teachers and students and putting into practice the ideas behind the constructivist approach of teaching with social media (action learning, active learning, learner-to-learner interaction, learning by teaching, exploring learning). The teachers themselves see the project as a source of “inspiration”, a tool “made by teachers for teachers”, a space capable of strengthening “the international community of practice of teachers”, and a platform <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> experiment, <b>get</b> involved and share ideas...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how a local chamber of commerce initiates experiences and events as a strategy for attracting customers to their high street - and keeping them there. It comprises a single case study of Birkerød Chamber of Commerce’s work with ‘experience economy’, where we specifically investigate what effect events staged on Birkerød Hovedgade have had on citizens, and how such knowledge could be exploited in the future in the Chamber’s strategy to develop the high street as an attractive shopping area. Method-wise, the investigation is structured around Preben Sepstrup’s ‘Campaign platform’ that we likewise employ to identify Birkerød chamber of commerce’s current strategy for working with experience economy. As part of the situation analysis we incorporate Michael Porter’s ‘Five Forces of Competition’ and for {{the identification of the}} target group we conduct a target group analysis. In the process of illuminating the values of Birkerød Hovedgade and its frequenters we examine the local community context. Through a comprehensive empirical apparatus, consisting of observations, questionnaires, plus individual and focus-group interviews, we demonstrate that events staged on Birkerød Hovedgade contribute positively to community spirit and are of measurable significance to the citizenry. The social content of events is instrumental in bringing the High Street to life, and - for this reason among others - townsfolk would not wish to do without them. Events nourish the sense of town fellowship, create and maintain near and distant relationships between inhabitants, as well as contributing to an increased knowledge of the town and the High Streets shops. Events give townspeople a comfortable and cheerful feeling of closeness, in contrast to the experience they may have as consumers in the shops themselves, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sometimes <b>get</b> the impression that they are there {{for the sake of the}} shops rather than vice versa. The main theories used to analyse are Joseph Pine & James Gilmore’s ‘Experience dimensions’, Christian Jantzen & Mikael Vetner’s grounding of the individual’s personal approach to events in the ‘Psychological structure of experience’ and Jens Ørnbo, Claus Sneppen & Peter Würtzs’ ‘Observer, Actor and Volunteer’ concepts. We expose lack of involvement among members of the Chamber of Commerce. Despite support for event creation at individual branch level, it still remains for them to properly appreciate what it means to work with events and experiences in a strategic and commercially integrated manner. The High Street is a vital forum for the town’s people, their families, and their friends; here the relational ties are made and nurtured that strengthen local loyalties and community spirit. We demonstrate that townspeople have a strong commitment to their High Street. The greatest problem lies with the shops themselves, who don’t really go whole-heartedly in for the events in the eyes of their customers. We argue that the shops should cooperate more actively with the rest of their local society in High Street events, in order to derive full benefit from the strategy. The chamber of commerce should broaden its view of its role in local society, taking their cue from the stories and histories that could make the events more relevant for townsfolk, thus bringing more people to the street. We conclude that events and experiences may be beneficially employed in local chamber of commerce efforts to attract more customers, but that it is decisive that individual branch members feel ownership and responsibility for the process of creating relevant experiences...|$|R
