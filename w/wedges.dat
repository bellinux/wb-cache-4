5|$|ConAgra Foods {{entered into}} a {{licensing}} agreement with Burger King in 2009 for {{a new line of}} microwavable French fry products. The new products are King Krinkz, which are seasoned crinkle-cut fries; King Kolossalz, an extra-large package of fries; and King Wedgez, seasoned potato <b>wedges.</b> The products were slated to be released in September 2009. The packaging is designed to resemble BK's FryPod fry container.|$|E
5|$|In {{permafrost}} soils with {{an active}} upper layer subject to annual freeze and thaw, patterned ground can form, creating circles, nets, ice wedge polygons, steps, and stripes. Thermal contraction causes shrinkage cracks to form; in a thaw, water fills the cracks, expanding to form ice when next frozen, and widening the cracks into <b>wedges.</b> These cracks may join up to form polygons and other shapes.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} of men {{with the intention of}} capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron <b>wedges</b> under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E

50|$|Thomas <b>Wedge</b> (1760-1854) was an English agriculturalist. He {{was the son}} of Francis <b>Wedge</b> (1714-1784) of Fernhill House, near Forton, Staffordshire, {{a prosperous}} farmer, and brother of John <b>Wedge</b> and Charles <b>Wedge</b> of Shudy Camps.

5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and <b>wedges</b> in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
5|$|Herschel <b>wedges,</b> {{also called}} Solar Diagonals, are {{effective}} and inexpensive for small telescopes. The sunlight that is {{destined for the}} eyepiece is reflected from an unsilvered surface {{of a piece of}} glass. Only a very small fraction of the incident light is reflected. The rest passes through the glass and leaves the instrument. If the glass breaks because of the heat, no light at all is reflected, making the device fail-safe. Simple filters made of darkened glass allow the full intensity of sunlight to pass through if they break, endangering the observer's eyesight. Unfiltered binoculars can deliver hundreds of times as much energy as using the naked eye, possibly causing immediate damage. It is claimed that even brief glances at the midday Sun through an unfiltered telescope can cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|The German plan {{of attack}} was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured <b>wedges</b> through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E
50|$|Consider a {{block that}} is to be lifted by a <b>wedge.</b> As the <b>wedge</b> slides under the block, the block slides up the sloped side of a <b>wedge.</b> This lifts the weight FB of the block. The {{horizontal}} force FA needed to lift the block is obtained by considering the velocity of the <b>wedge</b> vA and the velocity of the block vB. If we assume the <b>wedge</b> does not dissipate or store energy, then the power into the <b>wedge</b> equals the power out, soorThe velocity of the block is related to the velocity of the <b>wedge</b> by the slope of the side of the <b>wedge.</b> If the angle of the <b>wedge</b> is α thenwhich means that the mechanical advantageThus, the smaller the angle α the greater the ratio of the lifting force to the applied force on the <b>wedge.</b> This is the mechanical advantage of the <b>wedge.</b> This formula for mechanical advantage applies to cutting edges and splitting operations as well as to lifting.|$|R
40|$|The slide <b>wedge</b> device has {{at least}} one pair if opposingly movable slide <b>wedge</b> {{components}} (14), which by means of tension devices (16) are tensioned radially inwards, locating on the base plate (20) and the <b>wedge</b> pressure plate (12). The tension on the slide <b>wedge</b> components can be invalidated with little delay, and is adjustable. The <b>wedge</b> pressure plate may have one or more <b>wedge</b> surfaces with a <b>wedge</b> angle corresponding to that of the slide <b>wedge</b> components. The <b>wedge</b> pressure plate can be axially slidably movably accommodated in a housing (18) with an axial end stop for it. ADVANTAGE - With technically simple means, a secure press power transmission is made possible and the arrangement also offers a rapidly and easily releasable overload protection...|$|R

5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM <b>wedges</b> spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the <b>wedges</b> and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool shakers completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato <b>wedges,</b> a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} three rounds, the wheel {{contains}} a Wild Card and a Gift Tag, while two ½ Car tags are present in rounds two and three only (except on episodes with two-player teams). The Wild Card {{may be used to}} call an additional consonant after any turn (for the amount that the contestant has just spun) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there. The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from, or $1,000 in cash courtesy of, the sponsoring company, and the ½ Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round(s) in which he or she claims both. Unlike the other tags, the ½ Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won. A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won. All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 <b>wedges,</b> so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag/wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle. The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which, if won and taken to the bonus round, offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000. A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash, prizes, or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card, which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it. Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds, but it does take away the Wild Card, individual ½ Car tags, and/or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round. Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ($2,000 on weeks with two-contestant teams) have their scores increased to that amount.|$|E

5|$|The core game {{is based}} on Hangman. Each round has a {{category}} and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer, and punctuation revealed as needed. Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories, and this list has evolved {{over the course of}} the series. Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016. In such rounds, a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category, and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword. The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette-style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in round 1, $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt <b>wedges</b> and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round. Each game features three contestants, or occasionally, three two-contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue, with the contestants' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping.|$|E
25|$|Wooden <b>wedges</b> may {{be forced}} between the stage and the bottom edge of the wagon perimeter. Ideally, the <b>wedges</b> are driven under the wagon {{to the extent that}} the wagon is {{supported}} by the <b>wedges</b> instead of its casters. <b>Wedges</b> are typically used in pairs, on opposite sides of the wagon so that the wagon can't slip off the <b>wedges.</b>|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} {{suggest that}} leg length increases after opening <b>wedge</b> high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and decreases after closing <b>wedge</b> HTO; however, in vivo studies have yielded conflicting results. This meta-analysis therefore assessed changes in leg length after opening <b>wedge</b> and closing <b>wedge</b> HTO. All studies comparing pre- and postoperative leg length {{in patients who}} underwent opening and/or closing <b>wedge</b> HTO were included. Two reviewers independently recorded data from each study in terms of sample size as well as preoperative and postoperative leg length of open <b>wedge</b> and/or closed <b>wedge</b> HTO groups. Four studies {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Although pooled results showed leg length changes from before to after surgery were - 6. 93 mm (95 % confidence interval [CI]: - 17. 53 to 3. 67 mm; P = 0. 20) in opening <b>wedge</b> HTO and 1. 97 mm (95 % CI: - 7. 13 to 11. 07 mm; P = 0. 67) in closing <b>wedge</b> HTO, respectively, these values were statistically not significant. However, the difference in the pooled mean leg length change from before to after surgery between opening <b>wedge</b> and closing <b>wedge</b> HTO was 8 mm, a difference that was significant (95 % CI: 6. 53 to 9. 46 mm; P< 0. 001).

25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 2nd {{millennium}} BC, the Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated sexagesimal positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals.

25|$|By the 1820s {{the first}} shaped rolled rails {{had begun to}} be {{produced}} initially of a T shape which required a chair to hold them; the rails were held in position by iron <b>wedges</b> (which sometimes caused the rail to break when forced in) and later by wooden <b>wedges,</b> which became the standard. In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted I beam), which had a flat bottom and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted U section with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|E
