This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely <b>with</b> <b>German</b> civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships <b>with</b> <b>German</b> women.|$|E
