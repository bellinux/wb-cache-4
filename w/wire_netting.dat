The Conservatory again was repainted in 1899 and received new floors of grooved concrete. At this point, the old floors, some of wood and some of concrete, were replaced by new grooved concrete. The grooves in the floor were intended to carry off the surplus water and make {{a visit to the}} conservatory more comfortable and pleasant. Several wooden plant benches that had rotted out were replaced by benches made of concrete <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> to stand the constant change of temperature better than wood.|$|E

The movement of the infantry across Sinai was eased by construction of <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> roads also used by Egyptian Labour Corps, light vehicles, cars, and ambulances. This reasonably stable surface, which did not sink, was constructed from two or four rolls of rabbit wire; one inch mesh wire rolled out side by side, wired together with the edges fixed into the sand with long steel or wooden pegs to produce a reasonable track.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the cage floor-type and stocking density on the rabbit meat quality. Weaned rabbits were placed to 12 pens, each having a basic area of 50 × 170 cm. The pens differed only in the type of floor. Six pens had a <b>wire</b> <b>net,</b> six pens a combined (half of the floor <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> and half of the floor straw litter) floor. On both floor types (<b>wire</b> <b>net</b> and combined) three stocking densities (8, 12 and 16 rabbits/m 2) were applied. The experiment took place between the ages of 5 and 11 weeks. At 11 weeks of age the animals were slaughtered and hind leg (HL) and loin meat were dissected and analysed for pHu, L*a*b* colour values, proximate composition and fatty acid profile. Compared to <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floor the combined floor significantly increased the b* colour value of Biceps femoris (BF) muscle and the a* colour value of Longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle, whereas the pHu and the fat content of LD muscle decreased.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and cage floor enrichment on some behavioral activities of growing rabbits {{and the effect}} of temperature on cage floor choice were investigated. Forty-eight rabbits from the Botucatu genetic group, weaned at 35 d of age, were housed at low density (1, 500 cm 2), four per cage, in <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> cages up to 10 weeks of age. Cages were placed either in a natural temperature chamber or in a refrigerated one. In each chamber, half of the cages had part of the floor surface covered with a wooden board enriched with litter straw such that, in enriched cages, rabbits had free choice between the straw and the <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floor. In all cages, rabbits had free access to water and feed {{on both sides of the}} cage.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test a new combination of deep litter and <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floor.

Rearing the rabbits in pens (P 16, P 12, PW, PD) decreased the body weight and weight gain, the ratio of the medium and hind part of the carcass (hind legs) and the fat depots compared to the caged rabbits. For dressing out percentage and for fore part of the carcass the effect of housing was significant only at the level of P< 0. 1. No significant differences were observed for feed consumption, feed conversion ratio and mortality. 11. 1, 58. 7 and 30. 2 % of the rabbits could be located at the platform of deep litter floor (1 / 3 basic area), at the area under the platform (1 / 3 basic area) and at areas near to the feeder or drinker (1 / 3 basic area). Using platforms of <b>wire</b> <b>net</b> floors most of the rabbits (43 %) were located on the platforms. 31. 5 and 25. 5 % of the rabbits stayed under the platform and at uncovered areas, respectively.

40|$|Farmed rabbit welfare mainly {{depends on}} the housing {{conditions}} created by people. When group size is above a maximum of four to five rabbits per cage, the disadvantages (higher risk of contamination and related disease andmortality, higher rates of aggressiveness and injured rabbits) outnumber the advantages (greater locomotion possibility and more social contact). According to several studies, the optimal stocking density is 16 – 18 rabbits/m 2 (final animal load 40 – 45 kg m− 2), depending on final weight. Deep litter is unfavourable due to the higher risk of contamination with coccidiae (higher mortality) and lower productivity and carcass quality traits. <b>Wire</b> <b>net</b> floors are less preferable below 15 °C.
