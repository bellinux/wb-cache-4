5|$|Using iron {{construction}} for <b>warships</b> offered {{advantages for}} the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising <b>warships.</b>|$|E
5|$|By early 1945, {{following}} the Solomon Islands campaign, the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the once formidable Imperial Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet {{was reduced to}} {{just a handful of}} operational <b>warships</b> and a few remaining aircraft and aircrew. Most of the remaining Japanese <b>warships</b> in the Combined Fleet were stationed at ports in Japan, with most of the large ships at Kure, Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|Even though Britain led {{the world}} in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel <b>warships.</b> The Bessemer process for steel {{manufacture}} produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the Siemens-Martin process to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel <b>warships</b> built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels Iris and Mercury, laid down in 1875 and 1876.|$|E

5|$|In March 1862, a {{contract}} was placed with Laird & Son Co. by Captain James D. Bulloch, a naval {{agent for the}} Confederate States of America, for two double-turreted <b>warships</b> designed for ramming attacks {{at a cost of}} £93,750 each, exclusive of armament and ammunition. They were intended, together with other <b>warships,</b> to break the Federal blockade of Confederate coastal cities and to hold some Northern cities for ransom.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries fleets had relied on {{two types of}} major warship, the ship {{of the line and}} the frigate. The first major change to these types was the {{introduction}} of steam power for propulsion. While paddle steamer <b>warships</b> had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major <b>warships</b> after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s.|$|E

5|$|Prevented by {{the treaty}} of Phoenice from {{expansion}} in the east, Philip set out to extend his power in the Aegean and in Asia Minor. In the spring of 201BC he took Samos and the Egyptian fleet stationed there. He then besieged Chios to the north. These events caused Attalus, allied with Rhodes, Byzantium and Cyzicus, to enter the war. A large naval battle occurred in the strait between Chios and the mainland, just southwest of Erythrae. According to Polybius, fifty-three decked <b>warships</b> and over {{one hundred and fifty}} smaller <b>warships,</b> took part on the Macedonian side, with sixty-five decked <b>warships</b> and a number of smaller <b>warships</b> on the allied side. During the battle Attalus, having become isolated from his fleet and pursued by Philip, was forced to run his three ships ashore, narrowly escaping by spreading various royal treasures on the decks of the grounded ships, causing his pursuers to abandon the pursuit in favor of plunder.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyao divides Chinese <b>warships</b> {{into six}} categories: Tower ships (lou chuan), combat or war junks (dou xian or zhan xian), covered swoopers (meng chong), flying barques (zou ge), patrol boats (you ting), and sea hawk ships (hai hu).

During this period of inactivity, Mesudiye received a minor modernization at the Tersâne-i Âmire shipyard on the Golden Horn. At {{the start of the}} Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, Mesudiye was found to be unfit for combat, as were most of the other major <b>warships</b> of the fleet. On 15 May Mesudiye and several other <b>warships</b> attempted to hold a training exercise, which only highlighted the poor state of training of the ships' crews.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 15 February, {{both the}} British and French forces raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships {{included}} some fully armed <b>warships</b> and he therefore ordered the brig Ganges {{and the four}} lead ships to hoist blue ensigns, {{while the rest of}} the convoy raised red ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were <b>warships</b> attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that at least some of the unidentified vessels must be <b>warships,</b> particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.|$|E

5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large <b>warships</b> {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these <b>warships</b> were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller <b>warships</b> were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about half her anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby {{in a position where}} she was able to protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish <b>warships</b> were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, {{rectangular}} bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as <b>warships</b> and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more rounded bottom and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks of World War II, <b>warships</b> of the United States Navy, the British Royal Navy, and the Royal New Zealand Navy bombarded {{industrial}} and military facilities in Japan. Most of these bombardments involved battleships and cruisers which caused heavy damage to several of the factories targeted, as well as nearby civilian areas. A major goal of the attacks was to provoke the Japanese military into committing some of its reserve force of aircraft into battle. However, the Japanese {{did not attempt to}} attack the Allied bombardment forces, and none of the involved <b>warships</b> suffered any damage.|$|E

In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against fast-moving enemy <b>warships.</b> Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
