5|$|Dodd's {{career was}} busiest in the 1980s, and by 1985 it was {{reported}} that he had acted in 55 movies or television features. In 1981 he played Billy Snakeskin in the film Gallipoli, about the fate of young men who participated in the World War I Gallipoli Campaign of 1915. This was followed by parts in Chase Through the Night and Essington, both in 1984. In 1985 he played the role of Mr Joe in The Coca-Cola Kid, an Australian romantic comedy with an international cast including Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi. In 1986 he appeared in the film Short Changed, <b>while</b> <b>through</b> the mid-1980s he had minor parts in the popular television series The Flying Doctors (1985–1988).|$|E

Another relation John Harington (different branch of the family) observed at the age of 13 the displayed head of Catesby after his execution and later commented on it.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, {{the early}} rate of home runs were {{markedly}} less through May 15, 2010, with 35 home runs hit in 14 games for 2.5 per game (a projection of 205—in 2009, the stadium finished at 2.93 per {{game for a}} total of 237). Even though the stadium's home run rate decreased slightly for the 2010 season to 2.73 per game, it was still the highest figure in the majors. However, the prolific home run rate of April and May 2009 that drew criticism has not sustained itself over any season thus far, and <b>while</b> <b>through</b> the first two months of the 2011 season the Yankees hit far more homers than any other team in the majors, Yankee Stadium was not the top home run park.|$|E

25|$|Hawk competed as a singles wrestler in Europe and Japan and {{although}} he won nearly every singles match he competed in, he was usually seen (by North American and Japanese fans at least) as a tag team wrestler. Thus, he always fought either mid-card opponents or made teams with better-known singles stars. When he joined New Japan Pro Wrestling he was immediately paired with Kensuke Sasaki, then simply known as a good mid-carder, as the Hell Raisers (Sasaki adopting the face paint and gimmick Power Warrior). The two dominated NJPW's tag team ranks for a <b>while</b> <b>through</b> their two wins of the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but no North American promoter thought about bringing them as a team, due to Sasaki's affiliation with NJPW. As a singles wrestler, Hawk found success in Europe, winning the CWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
25|$|His history textbook, {{the first}} Marxist {{synthesis}} of Romanian history, appeared in 1947, in one edition for advanced pupils {{and another for}} younger ones. It portrayed the country's history {{through the lens of}} Marxist stages of history: primitive communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism, advancing all the <b>while</b> <b>through</b> class struggle. Initially called Istoria României ("The History of Romania") but later Istoria R.P.R. ("The History of the R P R"), it appeared between 1947 and 1956 and was used until the 1961–1962 school year. Appearing very quickly ("in record time", according to Mihai Stoian), it was not written from scratch by Roller and his collaborators, but rather used documents from the PCR's period of illegality, especially the theses adopted by the fifth party congress held near Moscow in 1931, which criticized the 1859 union, the 1918 union, the constitutional government, democratic reforms, the monarchy, parliamentarism, the activity of the historic parties' leaders and foreign policy, with all these criticisms entering the textbook.|$|E
25|$|However, {{just east}} of Blackwall, at the {{crossing}} of the River Lea, there is a TOTSO (turn-off to stay on) with the A1261 East India Dock Link Tunnel, and the road changes character dramatically, becoming a dual three-lane expressway. This grade-separated route continues {{all the way to}} the Greater London Boundary. Notable junctions include Canning Town, and the A406 junction near Beckton, as well as the single carriageway Lodge Avenue flyover near Barking, where the old A13 route (Ripple Road) merges with the new. Grade-separated in 2002-2004, the dual carriageway section through Newham is Newham Way, <b>while</b> <b>through</b> Barking it is Alfreds Way, both comprising the East Ham & Barking Bypass, and originally dualled by the 1960s. This section is structurally sound and built to high standards, but was subject to a 40mph (64km/h) speed limit. Prior to grade-separation, the speed limit was 50mph (80km/h). Works involved inserting new underpasses at Prince Regent and Movers Lane, a new flyover at Beckton Alps, and expanding Canning Town flyover from two lanes either way to three. Also inserted was the free-flow link to the A1261 tunnel. London Bus route 173 is the only route to use the A13 here, between Beckton Alps and Ripple Road. However, the speed limit was increased back to 50mph in 2011.|$|E

500|$|On {{his return}} to the United States in 1976 he {{transformed}} his Viking Brotherhood into the Asatrú Free Assembly (AFA). The sociologist of religion Jennifer Snook described it as [...] "the first national Heathen organization in the United States", while according to the religious studies scholars Michael F. Strmiska and Baldur A. Sigurvinsson, the AFA [...] "established many of the important organizational and ritual structures that remain operative" [...] in American Heathenry into the 21st century. Initially meeting in the backroom of an insurance agency owned by group member Dick Johnson, the group later established a store-front office in Breckenridge, <b>while</b> <b>through</b> the AFA, McNallen continued publishing Runestone and produced booklets on Asatru. He also began conducting religious ceremonies, or blóts, and lectured at Pagan events across the U.S. He established groups known as guilds within the AFA to focus on particular endeavours, such as the Mead Brewing Guild and the Warrior Guild. The latter published a quarterly, Wolf Age, in which McNallen displayed his fascination for warrior ethics.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} as to why this area did not remain {{at the forefront of}} technological and social development lies in the subsequent history of its geographical location. [...] At the end of the mostly peaceful Neolithic period, this area became a highway for invaders from the east moving into Europe. [...] By the time the historical written record begins to cover this area, it has already seen a number of invasions sweep over it, leaving social and political upheaval in their wake. [...] This trend was to continue on a fairly regular basis up until the 20th century. [...] With so much destruction, it was difficult for the residents of this area to recover from each successive invasion before encountering the next. [...] However, the few societies in this area that managed to survive for a <b>while</b> <b>through</b> these turbulent centuries left behind a culture and history that are rich and dramatic.|$|E
2500|$|His {{younger sister}} Zenebework was married {{off at a}} young age to Ras Bezabih of Gojjam, but died in childbirth. Iyasu also had an elder half-sister, Woizero Sehin Mikael, married to Jantirar Asfaw, Lord of Ambassel, whose {{daughter}} would eventually become Empress Menen Asfaw, wife of Emperor Haile Selassie. [...] Another half sister of Lij Iyasu was Woizero Tewabech Mikael, second wife of Ras Seyoum Mangasha of Tigray. [...] <b>While</b> <b>through</b> his Imperial mother, Iyasu could claim to be descended from King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, through his father, he claimed descent from the Prophet Mohammed. Iyasu seems to have had at least thirteen secondary wives and an uncertain number of natural children, several of whom have been Iyasuist claimants to the Imperial throne, as well as grandchildren like Girma Yohannes. Lij Iyasu's only legitimate child was a daughter born in 1928 to him and Sabla Wangel Hailu, Alem Tsahai Iyasu who was granted the title of Emebet-hoy by Emperor Haile Selassie.|$|E
2500|$|Route 75 was a {{proposed}} freeway in the U.S. State of New Jersey in the Newark area in 1960s and 1970s. [...] It {{was designed to}} connect the existing Route 21 freeway north of Newark with Interstate 78, U.S. Route 1-9, and Newark Airport. [...] The state of New Jersey applied for interstate status for the route in 1970, but construction of the road remained stalled in courts throughout the 1970s. [...] In 1973, the state of New Jersey and the Federal Highway Administration shelved plans for the route, and in 1997, the state of New Jersey officially removed the route from its route logs. [...] Despite its removal, vestiges of Route 75 still remain. [...] The first example is Exit 13 on Interstate 280 eastbound in Newark. [...] The exit is an enormous three lane ramp, <b>while</b> <b>through</b> traffic on I-280 has only two lanes. [...] The ramp {{comes to a stop}} at a traffic light on First Street, just south of Orange Street. Also, at Exit 56 off Interstate 78, large flyover ramps meant for a freeway diverge from the roadway, but terminate at city streets.|$|E
