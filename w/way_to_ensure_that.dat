5|$|Defying the king, between 12February and 20April 1642, each county {{delegation}} of England in Commons chose two divines, {{in addition to}} two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22August, marking {{the beginning of the}} First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.|$|E

25|$|The best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> {{an injured}} horse returns to full {{work is to}} {{rehabilitate}} the animal correctly. This includes slowly bringing the horse back into training, and giving the horse light exercise each day as the tendon is healing. An impatient trainer who rushes to bring the horse back to intense training is likely to cause re-injury of the tendon.|$|E

25|$|Proponents {{of civil}} unions {{say that they}} provide {{practical}} equality for same-sex couples and solve the problems over areas such as hospital visitation rights and transfer of property caused by lack of legal recognition. Proponents also say that creating civil unions is a more pragmatic <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> same-sex couples have legal rights as it avoids the more controversial issues surrounding marriage and the religious source of the term.|$|E
25|$|As the {{original}} {{requirement for the}} system was to provide additional information to optical instruments, accurate bearing measurements were not required. However, the system did need some <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the target being ranged was the one being tracked optically, and not another nearby target. For this role, the system used two receiver antennas mounted about one wavelength apart, {{so that when they}} were pointed directly at the target the received signals would cancel out and produce a null on the display. This was sent to a second display, who's operator attempted to keep the antennas pointed at the target.|$|E
25|$|Police {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} {{the lives of people}} in the three-story apartment building might be at risk, so they couldn't afford to barricade the building and wait. They determined that due to the location of Mixon's sister's apartment within the building, there was no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> other residents could safely be brought through the single front entry door to the street. Mufarreh decided to send in the SWAT officers prematurely, assessing that the threat level was low due to a high unlikelihood that Mixon would actually be present inside the apartment. Tactical commander Captain Rick Orozco approved of Mufarreh's plan.|$|E

25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An {{uninterruptible power supply}} may use diodes in this <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and a heavy-duty split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E
25|$|The Bavarian Party {{was founded}} {{shortly after the}} war. Its goal was to {{establish}} an independent Bavarian state. For a time, the idea that Bavaria might become independent again was seriously entertained by the Allied occupation authorities as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> Germany {{would be unable to}} wage offensive war again, and also by Bavarians themselves in part because they preferred to blame the war and its result on Prussian militarism instead of their own support for the Nazis. A union between Bavaria and Austria was also considered. With the onset of the Cold War, support for Bavarian independence quickly lost support both within Bavaria and from the Western allies, and the state became a part of West Germany.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is {{the only}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> a puppy or dog remain healthy because the disease is {{extremely}} virulent and contagious. Appropriate vaccination should be performed starting at 7–8 weeks of age, with a booster given every 3–4 weeks until at least 16 weeks of age. Likewise, pregnant mothers should not be vaccinated as it will abort the puppies and could make the mother extremely sick. The virus is extremely hardy and {{has been found to}} survive in feces and other organic material such as soil for over 10 years. It survives extremely low and high temperatures. The only household disinfectant that kills the virus is bleach. The dilute bleach solution needs to be a (1:10 ratio) to disinfect and kill parvovirus.|$|E

25|$|Researchers have {{analysed}} the behaviour of chimpanzees, {{with particular}} reference to copulation calling. Copulation calling {{is a type}} of vocalisation used to attract mates. The calls are vocalised either before, during, or after sexual intercourse. Copulation calling, in line with Hrdy's hypothesis, may then be one <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the female can mate with as many different males as possible, causing paternity confusion. Indeed, the authors found that the probability of copulatory calling in female chimpanzees was not modulated by the ovarian phase of the female caller, thereby aiding paternity confusion. This paternity confusion ultimately ensures that the woman has access to the resources of a number of different males. These resources can be utilised by her, as well as by her offspring.|$|E
500|$|J. C. Jenkins, Second Parliamentary Counsel at the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, has {{expressed}} some approval at the decision. Firstly, {{he claims that}} it will significantly change the way legislation is drafted. Prior to Pepper, draftsmanship was a [...] "time consuming" [...] and [...] "frustrating rather than enlightening" [...] business. There are risks of [...] "excessive detail, over-elaboration, verbosity, prolixity, iteration, tedious repetition", and so a draftsman avoids directly dealing with every single problem, instead following the rule set out by the Renton Committee to ensure that [...] "sufficient certainty is obtained for a fair-minded and reasonable reader to be in no doubt what is intended, it being assumed {{that no one would}} take entirely perverse points against the draft, or that such points would be brushed aside by the court". The draftsman may be in conflict with a government official who wishes to be overly specific, where this general rule renders their concerns moot; in such situations, the ability to include a passage of a Minister's speech as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the courts will interpret legislation in a specific way may clear up any doubts they feel. As such, Jenkins feels that Pepper may make the jobs of parliamentary draftsmen much easier. Although one academic called Pepper a [...] "long overdue" [...] decision from [...] "which there is no turning back", the overall reaction was a negative one. The decision can be interpreted as promoting legislative supremacy, a key point in a system where parliamentary sovereignty is confirmed.|$|E

50|$|Overall it {{is clear}} to see that there are many medical {{problems}} that can arise from using computers and damaged eyesight, CTS and musculoskeletal problems are only the tip of the iceberg. But {{it is also important to}} note that changes are currently being made <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> all these problems are ameliorated to the best standard that employers and computer users currently have the technology to implement. By taking measures like ensuring our computer peripherals are situated <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> maximum comfort while working and taking frequent breaks from computational work can go a long <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> many medical conditions arising from computers are avoided. These are small measures but they go a long <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensuring</b> <b>that</b> computer users maintain their health, As with many modern and marvellous technologies in the world today there is always a downside and the major downside of computers is the medical problems that can arise from their prolonged use. Thus it is the duty of computer users and employers everywhere <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the downside is kept to a minimum.|$|R

After many years of effort by a great number of tannaim, the oral tradition was written down around 200CE by Rabbi Judah haNasi, who took up the compilation of a nominally written version of the Oral Law, the Mishnah (Hebrew: משנה). Other oral traditions from the same time period not entered into the Mishnah were recorded as [...] "Baraitot" [...] (external teaching), and the Tosefta. Other traditions were written down as Midrashim.|$|E

KLM Flight 867, another Boeing 747, again lost power to all engines in 1989 over Alaska after Mount Redoubt erupted.

2500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Second Temple and the fall of Jerusalem in the 1st and early 2nd Centuries CE devastated the Jewish community. The First Jewish–Roman War of 66–73 CE and the Bar Kokhba revolt cost {{more than a million}} Jewish lives, the {{destruction of}} leading yeshivot, and thousands of scholars and students. At that point, it became apparent that the Hebrew community and its learning were threatened, and that publication was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> the law could be preserved. Thus, around 200 CE, a redaction of the Oral Law in writing was completed. Both Rabbinic tradition and scholarship ascribe this effort to Rabbi Judah HaNasi (or [...] "Judah the Prince"). The product of this effort, the Mishnah, is generally considered the first work of Rabbinic literature.|$|E

Also on July 28, Bethmann Hollweg offered to form an anti-Russian military alliance with Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|Although most anglers {{keep their}} catch for consumption, catch and release fishing is {{increasingly}} practised, especially by fly anglers. The general principle is that releasing fish {{allows them to}} survive, thus avoiding unintended depletion of the population. For species such as marlin, muskellunge, and bass, there is a cultural taboo among anglers against taking them for food. In {{many parts of the}} world, size limits apply to certain species, meaning fish below a certain size must, by law, be released. It is generally believed that larger fish have a greater breeding potential. Some fisheries have a slot limit that allows the taking of smaller and larger fish, but requiring that intermediate sized fish be released. It is generally accepted that this management approach will help the fishery create a number of large, trophy-sized fish. [...] In smaller fisheries that are heavily fished, catch and release is the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>that</b> catchable fish will be available from year to year.|$|E
