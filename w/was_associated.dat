5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under encroaching seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|Altar 10 <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with Stela13 and {{was found}} {{on top of the}} large {{offering}} of ceramics associated with that stela and the royal tomb in Structure7A.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the financial crises in Argentina and Turkey {{in order to}} find out whether a set of six major macroeconomic indicators account for these crises or not. Evidence suggests that in Turkey, an increase in domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the 1992, 1994 and 2001 financial crises, whereas an increase in CPI <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crisis episodes. Similarly, a decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises. A fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991, 1992 and 1994. An increase in M 1 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> only with the crisis in 1992 and a fall in the volume of exports relative to volume of imports <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crisis in 1994. In Argentina, an increase in neither CPI nor domestic credit <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with any of the financial crises. A decrease in exchange rate <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with all crises, whereas a fall in the market index <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with financial crises in 1991 and 2000. An increase in M 1, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the crises in 1993, 2000 and 2001...|$|R

5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to the}} blue wildebeest has been discovered. Dating back to around 3000 BC, it was found in Hierakonopolis (Nekhen), which used to be the religious and political capital of Upper Egypt at that time. This may be evidence that the animal used to occur in North Africa and <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with the ancient Egyptians.|$|E
25|$|Low phenethylamine (PEA) {{concentration}} in the brain <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with major depressive disorder, and high concentrations <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> with schizophrenia. Low PEA levels and under-activation of TAAR1 also appears to <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with ADHD.|$|R
50|$|Low {{degrees of}} {{crystallinity}} (0-20%) <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> with liquidlike-to-elastomeric properties.

25|$|Several rare genetic {{disorders}} <b>are</b> <b>associated</b> {{with specific}} subtypes of ovarian cancer.

5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or {{in combination with other}} NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|During 2005, {{the largest}} {{recorded}} epidemic of diarrhoea occurred in Nicaragua. This unusually large and severe outbreak <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with mutations in the rotavirus A genome, possibly helping the virus escape the prevalent immunity in the population. A similar large outbreak occurred in Brazil in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Early {{settlement}} of the Hawaiian islands led to major changes to local ecosystems and many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species. Ancient Hawaiians brought foreign plants and animals, and their arrival <b>was</b> <b>associated</b> with increased rates of erosion.|$|E

Then 12∧20=4 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the set {2,3,4}∩{2,4,5}={2,4}, while 12∨20=60 <b>is</b> <b>associated</b> with the set {2,3,4}∪{2,4,5}={2,3,4,5}, so the join and meet operations of the lattice correspond to union and intersection of sets.|$|R
