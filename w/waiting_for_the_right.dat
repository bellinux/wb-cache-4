5|$|When Nao {{received}} news Card {{had arrived}} in Saigon, he inspected the equipment which now included a new battery and a redesigned bomb. Again, Nao decided to set off the bombs during {{the early hours of}} May 2, so that he and his fellow operative could escape safely and avoid inflicting casualties on the local population. But due to illness, Cay declined {{to take part in the}} operation, so Hung had to replace him. At around 9am on May 1, Nao rushed to Hung’s home, where the latter was given a hand grenade and was notified of an upcoming operation without much detail. At 6pm, after Nao had finished unloading the bombs onto one canoe, he and Hung traveled down the Saigon River in two separate canoes, towards the commercial port district. Both men than pulled over in the Thu Thiem area, to avoid detection from South Vietnamese authorities by intermingling with the local workers who lived there. While <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time, Nao briefed Hung on the objectives of the operation, which was to sink the largest American ship at the Saigon Port, and promptly report the results back to headquarters.|$|E

25|$|Significantly, it was {{not until}} the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began {{training}} Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan. Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad – which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects – have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, because the Israeli security and intelligence services believe that al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to mount an attack.|$|E

25|$|For the snowboarding scene, {{which was}} shot in Aiguille de la Grande Sassière in France, {{professional}} snowboarders Xavier de Le Rue and Jeremy Jones, along with Ralph Backstrom and Mike Basich, were hired to play stunt doubles. There were daily avalanche checks during the shoot, and {{a significant amount of}} time was spent sitting and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> conditions to film. For this scene, Core and members of his crew roped down cliffs to record the snowboarders from the best possible angles. At some point, Core had to give Xavier the camera and he had to shoot other people. He admitted that because Rue and Jones were so fast, few could keep up with them. During filming a particular sequence, a Class 4 avalanche was triggered.|$|E
25|$|She {{has often}} said that {{she knew she would}} become a monastic in the Buddhist {{tradition}} at some point in her life; she was just <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time. That time came in 2000 when she took early retirement from Thammasat University and received the bodhisattva's precept from the Fo Guang Shan order in Taiwan. In 2001, she took her sāmaṇerī ordination in Sri Lanka from R. Saddha Sumana Bhikkhuni and T. Dhammaloka Bhikkhu. In 2001, she was ordained a full bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka, the first Thai woman to be ordained in a Theravada monastic lineage, as Dhammananda. Her ordination lineage is Syamopali from Dambulla chapter. She currently resides at the Songdhammakalyani Monastery in the Muang District, Nakhonpathom province, Thailand. Since her ordination, Dhammananda has written more than 100 books, designed to educate the public about various issues related to Thai Buddhism, including the place of women.|$|E
25|$|In episode 4, Agnes urges Kat {{to return}} to Spain, and when Dermott learns of this, he confronts Agnes about taking him from his mother. In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time and insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

500|$|An Rfunk song, [...] "Fighting Temptation" [...] samples Uncle Louie's [...] "I Like Funky Music" [...] (1979). Lyrically, {{the song}} makes {{reference}} to fighting against negativity in {{life as well}} as <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> person before falling in love. Music critics generally received the song with positive reception. They complimented the theme of the song, the vocals of Beyoncé, and the verse-raps. [...] "Fighting Temptation" [...] received attention mainly in European countries, peaking at number eleven in the Netherlands and reaching the top fifty in Belgium as well as Switzerland. The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Antti Jokinen.|$|E
500|$|McAvoy {{declared}} {{that since he}} [...] "had a blast making the first Wanted", {{he would make a}} sequel regardless {{of the quality of the}} script; however, he also acknowledged that the extended time the film spent in development [...] "suggests to me that they're not finding it very easy to come up with a story that they're passionate about, so we'll have to wait and see." [...] In 2014, McAvoy acknowledged that a potential sequel has been in the talks, saying he [...] "had a couple of versions of script thrown my way" [...] while adding that Universal is still <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> screenplay.|$|E
500|$|The torments {{that the}} Joker puts Commissioner Gordon through {{are meant to}} serve as [...] "proof that there is {{something}} buried deep within each lunatic, a nugget of insanity, that is simply <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment to spring forth." [...] Unlike the Joker, however, Gordon emerges from his ordeal with his sanity and moral code intact. The story is also famous for changing how the Modern Age of Comics perceived Batman comics by bringing it back to its darker roots. The comic book, however, delves deeper in order to present Batman's own psychology - that he is, in his own way, just as insane as the Joker, and that he and the Joker perceive the world according to differing points of view, with the Joker's interpreted through a joke.|$|E

500|$|Most notably, he {{performed}} {{the first ever}} kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff had been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> patient for some time, {{hoping to find a}} patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The patient that Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. [...] Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, {{he performed}} 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.|$|E

Ayman al-Zawahiri eventually became one of Egyptian Islamic Jihad's leading organizers and recruiters. Zawahiri's hope was to recruit military officers and accumulate weapons, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> moment to launch [...] "a complete overthrow of the existing order." [...] Chief strategist of Al-Jihad was Aboud al-Zumar, a colonel in the military intelligence whose plan was to kill the main leaders of the country, capture {{the headquarters of the}} army and State Security, the telephone exchange building, and of course the radio and television building, where news of the Islamic revolution would then be broadcast, unleashing – he expected – [...] "a popular uprising against secular authority all over the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{six out of}} the ten seasons between 1920 and 1929, he made centuries, {{but never}} {{more than one in}} any season, and his total of runs in a season never {{exceeded}} 600. Among his centuries was one of 118, made in Somerset's first-ever first-class match against Glamorgan in 1921. He put on 189 for the first wicket with the dashing Peter Randall Johnson, who made 123 of the runs; Rippon was, by implication in Wisden's report, much slower, though his runs came in 190 minutes. His highest innings was 133 against Worcestershire at the Knowle ground in 1927, the runs being made out of 314 runs while he was at the wicket: he [...] "wore down the attack", wrote Wisden, and [...] "showed such patience in <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> ball to hit that he did not give a chance". Not all of his batting was slow, however: in 1928, the last of his centuries was 112 against Hampshire and he put on 197 for the first wicket with Tom Young, the runs coming in less than 150 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Strength {{played an}} {{important}} part in Hoad's game, as he often drove for winners rather than rallying and <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> opportunity. Although he assaulted his opponents, he also had the skill to win the French Championships on the slower clay court. Hoad played right-handed and had a powerful serve and groundstrokes but his game lacked consistency. At times Hoad had difficulty maintaining concentration. According to Kramer, [...] "Hoad had the loosest game of any good kid I ever saw. There was absolutely no pattern to his game.... He was the only player I ever saw who could stand six or seven feet behind the baseline and snap the ball back hard, crosscourt. He'd try for winners off everything, off great serves, off tricky short balls, off low volleys. He hit hard overspin drives, {{and there was no way}} you could ever get him to temporise on important points." [...] Kramer compares Hoad to another great player, Ellsworth Vines. [...] "Both were very strong guys. Both succeeded at a very young age.... Also, both were very lazy guys. Vines lost interest in tennis (for golf) before he was thirty, and Hoad never appeared to be very interested. Despite their great natural ability, neither put up the outstanding records that they were capable of. Unfortunately, the latter was largely true because both had physical problems." ...|$|E
