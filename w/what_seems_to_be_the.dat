25|$|Énée then rushes {{on to tell}} of the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E
25|$|As stated before, most of {{the story}} is {{reported}} by direct speech of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward. The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the dramatic tension. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> verdict {{turns out to be a}} clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Mills {{decided to}} speak about his inner experiences, but only if asked to do so. He made this {{agreement}} after he received the same message from two different sources: “You must learn to speak the Word again.” Then, people began seeking him out - sometimes arriving unexpectedly on his doorstep - asking about their deepest questions and concerns. Mills found himself speaking spontaneously to these seekers. When their number became too large to speak with individually, Mills began giving lectures. He defined his spontaneous speaking, which he called Unfoldment, as “an impromptu performance under the impelling of divine ideas. It is a projection from another dimension or plane of consciousness, causing those prepared to hear to awaken to the higher or greater possibilities of living {{beyond the limits of}} three dimensions and translating <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ordinary into another level of consideration.” He also often spoke in poetry, offering some 3,000 extemporaneous poems during his lifetime.|$|E

However, Sam {{finds out that}} Franco is Jason's twin brother. Sam has another paternity test run, and is devastated when it says that Franco {{is the father of}} her baby. She tells Jason, {{and the two of them}} start to drift apart trying to deal this news. While they're separated, Sam gives birth to a baby boy during a rainstorm. Her son is switched at birth with Victor Lord III, who was stillborn, by Heather Webber (Robin Mattson) and Todd Manning (Roger Howarth). Jason finds them, and the two mourn when they believe that the baby died. It's revealed that Jason is the father of Sam's son because Heather switched the paternity test. Their son is given to Téa Delgado (Florencia Lozano), Victor's mother, who believes he's her son. Though Jason wants to make things right with Sam, she blames him for the death of her son. The two separate, and file for divorce. During the poisoning of the Port Charles water supply, Sam and Jason are admitted to the hospital in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last hours of their life. Sam shares with Jason a dream she had where her son was still alive. Afterwards, Jason gets information that starts to make him suspect the baby that died wasn't Sam's.|$|E

Much of the drapery on the bust of the image is ornamentation comprising jewellery made of pearls around her throat. An elaborate pile of curls forms her hair, some of which trails to her shoulders. [...] Above these curly tresses and behind the head is a tiered coronet of jewels, the curved edge of which rises to form a halo.

500|$|Cheney has {{publicly}} criticized President Obama since the 2008 presidential election. On December 29, 2009, {{four days after}} the attempted bombing of an international passenger flight from Netherlands to United States, Cheney criticized Obama: [...] " [...] are at war and when President Obama pretends we aren't, it makes us less safe. [...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society." [...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E

After {{the two men}} get into a vicious physical altercation, X divulges Mulder's whereabouts. Meanwhile, Mulder finds the stranded Allegiance, with its sail broken through a patch of shallow ice. Inside, he finds <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> sub's only surviving crewman, whom Mulder correctly guesses is the disguised Bounty Hunter. The two struggle, during which Mulder becomes exposed to the Bounty Hunter's toxic blood. The Bounty Hunter claims that Samantha is still alive before dumping Mulder off the sail and submerging the Allegiance; Mulder is nearly cut in half with the sub's diving plane in the process. Mulder is discovered and rushed to the field hospital seen {{at the beginning of}} [...] "Colony", where Scully—having learned that the alien blood contains a retrovirus that dies in cold temperatures—convinces the doctors to take him out of the bath that would warm his body up.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} five months the pages were {{accompanied}} with captions beneath them, and at first the captions were numbered. [...] In contrast to the high level of skill in the artwork, the dialogue in the speech balloons is crude, sometimes approaching illegibility, and [...] "disfigur otherwise flawless work", according to critic R. C. Harvey. [...] The level of effort and skill apparent in the title lettering highlights <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the visual composition. [...] They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and showed that McCay's gift was in the visual and not the verbal.|$|E

The intention was to link Bremer with the Democrats. Hersh writes that, in a taped conversation, [...] "Nixon is energized and excited by <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> ultimate political dirty trick: the FBI and the Milwaukee police will be convinced, and will tell the world, that the attempted assassination of Wallace had its roots in left-wing Democratic politics."

[...] The Annunciation of 1482 in the Städel museum in Frankfurt shows it at the top, and the same carpet seems {{to be used in the}} Annunciation, with Saint Emidius in the National Gallery, London (1486), which shows the type hung over a balcony to the top left (and a different type of carpet over another balcony in the right foreground.

2500|$|The Italic League {{played an}} {{essential}} part {{in the balance of}} power subsequently pursued by the Florentine ruler Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–92); its only cracks were the Pazzi conspiracy, the Barons Conspiracy and the Salt War. The League provided enough stability to allow the peninsular economy to recover from the population loss and economic depression caused by the Black Death and its aftermath, leading to an economic expansion that endured until {{the first part of the}} 17th century. The League also enabled the creation of the first permanent embassies amongst the states of the Italian peninsula, in order to monitor compliance with the terms prohibiting supporting exiled dissidents, with De Officio Legati — <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first treatise on ambassadorship — written by Ermolao Barbaro in Venice in 1490, after he had served the [...] in Burgundy and Milan.|$|E
2500|$|After United Artists {{declined}} to budget the film, Lucas and producer Gary Kurtz presented the film treatment to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it rejected its {{options for the}} film because the concept was [...] "a little strange", and it said that Lucas should follow American Graffiti with more consequential themes. Lucas said, [...] "I've always been an outsider to Hollywood types. They think I do weirdo films." [...] According to Kurtz, Lew Wasserman, the studio's head, [...] "just didn't think much of science fiction at that time, didn't think it had much of a future then, with that particular audience." [...] He said that [...] "science fiction wasn't popular in the mid-'70s ... <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case generally is that the studio executives are looking for what was popular last year, {{rather than trying to}} look forward to what might be popular next year." [...] Lucas explained in 1977 that the film is not [...] "about the future" [...] and that it [...] "is a fantasy much closer to the Brothers Grimm than it is to [...] ". He added: [...] "My main reason for making it was to give young people an honest, wholesome fantasy life, the kind my generation had. We had westerns, pirate movies, all kinds of great things. Now they have The Six Million Dollar Man and Kojak. Where are the romance, the adventure, and the fun that used to be in practically every movie made?" [...] Kurtz said, [...] "Although Star Wars wasn't like that at all, it was just sort of lumped into that same kind of [...] category." ...|$|E
