5|$|After the September 11 attacks, Madonna {{was in an}} introspective {{mood and}} started writing songs for her next studio album, American Life, with {{producer}} Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Recording started in late 2001 but was put on hold as Madonna shot for her film Swept Away in Malta, and also starred in the West End play, Up For Grabs. In the meantime, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was filming the twentieth James Bond film, Die Another Day, directed by Lee Tamahori. The previous film in the franchise, The World Is Not Enough (1999) was a box office success earning US$362 million worldwide. However, the eponymous soundtrack single by alternative rock group Garbage failed to gain commercial success in the United States. The music management at MGM <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for a high-profile artist to write and perform the title song for Die Another Day.|$|E

Glaurung, who now lived in the ruined halls of Nargothrond, descended into the river so that a fog rose and enmeshed the company. Morwen was lost, but Nienor met the dragon and was enspelled by him, forgetting her past. Eventually she fled from both the Elves and the Orcs that pursued her and reached Brethil.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{disappearance}} of the Southern Cross that was piloted by Charles Kingsford Smith in early April 1929 as part of the flight from Sydney to Wyndham, messages had been sent using the Wave Hill wireless station. Several search-planes <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the Southern Cross including the Kookaburra, flown by Lieutenant Keith Anderson with mechanic R. Hitchcock, which took off from Alice Springs on 10 April. The Kookaburra never landed at Wave Hill to resupply and was declared missing. The Southern Cross was found 12 April on mudflats {{at the mouth of the}} Glenelg River in the Kimberley region of Western Australia. The wreckage of the Kookaburra was found in desert country south-east of Wave Hill on 21 April with Hitchcock's body beneath one wing and Anderson missing. Anderson's body was found a few hundred meters away.|$|E
25|$|On a cold {{morning of}} February 1827, John left {{his home and}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for work as a farm-servant. At 12, he found life at home {{unbearable}} because of the continuous quarrels with Antonio. Having to face life by himself {{at such a young}} age may have developed his later sympathies to help abandoned boys. After begging unsuccessfully for work, Bosco ended up at the wine farm of Louis Moglia. Although Bosco could pursue some studies by himself, he was not able to attend school for two more years. In 1830 he met Joseph Cafasso, a young priest who identified some natural talent and supported his first schooling. In 1835 Bosco entered the seminary at Chieri, next to the Church of the Immacolata Concezione. In 1841, after six years of study, he was ordained priest on the eve of Trinity Sunday by Archbishop Franzoni of Turin.|$|E

Tostes responded to a 1994 press query about Caymmi's habit of frequenting bars with a short story: [...] "One night I <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for him in a bar ... He was {{surrounded}} by women. I went in and slammed a table. A glass broke. The bouncer came, and I punched Caymmi's face. Then I left cussing. I thought he was involved with drugs, but it wasn't the case. He was with the tramps." [...] Despite such incidents, however, they remained together for 68 years, {{until his death in}} 2008. The couple had three children, Nana, Danilo, and Dori, all of whom followed their father into musical careers.|$|E

On 8 May [...] Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for them after the storm and found only tracks leading {{to the edge of}} the broken ice. Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack and Gaze.|$|E
