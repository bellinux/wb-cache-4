40|$|Sixty-one Burkholderia cepacia {{isolates}} {{from patients}} with cystic fibrosis (CF) and four plant isolates were screened for {{production of the}} siderophores salicylic acid (SA), pyochelin, cepabactin, and ornibactins and fingerprinted by a PCR-based randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method. Of the 24 RAPD types determined, 22 (92 %) were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced SA, 21 (87 %) were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced ornibactins, 15 (60 %) were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced pyochelin, and 3 (12 %) were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced cepabactin. Of the 24 RAPD types plus 2 phenotypic variants of types 1 and 9, 3 were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced all four siderophores, 8 were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced three siderophores, 12 were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced two siderophores, and 3 were associated <b>with</b> isolates <b>that</b> produced only one siderophore. These {{results suggest that the}} numbers and types of siderophores produced by CF isolates of B. cepacia correlate with RAPD type and that SA and ornibactins are the most prevalent siderophores produced...|$|R
