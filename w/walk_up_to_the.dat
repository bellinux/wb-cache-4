She and her husband then <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Chancellery garden, where Goebbels shoots his wife and then himself. As the remaining staff in the bunker evacuate, Krebs and Burgdorf kill themselves. Weidling broadcasts to the city that Hitler is dead and that he will be seeking an immediate ceasefire.|$|E

25|$|The {{large house}} {{situated}} halfway along the dam wall was originally the weirmaster's cottage. The weirmaster would <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hexagonal valve house, constructed {{to the same}} design as BCN tollhouses, and operate the gate valves to release water from Chasewater reservoir into the canal. The construction of the M6 Toll between the reservoir and the A5 required {{the construction of a}} new bridge over the motorway to access the southern side of the lake, where an Innovation Centre provides enhanced access to the waterfront. Selling land for motorway construction also allowed the Chasewater Railway to construct new premises and a large engine shed on the lake side.|$|E
500|$|Breen stands transfixed and is {{eventually}} {{consumed by the}} energies from the craft as it slowly melts away and {{an image of a}} Martian [...] "devil" [...] floats in the sky above London. Fires and riots erupt, and after Quatermass succumbs to the mass psychosis he attempts to kill Roney, who does not have the alien gene and is therefore immune to the alien influence. Roney manages to shake Quatermass out of his trance, and remembering the legends of demons and their aversion to iron and water, he proposes that a sufficient mass of iron connected to wet earth may be sufficient to short-circuit the apparition. Quatermass acquires a length of iron chain and tries to reach the [...] "devil" [...] but succumbs to its psychic pressure. Roney manages to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> apparition and hurls the chain at it, resulting in him and the spacecraft being reduced to ashes.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} other {{successful}} [...] "drive up" [...] businesses have their roots in the 1950s, including McDonald's (expanded c. 1955), which had no dine-in facilities, requiring customers to park and <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, taking their order [...] "to go". Automation {{and the lack of}} dining facilities allowed McDonald's to sell burgers for 15 cents each, instead of the typical 35 cents, and people were buying them by the bagful. By 1948, they had fired their carhops, installed larger grills, reduced their menu and radically changed the industry by introducing assembly-line methods of food production, similar to the auto industry, dubbing it the [...] "Speedee Service System". They redesigned their sign specifically {{to make it easier to}} see from the road, creating the now familiar yellow double-arch structure. Businessman Ray Kroc joined McDonald's as a franchise agent in 1955. He subsequently purchased the chain from the McDonald brothers and oversaw its worldwide growth.|$|E

500|$|The first {{additional}} gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait {{known as}} the tölt. This {{is known for its}} explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern {{is the same as the}} walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a [...] "Pig's Pace" [...] or [...] "Piggy-pace" [...] that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a Valhopp and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses that mix their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} {{feature is the}} [...] bronze statue of [...] Heisman Trophy winner Nile Kinnick, the statue depicts Kinnick dressed as a scholar, rather than in his {{football}} uniform. The bronze statue is placed near the team entrance to the stadium. [...] When the renovation of the stadium was completed, and the statue unveiled, a tradition among the players began: one player, before entering the locker room, {{reached out and touched}} the helmet that was placed at Kinnick's feet. From that point on, all Iowa players, before entering the locker room, and after getting off the bus, <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> statue and rub the helmet, as a token of respect for Kinnick - the only Iowa player to ever win the Heisman Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{the enemy}} fled {{at the sound}} of the [...] "First Wave", and stops were {{correctly}} placed by the operational commander, the operations were efficiently carried out. The difficult thing was to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enemy hiding in a house or cave or behind a boulder and kill or capture him. Many a troopie clawing through obstacles found himself very suddenly right by another armed man he was supposed to kill or capture. Though the event was shocking (and often results in one or more persons being killed), it is far more efficient than firing or dropping ordnance from air and overall reduces civilian casualties. The cooperation of the Rhodesian Air Force with Army operations was exceptional. [...] Even when patrolling, any unit of the Rhodesian Army could expect prompt G-car response in a crisis.|$|E

2500|$|A prologue {{was added}} to the {{beginning}} of all the fourth-series episodes for the American transmissions. This was to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard; a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> body as the voice-over explains: [...] "Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers." [...] During this voice-over, Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together. Fade to black and then the opening titles proper begin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1874: [...] "Another, if possible, {{still more}} {{beautiful}} day, after a slight frost. — After writing started at 11 with Beatrice to try & <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> falls of the Glassalt, which I {{had not done}} since 20 years! There was not a breath of wind & a very powerful sun. I managed to get up & was wonderfully little out of breath. Brown helped me up the steepest parts, which are rather trying. The falls were not particularly full, but always very fine. I {{walked up to the}} very top, just above, them, & rested a little on the heather. The descent was far easier, but the path was very rough in parts & I had recourse to Brown's strong arm to steady me. It is 4 miles to the top & back, & I felt quite proud, that I could accomplish it so well. — In the afternoon drove with Beatrice & Janie E. nearly as far as Birkhall & back, taking our tea at the Linn of Muich. A splendid frosty evening." [...] Likewise in 1877: [...] "Walked with Beatrice {{up to the top of}} the Glassalt falls, where the icicles where hanging ...|$|E
2500|$|Negoiță does however {{proceed to}} Negustori, {{learning}} that Acrivița was chased {{out of her}} home by the creditors and moved back in with her father. Once there, {{he claims to be}} a debtor of Ianulea's, presenting her with 100 gold coins and a deed to the Cuțitul de Argint vineyard. He manages to intrigue her by suggesting that, should she ever hear of a demon possessing a woman or girl, she is to <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victim, call out parigboria tu kosmu, and recount her longing for Ianulea. She promises to follow his advice, and Negoiță returns to court, before deciding to head out of the city for good. He receives yet more presents from the princely family, as well as emotional thanks from Manoli Ghaiduri. As Negoiță rides out on his way to Oltenia, the devil takes control of another young lady, the daughter of Wallachia's Orthodox Metropolitan. This is Acrivița's opportunity to follow Negoiță's advice, and, as soon as she enters the room, the demon flees in panic. The story ends on Aghiuță's return to Hell, where he requests from Dardarot not to ever accept either Negoiță and Acrivița into Hell, and assign them instead to Heaven: [...] "let Saint Peter make up with them as best he can." [...] He also demands and obtains a period of rest to last three centuries, as [...] "those little affairs down on earth left me dog-tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|Implementing pathfinding was a {{particularly}} difficult challenge. The terrain in the game is a 3D polygonal mesh constructed of square cells, {{each of which is}} tessellated into two triangles. Certain cells have an associated terrain type which indicates their impassability, and may contain any solid object. The team originally planned to use the A* algorithm, but soon realized this would create problems in terms of the realism they desired. As impassable obstacles can lie anywhere on the map, and as the square cells are quite large, the obstacles are not guaranteed to be aligned at their center. Furthermore, even if an obstacle did occupy exactly one cell, the A* algorithm would make a unit <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> obstacle, turn, and continue around it. The developers instead wanted their units to move to avoid obstacles ahead of time, as they approached them, such as smoothly weaving through a forest instead of continually heading straight for a tree, only to stop and suddenly walk around it. As such, they wrote their own pathfinding algorithm. As the terrain in the game never changes, paths could be calculated once and remembered. Then, the team factored in arbitrarily placed obstacles and periodically refined their pathfinding using a vector-based scheme. If the planned path caused the unit to hit an obstacle, the path was altered, with the AI choosing whether deviating to the left or the right was the shorter option. Their system worked for 90% of cases, but in testing, the developers discovered several scenarios where their pathfinding algorithm didn't work especially well. However, by the time they made this discovery, {{it was too late to}} implement the changes that would have been necessary to fully correct it. As such, their assessment of the pathfinding in the final version of the game was that [...] "it works pretty well and provides the effect we sought, but there's definitely room for improvement." ...|$|E
2500|$|From its {{inception}} to its broadcast, {{there were a}} lot of changes in how the episode is presented. Originally, [...] "Pip" [...] was going to be a musical episode, the first South Park musical since the 1999 movie [...] At one point, the plan was to have Pip tell his own story to the South Park Elementary class. An early storyboard scene shows [...] "Pip <b>walk</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> class holding a HUGE manuscript of paper. It could be a novel." [...] Beginning his story in the classroom, he starts by introducing the origins of his name, only to be interrupted by Cartman – much like the scene in [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig". In the end, the finished episode did not include the boys or any other regular characters. As Stone and Parker explained, [...] "bookend it with the kids or hav the kids listening to the story" [...] would be too formulaic for their tastes, so they decided to do the episode without the South Park boys, precisely [...] "ecause it's a bad idea." [...] Having an episode's worth of story told in front of the class was later used in the eighth season episode [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", which has Cartman telling a Christmas themed story (in a plot twist). The ending of the story's narration in that episode resembles the ending in [...] "Pip". In [...] "Pip", the narrator ends the story with the line [...] "And they all lived happily ever after, except for Pocket, who died of Hepatitis B." [...] In [...] "Woodland Critter Christmas", Cartman finishes the story by saying [...] "And they all lived happily ever after. Except for Kyle, who died of AIDS two weeks later." [...] Another idea was to have Chef narrate the episode, in the style of Masterpiece Theatre. In the end, the creators decided to do the Masterpiece parody in live action, with the narrator played by Malcolm McDowell. The reason behind the introduction was to make it clear to the viewers that it is going to be an [...] "extremely different experience" [...] from the other episodes, and that they are not going to see the regular characters of the show. The creators said that they did this having learned the lesson from the second season episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] – which also revolves entirely around two minor characters – about the necessity of making the audience aware that they are not to expect to see the regular characters any time during the episode. Both McDowell and the two creators have spoken highly of each other. Parker and Stone said that shooting with McDowell was a positive experience, and that he told old stories about the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange – which McDowell starred in –, and its director Stanley Kubrick.|$|E
