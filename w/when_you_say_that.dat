60|$|JENNY. That {{makes me}} so happy. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> I feel wicked for {{loitering}} here. I must get to work again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{have you}} done this?" [...] he faltered. [...] "Tell me what you mean, man, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you were {{responsible}} for his disappearance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you do look so honest <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that!</b> It must be true--surely you couldn't {{look that}} way, you wouldn't {{look that way}} {{if it were not}} true--would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have no {{occasion}} {{to call her}} anything but Madam. Just <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> think is likely {{to make the best}} impression--look at me from time to time--and if I put my hand to my cravat so--(showing her the motion)--you will stop; but I shall only do this <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> anything <b>that</b> is not likely to please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you haven't it?" [...] she echoed. [...] "It's <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{things like}} <b>that</b> that you're so dreadfully tiresome. As {{if there were}} {{anything}} that you haven't or mightn't have!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well!' cried Tom, 'I {{am glad to}} hear it; I am overjoyed to hear it. I am {{sure there}} is not, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> so in <b>that</b> manner. You won't take it ill, John, that I said what I did just now!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a {{nice way}} for a baptized Christian to talk," [...] said Barbara, adding, [...] "But Jeekie, {{what do you mean}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the god did not take you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he said, [...] "you shall do 'most {{everything}} you like; but, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I do not love you, I {{am not sure}} that you are right." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you weed them out, {{you send}} a cold shiver down my spine. I hope you don't mean that you--that you--that you assist Nature in any way? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your {{daughter}} I {{can love}} as my own. I think I prove my devotion to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I am willing {{for your sake}} to encounter the troubles which may attend your son's future career.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{happen to}} have a special {{acquaintance}} with the water plant Alisma Plantago ... and as I never saw it so thoroughly or so well drawn, I must take leave to remonstrate with <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> sweepingly <b>that</b> these men 'sacrifice truth as well as feeling to eccentricity.' For as a mere botanical study of the Water Lily and Alisma, {{as well as of the}} common lily and several other garden flowers, this picture would be invaluable to me, and I heartily wish it were mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} the abbess, [...] "it is hard, as we nuns know well. But, daughter, that sore choice {{has not yet}} been thrust upon <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> Saladin <b>says</b> <b>that</b> he sets <b>you</b> against the lives of all this cityful, then you must judge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} smoked all the evening," [...] he confessed, [...] "I cannot. You are right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{we are not}} beaten, but I like to look ahead. I want to know your terms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{about three}} years. You are quite right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she is unlike any of us. It doesn't seem nice to {{complain}} about her exactly, but she really is terribly trying, isn't she, Selina?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sound common sense," [...] Mr. Draconmeyer agreed. [...] "You are {{perfectly}} right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> we are over-sensitive. The banker deplores {{it as much}} as the politician. It's the money-kings, I suppose, who find it profitable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet, dear Sarah," [...] he freely broke in, [...] "I feel, <b>when</b> I hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't quite {{do justice}} to the {{important}} truth of the extent to which--as you're also mine--I'm your natural due. I should like much better," [...] he laughed, [...] "to see you fight for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> no {{one there}} {{realized}} {{the importance of the}} doctor's statement at that moment, I am wrong; there were three persons, who fully understood at once the gravity of the situation, and the astounding development which the case was beginning to assume.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite that, Miss Merton; though I own I {{admire the}} good knight, greatly. We {{are going to}} move off, now, to the covert {{that has to be}} drawn; and I know I shall shock <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I {{sincerely}} hope that nothing will be found there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have heard}} you," [...] said Meyer, when Mr. Clifford had {{finished}} translating, [...] "and {{we wish to}} ask you a question. What do you mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the Spirit of the white woman has been seen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I'm {{not quite}} sure I follow you," [...] Mr. Bundercombe observed. [...] "I am with you all right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the direct pecuniary payment for being in Parliament doesn't amount to anything; but what's your pull worth, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not believe}} you, Eustace," [...] he said. [...] "Do you {{understand}} what you make out this lady to be <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> she could kiss {{me and tell me}} that she loved me--for she did both yesterday--and promise to marry you to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, quietly, [...] "it {{was a great}} responsibility, {{and there}} were times when I was horribly afraid. Still, events have proved me right, and I think it is the {{greatest}} compliment I could pay <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it was to make Carrie safe I did it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I rejoice to hear it,' said Sir John. 'Commend me to them <b>when</b> <b>you</b> return, and <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I wished I were {{fortunate}} enough to convey, myself, the salute which I entrust you to deliver. And what,' he asked very sweetly, after a moment's pause, 'can I do for you? You may command me freely.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "National Anthem" [...] was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler in May 2012. It premiered on June 27, 2012. Mandler stated the concept was Del Rey's {{and that she was}} [...] "really interested in exploring this loss of innocence, this idea that what you think you're experiencing is maybe not what it's always going to be. Because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'Kennedy,' <b>that</b> immediately evokes something, just like when I say 'It's a Romeo and Juliet story.' So I think using that power, that pedigree of the story is a really fascinating place to show the loss of something, the breakdown of something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{may be the}} {{explanation}} of all the bad feeling," [...] Maggie admitted, [...] "and {{you may be right}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any practical move against us is almost impossible. Dad doesn't think so, you know. He is terribly exercised about the coming of Prince Shan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{precious}} life?" [...] Lord Harry repeated lightly. [...] "You're {{thinking of}} Mr. Mountjoy, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that.</b> His life is worth saving. As for my life"---- He ended the sentence by a whistle, {{as the best}} way he could hit on of expressing his contempt for his own existence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{say that}} Leopold of Lutha lived futilely. You are right; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he has died futilely, you are, I believe, wrong. Living, {{he gave us}} a poor weakling. Dying, he leaves the throne to a brave man, in whose veins flows {{the blood of the}} Rubinroths, {{hereditary}} rulers of Lutha.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it is delicious," [...] he {{answered}} her, speaking more lightly than he felt. [...] "What a numskull you make, Grizel, of {{any man who}} presumes to write about women! I am at school again, and you are Miss Ailie teaching me the alphabet. But I thought you lost that serious little girl on the doleful day <b>when</b> she heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> loved me best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Her {{power of}} paying a ransom,' said Massena. 'You have three missions, then: To rescue this unfortunate lady; to punish this villain; and, if possible, {{to break up}} this nest of brigands. It will be a proof of the {{confidence}} which I have in <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I can only spare you half a squadron with which to accomplish all this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} think me an infernal scoundrel!" [...] he said. [...] "I can stand a good deal, Miss Isabel, but I can't stand that. How have I failed in respect toward you, if you please? I {{have told you}} you're the woman my heart is set on. Well? Isn't it plain what I want of <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that?</b> Isabel Miller, I {{want you to be}} my wife!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I don't think so. We ask to {{be forgiven}} just as we forgive. That {{is the way in}} which we hope to be forgiven, and {{therefore}} it {{is the way in which}} we ought to forgive. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> prayer at night, mamma, do you ever ask yourself whether you have forgiven him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cannot leave Monte Carlo?" [...] she {{repeated}} derisively. [...] "Why, my dear man, {{you are a}} {{fish out of water}} here! You don't gamble, you do nothing but moon about and go to the Opera and worry about your silly politics. What on earth do you mean <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you cannot leave Monte Carlo?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Ledsam," [...] {{the detective}} assured him, [...] "I shall tell you {{everything}} that is possible. At the same time, I will be frank with you. You are right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{it was you who}} first directed my attention towards Sir Timothy Brast. Since that time, however, your own relations with him, to an onlooker, have become a little puzzling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Sir," [...] {{broke in}} the Comte slowly, {{and with a}} voice {{that seemed to be}} {{trembling}} with emotion, [...] "it is to my daughter and to myself that you have just rendered a signal and generous service. For this I tender you my thanks, yet believe me, I pray <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I <b>say</b> <b>that</b> both she and I would rather have suffered any humiliation or ill-usage from that rough crowd than owe our safety and comfort to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I couldn't {{even begin}} to explain what an amazing {{experience}} this was... It was breathtaking... I felt incredibly honoured being able to share even just this {{short period of time}} with both the police, soldiers and the islanders... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> hear others <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this experience will change your life, you don't believe it until it happens to you and I am lost for words knowing {{that i was able to}} experience this while being surrounded by such wonderful and inspiring people..." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a curious}} situation; {{yet it is}} not on that account that I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which seemed to me still more curious. To wit, that this dreadful matter brought from these downtrodden people no {{outburst}} of rage against these oppressors. They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but a kindness. Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery. Their entire being {{was reduced to a}} monotonous dead level of patience, resignation, dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in this life. Their very imagination was dead. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower deep for him.|$|R
