25|$|What made Cubism {{progressive}} and truly modern, according to Metzinger and Gleizes, was its new geometric armature; with that it broke {{free from the}} immobility of 3-dimensional Euclidean geometry and attained a dynamic representation of the 4-dimensional continuum in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> a better representation of reality, of life's experience, {{something that could be}} grasped through the senses (not through the eye) and expressed onto a canvas.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} May 15, 2009 through Reprise Records. Armstrong {{has described the}} album as a [...] "snapshot of the era in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> as we question {{and try to make}} sense of the selfish manipulation going on around us, whether it be the government, religion, media or frankly any form of authority". The singles [...] "Know Your Enemy" [...] and [...] "21 Guns" [...] exemplify the themes of alienation and politically motivated anger present in the record.|$|E
500|$|Grant {{has been}} more direct in his {{description}} of Anarky's virtuous attributes: [...] "In my eyes, Anarky's a hero. Anarky's the hero I want to be if I was smart enough and physically fit enough." [...] Acknowledging that Anarky's moral perspective was guided by his own, Grant expressed that the conflict between Anarky and other heroes {{is a result of}} their political divisions: [...] "In my eyes, he's a hero, but to others, they see him as a villain. That is because most people might gripe about the political situation, or various aspects of the political situation, and wouldn't advocate the total overthrow of the system under <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live.</b> Anarky certainly does that, and more." ...|$|E

5000|$|Step three: The {{analytical}} step involves {{analyzing the}} here and now and creates a subjective space of freedom from the present.

60|$|In a word, we {{were now}} in very {{considerable}} circumstances, {{and every year}} increasing; for our new plantation grew upon our hands insensibly, and in eight years <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> upon it, <b>we</b> brought it to such pitch, that the produce was at least #300 sterling a year; I mean, worth so much in England.|$|R
500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to the world in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E
500|$|A lyrics {{video for}} the song was {{uploaded}} onto Muñiz's YouTube channel on 21 April 2017, showing [...] "some very summery scenes". The release of the official music video followed on 17 May 2017 on the same platform, but was not made available to watch until 26 May 2017. It was directed by Manuel Escalante of Enjambre Producciones in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona, with production and photography handled by him along with Petter Lettocha and José Casillas. When interviewed, Muñiz expained {{the concept of the}} visual, [...] " [...] We were very moved by {{the idea of having a}} story of a long-distance virtual and sentimental relationship that is carried out through virtual reality: one in Mexico and the other one in Barcelona. Everything begins [...] when I invariably connect with my partner (Alexandra Stan) through a virtual reality system in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> a super romance and where we see each other in different locations in Mexico City and Barcelona." ...|$|E
500|$|Out of the ruts and {{the ways}} of its village, Selborne {{fashioned}} a new natural history. [...] It spoke simply, with a human voice. [...] But it looked profoundly. [...] It pioneered a way for students of nature who wished, as White did, not to roam the high Arctic or far Pacific but to fathom their own terrain. [...] It offered a wide world to anyone willing to dig deep. [...] Selborne said: [...] watch narrowly, skim close to the ground. [...] It whispered, hushed, what Thoreau would later broadcast: [...] "We are acquainted with a mere pellicle of the globe on <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live.</b> [...] Most have not delved six feet beneath the surface, nor leaped as many above it. [...] We know not where we are." [...] In those words, as in all Walden, Thoreau may have had in mind the village of Selborne and the Reverend Gilbert White--the town reached only by ruts running well beneath the surface, the man whose book had leapt the ruts to round the globe.|$|E

[This was {{composed}} while pacing {{to and fro}} between the Hall of Coleorton, then rebuilding, and the principal Farmhouse of the Estate, in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> for nine or ten months.

60|$|In {{spite of}} the reign of fear under <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived,</b> the Folk were always great laughers. We had the sense of humor. Our merriment was Gargantuan. It was never restrained. There was nothing half way about it. When a thing was funny we were convulsed with {{appreciation}} of it, and the simplest, crudest things were funny to us. Oh, we were great laughers, I can tell you.|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} time, I {{was not only}} reading many books besides Thackeray's, but I was {{studying}} to get a smattering of several languages as well as I could, with or without help. I could now manage Spanish fairly well, and I was sending on to New York for authors in that tongue. I do not remember how I got {{the money to buy}} them; to be sure it was no great sum; but it must have been given me out of the sums we were all working so hard {{to make up for the}} debt, and the interest on the debt (that is always the wicked pinch for the debtor!), we had incurred in the purchase of the newspaper <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> by, and the house <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> in. I spent no money on any other sort of pleasure, and so, I suppose, it was afforded me the more readily; but I cannot really recall the history of those acquisitions on its financial side. In any case, if the sums I laid out in literature could not have been comparatively great, the excitement attending the outlay was prodigious.|$|R

2500|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the Maldives is the island's second main industry. According to national tradition {{in the words of}} former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, [...] "Fishing is the lifeblood of our nation, it is inborn.

Fishing, and our country and its people, [...] one and shall remain inseparable forever." ...|$|E

Why should I blame you because you won my heart? Let me sooner blame the sea on <b>which</b> <b>we</b> floated, the beach where we walked, the house in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived,</b> and the Destiny that brought us together. I am proud and glad to love you, dear, but I am not so selfish as to wish to ruin you: Geoffrey--I had rather die." ...|$|R
50|$|We {{were told}} once {{that the land}} in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> was white man's land. We were told we could buy from the white man, a white man could take {{transfer}} for us. The tribe determined to buy land and all contributed to buy chief's, i.e., Mokgatle Mokgatle's kraal. Then it was allowed that any petty chief should buy themselves ground. The chief Mokgatle said those {{who were able to}} do so could. My father was there and he told me.|$|R
60|$|We {{always knew}} when these {{disorders}} had set in, we {{knew all the}} signs but no medicine availed to stop their progress. Each attack ran its course in spite of nurse and drug whilst I raged helplessly and Zulime grew hollow-eyed with anxious midnight vigil. Death was a never-absent hovering shadow when those bitter winter winds were blowing, and realizing this I came to hate the great desolate city in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived,</b> and to long with the most passionate ardor for the coming of April's sun.|$|R

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of the early twenty-first century, the collage techniques of Votre Faust—especially in conjunction with contemporaneous statements by Pousseur about the [...] "information age" [...] in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and the general acceptance of a collective network of creation—are seen as a [...] "prescient commentary on what we have come to call 'postmodern pastiche,' in which different historical registers and styles are mingled in a single work" [...]|$|E

For builders and visitors alike, nuclear power plants will be considered the cathedrals of the 20th century. Their syncretism mingles the conscious and the unconscious, religious fulfilment and industrial achievement, the limitations of uses of materials and boundless artistic inspiration, utopia come true and the continued search for harmony.|$|E
40|$|I have {{compiled}} a raw collection of poetry {{that speaks to}} the obstacles and disturbances my mother’s incarceration has imparted unto me. Much of the content involves worries and uncertainties I faced during her multiple arrests, the conditions in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> prior to her arrest, and particular coping mechanisms I utilized during the entire process—a process that is life-long. Prior to the poetry I have amassed a brief introduction that speaks to themes throughout my writing as well as different contextual literature that deals with the effects maternal incarceration has on children...|$|R
40|$|I {{was born}} in New York City in 1926, four years after my parents and my brother {{migrated}} to the United States {{from the city of}} Odessa in Russia. Although they arrived in New York penniless, my parents scraped together enough savings to establish the first of several small businesses just after I was born.

2500|$|Conservative Judaism {{strongly}} {{supports the}} use of science as {{the proper way to}} learn about the physical world in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and thus encourages its adherents {{to find a way to}} understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of scientific research. The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists.

2500|$|This {{pattern of}} debate is {{found among the}} {{earliest}} Greek philosophers, known as the pre-Socratics, who provided alternative answers to the same question found in the myths of their neighbors: [...] "How did the ordered cosmos in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> come to be?" [...] But although the question is much the same, their answers and their attitude towards the answers is markedly different. [...] As reported by such later writers as Aristotle, their explanations tended to center on the material source of things.|$|E
6000|$|The {{quiet time}} passed, in the by-street in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived.</b> The outer stir and tumult of Parisian life ran its daily course around us, unnoticed and unheard. Steadily, though slowly, Eustace gained strength. The doctors, with {{a word or}} two of caution, left him almost entirely to me. [...] "You are his physician," [...] they said; [...] "the happier you make him, the sooner he will recover." [...] The quiet, {{monotonous}} round of my new life was far from wearying me. I, too, wanted repose--I had no interests, no pleasures, out of my husband's room.|$|R
60|$|The {{village in}} <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> {{contained}} a goodly {{number of families}} of high standing and comfortable fortune. It was a village of well-kept and well-shaded streets, of close-cut grass, with no litter on the sidewalks. Our house {{was one of the}} best in the place, and since I had come of age I had greatly improved it. I had a fair inheritance from my mother, and this my grandmother desired me to expend without reference to what I was receiving and would receive from her. To her son's son would come ultimately everything that she possessed.|$|R
60|$|In this thankful frame I {{continued}} all {{the remainder}} of my time; and the conversation which employed the hours between Friday and me was such, as made the three years <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>lived</b> there together perfectly and completely happy, if any such thing as complete happiness {{can be found in}} a sublunary state. The savage was now a good Christian, a much better than I; though I have reason to hope, and bless God for it, that we were equally penitent, and comforted restored penitents: we had here the Word of God to read, and no farther off from his Spirit to instruct than if we had been in England.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the legal}} drama Boston Legal, Alan Shore quotes Adlai Stevenson's Nature of Patriotism speech when he defends {{a client who}} has {{withheld}} her taxes to protest {{the current state of}} America. He says, [...] "The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and fear breeds repression. Too often sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to the freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism." [...] What has changed now, he argues, is that the cloak has morphed into anti-terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin {{demonstrates}} the novel’s distinct nature by contrasting {{it with the}} epic. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique {{in that it is}} able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.|$|E

This [...] "ideal average" [...] can serve as a guide to examining the societies in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live...</b> but the two are not the same, something the disciples of the [...] "tendency of the rate of profit to fall" [...] school do not seem to grasp." ...|$|E
