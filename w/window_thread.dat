25|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} the 'Bridge' banknotes was initiated in 2006 by the Danish National Bank. The {{theme of the}} new banknotes is Danish bridges and the surrounding landscapes, or details from these landscapes. Danish artist Karin Birgitte Lund has chosen to interpret this theme in two ways: bridges as links between various parts of Denmark and as links between {{the past and the}} present. The present is represented by the bridges, the past by five distinctive prehistoric objects found near the bridges. Among the new security features is a <b>window</b> <b>thread</b> ("Motion") with a moving wave pattern. Another feature is a new, sophisticated hologram that reflects light in different colors. The new banknotes also have the traditional security features such as the watermark and the hidden security thread.|$|E

5000|$|Lacking fork or a high {{performance}} way to recreate that functionality, Hamilton uses the <b>Windows</b> <b>threads</b> facilities instead. [...] When a new thread is created, it runs {{within the same}} process space and it shares all of the process state. If one thread changes the current directory or the contents of memory, it's changed for all the threads. It's much cheaper to create a thread than a process but there's no isolation between them. To recreate the missing isolation of separate processes, the threads cooperate to share resources using locks.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. After {{the virtual}} NC {{real-time}} machining process control technology is studied, we design the NC code interpreter using the pipeline control method of overlapped resources in this paper. In {{order to improve}} the availability of interpreter, the design adopts the function pointer array and expression evaluation algorithm. By using two methods, the scalability is enhanced. Also the versatility is improved by using keywords information table to some extent. The system achieves a straight line and arc of the trajectory interpolation by the digital sampling algorithm and makes the efficiency improved by using RCS communication mechanism, <b>windows</b> <b>thread</b> and timing mechanism...|$|R

The high-denomination notes of PHP100, PHP200, PHP500 and PHP 1000 were modified with anti-counterfeiting measures including a <b>windowed</b> security <b>thread</b> and iridescent band in 2001 and 2002.|$|R
25|$|The new {{security}} features were: a <b>windowed</b> security <b>thread</b> (with the notes' denominations in microprinting), watermarks, microprinting, intaglio printing (viewing-angle dependent visibility {{as well as}} a Braille representation of the notes denomination), colour-shifting ink (on the DM 500 and 1000 denominations), a see-through register and ultraviolet-visible security features.|$|R
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as <b>windowed</b> <b>thread</b> and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that make it very hard to copy.|$|R

50|$|Several new {{security}} features have {{been incorporated into}} this series. Microprinting, <b>windowed</b> security <b>threads,</b> perfect registration devices and lithographic printing have been included. The NT$2,000 was initially the only banknote to feature a holographic patch, being the highest denomination banknote in public circulation. This feature has since been extended to NT$500 and NT$1,000 banknotes, which now include a holographic strip.|$|R

40|$|Developing {{software}} for networked applications is hard and developing reusable {{software for}} networked applications is even harder. First, {{there are the}} complexities inherent to distributed systems, such as optimally mapping application services onto hardware nodes, synchronizing service initialization, and ensuring availability while masking partial failures. These complexities can stymie even experienced software developers because they arise from fundamental challenges {{in the domain of}} network programming. Unfortunately, developers must master the accidental complexities, such as low-level and non-portable programming interfaces and the use of function-oriented design techniques that require tedious and error-prone revisions as requirements and/or platforms evolve. These complexities arise largely from limitations with the software tools and techniques applied historically by developers of networked software. Despite the use of object-oriented technologies in many domains, such as graphical user interfaces and productivity tools, much networked software still uses C-level operating system (OS) application programmatic interfaces (APIs), such as the UNIX socket API or the <b>Windows</b> <b>threading</b> API. Many accidental complexities of networked programmin...|$|R
5|$|Other {{security}} features include lithographic print (the resulting background hinders camera counterfeiting), anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, asymmetrical serial numbers and <b>windowed</b> security <b>threads</b> (thin ribbons {{woven into the}} paper). Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other {{security features}} that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.|$|R
40|$|This final thesis {{describes}} the currently available processes for testing security threads in banknote papers. The currency market has generally {{two types of}} security <b>threads,</b> embedded and <b>window</b> <b>threads.</b>   It is generally important to optimize the adhesive used. This requires a test method with good precision and low operator independence. By achieving and using good test methods the process of evaluating a new products pros and cons {{can be done with}} higher precision. The thread adhesion properties are of great importance when developing new adhesion systems. The main reason for testing the threads adhesion is to verify that the thread cannot be removed in an intact form from the banknote but also for product development processes.   The current test methods were developed by introducing new parameters and sample preparations specifications. The data evaluation system was also upgraded.   The measurement of thread adhesion vs. position in CD and vs. time showed expected results. A new and more reliable test method was implemented and evaluated and was together with the improved current method able to detect same properties independently...|$|R

5000|$|The {{main issue}} {{with this type}} of rootkit is that hidden {{processes}} are still able to run despite various context switches. In a <b>Windows</b> scheduler, <b>threads</b> are segregated to perform tasks, not processes. Rather, a thread calls multiple processes during a given time frame. This process is controlled by the round-robin nature of the scheduler and threads are put on idle to allow other threads to be active. Even though a process becomes invisible to the task manager, the process still runs concurrently with the system because the threads are active. [...] This makes detecting hidden processes created by the rootkit extremely difficult.|$|R
25|$|The $20, $50, and $100 notes {{introduce}} watermark {{security features}} {{for the first}} time on Canadian currency since the four-dollar Dominion notes; they also boast significantly expanded holographic security features. Also among the new features are a <b>windowed</b> colour-shifting <b>thread</b> woven into the paper, a see-through number, and enhanced fluorescence under ultraviolet lighting. These features are designed to help Canadians protect themselves by detecting counterfeit notes. All post-2001 series notes also include the EURion constellation, on both sides of the note. The new notes have a tactile feature, which is a series of raised dots (but not Braille) in the upper right corner on the face of each note to aid the visually impaired in identifying currency denominations.|$|R

50|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90 grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other textile fibres. Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: {{it is much more}} resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).Most banknotes are made using the mould made process in which a watermark and thread is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements.

40|$|Clusters of industry-standard multiprocessors are {{emerging}} as a competitive alternative for large-scale parallel computing. However, these systems have several disadvantages over large-scale multiprocessors, including complex thread scheduling and increased susceptibility to failure. This paper describes the design and implementation of two user-level mechanisms in the Brazos parallel programming environment that address these issues on clusters of multiprocessors running <b>Windows</b> NT: <b>thread</b> migration and checkpointing. These mechanisms offer several benefits: (1) The ability to tolerate the failure of multiple computing nodes with minimal runtime overhead and short recovery time. (2) The ability to add and remove computing nodes while applications continue to run, simplifying scheduled maintenance operations and facilitating load balancing. (3) The ability to tolerate power failures by performing a checkpoint before shutdown or by migrating computation threads to other stable nodes. Br [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Powerful desktop {{multiprocessor}} systems {{based on}} the Intel Architecture (iA) offer a formidable alternative to traditional scientific/engineering workstations for commercial application developers at an attractive costperformance ratio. However, the lack of adequate compiler and runtime library support for multithreading and parallel processing on Windows NT* makes it difficult or impossible to fully exploit the performance advantage of these multiprocessor systems. In this paper we describe the design, development, and initial performance results of the Illinois-Intel Multithreading Library (IML), which aims at providing an efficient and powerful (in terms of types of parallelism it supports) API for multithreaded application developers.
