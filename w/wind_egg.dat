50|$|A cock egg is {{most often}} a pullet's first effort, {{produced}} before her laying mechanism is fully ready. In a mature hen, a <b>wind</b> <b>egg</b> is unlikely, but can occur if a bit of reproductive tissue breaks away, stimulating the egg-producing glands to treat it as a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This has occurred if, instead of a yolk, the egg contains a small particle of grayish tissue. This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl, including chickens (both standard and bantams), guineafowl, and Japanese (Coturnix) quail.|$|E

5000|$|Additionally, it {{has been}} shown that the weather has a large impact on the eggs of P. rapae. [...] The main issues with the weather are that strong <b>winds</b> can blow <b>eggs</b> from the leaves and strong rains can drown the caterpillars.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} other Manorina species {{cooperative}} and colonial breeding is common, but breeding has also been recorded in isolated pairs. Pair breeding attempts without helpers have a higher failure rate. Breeding has been recorded throughout the year, but is most common August through October, and multiple clutches are common. The nest is a standard cup or bowl nest built into the fork of a tree with good cover. It is built of woven twigs and grasses and a thick soft interior lining often of wool. It is similar, but more substantive than the nest of the noisy miner. Clutch size is typically three or four eggs, but there are recordings of both two and five eggs. Eggs are pink-buff eggs with spots concentrated on the larger end. Females typically do all the incubation, but males have been recorded incubating in strong <b>wind.</b> <b>Eggs</b> hatch after an incubation period 15-16 day. Both parents and any available helpers will feed young in the nest. Up to seven birds have been observed at nests. Helpers are unstudied in yellow-throated miners, but are generally young or unmated males in both bell miners and noisy miners. Nests can be parasitized by either the pallid cuckoo or common koel. Parasitism by pallid cuckoos has been observed to {{be as high as}} 12%.|$|R
500|$|The male Colostethus subpunctatus, a tiny frog, {{protects the}} egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log. When the eggs hatch, the male {{transports}} the tadpoles on his back, stuck there by a mucous secretion, to a temporary pool where he dips {{himself into the}} water and the tadpoles drop off. The male midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) <b>winds</b> <b>egg</b> strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks. He keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch, he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus spp.) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings; however, this stage was never observed before the species became extinct. The tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply. The pouched frog (Assa darlingtoni) lays eggs on the ground. When they hatch, the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs. The aquatic Surinam toad (Pipa pipa) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis. The granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family Dendrobatidae. Its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch, the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water-filled crevice such as the [...] of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad. The female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles.|$|R
5|$|Mayflies are {{distributed}} {{all over the}} world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by <b>wind,</b> and <b>eggs</b> may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the Neotropic ecozone, while the Holarctic has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single bioregion. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.|$|R

Data were obtained from wake traverse measurements downstream of the cascade using pneumatic probes and from blade surface pressure measurements. Additionally total pressure distributions and side wall boundary layers in the upstream flow field were measured with a pitot probe. The influence of side wall boundary layers, especially the displacement effects on the two dimensional flow field of a turbine cascade will be shown and a correction for these effects will be given. The results from EGG and SB 301 will also be compared with those from other European cascade wind tunnels...|$|R

60|$|But {{perfection}} of structure and adaptation to purpose, are not universal characteristics of birds' nests, {{since there are}} decided imperfections in the nesting of many birds which are quite compatible with our present theory, but are hardly so with that of instinct, {{which is supposed to}} be infallible. The Passenger pigeon of America often crowds the branches with its nests till they break, and the ground is strewn with shattered nests, eggs, and young birds. Rooks' nests are often so imperfect that during high <b>winds</b> the <b>eggs</b> fall out; but the Window-Swallow is the most unfortunate in this respect, for White, of Selborne, informs us that he has seen them build, year after year, in places where their nests are liable to be washed away by a heavy rain and their young ones destroyed.|$|R
40|$|In Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, nehu (Hawaiian anchovy, Encrasicholina purpurea) {{eggs were}} found {{primarily}} {{in areas where}} water depth was > 10 - 12 m and were infrequently encountered near reefs, shorelines, or other shallow areas. Eggs were usually most abundant near the centers of {{one or both of}} the two large basins; the more enclosed southern basin usually accounted for the majority of the total eggs present. Nehu eggs were present throughout the year, but abundance was usually higher between July and February or March. There was considerable shorter time-scale variation in egg abundance, but there was no apparent underlying periodicity other than the annual cycle. Egg abundance was poorly correlated with measured environmental factors; the only potential relationship was that abundance tended to be low during the season of strong northeast trade <b>winds.</b> <b>Egg</b> abundance in Kaneohe Bay was poorly correlated with abundance in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the other major area where nehu are found. Total numbers of eggs present in Kaneohe Bay reached about 109 during peaks. Based on available knowledge of nehu fecundity, spawning frequency, and sex ratio, the biomass of spawning females was about 2 t and that of all adults about 8 t during peaks of egg abundance. Catches of nehu by the skipjack tuna baitfishery were poorly correlated with estimates of adult standing crop, and most variation in catch was attributed to variation in effort. Annual catches, however, were about five times the highest estimates of adult biomass, and several monthly catches exceeded 8 t. The results indicate that postmetamorphic nehu move into and out of and perhaps between spawning and nursery areas such as Kaneohe Bay and that the total population is much larger than that present in enclosed areas at any given time. Consequently, further studies of the population dynamics of nehu and their interaction with the fishery should be conducted on an island-wide and probably archipelagowide basis...|$|R
50|$|Kerguelen petrels breed colonially on remote islands; colonies {{are present}} on Gough Island in the Atlantic Ocean, and Marion Island, Prince Edward Island, Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Island in the Indian Ocean.

The burrows usually face {{away from the}} prevailing <b>wind.</b> A single <b>egg</b> is laid per breeding season; the egg is unusually round for the family. The egg is incubated by both parents for 49 days. After hatching the chick fledges after 60 days.|$|R

40|$|Within a European {{research}} project experimental studies were performed concerning {{the determination of}} the film cooling efficiency on the pressure side of trailing edges of high pressure turbine blades. The experiments were carried out at the linear cascade <b>wind</b> tunnel (<b>EGG)</b> of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Göttingen. The thermodynamic investigations were performed using the same cascade geometries and trailing edge configurations as for the aerodynamic measurements. Two different trailing edge geometries with coolant ejection were investigated. The first configuration was equipped with a pressure side cutback while for the second configuration the pressure side film cooling was realized by a row of cylindrical holes. The determination of the surface temperatures was done by using a combination of IR-thermography and thermocouples. Preliminary studies showed the feasibility to use metallic surfaces of the suction side of the adjacent blade as a mirror for IR-thermography. Thus it is possible to observe the pressure side near the trailing edge of interest by means of an infrared camera. The camera was mounted outside of the cascade’s free stream ensuring no influence to the aerodynamic boundary conditions. Up to seven flush mounted thermocouples {{on each side of the}} trailing edge were used for an in-situ calibration of the infrared pictures and thermal loss calculations. The distributions and averaged values of the film cooling efficiency are in agreement with aerodynamic measurements [9]. The results for the cutback configuration with 0. 5...|$|R
