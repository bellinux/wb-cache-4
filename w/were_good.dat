5|$|Historically, {{solvent-based}} lubricants, such as {{diesel fuel}} and kerosene, were commonly used. These <b>were</b> <b>good</b> at releasing the {{part from the}} dies, but a small explosion occurred during each shot, {{which led to a}} build-up of carbon on the mold cavity walls. However, they were easier to apply evenly than water-based lubricants.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Kon {{released}} the 13-episode television series Paranoia Agent, in which Kon revisits {{the theme of}} the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional social themes. The series was created from an abundance of unused ideas for stories and arrangements that Kon felt <b>were</b> <b>good</b> but did not fit into any of his projects.|$|E
5|$|While {{the quality}} of the game's {{graphics}} was lauded and sales <b>were</b> <b>good</b> during its month of release, the control was received negatively by critics, who felt it was awkward and unintuitive. Nevertheless, the game spawned two sequels, released in 2001 and 2003.|$|E

5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} Preston on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury {{was the second}} son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, n√©e Steel. Growing up in Prahran, Kingsbury became friends with Allen Avery when he was five years old. The two often raced billycarts down the hilly streets, and would remain lifelong friends. Kingsbury {{attended}} Windsor State School as a child, and his results <b>were</b> <b>good</b> enough to earn a scholarship at Melbourne Technical College. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business, a job he disliked.|$|E
5|$|Cattle raising was {{the major}} {{industry}} in the 1840s with sheep becoming predominant in the 1860s. At this time many Victorians settled in the Riverina to breed sheep and cattle to feed the miners {{taking part in the}} Victorian Gold Rush. The herds were considered inferior at first, but these pastures <b>were</b> <b>good</b> for stock, and the land which seemed a desert was actually good fattening country.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the game's {{graphics}} <b>were</b> <b>good,</b> enjoyed Uematsu's score, and several praised the concepts behind the Job and leveling systems. Alongside this, unanimous criticism was laid against the gameplay pace, its convoluted interface, bugs and glitches, and {{the slow pace of}} the story. It was generally seen as a great disappointment both as an MMORPG and a mainline entry in the Final Fantasy series. Later, as part of an interview concerning the game's later development, 1UP.com commented that subsequent patches and overhauls had turned the game into something more playable.|$|E

Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about {{the seriousness of the}} situation on Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for the movement {{of the rest of the}} 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there <b>were</b> <b>good</b> beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} <b>were</b> <b>good</b> and bad points to {{working closely with}} Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, two {{producers}} optioned {{the rights}} to create a live-action film based on Metroid, but the rights expired. John Woo acquired the rights a few years later, and Lion Rock Productions was to produce and release the film before 2006, but it either has been canceled or remains in limbo. Sakamoto has expressed no interest in working on a Metroid movie himself, but stated he could support such a project by Ryuji Kitaura, director of the CG scenes in Other M, if the concept and methodologies <b>were</b> <b>good</b> enough.|$|E
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming.

5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two dinghies. They <b>were</b> <b>good</b> sea boats, but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe roll. The cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast's {{relations}} with his cathedral chapter <b>were</b> <b>good,</b> and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It {{was not until}} late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple archdeaconries, which appears to have happened in 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and precentor for the cathedral chapter, {{as well as the}} first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of Bartholomew Iscanus, who was bishop from 1161‚Äì1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the cathedral chapter relaxed its communal living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the canons of the cathedral chapter quit living in a communal dormitory.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations <b>were</b> <b>good.</b> Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players <b>were</b> <b>good,</b> but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield‚Äîquarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic‚Äîas the greatest in history. While he believed the Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E
5|$|Babrak Karmal (Dari/, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 ‚Äì 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan {{politician}} who was installed {{as president of}} Afghanistan by the USSR when they invaded in 1979. Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University. When the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to Marxism by Mir Akbar Khyber during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government. He eventually became {{the leader of the}} Parcham faction. When the PDPA split in 1967, the Parcham-faction established a Parcham PDPA, while their ideological nemesis, the Khalqs, established a Khalqist PDPA. Under Karmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in Mohammad Daoud Khan's rise to power, and his subsequent regime. While relations <b>were</b> <b>good</b> at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977. The PDPA took power in the 1978 Saur Revolution.|$|E
