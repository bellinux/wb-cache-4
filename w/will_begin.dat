At present Cardiff Blues pay Cardiff Athletic Club rent of around £115,000 per annum, however this would nearly double to around £200,000.|$|E
5|$|Should {{the human}} race become extinct, then the various {{features}} assembled by humanity <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to decay. The largest structures have an estimated decay half-life of about 1,000years. The last surviving structures would most likely be open pit mines, large landfills, major highways, wide canal cuts, and earth-fill flank dams. A few massive stone monuments like the pyramids at the Giza Necropolis or the sculptures at Mount Rushmore may still survive in some form after a million years.|$|E
5|$|Since 2008, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} {{has undergone}} studies for Select Bus Service (SBS) implementation, which would convert the Q52 and Q53 into {{bus rapid transit}} routes.

5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces {{at the beginning of}} the game. The player <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark) whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> in eastern Europe. The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions. Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units. The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{score system}} {{is based on}} a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|A {{pedestrian}} safety project {{aimed to}} reduce jaywalking will install a dune-style fence in the median of MD 528, {{with the first}} phase to take place between 41st Street/Convention Center Drive and MD 90. Construction on the first phase was expected to begin in January 2017 and be finished by Memorial Day of that year, but was delayed after the only bid came in over the $4.5 million budget. Construction on the first phase, which will run between 26th Street and MD 90, <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> in October 2017 and be completed in May 2018. Future phases will build the fence between 9th Street and 26th Street and between MD 90 and the Delaware border.|$|E

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact {{white dwarf star}} after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|At Fort Marlene, Mulder {{runs into}} the sickly looking Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), who tells Mulder that she was {{subjected}} to experiments by the Syndicate to create a black oil vaccine and that the colonists <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> colonization if they learn of Cassandra's existence as an alien-human hybrid. Scully, {{with help from the}} Lone Gunmen, looks into Fowley's personal history and informs Mulder that Fowley has been collecting data on alien abductees and traveling to Tunisia every week, although there is no trace of her activities in FBI records. Although Mulder still trusts Fowley, he goes to her apartment to confront her.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the regular}} season, the team which has the most points is awarded the title of regular season champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between the regular season and postseason. As with the regular season, the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} regular season and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the regular season will receive a home-ice advantage and the series <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E
5|$|Enemy monsters {{inhabit the}} levels, but the player can crush them by {{flattening}} impassable blocks against them.

Danny wakes from his mental explorations if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a timer, but the C.R.U.S.H. device reinserts him at the start of the level or the last checkpoint Danny passed.|$|E
5|$|First {{designated}} in 1972, Highway427 follows {{what was}} originally a two lane roadway known as Highway27, {{as well as}} a short freeway north of Highway401 known as the Airport Expressway. Both routes were upgraded throughout the 1950s and 1960s, eventually becoming intertwined into the present configuration in 1972. The freeway was extended north from Pearson Airport to Highway7 over the following twenty years. A short arterial extension was later built, though this section is designated as York Regional Road99 (Zenway Boulevard).

5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the UT Board of Regents {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a new 13 story hospital that will be located next to John Sealy Hospital.
