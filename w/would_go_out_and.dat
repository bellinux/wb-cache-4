She and Olga, who was also given her own regiment, <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> inspect the soldiers regularly, an occasion they greatly enjoyed. When she was nearly fourteen, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her {{to get out of}} bed in time to go to a review so she could watch a soldier she was infatuated with. [...] "I would like so much to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn," [...] she wrote to Alexandra on 20 April 1911.

Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although initially, {{the album}} was not meant for release and Faraz did not {{want it to be}} more than an experiment. [...] "The album was good but I felt {{strongly}} about re-doing it. Not revamping but redoing it," [...] he says. However, Akhtar Qayyum went on to strike a record deal with Sound Master and {{the album was}} released in 1999. [...] "I had no idea that Akhtar <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> release it, which he did. It did well but I wasn't expecting the album to hit the market," [...] says Faraz. This led to relations between Akhtar and Faraz restrain and Akhtar soon left the band due to musical differences.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> get it done".|$|E

Over time when her husband physically abused her over some imagined wrong-doing, she <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do it. She started drinking and describes one drinking session in her autobiography where she was unconscious of what took place. She found herself in a village where Joshi, {{one of the men}} she had been drinking with brought her as his third wife. She stayed virtually imprisoned there for three years, till she was able to smuggle a letter out to her husband.

The album was {{certified}} gold by the RIAA with 500,000 copies shipped as of February 1, 2008. Regarding the album's sales in 2010, Corgan stated that the album [...] "went gold. But people didn't listen to it. I could tell that people weren't listening to the album. In the past if you put out an album, people at least knew the first song. We <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> play [...] "Doomsday Clock" [...] and I could tell that they hadn't even listened to it. I don't {{view it as a}} gross disappointment. It's disappointing to me that what I was trying to communicate didn't get the chance to be communicated." ...|$|E
2500|$|Series co-creator Dan Povenmire {{attributed}} the genesis {{for the show}} to his childhood in Mobile, Alabama. Povenmire recalled that his mother told him [...] "never to waste a day of summer". Meanwhile, the show's other co-creator, Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh {{grew up in a}} large, blended family. Similar to Povenmire, Marsh spent his summers exploring and taking part in several different activities in order to have fun. The two met while working as layout artists on The Simpsons in the 1990s. Povenmire commented that [...] "We were always laughing at the same jokes". The two became a writing team on the Nickelodeon animated series Rocko's Modern Life. They began working on Phineas and Ferb around 1992, while still working together at Nickelodeon. The two had become friends due to their mutual tastes and interests. Citing their childhood, they wanted to incorporate summer vacations, a time when the two <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> do something constructive. They spent sixteen years pitching it to four different networks, including Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, all of which kept shooting it down due to its complexity. When Povenmire landed a pitch with Disney, despite being unsure at first, the series was accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Diana, Steve and Joe Atkinson (Norman Burton), a {{weathered}} IADC agent, received their orders from a [...] "Charlie's Angels-like" [...] character who is heard but never seen. Diana and Steve <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> work the field while Joe assisted from the office. The Atkinson character was dropped after the ninth episode of this season, and Steve {{was given a}} promotion, becoming IADC Director, and Diana's boss, in the process. This promotion for Steve Trevor meant that Lyle Waggoner was seen less in subsequent episodes {{for the remainder of}} the series' run. In this season, the computer IRAC (Information Retrieval Associative Computer), more informally known as [...] "Ira," [...] was introduced: its first appearance is in season 2, episode 1, where Diana introduces her Diana Prince identity into its records, over IRAC's protests. Ira was the IADC's super-intelligent computer, who deduces that Diana Prince is really Wonder Woman, although he never shares this information with anyone, except Diana herself. Saundra Sharp joined the cast as Eve, Steve's assistant (the job held by Diana at the start of the season). Towards the end of the season, in the episode [...] "IRAC is Missing," [...] a small mobile robot called Rover was added for comic relief. An offshoot of IRAC who performs duties such as delivering coffee and sorting mail, Rover speaks with a high-pitched voice, occasionally makes [...] "Beep Beep" [...] sounds and, like IRAC, is aware that Wonder Woman's secret identity is Diana Prince.|$|E

5000|$|The idea of {{the rodeo}} was born in 1964. The Rodeo, a {{collaboration}} between prisoners and prison employees, began in 1965.
