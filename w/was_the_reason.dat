5|$|As Ziva and Tony {{drive home}} from the airport, she divulges the reason for her resentment of the new director: Orli Elbaz <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for her parents' divorce. She {{discloses}} that she had always {{believed that it was}} a political strategy on Elbaz's part in attempt to advance her rank in Mossad, though she now thinks that it is possible that Elbaz had loved Eli. When she adds that she believes that she would be a different person were it not for Elbaz, Tony expresses thankfulness that things occurred the way they did.|$|E
5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets behaving in such a mature manner. Bernsten said this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E

Gopalayya describes that opposing Shambhu’s decision to join freedom movement may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> {{for him to}} leave the place. At the same time Shankaramma also blames herself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for his riddance. Each character explores their hidden feelings in their own way with Shivaramu.|$|R

5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the suspension is debatable.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan campaigned {{heavily on}} the {{platform}} that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s. During this time Carter's defense secretary, Harold Brown, announced the stealth bomber project, apparently implying that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the B-1 cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Filming for series 3 {{began in}} November 2012, with an airing date {{scheduled}} for May 2013. In November Jones and Sharp were photographed filming {{on location in}} Manchester for the series. As the fourth series had a different air date (its television broadcast began in September, unlike May for the three previous series) it became the first series not to be filmed in the winter months. A longer break in production between series 3 and 4 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that the fourth series was instead filmed in summer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century Białystok was an {{important}} center for light industry, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the substantial growth of the city's population. The tradition continued with many garment factories established in the twentieth century, such as Fasty {{in the district of}} Bacieczki. However, after the fall of communism in 1989 many of these factories faced severe problems and subsequently closed down.|$|E
5|$|Plume {{harvesting}} {{became a}} dangerous business. The Audubon Society became {{concerned with the}} amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, Guy Bradley, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in Flamingo within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Rodriguez {{provoked}} controversy {{after being}} {{stopped by the}} police for {{driving under the influence}} a few weeks before her character was killed, leading to speculation that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for her death.

5|$|The {{army was}} well {{organised}} and this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for PulakeshinII's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps {{and a powerful}} navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatabala when referring to the powerful Chalukya armies.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{there was}} already a {{movement}} within the Army General Staff to have Matsui removed from his post. Reports of the atrocities in Nanking had reached the Japanese government and some within the Army General Staff blamed Matsui for mishandling the crisis and causing Japan international embarrassment. Some even wanted him court-martialed for negligence. Even so, the Japanese government was not planning on dismissing Matsui solely because of the Nanking Massacre. The Foreign Ministry was displeased by anti-Western statements Matsui had made after becoming CCAA commander, including his comment {{that he did not}} recognize the neutrality of foreign concessions in Shanghai, and the Army General Staff was concerned about Matsui's severe personality conflicts with his subordinate commanders, which were interfering with the chain of command. The Army Minister Hajime Sugiyama told General Shunroku Hata that the inability of Matsui and his subordinates to coordinate and cooperate with one another <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> he was being removed.|$|E
5|$|Cid {{informs the}} group, {{when they reach}} Lindblum, that Kuja is Brahne's arms dealer. Believing him to be {{from one of the}} other continents, {{normally}} inaccessible by airship, the party travels through a tunnel with Quina to the Outer Continent. There they meet Eiko, discover a village of black mages, and find the Iifa Tree, which produces a fighting-stimulant called Mist. They learn that Kuja uses Mist to create the Black Mages, and Vivi was a prototype. After stopping the Mist creation, the group meets Amarant, hired by Brahne to capture Garnet, who joins them instead. They also learn that Garnet is originally from the same destroyed village as Eiko, and has the power to summon eidolons, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> she was adopted by Brahne. Brahne and Kuja then reach the Iifa Tree, but Brahne attempts to kill him with an eidolon; Kuja instead takes control over it and destroys her and her army instead.|$|E

5|$|Director Quentin Tarantino {{expressed}} interest in directing an adaptation of Casino Royale, but Eon were not interested.

Later in 2005, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film.|$|E
5|$|During 14April 1912, Titanics radio {{operators}} received six {{messages from}} other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on Titanic {{had begun to}} notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50years (which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why the lookouts were unaware that {{they were about to}} steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.|$|E
5|$|For {{his last}} two starts of the year, Fantastic Light was sent to East Asia.

Despite three successive defeats, Fantastic Light still managed to end {{the season with a}} major victory. In December he was sent to Sha Tin for the Hong Kong Cup and justified favouritism by leading in the straight and staying on strongly to beat Greek Dance and Jim and Tonic. The win earned Fantastic Light top place in the Emirates World Series, a competition in which points were awarded for performances in a number of international races.|$|E

5|$|In December 1852, {{the mill}} complex was valued at £75,000; when George Murray died in 1855, {{two of his}} three sons – James and Benjamin – {{inherited}} the complex. By 1881, A & G Murray had become registered as a limited liability company and the running of it was mostly {{in the hands of}} manager Herbert Dixon, who had joined the company in 1876, as the Murray family played less of a role. Under Dixon the company modernised and used new technology and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for the firm's continued success. The use of new, more efficient technologies resulted in the further reduction of the workforce so that by 1897, A & G Murray only employed 500 people. In 1887, Fireproof Mill and Doubling Mill were leased by A & G Murray Ltd to C E Bennet.|$|E
5|$|In December, after former East German leader Erich Honecker {{was issued}} {{an arrest warrant}} by {{prosecutors}} in Berlin and charged with giving orders to fire on escapees, Snetkov refused to hand over Honecker, who was under Soviet protection at a military hospital. He opposed the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Germany, and stated in multiple early 2000s interviews with Russian military newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda that his opposition to a Soviet pull-out <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for his dismissal from command of the WGF later that month. However, according to a contemporary Izvestia report, he was fired along with deputies after the desertions of a regimental commander and a supply unit leader on 29 November, who took two missiles, three tank shells and other armaments with them. After his dismissal, Snetkov joined the Group of Inspectors General of the Ministry of Defense, traditionally a pre-retirement post for elderly generals.
