40|$|Session 26 : Oral Health ResearchPoster PresentationObjectives: To {{investigate}} the changes <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> {{in patients with}} nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after radiotherapy. Methods: Two hundred forty-two consecutive patients with newly diagnosed NPC were recruited. A <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> device plus daily jaw exercise instructions was prescribed to each patient. Maximum <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> at incisal region was measured at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 after radiotherapy. Multi-way repeated measures ANCOVA {{test was used to}} compare <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> changes over time and between groups (cancer staging, adjuvant chemotherapy and compliance with the jaw exercise). The level of significance was set to be 0. 05. Results: A total of 212 patients completed the study. There was a significant reduction in mean <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> (P< 0. 05) from baseline (48. 5 ± 0. 6 mm) to 2 months (46. 6 ± 0. 6 mm) after radiotherapy. The mean <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> was significantly reduced further (P< 0. 05) at 6 months (42. 1 ± 0. 7 mm) after radiotherapy but it remained stable at 12 months (42. 1 ± 0. 8 mm) after treatment. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy exhibited significant smaller mean <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> after radiotherapy than patients who did not (P< 0. 05).

40|$|Summary: The purpose ofthe {{experiment}} {{was to explore}} relations between jaw and laryngeal functions. The general question was whether laryngeal adduction was affected byjaw <b>opening</b> or by <b>jaw</b> biting. Twelve untrained, vocally healthy male and female adults participated as subjects. Subjects produced repeated to-kens of/A/in each of 12 experimental conditions involving combinations <b>of</b> 3 <b>jaw</b> <b>openings</b> (10 ram, 25 mm, 40 mm), 2 jaw biting pressures (10 kPa, 200 kPa), and 2 fundamental frequencies (conversational and high). For each token, laryngeal adduction was estimated from the electroglottographic closed quo-tient. The most straightforward results were that (1) laryngeal adduction in-creased as <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> increased at the conversational pitch, for all subjects, in-dependent of biting pressure, and (2) laryngeal adduction increased as biting pressure increased, at the conversational pitch, for males, independent <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> Other relations between estimated laryngeal adduction and jaw ma-nipulations were more complex, varying with fundamental frequency and gen-der.

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the relative displacement of the temporomandibular (TM) disc and the mandible during mouth opening. The movement of the TM disc was studied using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) FFE dynamic scan sequence with a customised mono-directional "spreader" device. Six sagittal static images in revolved sections of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) were obtained in various positions <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> from 0 to 50 mm (distance between lower and upper incisors). The results provided a description of the TM disc displacements as a function <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> The anatomical marker movement data was transformed and the motions of the TM disc and the mandible were observed. The displacements of the mandible and TM disc were about 31 mm and 18 mm respectively at mouth opening of 50 mm. The maximum rotation of the mandible was 34. 4 °. While the movement of the mandible has already been published, though only for a small mouth opening, the behaviour of the disc during the same movement has not been well depicted.

40|$|Summary. The {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} determine {{to what extent}} head posture affected the EMG activity <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> (suprahyoid) and <b>jaw</b> closing (masseter) muscles during chewing. The subjects comprised twenty adult males with normal occlusion. The EMG parameters analyzed were: maximal integrated EMG activity; duration, and coordination <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> and closing muscle activity. Recordings were made with the head in three positions: normal upright, inclined forward, and inclined backward. Maximal integrated EMG activity was reduced for the masseter muscle when the head was flexed forward, and for the suprahyoid muscle group when the head was flexed backward. The duration of the masseter chewing phase was reduced when the head was flexed forward and increased when the head was flexed backward. The duration of the suprahyoid chewing phase was unaffected by variation in head position. No absolute reciprocity {{was found between the}} suprahyoid and masseter muscle activity during chewing.

40|$|The {{current study}} employs a {{simultaneous}} cross-system monitoring technique {{to examine the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> on articulatory and vocal behaviours. The {{purpose of the study}} is to determine whether an increased <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> posture can improve speech and voice quality in a variety of phonetic contexts. Participants were 20 healthy non-smoking adults, including 10 New Zealand English (Mean = 36. 5 years, SD = 14) and 10 Mandarin (Mean = 27. 5 years, SD = 9. 3) native speakers, with five females and five males in each group. Participants were asked to say, with and without an exaggerated <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> posture, monosyllabic consonant-vowel (CV) couplets which contained a vowel (/i/, /a/, or /u/) and a consonant selected from the phonemes in their native language. Signals recorded with the acoustic, electroglottographic (EGG), and marker-based video tracking devices were analyzed to yield (i) acoustic measures, including consonant length, fundamental frequency (F 0), percent jitter (%jitter), percent shimmer (%shimmer), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and frequencies of Formants One and Two (F 1 and F 2), (ii) EGG measures, including open quotient and speed quotient, and (iii) maximum jaw displacement. A series of two-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) and repeated measures ANOVAs were conducted on the experimental measures to determine whether there was an effect of task (normal vs. exaggerated <b>jaw</b> <b>opening),</b> language (English vs. Mandarin), consonant, or tone (Tones 1 to 4, for the Mandarin group only). Results showed that an exaggerated <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> posture resulted in an expansion of vowel space (as shown in the F 1 -F 2 plot for vowels /i/, /a/, and /u/), increased F 0, and positive changes in phonatory stability, including decreased %jitter and %shimmer and increased SNR. These findings highlighted the importance <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> manipulation in speech treatment and supported the hypothesis that an open mouth approach was useful for speech and voice enhancement, suggesting that <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> had a universal effect of reducing phonetic complexity.

Participants, aged between 9 and 12 years, included nine normal hearing children (4 females and 5 males) and six children with hearing impairments (3 females and 3 males). Participants were instructed to say the standard word list used for the Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation {{and a list of}} words including each of the vowels /i/, /a/, and /u/, preceded by the consonants /b/, /g/, or /s/ in a CV, CVC or CVCV context. In total, the second word list included 45 words (3 vowels X 3 consonants X 5 trials) and participants were asked to repeat a second time using an open <b>jaw</b> posture. Measures <b>of</b> the acoustic signals included: frequencies of formants one and two (F 1, F 2), fundamental frequency (F 0), percent jitter, percent shimmer, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), vowel length, consonant length, and spectral moments (M 1 and M 2). Vowel spaces, derived from F 1 and F 2, were also analysed. The EGG measures included fundamental frequency, open quotient, and speed quotient. The marker-based facial tracking signals was analyzed to derive the measure <b>of</b> maximum <b>jaw</b> displacement. Individual participants’ measures were submitted to a series of two-way Analysis of Variances (ANOVAs) and the average data for participants in the normal-hearing group to a series of twoway repeated measures ANOVAs.

Method:Jaw and finger motions were recorded using Optotrak. The effects of stress position on jaw-finger coordination were tested across different target positions (near vs. far) and different consonants in the target word (/t/ vs. /p/). Twenty native Portuguese Brazilian speakers participated in the experiment (all conditions).

The apex <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> gesture for the stressed syllable appears synchronized to {{the onset of the}} finger-target alignment period (corresponding to the pointing apex) for 'CVCV words, and with the offset of that period for CV'CV ones. Conclusions:For both stress conditions, the stressed syllable occurs within the finger-target alignment period due to tight finger-jaw coordination. This result is interpreted as an evidence for an anchoring of the speech deictic site (part of speech that shows) in the pointing gesture...|$|R

Design: A Single-Subject Experimental Design (SSED) with ABA - design was used. Three measurements were performed during the baseline phase. During the intervention eight measurements were made; two measurements per week over a period of four weeks. In the final phase, two measurements were carried out, 6 and 9 weeks after the initiation of the study, respectively. Material: Two patients were included in the study. Both recruited from the waiting list at a physiotherapy clinic. One patient has been suffering from temporomandibular pain and reduced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> for 15 months. The second patient had experienced temporomandibular pain repeatedly over several years with occasional clicking in the jaw joint. Both patients completed the study. Method: Treatment consisted of manual traction techniques ad modum Kaltenborn: Intermittent traction for pain relief and traction grade III to increase <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> The patients also performed home exercises. Pain was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) and active <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> was measured with digital calipers category Cocraft 40 - 7541.

CASE REPORT: A 50 -year-old male with a severe painful limitation (12 mm) <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> referred a trauma to the right temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area occurring about 40 days before. Posttraumatic TMJ ankylosis was ruled out on the basis of negative magnetic resonance and cone-beam computerized tomography findings, and the patient underwent treatment with arthrocentesis, botulinum toxin injections, and physiotherapy on the basis of two diagnostic hypotheses, viz., an anchored disk phenomenon or a myofibrotic contracture of the right masseter muscle due to prolonged myospasm. After 4 months, <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> was slightly increased to 23 mm, but limitation and pain persisted. A new CT was performed to investigate for the emerging clinical picture compatible with traumatic myositis ossificans of the right temporalis muscle. Once the diagnosis was confirmed, the patient underwent surgery for coronoidectomy. At the 6 -month follow-up, mouth opening was increased to up to 35 mm and pain was absent. DISCUSSION: It is fundamental that patients suspected of having uncommon clinical pictures leading to mouth opening restriction are promptly referred to specialized centers, where the differential diagnosis process should be based on a comprehensive assessment taking into account for the potential etiologic factors described in the literature...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{examine the}} effect of {{mechanical}} loading on the induction of temporomandibular joint osteoarthrosis (TMJ OA). METHODS: Mechanical stress was applied to the rat TMJ by forced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> 3 hours a day for 5 days. The electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter and digastric muscles was continuously monitored by radio-telemetry. It was characterized by the total time each muscle was active (duty time), the number of bursts, and the average burst length. For histologic analysis, rats were sacrificed before, immediately after, and 3 weeks after the period <b>of</b> forced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> RESULTS: The condylar cartilage revealed OA-like lesions with a {{decrease in the number of}} chondrocytes immediately after forced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> Three weeks later, the OA-like lesions were repaired to some extent. After the forced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening,</b> the duty time of the masseter increased, whereas the duty time of the digastric decreased significantly (P <. 01) at the 5 % activity level. Three weeks later, the masseter duty time had decreased and the digastric duty time had slightly increased, returning to the levels observed before forced <b>jaw</b> <b>opening.</b> CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mechanical overloading of the TMJ induced OA-like lesions with a simultaneous influence on jaw muscle activity, especially at the low activity level. This might imply that muscle activity adapted to reduce the effects of (forced) joint overloading...|$|R

Methods: Eighty American Society of Anesthesiologists classification physical status I or II children were enrolled. After mask induction with sevoflurane with nitrous oxide for 3 minutes, 0. 3 mg/kg of rocuronium was given. Intubation was performed 60 or 90 seconds thereafter.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate contributions of the auditory and somatosensory modalities to speech motor control. In Task I, a sensorimotor adaptation experiment was conducted by perturbing one of these two sensory modalities or both modalities simultaneously. During productions of monosyllabic CVC words, the first formant frequency (F 1) in the auditory feedback was shifted up by a real-time digital processor and/or the extent <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> was increased or decreased with a force field applied by a robotic device (and, thus, the associated somatosensory feedback was perturbed). All eight subjects lowered F 1 in their productions to compensate for the up-shifted F 1 in the feedback signal regardless of whether or not the jaw was perturbed. These adaptive changes in subjects 2 ̆ 7 acoustic output resulted from adjustments in the articulatory movements <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> or tongue. However, adaptation in <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> extent in response to the mechanical perturbation occurred only when no auditory feedback perturbation was applied or when the direction of adaptation to the force was compatible with the direction of adaptation to a simultaneously applied acoustic perturbation. In Tasks II and III, subjects 2 ̆ 7 auditory precision and accuracy for F 1 frequency and somatosensory precision and accuracy for jaw position were estimated using a psychophysical approach (method of adjustment). Correlation analyses showed that the relationships (a) between F 1 adaptation extent and auditory acuity for F 1 and (b) between jaw position adaptation extent and somatosensory acuity were weak and statistically not significant for the present sample size. ^ Overall, findings suggest that, in speech production, sensorimotor adaptation updates the underlying control mechanisms in such a way that vowel-related articulatory movements aim to achieve primarily acoustic goals rather than somatosensory goals. ...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{compare the}} intubating {{conditions}} between inj. Rocuronium and inj. Succinylcholine during rapid sequence intubation in patients posted for emergency surgeries. The primary outcome was excellent intubation conditions. The secondary outcome was acceptable conditions and complications associated with rocuronium. Methods and Material : 60 patients posted for emergency surgeries were randomly divided randomly in to two groups. Intubating conditions at 60 seconds were compared in group-A (inj. succinylcholine 1 mg/kg) and group-B(inj. rocuronium 0. 6 mg/kg), 30 patients in each group. Intubating conditions were judged {{based on the}} scoring <b>of</b> ease <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening,</b> position <b>of</b> the vocal cords and degree of straining after tracheal intubation. Statistical analysis used: Data obtained were be analysed by t-test, chi-square test and fisher exact test wherever applicable. Results: Mean apnoea onset time was 28. 37 sec in group-A whereas it was 41. 13 seconds in group-B. The mean intubation score was 9. 00 ± 00 in group-A and 8. 43 ± 0. 85 in group-B. No side effects were observed in both the groups.

Before, during, and after infusion, the EMG-activity was recorded from the masseter and temporalis muscles with the <b>jaw</b> in each <b>of</b> the three positions. HS induced significantly higher pain-levels than IS (mean VAS: HS: 5. 2 ± 1. 3, IS: 0. 7 ± 0. 2, P < 0. 05). At rest, the EMG-activity in most <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> muscles increased significantly during both infusions (P < 0. 05). At half-maximal opening, the EMG-activity in the infused muscle increased significantly with both HS and IS (P < 0. 05).

In addition, a modeling study compared the articulatory consequences of similar jaw-opening settings in a typical male and a typical female articulatory model. Results Greater <b>jaw</b> <b>openings</b> were found for the female speakers, in particular in the accented condition, where <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> was found to be larger. In line with this finding, the modeling study showed that similar jaw-opening settings in male and female speakers led to differences in pharyngeal constriction, resulting in complete radico-pharyngeal closure in the male model. Conclusion The empirical and modeling findings suggest a possible physiological component in sex-specific differences in speech clarity for low vowels...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{measure the}} oral {{health status of}} {{southern}} Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) survivors 1 - 4 years after radiotherapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 109 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Thirty-eight subjects were NPC survivors, 40 subjects were patients newly diagnosed with NPC and 31 were healthy subjects. Verified clinical examination techniques {{were used to assess}} limitation <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> <b>opening,</b> the presence <b>of</b> mucositis, candidiasis, dental caries, periodontal disease [community periodontal index (CPI) ] including attachment loss (ALoss) and prosthetic status/need. Differences among three groups were tested by chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Relationships between selected clinical variables and radiation parameters were analysed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. RESULTS: The NPC survivors attended for dental treatment more frequently than the other groups (P < 0. 01). NPC survivors had significant xerostomia (92 %, P < 0. 01), trismus (29 %, P < 0. 01), a higher prevalence of clinical candidiasis (24 %, P < 0. 01), a greater DMFT (16. 4 ± 7. 0, P < 0. 01), more decay/filled roots (2. 1 ± 2. 9, P = 0. 01) compared with new NPC patients and controls. No difference was found in CPI, ALoss, prosthetic status and need between groups. Dry mouth and tooth hypersensitivity were the most common oral problems perceived by the NPC survivors. CONCLUSION: Despite having regular dental follow-ups, oral health was compromised in NPC survivors 1 - 4 years postradiotherapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{extremes}} <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> position during <b>opening</b> or closing {{were used}} to compute the variability of the vowel- or consonant-related utterance. We calculated two mea-sures <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> variability on a per-subject basis: The first was variability relative to the mean jaw position at max-imumopening ormaximum closing, and the secondwas the coefficient of variation (CV), which is the standard deviation <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> position divided by the mean jaw posi-tion.

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to design and {{manufacture}} a composite mandible replicate suitable for testing the influence of prosthetic materials on the stress distribution of bone. Composite mandibles made of a poly(methylmethacrylate) core and a glass reinforced outer shell are manufactured and characterised through mechanical tests assisted by the finite element analysis. The mandible replicate has been conveniently equipped with strain gauges, moreover a video extensometer has also been used {{in order to measure}} the arch width change during loading. A close agreement is found between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions. By laterally loading the mandibles the maximum values of stress and strain take place in the premolar-incisal region. By varying technological parameters such as the fiber volume fraction and orientation, it is easy to replicate the behaviour of mandibles having different stiffnesses. The results obtained by laterally loading the composite mandibles through the condyles or through the gonion regions are consistent with literature data relative to the arch <b>width</b> decrease <b>of</b> natural <b>jaws</b> during <b>opening</b> and closing. This novel synthetic system coupled with the Finite Element model constitutes an experimental-theoretical model suitable to investigate the biomechanical effects of oral rehabilitations on mandibular bone...|$|R
40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{some preliminary}} measurements on the movement <b>of</b> the lower <b>jaw</b> in speech. Such measurements may be interesting for several reasons. One {{of these is}} that they more easily than measurements on the movements of other articulators may give {{some insight into the}} effect of stress, duration and position on articulator movement. Another reason is that the study <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> movement together with other aspects of articulation may provide information on articulatory coordination. The effect of stress, duration and position on the extent <b>of</b> <b>jaw</b> movement has been investigated by studying jaw movement in the speaking of nonsense words with the structure /ta:ta:ta:t/ and /tatatat/. These two phoneme sequences have been spoken as nonsense words with the stress on the first, second or third syllable. Each of the resulting 6 variations has been spoken 10 times by both authors. Furthermore, one aspect of articulatory coordination has been studied, viz. the temporal relation between the start <b>of</b> the <b>jaw</b> <b>opening</b> movement and the vowel onset in intervocalic consonants and consonant clusters by recording jaw movement in nonsense words of the structure /daC 2 ̆ 6 amp;/, where /C/ stands for one of the following consonants or consonant clusters: /d, t, s, st, str, nst, nstr/. All forms were spoken 10 times each by both authors...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{research}} was to found out the differences in vowel formant production in 156 speakers, exactly between 46 individuals with normal hearing, 36 with severe (M= 78. 43, SD= 16. 07) and 74 with profound hearing impairment (M = 108. 10, SD = 7. 69). The F 2 values in anterior vowel production are lower and F 2 formant values are higher in the hearing impaired groups, according to the degree of hearing impairment, compared with the values of normal hearing individuals. The range of F 1 from high to low vowels is smaller in the hearing impaired groups, according to the degree of hearing impairment, compared with the values of normal hearing individuals.
