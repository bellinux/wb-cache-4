5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>is</b> unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Besides the Slavs, the {{presence}} of a German-speaking population can be demonstrated based on toponyms.

Finally, the name of the Barca, Barót and other rivers could be either Turkic or Slavic.|$|E
