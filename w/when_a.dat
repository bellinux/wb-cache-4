5|$|A notable {{cultural}} {{trait of}} Chiprovtsi shared {{with much of}} the region is the veneration of a family patron saint, named svetets ("saint") and akin to Serbian slava. The practice exists since time immemorial and the family saint is thought to have been chosen by the taking of a random candle by an unaware person. The svetets is associated to the family house: <b>when</b> <b>a</b> daughter-in-law comes to live there, she accepts the family saint of the home, and <b>when</b> <b>a</b> family member or a foreign settler moves out or builds a new house, they adopt a new svetets.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations. Harsh calls were made <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bird was alarmed or agitated, whistle-type calls were emitted in general contexts, sometimes monotonously, and shorter duration 'chatter' calls were given <b>when</b> <b>a</b> bird sighted a human near the enclosure.|$|E

5|$|Aggressive {{resemblance}} {{is used by}} predators or parasites. In special aggressive resemblance, {{the animal}} looks like something else, luring the prey or host to approach, for example <b>when</b> <b>a</b> flower mantis resembles {{a particular kind of}} flower, such as an orchid. In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example <b>when</b> <b>a</b> leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} several short spells <b>when</b> <b>a</b> third {{division}} was created, the two-division structure remained largely in place until 1975, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> major re-organisation of the league led to a new three-tier set-up {{and the creation of}} a new Premier Division at the highest level. In 1998, the teams then in the Premier Division broke away to form the SPL, which supplanted the Premier Division as the highest level of football in Scotland. The SPL and SFL merged in 2013 to form the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL), which branded its top division as the Scottish Premiership.|$|E

50|$|Normally, {{eating is}} {{pleasant}} <b>when</b> <b>an</b> individual is hungry and less pleasant <b>when</b> <b>an</b> individual is full. Neuronal activation in the OFC decreases <b>when</b> <b>an</b> individual is full, however {{there is a}} disturbance in this pathway in individuals with AN and BN. Thus, patients with AN have little response to food or a quick response to being full, and patients with BN have an exaggerated response to food or a decrease in feeling full.|$|R
5|$|At times, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One {{of the most striking}} archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E

25|$|Aiki is {{different}} from the victory of sen sen, and is applied in situations of go no sen, such as <b>when</b> <b>an</b> opponent thrusts at you.

This is katsujinken. <b>When</b> <b>an</b> opponent strikes at you and your sword pierces his stomach it is setsuninken. These two concepts are the essence of the sword.|$|R
