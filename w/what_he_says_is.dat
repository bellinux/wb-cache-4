25|$|The {{foundation}} of Swedenborg's theology was {{laid down in}} Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Mysteries), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In {{a significant portion of}} that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in Apocalypse Revealed.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He begins this work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.|$|E

Philosophically, this sounds like the traditional [...] "bootstrap" [...] theory, but it isn’t. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> that the poor should be given the fiscal support to create their market, which would give them the ability to become self-reliant in the future.|$|E

2500|$|The One People's Project {{claims that}} MacDonald has {{promoted}} anti-Semitic propaganda {{under the guise}} of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> a legitimate and academic search for truth. He has been accused of misrepresenting the sources he uses in that regard. For example, Barry Mehler, an educator at Ferris State University, noted that MacDonald had claimed that [...] "Jewish opposition to the 1921 and 1924 legislation (to limit immigration) was motivated less by a desire for higher levels of Jewish immigration than by opposition to the implicit theory that America should be dominated by individuals with northern and western European ancestry." [...] MacDonald based this on a dissertation entitled “American Jewry and United States immigration policy, 1881–1953” by Sheldon Morris Neuringer. Nueringer’s thesis posited that Jewish opposition in 1921 and 1924 to the anti-immigration legislation at the time was due more to it having the [...] "taint of discrimination and anti-Semitism" [...] as opposed to how it would limit Jewish immigration. Mehler stated [...] "It seems to me Mr. MacDonald is misrepresenting Mr. Neuringer in this case and I posted my query hoping that a historian familiar with the literature might have a judgment on MacDonald's use of the historical data."' ...|$|E
