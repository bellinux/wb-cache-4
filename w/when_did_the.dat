2500|$|Various {{scholars}} {{have used a}} synthesis of evidence to present models to suggest {{an answer to the}} questions that surround the Anglo-Saxon settlement. These questions include: How many migrants were there? <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Saxons" [...] gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements {{at the time of the}} Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation. [...] Heinrich Härke explains the nature of this agreement: [...] "It is now widely accepted that the Anglo-Saxons were not just transplanted Germanic invaders and settlers from the Continent, but the outcome of insular interactions and changes. But we are still lacking explicit models that suggest how this ethnogenetic process might have worked in concrete terms".|$|E

60|$|Exam. 2. Thou thinkest that thou hast {{been born}} again, ('tis well if thou hast) but least thou shouldest deceive thy poor soul, I pray thee consider, <b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of the Lord Jesus shew thee, that thou hadst no faith in thee by nature? And <b>when</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of Christ {{convince}} thee of sin, because thou didst {{not believe in}} him? It may be thou hast been convinced of sins against the law, by the law, and thine own conscience, as the Pharisees were (John 8:9; Rom 3:20). Ay, but when didst thou see thyself a lost creature for want {{of faith in the}} son of Mary? If not, thou hast not yet been savingly convinced by the Spirit of Christ; for that, when it convinceth effectually of sin, it convinceth of unbelief; though thou hast been never so much convinced of sins against the law, if thou hast not seen thyself under the power and dominion, guilt and punishment of sin, because thou didst not believe in Christ, thou hast not yet been savingly convinced; for that's one work of the Spirit to convince of sin, 'Because they believe not on me,' saith Jesus the Son of Mary, who was espoused to Joseph the carpenter: But on the contrary, dost thou not say in thy heart, thou never hadst thy faith to seek, but hast always believed with as good a faith as any one alive? If so, then know for certain that thou hast no faith of the operation of God in thee, according to God's ordinary working; and if so, then know, that if the Son of Man should come to judge the world at this moment of time, that thou with all thy faith (thou thinkest thou hast) wouldst fall in the judgment (2 Thess 2:12).|$|E

How was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought, in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.|$|E

6000|$|I {{found the}} half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions as {{pleasing}} {{to my ear}} as they had formerly been. A Southerner talks music.

The words may lack charm to the eye, in print, but they have it to the ear. <b>When</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> r disappear from Southern speech, and how did it come to disappear? The custom of dropping it was not borrowed from the North, nor inherited from England. Many Southerners--most Southerners--put a y into occasional words that begin with the k sound. For instance, they say Mr. K'yahtah (Carter) and speak of playing k'yahds or of riding in the k'yahs. And they have the pleasant custom--long ago fallen into decay in the North--of frequently employing the respectful 'Sir.' Instead of the curt Yes, and the abrupt No, they say 'Yes, Suh', 'No, Suh.' ...|$|E
