50|$|For many years, the Port prospered as the <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for Montreal. In 1889 the Canadian Pacific Railway {{opened a}} line {{across the state}} of Maine from Montreal to Saint John and {{transferred}} {{the majority of its}} trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the <b>port</b> during the <b>winter</b> months.|$|R
50|$|After Confederation, {{boosters}} of Halifax expected federal help to {{make the}} city's natural harbor Canada's official <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> and a gateway for trade with Europe. Halifax's advantages included its location just off the Great Circle route made it the closest to Europe of any mainland North American port. But the new Intercolonial Railway (ICR) took an indirect, southerly route for military and political reasons, and the national government made little effort to promote Halifax as Canada's <b>winter</b> <b>port.</b> Ignoring appeals to nationalism and the ICR's own attempts to promote traffic to Halifax, most Canadian exporters sent their wares by train though Boston or Portland. No one was interested in financing the large-scale port facilities Halifax lacked. It took the First World War to at last boost Halifax's harbor into prominence on the North Atlantic.|$|R
50|$|The Quebec Central Railway {{anticipated}} that the new CPR main line across Maine to its <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> of Saint John would result in traffic to Quebec City, thus the QCR built {{a line from the}} CPR at Megantic north to Tring Junction and thence on to Vallee Junction in the Beauce River valley.|$|R
50|$|The Winterport Historic District {{encompasses}} {{a significant portion}} of the town center of Winterport, Maine. The town was mainly developed in the mid-19th century, when it served as the main <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for Bangor, and features a high concentration of Greek Revival and Italianate architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.|$|R
50|$|Thus the Government of Canada came {{to inherit}} the PEIR in 1874 {{at the same}} time as {{construction}} was progressing on the Intercolonial Railway (IRC), which would link the strategic <b>winter</b> <b>ports</b> of the Canadian Maritimes with Central Canada. New locomotives were purchased from the United Kingdom and from Canadian manufacturers along with new rail cars.|$|R
50|$|The 201 mile {{section of}} railway {{across the state}} of Maine was {{operated}} directly by CPR from 1889 to 1988. The opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958 {{and the provision of}} icebreaking services for the port of Montreal by the new Canadian Coast Guard after the 1960s saw the importance of a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> at Saint John diminish.|$|R
50|$|After Confederation in 1867, {{boosters}} of Halifax expected federal help to {{make the}} city's natural harbor Canada's official <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> and a gateway for trade with Europe. Halifax's advantages included its location just off the Great Circle route made it the closest to Europe of any mainland North American port.

Harbour promoters fought an uphill battle to finance the large-scale port facilities Halifax lacked, succeeding just before the First World War with the start of construction of the large docking facilities at Ocean Terminals in Halifax's South End. The war at last boosted Halifax's harbor into prominence on the North Atlantic.|$|R

The series was first broadcast in August 2011.|$|R
50|$|The Lachsbach {{is formed}} by the merger of its headstreams, the Sebnitz (left, about half the size) and Polenz (right, rather longer) in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains near Porschdorf. The {{combined}} confluence section of the two rivers was first recorded in 1543 as die beyde wasser ("the two waters"), a description no longer common today. After only 3 kilometres, the Lachsbach empties into the Elbe above Prossen's <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> near Wendischfähre.|$|R
50|$|The reefs {{that stretch}} {{around the island}} {{and out to the}} south and west are home to some of Australia's most {{colourful}} marine animals. Things to be seen including big belly sea horses, sea dragons, pygmy pipehorses, red Indian fish and all the usual fish seen around Sydney. People have also seen seals and grey nurse sharks at times and in late <b>winter</b> <b>Port</b> Jackson sharks are very common.|$|R
2500|$|In 1713, France {{set about}} {{constructing}} Port Dauphin and a limited naval support base {{at the former}} site of Fort St-Anne; however, the winter icing conditions of the harbour led the French to choose another harbour on the [...] southeastern part of Île Royale. The harbour, being ice-free and well protected, soon became a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for French naval forces on the Atlantic seaboard and they named it Havre Louisbourg after King Louis XIV.|$|R
50|$|Porter {{sailed to}} Washington, D.C. on 27 February 1897 for {{inspection}} and was further examined on 16 - 20 March at New York by the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. She operated between New London and Newport; then visited New York from 15 July-3 October before getting underway for her <b>winter</b> <b>port,</b> Charleston, South Carolina. Porter cruised in southern waters until 8 December and {{then proceeded to}} Key West where she was stationed from 1-22 January 1898.|$|R
25|$|Historically, Maine ports {{played a}} key role in {{national}} transportation. Beginning around 1880, Portland's rail link and ice-free port made it Canada's principal <b>winter</b> <b>port,</b> until the aggressive development of Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the mid-1900s. In 2013, 12,039,600 short tons passed into and out of Portland by sea, which places it 45th of US water ports. Portland Maine's Portland International Jetport was recently expanded, providing the state with increased air traffic from carriers such as JetBlue and Southwest Airlines.|$|R
50|$|Founded in {{the early}} 17th century, Christianshavn was {{originally}} considerably smaller than at present. The area {{to the south of}} the new district was known as the Grønnegård Harbour (Danish: Grønnegårds Havn) and used as a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for the Royal Navy's ships, conveniently located opposite the Arsenal Dock where they would be equipped. Up through the century, the area was gradually sold off and filled. In 1695 the entire site was acquired by Jan van Osten who established a shipyard there.|$|R

50|$|There is {{evidence}} of a Norse-Gaelic settlement in Bannow in general and Clonmines in particular. In the early thirteenth century, after the Norman conquest of Ireland, a borough and port was established at Clonmines by William Marshal. Colfer suggests that Marshal chose the site {{in spite of its}} shallow harbour and poor hinterland, to offer a sheltered <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> alternative to New Ross. After the partition of Marshal's Lordship of Leinster around 1249, Clonmines was a detached manor of the liberty of Kildare.|$|R
50|$|It {{was founded}} in 1885 as a fishing port on the Sea of Okhotsk, and up to these days has never been made {{accessible}} by road, even though the area had been a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for the Yakut and Evenki people for many years before Russians discovered it. Chumikan soon became a trading center for gold, which was discovered inland within a decade after founding. In the 1920s, after the gold was depleted, Chumikan became, along with other localities along the coast, a center {{of resistance to the}} October Revolution.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for Montreal, Quebec when {{shipping}} was unable to traverse the sea ice in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and St. Lawrence River. The Canadian Pacific Railway opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of Maine and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the <b>port</b> during the <b>winter</b> months. The <b>port</b> fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round icebreaker services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to shortline operator New Brunswick Southern Railway. The Canadian National Railway still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from Moncton.|$|R
50|$|Claudius was {{a younger}} brother of Germanicus, and had long been {{considered}} a weakling and a fool {{by the rest of}} his family. The Praetorian Guard, however, acclaimed him as emperor. Claudius was neither paranoid like his uncle Tiberius, nor insane like his nephew Caligula, and was therefore able to administer the Empire with reasonable ability. He improved the bureaucracy and streamlined the citizenship and senatorial rolls. He ordered the construction of a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> at Ostia Antica for Rome, thereby providing a place for grain {{from other parts of the}} Empire to be brought in inclement weather.|$|R
50|$|In 1853, upon {{completion}} of the Grand Trunk Railway to Montreal, Portland became the primary ice-free winter seaport for Canadian exports. The Portland Company manufactured more than 600 19th-century steam locomotives. Portland became a 20th-century rail hub as five additional rail lines merged into Portland Terminal Company in 1911. Following nationalization of the Grand Trunk system in 1923, Canadian export traffic was diverted from Portland to Halifax, Nova Scotia, causing marked local economic decline. In the 20th century, icebreakers later enabled ships to reach Montreal in winter, drastically reducing Portland's role as a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for Canada.|$|R

The Zaca is frequently seen at prestigious sailing races in the Mediterranean. Her <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> is in Port de Fontvielle, Monaco. In 2009, the Sailing Channel (now the Nautical Channel) dedicated a program to {{the entire history of}} the Zaca from original construction to the present entitled [...] "In the Wake of the Zaca".|$|R
50|$|CPR sought, and was given, a {{lease on}} the New Brunswick Railway {{for a period}} of 990 years {{beginning}} on July 1, 1890, resulting in a mainline from Montreal to Saint John and the feeder network of NBR branchlines to St. Stephen and St. Andrews as well as Fredericton and the upper Saint John River valley. This development gave CPR access to the port of Saint John and until the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950s and subsequent expansion of government ice breaking services for shipping, Saint John would become CPR's <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> on the Atlantic coast when Montreal was ice-bound.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in 1866, {{public transit}} {{consisted}} of horse-drawn cars which mostly funneled traffic {{from the ocean}} to ferries on the Saint John River. The electric trolley system in Saint John made its debut in 1893 and the fledgling St. John Railway Company was quickly bought by a Montréal-based consortium which included the railway magnates W.C. Van Horne, Richard B. Angus, and Thomas G. Shaughnessy, only {{a year after the}} Canadian Pacific [...] "Short Line" [...] had connected Montréal to Saint John; they invested the then-substantial sum of $92,000 into the project, seen also as an investment in Saint John as a major Maritime <b>winter</b> <b>port.</b>|$|R
50|$|Icebreakers keep 23 {{ports open}} for traffic even in <b>winter.</b> The <b>ports</b> in Gulf of Bothnia need icebreakers in average six months a year, while in Gulf of Finland icebreakers {{are needed for}} three months a year.|$|R
50|$|During the 1870s, {{financial}} difficulties saw {{the line from}} Saint John to St. Croix sold to the New Brunswick Railway (NBR). At the same time, the Maine Central Railroad (MEC) leased the E&NA from Vanceboro to Bangor; it would purchase {{the line in the}} 1950s. In 1889 the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) purchased the NBR and constructed the International Railway of Maine to connect Montreal to the ice free <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> of Saint John, leasing trackage rights over the section owned by the Maine Central between Vanceboro and Mattawamkeag. In 1974, CP Rail purchased this section, completing its ownership of a transcontinental railway from the shores of the Atlantic to the Pacific.|$|R
25|$|When the Treaty of Tartu {{was signed}} on 14 October 1920, Finland agreed {{to return the}} Russian icebreakers that the Finnish White Guard had seized during the Civil War in 1918. As a result, {{the largest and most}} {{powerful}} state-owned icebreaker of Finland at that time, Wäinämöinen, was handed over to Estonia in 1922. Since both the size of the ships calling at the Finnish <b>winter</b> <b>ports</b> and the amount of exported goods, especially forest products, had increased considerably since the First World War, there was a definite need for a large and powerful icebreaker. One of the key issues was the beam of the existing icebreakers, , which was not enough for the new ships used to transport goods across the Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
50|$|The route was a hard-fought {{compromise}} between Hanover and the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, then independent countries. Around 1850, people from Vegesack and Blumenthal {{argued for a}} direct connection to the Weser estuary. This was expected to promote {{the development of the}} villages of the marshes on the eastern shore of the lower Weser (the Osterstade). Hanover, however, preferred a route via Lesum, Scharmbeck and Beverstedt. It would be possible to build a branch from Beverstedt towards Hamburg, making Hanoverian Geestemünde a <b>winter</b> <b>port</b> for Hamburg. Bremen proposed as a compromise a route roughly along today's federal highway B 6, which was built between 1817 and 1839. Finally, both countries agreed to split the difference, so that the line runs near Stubben and Loxstedt.|$|R
5000|$|Until {{the early}} {{first decade of}} the 21st century, Canada's largest {{shipyard}} (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city.
