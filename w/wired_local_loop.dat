40|$|The {{traditional}} <b>wired</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> used {{to connect}} each telephone subscriber {{to the nearest}} exchange is expensive and unreliable. Wireless Local Loop (WLL) systems largely eliminate these copper wires using wireless technologies and could provide a cost effective solution. corDECT is one such WLL system, based on the DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications) standard, that provides toll-quality voice and data capability at a cost below that of a <b>wired</b> <b>local</b> <b>loop.</b> Using micro-cells and Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), it can handle high subscriber densities without frequency planning. corDECT is gaining commercial acceptance in India {{and a number of}} other countries...|$|E

50|$|Concentrators {{are often}} placed {{alongside}} a {{digital subscriber line}} access multiplexer (DSLAM). This can provide access to asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) Internet service for subscribers who are beyond the normal 4 km signaling limit on a copper wire loop. For example, a fiber optic cable might run up to 30 km without a repeater from the telephone exchange to a concentrator site, and <b>local</b> subscriber <b>wire</b> <b>local</b> <b>loops</b> can extend an additional 4 km beyond the concentrator and its DSLAM. With repeaters in the fiber optic cable {{the distance from the}} telephone exchange can be extended much farther.|$|R
50|$|A {{party line}} (multiparty line, shared service line, party <b>wire)</b> is a <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{telephone}} circuit that {{is shared by}} multiple telephone service subscribers.|$|R
50|$|Telephones are {{connected}} to the telephone exchange via a <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> which is a physical pair of <b>wires.</b> The <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 hertz (voiceband or commercial bandwidth). However, as long-distance trunks were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> (by utilizing frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.|$|R
5000|$|Unbundled {{access is}} similar to Bitstream access, where the {{incumbent}} provider gives competitive access to not to the actual copper <b>wire</b> of the <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> but to a high-speed ADSL data connection. Both setups ensure competition for the backhaul but leave [...] "last mile" [...] infrastructure {{the responsibility of the}} incumbent carrier.|$|R
50|$|There {{are both}} {{technical}} and marketing reasons why ADSL {{is in many}} places {{the most common type}} offered to home users. On the technical side, there is likely to be more crosstalk from other circuits at the DSLAM end (where the <b>wires</b> from many <b>local</b> <b>loops</b> are close to each other) than at the customer premises. Thus the upload signal is weakest at the noisiest part of the <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> while the download signal is strongest at the noisiest part of the <b>local</b> <b>loop.</b> It therefore makes technical sense to have the DSLAM transmit at a higher bit rate than does the modem on the customer end. Since the typical home user in fact does prefer a higher download speed, the telephone companies chose to make a virtue out of necessity, hence ADSL.|$|R
50|$|The first {{telephones}} {{were connected}} directly in pairs. Each user had a separate telephone wired to the locations he {{might wish to}} reach. This quickly became inconvenient and unmanageable when people wanted to communicate {{with more than a}} few people. The inventions of the telephone exchange provided the solution for establishing telephone connections with any other telephone in service in the local area. Each telephone was connected to the exchange via one <b>wire</b> pair, the <b>local</b> <b>loop.</b> Nearby exchanges in other service areas were connected with trunk lines and long distance service could be established by relaying the calls through multiple exchanges.|$|R
40|$|The <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> — {{the access}} network which connects {{customers}} {{to the core}} network — remains the last bastion of historical telecommunication operators. Even though competition in the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> is limited today, some new access technologies may enable new operators to enter the <b>local</b> <b>loop.</b> Among these technologies, the wireless <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{seems to be the}} most promising. In this article, we try to evaluate whether it could viable for a new entrant to enter the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> by building wireless <b>local</b> <b>loops.</b> We find that a wireless <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> entry strategy is characterized by (a) a strong technical progress, (b) a high level of uncertainty regarding the technology and the demand and (c) relatively high switching costs on the customer side. Even though the wireless <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> might not be viable in the short run, it will quickly become a strong means of entry for new operators. Bourreau Marc.

50|$|Although <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{unbundling}} is {{a standard}} process for an incumbent (ILEC), issues remain to be solved in the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> management process. For a CLEC which borrows lines from ILEC for DSL services provisioning process, a <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> is the most critical (and the most weak) point because of reduced management of this {{vital part of the}} network.|$|R

50|$|By 14 January 2006, 210,000 <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{connections}} {{had been}} unbundled from BT operation under <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> unbundling.

However, as reported by The Register, on 15 June 2006, the figure had reached only 500,000, but was growing by 20,000 a week. Ofcom announced in November 2006 that 1,000,000 connections had been unbundled. By April 2007, the figure was 2,000,000.|$|R
50|$|In local {{telephone}} networks, a Loop Management System (LMS) {{is a kind}} or a part of network management system intended to maximize <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> control. Sometimes it {{is referred to as}} <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> management (LLM) or copper loop management (CLM).|$|R
50|$|The {{short range}} brings {{superior}} bit-rate performance, compared to normal <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> unbundling (LLU). The <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> {{can be accessed}} using shared metallic path or full metallic path facilities. In the latter, which was first deployed in the UK {{in the village of}} Lyddington by Rutland Telecom, the telco loses remote access to the part of the <b>local</b> <b>loop</b> between the cabinet and the customer's premises unless the SLU Operator allows IP-level access via their DSLAM.|$|R

40|$|Interconnection is {{necessary}} for competition in telephony, but interconnection agree-ments are difficult to negotiate. With local service competition, entrants usually cannot duplicate the <b>local</b> <b>loop,</b> so interconnection also involves “renting ” the incumbent’s <b>local</b> <b>loops.</b> An incumbent may object to being asked to permit use of its infrastructure by its competi-tors, {{in order to allow}} its competitors to compete with it.

Under the heading "local loop unbundling" three variants are discussed, full unbundling, line sharing, and bitstream access. An obligation to provide competitors access to local networks on an unbundled basis is a strong intervention into the property rights of the regulated firm.
