500|$|Mars {{performed}} [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] {{live for}} the first time on June 24, 2011 at the NBC's Today Show as he danced along with his band. The choreography was inspired by James Brown, and Mars picked up a megaphone to sing some of the lyrics. On October 22, 2011, Mars and his band wore matching red velvet Dolce & Gabbana suits during the song's performance on the results show of The X Factor UK. Robbie Daw of Idolator called the live show [...] "rowdy", while a writer for Rap-Up praised the performance, writing that it [...] "rocked the house" [...] due to his [...] "James Brown funky moves" [...] and singing into a megaphone. Christopher Hooton for Metro opined that Mars [...] "stole the show" [...] with his suit and [...] "dance moves James Brown himself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of." ...|$|E
500|$|While in camp in Falmouth in late November, the {{officers}} of the 29th learned that Meagher had arranged for a green Irish Brigade flag to {{be presented to the}} regiment, recognizing their role as [...] "honorary Irishmen" [...] and their bravery during the Battle of Antietam. [...] Barnes declined the gift, however. [...] According to the regimental historian, [...] "While the Colonel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to receive the flag for the regiment as a token of the respect of their Irish comrades, yet he objected to the flag being carried by the regiment, on the ground that it was not an Irish regiment." [...] Irish Brigade historians, including Joseph Bilby, have observed {{that there may have been}} some controversy surrounding the issue. [...] According to Bilby, Barnes refused to accept the flag because they believed it [...] "would brand them as Fenians," [...] or Irish revolutionaries.|$|E
500|$|In Britain, Grainger's main {{legacy is}} {{the revival of}} {{interest}} in folk music. His pioneering work in the recording and setting of folk songs greatly influenced the following generation of English composers; Benjamin Britten acknowledged the Australian as his master in this respect. After hearing a broadcast of some Grainger settings, Britten [...] declared that these [...] " [...] all the Vaughan Williams and R. O. Morris arrangements into a cocked hat". In the United States, Grainger left a strong educational legacy through his involvement, over 40 years, with high school, summer school and college students. Likewise, his innovative approaches to instrumentation and scoring have left their mark on modern American band music; Timothy Reynish, a conductor and teacher of band music in Europe and America, has described him as [...] "the only composer of stature to consider military bands the equal, if not the superior, in expressive potential to symphony orchestras." [...] Grainger's attempts to produce [...] "free music" [...] by mechanical and later electronic means, which he considered his most important work, produced no follow-up; they were quickly overtaken and nullified [...] by new technological advances. Covell nevertheless remarks that in this endeavour, Grainger's dogged resourcefulness and ingenious [...] use of available materials demonstrate a particularly Australian aspect of the composer's character – one of which Grainger <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud.</b>|$|E
25|$|He {{was indeed}} the ideal fast bowler, aiming at the stumps, always on the attack. His leap before the right arm wheeled over was superb in poise. Never did he send down a {{defensive}} ball. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too <b>proud.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "How I wish, lad," [...] he went on, with {{a sudden}} change of voice, [...] "that your dear father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> here this day! Faith, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a <b>proud</b> man. Ah! It was a cruel bullet that hit him, at Vimiera." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will be as}} {{mild and}} as meek as a little dove. If she and the doctor had lost every {{shilling}} in the world, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> as <b>proud</b> as an eagle." [...] It must be acknowledged that Beatrice had had the wit to read Mary's character aright.|$|R
2500|$|Franchitti, again {{driving for}} Target Chip Ganassi Racing, had {{a slow start}} {{in the first four}} races. On 27 May, he had an {{emotional}} win of the 2012 Indianapolis 500. In reference to Dan Wheldon, Franchitti said in an interview after the race, [...] "I think D-Dub <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of that one." [...] The 500 would end up being his only win of the season and the last of his career, as Franchitti struggled against both Andretti and Penske's teams.|$|E
2500|$|Heidi Milligan and Pitt {{say goodbye}} at Kennedy Airport, where Pitt has {{arranged}} for Shaw (who is currently under arrest {{as an enemy}} agent) to also say goodbye. After Heidi leaves to board her plane, Pitt informs Shaw that he has arranged for Shaw's release and departure on the same plane with Heidi, claiming that [...] "The President owes me a favor." [...] Shaw releases himself from his handcuffs and Pitt remarks, [...] "James Bond <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of you ... I hear you two were quite close." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tom Searle's {{twin brother}} and bandmate, Dan, {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} on the band's official Facebook page that their upcoming Australian tour, {{as well as their}} UK and Europe headline tour, would still be taking place as a tribute to his [...] brother following his death. On the future of the band, Dan Searle wrote, [...] "We want to carry on, that is important to say, and we will strive to do so, but we will not release any music unless we truly believe that it is something that Tom <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of. Whether or not we can achieve that is something that we will have to discover in time". Sean Delander of Thy Art Is Murder filled in for Searle on the Australian tour, and Josh Middleton of Sylosis filled in on the European tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's go {{and tell}} him how much we liked it," [...] said Mary, thus {{suggesting}} an action which Ralph was anxious to take, though without her he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too <b>proud</b> to do it, for he suspected that he had more interest in Katharine than she had in him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really," [...] said Elsley, wincing, [...] "I {{never met}} him there." [...] He recollected that Lucia had {{expressed}} more pleasure at Major Campbell's coming than even, at that of her brother; and a dark, undefined phantom entered his heart, which, though he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> too <b>proud</b> to confess it to himself, {{was none other than}} jealousy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{behaved like}} a brick, anyhow," [...] the colonel said, [...] "and {{there is not}} a man in the {{regiment}} who <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud,</b> indeed, if he had accomplished such a feat. Half my subalterns were talking, at dinner last night, of learning the language so that, if the chance fell in their way, they might emulate your doings." ...|$|R
2500|$|One of Moulton's most appreciative, scholastic, and discriminating critics was Professor John Meiklejohn. He {{has said}} with {{authority}} that she {{deserved to be}} classed with the best Elizabethan lyricists in her lyrics,—with Robert Herrick and Thomas Campion and Shakespeare,—while in her sonnets she might rightly take a place with John Milton and William Wordsworth and Christina Rossetti. [...] "I cannot tell you how keen and great enjoyment (sometimes even rapture)," [...] he wrote her, [...] "I have got out of your exquisite lyrics." [...] In a series of [...] "Notes," [...] following the poems, line by line, he asserted that the poet won her success by the simplest means and plainest words, as true genius always does, and that her pages were full of emotional and imaginative meaning, Nature and Poetry uniting in an indissoluble whole; and Shelley himself, he said, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to own certain of the lines. The poem [...] "Quest" [...] he found so beautiful that, in his own words, it was [...] "difficult to speak of it in perfectly measured and unexaggerated language." [...] Of the poem [...] "Wife to Husband" [...] he said that [...] "the tenderness, the sweet and compelling rhythm, are worthy of the best Elizabethan days." [...] The sonnet, [...] "A Summer's Growth," [...] "unites," [...] he says, the [...] "passion of such Italian poets as Dante with the imagination of modern English." [...] This was in relation to her first volume, [...] "Swallow Flights"; and in conclusion he said: [...] "This poet must look for her brothers in {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries among the noble and intense lyrists. Her insight, her subtlety, her delicacy, her music, are hardly matched, and certainly not surpassed by Herrick or Campion or Crashaw or Carew or Herbert or Vaughan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{surprised}} at you, Will," [...] Dame Martin said. [...] "I {{should have thought}} that you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of the credit and honour that Ned is winning. Why, all our neighbours are talking of nothing else!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{could have}} wished,' said Mr Pecksniff, 'to {{have had the}} honour of {{introducing}} you to an elderly inmate of our house: to the uncle of our friend. Mr Chuzzlewit, sir, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> indeed to have taken you by the hand.' ...|$|E
50|$|The House caters for {{boarders}} from Years 7 to 12, and for day boys between Years 9 and 11, and <b>is</b> <b>proud</b> of its multi-national and multi-cultural composition, {{something of}} which J. J. Kendon, a noted philanthropist, <b>would</b> surely <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud.</b> This diversity creates a special {{atmosphere in which}} the boys are able to develop the important skills of acceptance, solidarity and teamwork, alongside their academic development.|$|R

60|$|Toby was not {{naturally}} {{what might}} be called a pretty boy, for his short red hair and his freckled face prevented any great display of beauty; but he was a good, honest looking boy, and in his tasteful costume looked very nice indeed--so nice that, could Mrs. Treat have seen him just then, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> very <b>proud</b> of her handiwork and hugged him harder than ever.|$|R
60|$|He was roused to a {{sense of}} the danger of his {{position}} by footsteps on the path outside, which, coming nearer and nearer, were evidently aimed at the summer-house. With a silence and celerity of which any brave <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud,</b> he got under the table.|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Mother, how can {{you talk}} like that? Of course I have been quite happy with you. But a man can't stay always with his mother. No chap does.

6000|$|... "Yes; but in {{the first}} place they were very naughty girls, else they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to {{minister}} to such a father; and in the second place they might have studied privately and taught themselves to understand what they read, and then it would have been interesting. I hope you don't expect me to be naughty and stupid?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “My {{father wanted}} the stadium to serve all {{the schools of}} the Greater Bluefield area,” Nelson said during a {{telephone}} interview. She added that a program of all the games scheduled to be played at the stadium in 1954 included Bluefield, Graham and Park Central high school games as well as Bluefield State College games that season. “ This was a stadium for all to use. I think that is something my father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> most <b>proud</b> of,” Nelson said.|$|R
60|$|If {{the affection}} {{of the young}} Spanish lady for the buccaneer chief was {{sufficient}} to make her {{take an interest in}} his subsequent career, she <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of him, for the ladies of those days had a high opinion of brave men and successful warriors. De Lussan soon proved that he was not only a good fighter, but that he was also an able general, and his operations on the western coast of South America were more like military campaigns than ordinary expeditions of lawless buccaneers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{thought you}} knew how to value her for herself, so good and so admirable--a lady in everything--with such perfect manners. I thought you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> pleased and <b>proud</b> that Gilbert's choice was so much nobler than beauty, or rank, or fashion could make it,' said Sophy, growing {{enthusiastic}} as she went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Miss Avondale," [...] {{burst out}} Randolph, [...] "if you only knew how sorry and indignant I {{was at the}} bank--when--you know--the other day"--he stammered.

60|$|You <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of me, my friends, if {{you could}} have seen and heard me, for I clashed my sabre as I spoke, and swung my dolman as though my {{regiment}} was picketed outside in the courtyard. They listened to me in silence, but the back of the Prince bowed more and more as though the burden which weighed upon it was greater than his strength. He looked round with haggard eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Then the Editor {{described}} Dick's warning visit; {{and how he}} {{had seen}} in the lad's eye that there was a thrashing in the wind, and had escaped through pity only--so the Editor put it--"through pity only, sir. And oh, sir," [...] he went on, [...] "if you had seen him speaking up for you, I am sure you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of your son. I know I admired the lad myself, and indeed that's what brings me here." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{was not for}} John Caldigate to {{join the}} mazes of that dance, though he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked it well, and was well fitted by skill and taste for such exercise. But the ground was hallowed on which they trod, and {{forbidden}} to him; and though there was probably not a girl or a dancing married woman there who <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to stand up with Mr. Caldigate of Folking, {{there was not one}} who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> dared to take the hand of a second-class passenger. So he stood, just within his own boundary, and looked and longed. Then there was a voice in his ear. 'Do you dance, Mr. Caldigate?' ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had almost}} {{said that her}} pride had left her. Such an {{assertion}} would be a gross libel on her. No; she <b>was</b> perhaps <b>prouder</b> than ever, as she left her old home. There was a humility in her cheap dress, in her large straw bonnet coming far over her face, in her dark gloves and little simple collar; nay, there was a humility in her altered voice, and somewhat chastened mien; but {{the spirit of the}} woman was wholly unbroken. She had even a pride in her very position, in her close and dear tie with the convicted prisoner. She was his for better and for worse; she would now show him what was her idea of the vow she had made. To the men who came to ticket and number the furniture, to the tradesmen's messengers who called for money, to the various workmen with whom the house was then invaded, she was humble enough; but had Mrs. Val come across her with pity, or the Miss Neverbends with their sententious twaddlings, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>prouder</b> than ever. Fallen indeed! She had had no fall; nor <b>had</b> he; he <b>was</b> still a man, with a greater aggregate of good in him than falls to the average lot of mortals. Who would dare to tell her that he had fallen? 'Twas thus that her pride was still strong within her; and as it supported her through this misery, who can blame her for it? ...|$|R
60|$|Hereward sat silent, appalled. For Tosti {{he cared}} not. But Harold Sigurdsson, Harold Hardraade, Harold the Viking, Harold the Varanger, Harold the Lionslayer, Harold of Constantinople, the bravest among champions, the wisest among kings, the cunningest among minstrels, {{the darling of}} the Vikings of the North; the one man whom Hereward had taken for his pattern and his ideal, the one man under whose banner he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to fight--the earth seemed empty, if Harold Hardraade were gone.|$|E
60|$|That {{night before}} he went to bed he wrote a letter to his uncle, as to which he said not a word to either his father, or mother, or sisters. He thought that the letter was a good letter, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to show it; but he feared that either his father or mother would advise him not to send it, and he was ashamed to read it to Molly. He {{therefore}} sent the letter across the park the next morning by the gardener.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} vehemently: [...] "I do! Every atom and dreg of it! You make me hate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, {{or whatever}} it may be called, if it's that which has caused this deterioration in you. That a woman-poet, a woman-seer, a woman whose soul shone like a diamond--whom all the wise of the world <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> of, if they could have known you--should degrade herself like this!

5000|$|The {{music was}} written by Jule Styne with the lyrics by Frank Loesser. Composer Irving Berlin was a huge admirer of the song. Berlin {{reportedly}} said {{that of all the}} songs by other composers he <b>had</b> heard, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> most <b>proud</b> to <b>have</b> written [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You". Writing of Berlin's praise for the song, Loesser wrote in his diary, [...] "Irving Berlin came in today and spent a solid hour telling me that 'Walk' is the best song he ever heard. He played and sang it over, bar by bar, explaining why it's the best song he ever heard. I was flattered like crazy." ...|$|R
5000|$|They {{knew the}} vomit was no accident, {{it was an}} omen. They tore the paper into little pieces and dropped them onto the floor. It was still wet. Some of the pieces you couldnt read anymore, but they didnt seem to care. Somehow, ideas came from those torn slips. And sure enough, [...] "Perfect Goat" [...] did make it on the album, along with fifteen other tracks that Dr. Frankenstein <b>would</b> <b>have</b> surely <b>been</b> <b>proud</b> to <b>have</b> {{stitched}} together. Yes, these are new songs. Just like all good pop music, there is something familiar about them, something friendly. But as you listen, never forget that vomit is at their core: twenty long years of painful regurgitation.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 October 2015, Sergei Magnitsky was posthumously awarded 'Honourable Mention' at the Allard Prize for International Integrity ceremony. The Magnitsky family {{attended}} the ceremony and responded, [...] "Sergei <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> so <b>proud</b> and humbled by this nomination. He always strived to live {{his life in}} the best possible way, with honesty and integrity. Six years after his untimely and heartbreaking death, it is awards such as this that keep Sergei’s memory alive. Being nominated for the Allard Prize gives his whole family a huge sense of pride and once again asserts that his life was not sacrificed in vain. Our whole family is immensely grateful for the attention this award will give to the global Magnitsky justice campaign which emerged from our tragedy." ...|$|R
