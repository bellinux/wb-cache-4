5|$|Each period, {{and after}} each goal scored, play is {{restarted}} with a face-off. If a ball travels {{over the boards}} {{and outside of the}} playing area, play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that <b>which</b> <b>last</b> touched the ball.|$|E

50|$|After {{visiting his}} father, Keppler {{made his way}} to St. Louis in 1867 and renewed his career as an actor.

5|$|The Committee for the {{purposes}} of the Crown Office Act 1877 consists of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Privy Seal as well as a Secretary of State. The Committee <b>which</b> <b>last</b> met in 1988 is concerned with the design and usage of wafer seals.|$|E
5|$|Full {{meetings}} of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces {{his or her own}} engagement (<b>which</b> <b>last</b> happened on 23 November 1839, in the reign of Queen Victoria); or when there is a demise of the Crown, either by the death or abdication of the monarch. A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811, when George, Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament. The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the playing area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team <b>which</b> <b>last</b> touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest to the ball when it leaves the playing area.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} taifas {{in what is}} now Portugal {{after the fall of the}} Almoravid dynasty: the second Taifa of Mértola, <b>which</b> <b>lasted</b> from 1144 to 1151, the second Taifa of Silves, <b>which</b> <b>lasted</b> from 1144 to 1151 and the Taifa of Tavira <b>which</b> <b>lasted</b> from 1146 to 1150.

5|$|In December 2008, it was {{proposed}} to restart direct services between Aberystwyth in mid-Wales and London, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> ran in 1991, with Marylebone as the London terminus. Arriva Trains Wales announced a consultation for two services a day, following {{the route of}} the WSMR connecting with the Cambrian line at Shrewsbury. This idea was abandoned following objections by Wrexham & Shropshire.|$|E
5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined trachytic lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a trachytic lava dome <b>which</b> <b>last</b> erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment {{altered the}} process for electing United States Senators and changed the way {{vacancies}} would be filled. Under the original constitutional provision, state legislatures filled vacancies when a Senator left office {{before the end of}} the term; the Seventeenth Amendment provides that state legislatures can grant governors the right to make temporary appointments, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> until a special election is provided to fill the seat. The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor. It also had an immediate and dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate.|$|E

5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate their mothers at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E
5|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano has {{its origins}} in {{continental}} rifting—a long rupture in the Earth's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart. This incipient rifting has formed {{as a result of}} the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault, on its way to the Aleutian Trench. As the continental crust stretches, the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults. Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions. The rift zone has existed for at least 14.9million years, and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active, with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years. Tseax Cone, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> erupted in the 18th century, is the southernmost volcano in the province, while Prindle Volcano in easternmost-central Alaska, which erupted more than 10,000years ago, is generally considered the northernmost.|$|E
5|$|The {{property}} that makes neurons unique is {{their ability to}} send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals {{by means of an}} axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a pyramidal cell, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, <b>which</b> <b>last</b> less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.|$|E
