5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E
5|$|One such {{community}} was Linn City (originally named Robin’s Nest). Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore, Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills {{along the banks}} of the Willamette. Warehouses, homes, and mills were steadily added until 1861, when a fire destroyed several of the buildings. Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Flood of 1862 struck, wiping out the remaining buildings.|$|E

5|$|The St. Edmund {{memorial}} coins were minted {{in great}} quantities {{by a group}} of more than 70 moneyers, many of whom appear to have originated from continental Europe: over 1800 specimens were found <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> Cuerdale Hoard was discovered in Lancashire in 1840. The memorial coins were widely used within the Danelaw. Coins have mainly been found in the east of England, but the exact location of any of the mints they came from is not known with certainty, although scholars have assumed that they were made in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of a port in Rijeka dates back to 1281, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Council of the Republic of Venice {{reported}} a conflict of Venetian merchants and ship owners from Zadar and Rab. In 1719, the Port of Rijeka was granted a charter as a free port by Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI, and the first road connecting the port to the hinterland, the Caroline road, was completed in 1728. The inland connections were gradually improved by {{the construction of the}} Josephina and Louisiana roads in 1779 and 1810 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the crossing to vehicular traffic was underpinned <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s.

5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, {{another factor}} that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists {{was the fact that}} the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the villages of Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British villages of White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{suggestion was}} that the comets were all fragments of an earlier Sun-grazing comet. This idea was first proposed in 1880, and its plausibility was amply demonstrated <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Comet of 1882 broke up into several fragments after its perihelion passage. In 1888, Heinrich Kreutz published a paper showing that the comets of 1843 (C/1843 D1, the Great March Comet), 1880 (C/1880 C1, the Great Southern Comet), and 1882 (C/1882 R1, Great September Comet) were probably fragments of a giant comet that had broken up several orbits before. The comet of 1680 proved to be unrelated to this family of comets.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, when {{a scandal}} forced the {{original}} Republican nominee, Godlove Stein Orth, {{to drop out}} of the gubernatorial race, Harrison accepted the Republican Party's invitation to take his place on the ticket. Harrison centered his campaign on economic policy and favored deflating the national currency. He was ultimately defeated in a plurality by James D. Williams, losing by 5,084 votes out of a total 434,457 cast, but Harrison was able to build on his new prominence in state politics. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Railroad Strike of 1877 reached Indianapolis, he gathered a citizen militia to make a show of support for owners and management, and helped to mediate an agreement between the workers and management and to prevent the strike from widening.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Depression {{began in}} the 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E

5|$|Northcott {{joined the}} Australian Army as a reservist in 1908, before {{becoming}} a regular officer in 1912.

He {{was wounded in the}} landing at Gallipoli on Anzac Day and invalided to Egypt, the United Kingdom, and ultimately Australia, taking no further part in the fighting. After the war, Northcott served on a series of staff posts. He attended the Staff College, Camberley and Imperial Defence College and also spent time overseas as an exchange officer with the British Army and as a military attaché in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk {{began to}} concern itself with {{providing}} {{churches in the}} new towns and relatively thinly supplied Highlands, establishing a church extension committee in 1828. Led by Thomas Chalmers, by the early 1840s it had added 222 churches, largely through public subscription. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> Disruption occurred in 1843, and roughly a third of ministers and their congregations left the established church and its buildings to form the Free Church of Scotland, Chalmers' organisational skills helped the Free Church build over 700 new places of worship by 1847. The established church took time to recover, but embarked on a rival programme of church building, increasing its number of parishes from 924 in 1843 to 1,437 by 1909. The intense competition between different denominations {{led to the creation}} of grand churches with tall steeples and ultimately resulted in an oversupply of churches, which would be a financial burden to future generations.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> Silence was {{screened}} for Darryl F.

The company also considered a remake of the film starring Clint Eastwood, which eventually evolved into a largely unrelated project by Universal Pictures, Joe Kidd.|$|E
