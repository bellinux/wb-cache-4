25|$|There <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas {{do not agree with}} the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E

At a press conference following his signing, the English Rangers players attended however the Scottish players boycotted it. The chairman of the Rangers Supporters Association stated [...] "It's a sad day for Rangers, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people handing back their season tickets.

[...] As he predicted, Rangers fans responded by burning their season tickets; Celtic supporters claimed Johnston had betrayed Catholicism, calling him [...] "Judas".
