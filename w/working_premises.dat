Furthermore, during exploratory focus group discussions, one of the respondents lamented, “the premises provided by SIDO to women entrepreneurs are not enough to allow many women to incubate their business”. The responses indicate that business and technology incubators do very little in the provision of the working space to women entrepreneurs in the food processing industry.|$|E

The availability of <b>working</b> <b>premises</b> is pre-condition for women entrepreneurs obtain certificates from Tanzania Bureau Standards (TBS) and Tanzania Food and Drugs Association (TFDA), indicating that the quality of the food produced complies with international standards. The food products approved by TBS and TFDA attract more customers increasing sale’s volume and profit. However, most of the women entrepreneurs fail to meet basic requirements to obtain certificates of standards. During the focus group discussions, several respondents mentioned that {{it is very difficult to}} obtain certificates from TBS and TFDA due to lengthy procedures. They expressed that “we have to observe a lot of conditions and most of us we are processing food products at home premises”. Our findings are in line with those of Panda (2018) who observed complications with regulations, complex requirements to register, bureaucracy, and favouritism as impediments to the development of women entrepreneurship in developing countries. As food processing demands special premises in order to avoid contaminations and maintain proper hygiene for human consumption, our study recommends that business incubators should set up new sites to accommodate {{a large number of}} clients and eliminate the lack of <b>working</b> <b>premises.</b>|$|E

3000|$|MSEs in Ethiopia {{have also}} been confronted {{with a number of}} {{challenges}} that obstructed their success. Mekonnen et al. (2013) had pinpointed that inadequate infrastructure facilities, inadequate finance, poor managerial and technical skills, and inadequate <b>working</b> <b>premises</b> were the major challenges to MSEs’ successful operations followed by marketing problems, low support from respective institutions, inadequate supply of raw materials, and regulatory issues. According to Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (2006) study, most MSEs in Ethiopia face critical constraints both at the operation and start-up level. Some of these constraints include lack of access to finance, access to premise, infrastructure, training in entrepreneurial and management skills, information on business opportunities, and social and cultural factors particularly related to deficient entrepreneurial culture and excessive corruption. Devereux and Sharp (2006) as cited in Zeleke (2009), and Mbonyane [...] and Ladzani [...] (2011) identified that lack of access to finance is the most influential factor from among all adverse factors hindering the growth and development of the MSE sector in most countries. Furthermore, Haftu et al. (2009) found that lack of finance and working space rank high as the major constraints faced by {{a large proportion of the}} enterprises. This result is supported by Hailemichael (2014) and Amasu (2012) that <b>working</b> <b>premises,</b> marketing and financial factors were the major factors significantly affecting performance of MSEs in Addis Ababa.|$|E

To se odražava naročito jasno na sindromu bolnih križa, koji se pojavljuje naročito često kod rada s teškim fizičkim naporom u nepovoljnom položaju tijela.

The analysis of working places, methods of work, and working environment has shown that heavy physical work, the work requiring physiologically unfavorable attitudes, and bad microclimatic conditions are the cause of an increased incidence of rheumatic disorders.

The aim of this study was to assess the ozone level in ambient air and <b>working</b> <b>premises</b> in terms of its possible influence on human health. Methods. The study was based on the results obtained in Lithuanian conditions. Continuous ozone measurement data from the rural monitoring station in Preila over the period 1995 - 2011 were analyzed. More than 180, 000 hourly values were examined according to the requirements in the Directive 2008 / 50 /EC. The World Health Organization (WHO) and European Union indicators the Sum of Ozone Means Over 35 ppb (SOMO 35), the maximum daily 8 -hour mean concentration of ozone higher than 100 and 120 μg/m 3 were estimated. Indoor ozone concentrations in copying and welding rooms were evaluated. The ozone concentration was measured with the ozone analyzer O 341 M. Results. The frequency distribution of ozone hourly concentrations at the Preila station showed that less than 1 % of the data were higher than 120 μg/m 3 and 6 % of them higher than 100 μg/m 3, that could have the adverse effect on human health, during 1995 - 2011. The investigations made in <b>working</b> <b>premises</b> showed that near a copying machine the ozone concentration can reach 330 μg/m 3, however in the room, i. e. 0. 5 m from the machine, the average ozone concentration during automatic copying was 165 μg/m³ and during manual copying it was 50 μg/m³. Measurements in a welding room showed that the ozone concentration was in the range of 380 - 1, 850 μg/m 3 at the distance of 25 cm from the electrode and at the distance of 1 m from the source the ozone concentration decreased 2. 5 times. Conclusion. The danger of the ambient ozone level to human health practically was not observed in Lithuanian conditions. However, almost 6 % of the data exceed the new WHO guideline of 100 μg/m 3 during the measurement time. Indoor ozone during welding reached a higher level than during copying that can cause human health problems...|$|E

To achieve this purpose, descriptive research method was designed in order to identify the internal and external factors that affect the capital growth of MSEs.

In the process of answering the basic questions, structured questionnaire that include demographic profiles, characteristics of MSE owners and their enterprises, determinants that affect the performance of Micro and small entrepreneurs was designed in open-ended, closed ended and likert scales. In addition, semistructured interviews were conducted with top officials of the TVET, MSEDO, and OCSSCO) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics involved the use of frequencies and mean. Inferential statistics were used to observe the variation in the growth of capital among the different levels of each of the explanatory variables with the aid of SPSS.
