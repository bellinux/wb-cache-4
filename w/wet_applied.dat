5000|$|The oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} measures 219.7 xx 153.7 cm. The depiction of full-figure portraits in nature was a speciality of 18th-century English artists, especially Gainsborough who delighted in painting landscapes; Elizabeth with her love for the English countryside was the ideal model for him.The composition is diagonal {{and is in the}} grand manner genre. The NGA describes the work as [...] "freely painted" [...] and impressionistic in style. The sitter's garb and [...] "the windblown landscape ... reflect the strong romantic component in Gainsborough's artistic temperament ... Her chin and mouth are firm, definite, and sculptural, and her heavily drawn eyebrows give her a steady, composed, and dignified expression. There is a hint of romantic melancholy in her eyes, with their slightly indirect gaze ... The painting is executed in liquid paint, blended wet into <b>wet,</b> <b>applied</b> in many layers {{in order to create a}} rich and sumptuous effect, with thin washes in free-flowing brushstrokes for the details." ...|$|E

40|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{a public}} health problem that is easily prevented in many countries through having a salt iodization programme. However, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that particular population groups including infants and young children have a higher daily iodine dose than adults, whilst also reducing salt consumption in their diet. Whilst many iodine supplements are available, swallowing tablet supplements is physically difficult for young children, thus {{there is a need}} for the development of novel iodine delivery systems for paediatric patients. In this study a novel, ultra-fast dissolving, nanofiber based orodispersible film iodine delivery system manufactured using an electrospinning technique was developed. The potassium iodate (KIO 3) loaded poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) fibre orodispersible films dissolve within seconds on <b>wetting</b> (<b>applying</b> on the tongue) without the need of water consumption. The electrospinning process and KIO 3 loading did not alter the crystallinity and conformation of PEO. With high loading, KIO 3 nanocrystals present in the fibers. This formulation design allows easy administration of iodine for preventing childhood iodine deficiency. It has also described a novel and easy method for producing and harvesting nanocrystals of inorganic salts that can be potentially adopted for use in other relevant fields...|$|R

30|$|NAA-based DBR can be {{achieved}} by taking advantage of the fact that a <b>wet</b> etching <b>applied</b> after the anodization to enlarge the pore diameter (pore-widening step) has a different rate depending on the used anodization voltage [23]. Thus, by combining a cyclic anodization voltage with a subsequent pore-widening step, tunable in-depth modulation of the pore diameter and effective refractive index variations are obtained. Other authors have reported on the fabrication of DBR structures by applying a cyclic anodization voltage [19, 20, 24] although they did not stress the importance of the pore-widening step in order to obtain the photonic stop bands.|$|R
