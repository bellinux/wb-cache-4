2500|$|Saladin {{proceeded}} to take Nusaybin which offered no resistance. A medium-sized town, Nusaybin {{was not of}} great importance, but it was located in a strategic position between Mardin and Mosul and within easy reach of Diyarbakir. In the midst of these victories, Saladin received word that the Crusaders were raiding the villages of Damascus. He replied [...] "Let them... whilst they knock down villages, we are taking cities; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> <b>we</b> shall have all the more strength to fight them." [...] Meanwhile, in Aleppo, the emir of the city Zangi raided Saladin's cities {{to the north and}} east, such as Balis, Manbij, Saruj, Buza'a, al-Karzain. He also destroyed his own citadel at A'zaz to prevent it from being used by the Ayyubids if they were to conquer it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Go to Virginia Water in it," [...] said Jone, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>we</b> {{can go to}} the hotel. I made a mistake, but I've got {{to stand}} by it or be called a greenhorn." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{the best}} part of it all. Mr Hall is such a brick, that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from the Isle of Wight he is going to take us all in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought you'd do it," [...] said Mrs. March, {{smiling as}} if satisfied. [...] "You shall all go and help me, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>we</b> will have bread and milk for breakfast, {{and make it}} up at dinnertime." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pass {{round the}} wine, lads, till {{we come back}} again. I am taking Anderson to the colonel, who was captain of his troop.

6000|$|... "I quite {{agree with}} you, Millicent. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> <b>we</b> can see about entirely refurnishing it, and, perhaps, adding some rooms to it, {{and we need}} not go down until a {{complete}} change has been made. We shall {{be able to manage}} it somehow or other, and I quite agree with you that anything will be better than going back to the house {{for a day or two}} before the wedding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” the man said, “it {{was your}} own fault; {{we told you}} to stop. Anyhow, you had better keep still a bit. If you’re here <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> we’ll {{see what we can}} do.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember the Solomons," [...] she pressed. [...] "Remember the Ariel. Remember <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> from Malaita, {{where we}} picked Jerry up, to Tulagi, {{that he had}} a brother there, a nigger-chaser on a schooner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Robert, I {{have been}} {{thinking}} {{so much about the}} future, and I think that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> from our travels we ought to put aside almost all our money to do good with." ...|$|R

50|$|Mohyeldin {{suggested}} that the real Kyle may have had “racist tendencies” toward Iraqis and Muslims, which could have caused him to go on “some of these, you know, killing sprees in Iraq on assignment.” Host Joe Scarborough challenged Mohyeldin’s claim that Kyle went on killing sprees, and ended the segment saying, “All right, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>come</b> <b>back,</b> Ayman is going to kick around Santa Claus".|$|R
5000|$|Several of {{his closest}} friends spoke at his funeral, {{including}} Wilhelm Liebknecht and Friedrich Engels.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to Gloucester to-day, and to-morrow we are off for Buxton.
