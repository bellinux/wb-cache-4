5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} {{was not without}} its faults. One error occurred with the photographer improperly taking pictures of the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{was first}} fitted to Beaufighter Mk. VIF {{aircraft}} of No. 141 Squadron RAF in June 1943. They began operations using Serrate {{on the night}} of 14 June, and by 7 September had claimed 14 German fighters shot down, for 3 losses. The squadron was later handed to No. 100 Group RAF, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> special operations within Bomber Command including jamming and similar efforts. In spite of their successes, {{it was clear that the}} Beaufighter lacked the speed needed to catch the German aircraft, and Mosquitoes began to replace them late in 1943.|$|E

5|$|An Administrator was {{assisted}} {{by one or}} several Commandants (Duwei 都尉) also known as Chief Commandant, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> all local military affairs such as raising militias, suppressing bandit groups, and building beacon towers. The Commandants' salary-rank was Equivalent to 2,000-dan. After 30 AD, all Commandants who were not located in distant frontier commanderies were abolished, yet if the commandery was located along borders where raids and armed incursions by hostile nomadic groups were frequent, he was still appointed. A Commandant in an interior commandery could only be appointed temporarily to deal with crises as they arose. Each commandery also had secretaries, a treasurer, and an Official in Charge of Accounts who submitted annual reports to the imperial court on the Administrator's performance.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, White Star {{refitted}} Suevic, {{adding the}} capacity for 266 second-class passengers, after which {{she returned to her}} Australian route. In March 1924, she completed her 50th voyage on that route. In 1928, though, Suevic was showing her age, and White Star sold her to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S for £35,000, who renamed her Skytteren and sent her to Germaniawerft at Kiel to be converted into a whaling factory ship. She served with the Norwegian whaling fleets in Antarctic waters. 1936 AS Finnhval came under control of the Norwegian shipping agent Jørgen Krag <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> on behalf of the German Margarine Union. So until the war her hunting results were delivered to Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{dedicated}} {{to the memory of}} Ralph Vicinanza. He {{had been one of the}} co-executive producers attached to Game of Thrones, and died in his sleep from a cerebral aneurysm on September 25, 2010. Vicinanza was the literary agent <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> George R. R. Martin's foreign language rights, and (with Vince Gerardis) one of the co-founders of the management company Created By which aimed at developing feature films and television shows based on the works of Vicinanza's clients. He was instrumental in bringing Martin's work to the screen, recommending the books to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and leading the negotiations with HBO. He died a few days after HBO greenlighted the series.|$|E

5|$|The opening beauty pass {{of the new}} Enterprise was the {{responsibility}} of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action bluescreen elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise-D effects for Generations, but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50mm lens instead of the 35mm used for Generations because the smaller lens made the new Enterprises dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture {{a high level of}} detail with physical models rather than trying to recreate it by computer graphics.|$|E
5|$|Van Alen was {{respected}} {{in his field}} for {{his work at the}} Albemarle building at Broadway and 24th Street, designed in collaboration with his partner H. Craig Severance. Van Alen and Severance complemented each other, with Van Alen being an original, imaginative architect and Severance being a shrewd businessperson <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the firm's finances. However, the relationship between them became tense because of their disagreements on how best to run the firm. The breaking point came after a 1924 article in the Architectural Review that praised the building's design, giving attribution to Van Alen while ignoring Severance's role altogether; their association dissolved months later. This ended up being decisive for the design of the future Chrysler Building, since Severance had a more traditional architectural style and Van Alen had a more modern style.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{increased}} running time, budget and facilities, the team {{were able to}} include more cels in animations, as well as longer and more intricate action sequences. The film included difficult sequences that Watanabe could not do {{along with the rest}} of the film, so two guest directors were brought in for them: Hiroyuki Okiura, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the opening sequence, and Tensai Okamura, who created a cinematic Western shown at a drive-in theater during the film. Watanabe wanted to give the film an Arabic feel, in contrast to the series which often used New York and Hong Kong for inspiration. To this end, Watanabe went on a research trip to Morocco. The character Rashid was based on the guide who had shown the research team round the city. Working on the film was different for Watanabe when compared to the series in a positive way: while he had to put the entire story in a twenty-minute episode for the series, the team were able to create a longer, more detailed narrative.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, {{as well as}} thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} decades, Singapore grew {{to become an}} important port in the region. Its success was due to several reasons including {{the opening of the}} Chinese market, the advent of ocean-going steamships, the dramatic reduction in the time and cost of shipping goods to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and the production of rubber and tin in Malaya. Its status as a free port provided a crucial advantage over other colonial port cities in Batavia (now Jakarta) and Manila where tariffs were levied, and it drew many Chinese, Malay, Indian, and Arab traders operating in South-East Asia to Singapore. The later opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 would further boost trade in Singapore. By 1880, over 1.5 million tons of goods were passing through Singapore each year, with around 80% of the cargo transported by steamships. The main commercial activity was entrepôt trade which flourished under no taxation and little restriction. Many merchant houses were set up in Singapore mainly by European trading firms, but also by Jewish, Chinese, Arab, Armenian, American and Indian merchants. There were also many Chinese middlemen <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> most of the trade between the European and Asian merchants.|$|E
5|$|Maury Gertsman, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the {{cinematography}} {{for nearly}} all Universal Pictures films from the mid-1940s to mid-1950s, worked as director of photography on The Brute Man. Since the film focused on a disfigured serial killer, Gertsman sought to give the movie a dark, diseased look appropriate for the film's subject matter and urban setting. Although primarily a horror thriller film, Gertsman uses several film noir elements in his photography, including shadowed lighting, unbalanced compositions, and chiaroscuro contrasts between light and dark. As a result, The Brute Man features a bleak, at times dismal visual atmosphere. Hans J. Salter, who composed the scores {{for many of the}} Universal Pictures films of the 1940s and 1950s, worked as composer for The Brute Man as well. Salter's score for the film strongly resembled the music he composed for the Universal horror films Black Friday (1940) and The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944). Philip Cahn edited The Brute Man. Raymond Kessler and Ralph Slosser worked as dialogue director and assistant director, respectively, while John B. Goodman and Abraham Grossman worked as art directors. Other crew included Russell A. Gausman and Edward R. Robinson as set decorators, Joe Lapis as sound technician, Jack Pierce as make-up director, Carmen Dirigo as hair stylist, and Vera West as gowns supervisor.|$|E

5|$|The {{games have}} been complemented and {{expanded}} upon through other media. For Final Fantasy XIII, a small book {{of short stories}} titled Final Fantasy XIII - Episode Zero was released, first through the game's website {{and then as a}} print release in December 2009. It shows events prior to the game's opening. A second novella, Episode i, was published via XIII-2s official website, bridging the narrative gap between XIII and XIII-2. Alongside XIII-2s Japanese release, a book detailing events not shown or described in the game titled Fragments Before was released in December 2011 including Episode i; this would be followed up by Fragments After, released in June 2012. Only Episode i has received an official English release. Lightning Returns was also set to receive a prequel novel by Benny Matsuyama alongside the game's Japanese release in November 2013, however this was later cancelled due to the author falling ill. A three-part novella exclusive to Famitsu Weekly magazine titled Final Fantasy XIII Reminiscence: tracer of memories was released across June and July 2014. It was written by Daisuke Watanabe, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the scripts for the XIII games, and takes place immediately after the ending of Lightning Returns. Reminiscence was later released online.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E
5|$|Ranked {{below the}} Three Councillors of State were the Nine Ministers (Jiu qing 九卿), who each headed a {{specialized}} ministry.

The Minister of the Household (Guang lu xun 光祿勳) {{was in charge of the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. The Minister of the Guards (Weiwei 衛尉) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The Minister Coachman (Taipu 太僕) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants, as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces. The Minister of Justice (Tingwei 廷尉) was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and interpreting the law. The Minister Herald (Da honglu 大鴻臚) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court, such as nobles and foreign ambassadors. The Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正) oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces <b>who</b> <b>handled</b> tax revenues and set standards for units of measurement. The Minister Steward (Shaofu 少府) served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment.|$|E
