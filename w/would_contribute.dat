5|$|Alex Parker, {{the leader}} of the team that {{performed}} the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time and, along with its dark surface, <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to previous surveys failing to observe it.|$|E
5|$|In May 1982, President Ronald Reagan {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Centennial Commission, led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca, to raise the funds needed to complete the work. Through its fundraising arm, the Statue of Liberty–Ellis Island Foundation, Inc., the group raised more than $350million in donations. The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign. A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card, the company <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> one cent to the renovation of the statue. The campaign generated contributions of $1.7million to the restoration project.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Federal Government {{officials}} {{signed an}} agreement in Garowe with Puntland, which said that the Federal and Puntland authorities will work to form an integrated national army. In April 2015, another bilateral treaty stipulated that Puntland <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> 3,000 troops to the Somali National Army. In May 2015, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud and {{the heads of the}} Puntland, Jubaland and Interim South West Administrations signed a seven-point agreement in Garowe authorizing the immediate deployment of 3,000 troops from Puntland for the Somali National Army. The leaders also agreed to integrate soldiers from the other regional states into the SNA.|$|E

5|$|In {{its opening}} weekend, the film grossed $55.4 million in 3,505 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking No. 1 {{at the box}} office. The {{previous}} film earned $62.2 million in its opening weekend, but dropped 70% in its second weekend. The second film by comparison, dropped 60% in its second weekend. Behind , it was the second-highest gross for a film released over a Father's Day weekend. This surpassed industry expectations of a $45 million opening, following the disappointing response to the 2003 film. Universal believed word of mouth <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to the film breaking even eventually.|$|E

5|$|A 65-yard screen {{pass from}} Vince Evans to Walter Payton gave the Bears a 13–10 lead. The Buccaneers {{answered}} {{that with a}} drive that ended with an eight-yard touchdown reception by Isaac Hagins. This score, with 5:08 left in the game, put the Buccaneers ahead of the Bears and left them as the only remaining undefeated team in the league. It was the third consecutive loss for the Bears. Jerry Eckwood also contributed a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest running play in Buccaneers history to that point. A broken wrist suffered in this game <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to Eckwood's diminished performance later in the season.|$|E

5|$|A {{break from}} the studies came {{in the second half}} of 1892. After his father's death, he could not afford to attend {{university}} that semester. He worked briefly as a private tutor in the Skien district, and was paid to write in the newspaper Varden. On returning to his studies he worked as a Kristiania correspondent for the newspaper; eventually he also worked for Päivälehti. In 1901 he took over from Erik Vullum as obituarist and anniversary writer in Verdens Gang. In the next years he <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> extensively to publications such as Den 17de Mai, Nationalbladet, Nordmanns-Forbundets tidsskrift, Syn og Segn, Samtiden, Unglyden, Dagbladet, Verdens Gang and Tidens Tegn; these were mostly Liberal or Norwegian nationalist publications.|$|E
5|$|After {{stepping}} down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, {{and was named}} the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role {{was that of a}} figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In {{the second half of the}} decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Brasenose was {{a smaller}} {{community}} during the war, but it kept going. Once again, union with Lincoln College was discussed: {{but in other}} areas, temporary merger was more appropriate; thus, Brasenose and Christ Church fielded single sports teams. The College hosted military personnel {{as it had in}} the First World War; a Nissen hut was even set up in Deer Park. Brasenose sent a flood of undergraduates into the forces; in particular, the college's sporting, masculine ethos meant many joined the Royal Air Force. This <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> significantly to a high death total– 123 for the Allies and 1 for the Germans– more than in the First World War, although proportionately less. Many of Brasenose's sporting heroes died; among survivors were future Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie and cricketer Pieter van der Bijl.|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{expelled}} George of Poděbrady's {{troops from}} Silesia. Matthias's army was encircled and routed at Uherský Brod on 2 November, {{forcing him to}} withdraw to Hungary. Matthias soon ordered the collection of an extraordinary tax without holding a Diet, raising widespread discontent among the Hungarian Estates. He visited Emperor Frederick in Vienna on 11 February 1470, hoping the Emperor <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to {{the costs of the}} war against Poděbrady. Although the negotiations lasted for a month, no compromise was worked out. The Emperor also refused to commit himself to promoting Matthias's election as King of the Romans. After a month, Matthias left Vienna without taking formal leave of Frederick III.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{the limited}} scope of Operation Summer '95, the Split Agreement became a {{fundamental}} instrument to change the overall strategic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where Bosnian Serbs had had the upper hand {{since the beginning of}} the Bosnian war, as well as in Croatia, where the front lines had been largely static since the 1992 Sarajevo armistice. As Operation Summer '95 concluded, the RSK and Republika Srpska changed their priority from smashing the Bihać pocket to fending off a possible Croatian offensive to capture Knin (advancing from the recently gained territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina). RSK leaders Milan Martić and Mile Mrkšić agreed with UN Special Representative Yasushi Akashi to withdraw from the Bihać area on 30 July, hoping the move <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to averting the Croatian attack. Albeit, the attack materialized days later as Operation Storm, a decisive victory to the HV in the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, American International Pictures founders James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff hired European talent agent Flavio Lucisano to {{look for}} Italian {{commercial}} films for them after the large success of the Italian feature Hercules (1958). In February 1963, American International Pictures {{made a deal with}} the Italian film production company Galatea that they <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to a minimum of nine co-productions in the next eight years. Black Sabbath follows many production trends of Italian films of the era. These co-productions were influenced by the lack of large film stars in Italy. To avoid high costs or larger stars, producers created anthology films involving three or four short narratives whose combined running time was that of a regular feature film, as in Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (1963). A second trend was to match an up-and-coming actor or a much older actor with a European ingenue actress, as in Spy in Your Eye which paired Pier Angeli and Dana Andrews. The third trend was the move towards making Westerns and horror films which were less expensive to produce than the previous sword and sandal films.|$|E

Jansz asked Henny Vrienten, a professional musician and composer who had previously collaborated with Jansz, if he would join the band. Vrienten initially refused as he felt it wasn’t advantageous to his career, but later changed his mind. He <b>would</b> then <b>contribute</b> to the three last tracks on Doe Maar’s second album Skunk. He <b>would</b> eventually <b>contribute</b> to the songs 32 Jaar, Smoorverliefd, and De Laatste Keer.|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as human blood types. Ford's work <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|Monolith Soft {{was founded}} by Tetsuya Takahashi, a {{developer}} who had previously worked at Nihon Falcom and later at Square, in which the latter was merged into Enix in 2003 to form Square Enix. While at Square, {{he and his wife}} Kaori Tanaka (also known as Soraya Saga) <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> to the development of multiple titles including entries in the Final Fantasy series. Following their work on Final Fantasy VI, Takahashi and Tanaka created a proposal for Final Fantasy VII; while deemed to dark for the Final Fantasy series, they were allowed to develop it as their own project titled Xenogears. Takahashi's ambition and drive prompted Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, then Executive Vice President at Square, to appoint him as director. Takahashi also wrote the script with Tanaka. Following the release of Xenogears, Takahashi became dissatisfied with Square's business approach at the time, which prioritized their major intellectual properties including Final Fantasy. This left Takahashi with no funding or creative room to develop further independent projects or continue his planned Xenogears series.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members <b>would</b> <b>contribute</b> funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E
