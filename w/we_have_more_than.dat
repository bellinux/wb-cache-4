[...] According to Ernesto Ruiz, Chief Executive Officer of Aeroman, [...] "Aeroman {{is a completely}} separate entity and is not impacted in any material way by the CCAA filing in Canada. We are extremely pleased with how well Aeroman is [...] doing; we are adding a new hangar to accommodate three new lines for narrow body aircraft that will be operational {{by the end of}} March 2012." [...] Mr. Ruiz also said, [...] "We have some 1,800 employees either working on the aircraft or in support functions. [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 200 technicians in training for these new lines of production, which will bring Aeroman to more than 2,000 employees once they are in operation." ...|$|E

6000|$|... --Who says <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the {{slightest}} veneer of civilization coated over our raw savagery {{when a group}} of living men can ask such a question of a man about to die and whom they are to see die? ...|$|E

60|$|But {{even our}} whispers {{ran up the}} rocks in mysterious murmurs till at last they died away in long-drawn sighs of sound. Echoes are {{delightful}} and romantic things, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough of them in that dreadful gulf.|$|R
60|$|Of {{the fish}} called the sturgeon, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> can be {{consumed}} by all our company; but one cannot endure the flavor day after day, and therefore {{is it that}} we use it for food only when we cannot get any other.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the town}} mansion of the noble family beneath whose roof at Beaumanoir <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once {{introduced}} the reader, to gain whose courtyard {{was at this}} moment the object of emulous coachmen, and to enter whose saloons was to reward the martyr-like patience of their lords and ladies.|$|E
6000|$|It was no easy {{matter to}} make the voice heard in such a gale and turmoil of seas, but {{the captain of the}} Fusilier managed to give his ship's name and {{intended}} destination. Then he shouted, [...] "How many can you carry? <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a hundred souls on board; more than sixty of them women and children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of powder, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a ton and a half, and if {{the siege}} were {{to be a long}} one we might require ten times as much. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> not <b>more</b> <b>than</b> eight rounds of shot for each gun, and <b>we</b> ought to <b>have</b> at least fifty for the heavy pieces, and twenty for those {{defending}} the path up the hill." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{know that}} selling {{a house is}} goofy, and we {{recognize}} that most people can't do it", admitted Kevin Salwen. [...] "We never encourage anybody to sell their house. That was just the thing that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough of. For others it may be time, or lattes, or iTunes downloads, or clothes in their closet. But everyone <b>has</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> enough of something.” [...] He clarified: ...|$|R
30|$|In both Banach and metric spaces [1, 5], the pointwise {{contraction}} mappings have at most one fixed point. But in {{the case}} of G-monotone pointwise contraction mappings, <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one fixed point. Indeed Jachymski [8] proved that G-contractions have a fixed point in each component of elements that are compatible. Since we do not assume the weak connectivity of the digraph G, <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one component which implies the possibility to <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one fixed point.|$|R
60|$|Not less {{interesting}} to Nazinred was {{the community in}} the midst of which he found himself, for, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once indicated, our Indian was intellectually far in advance of his fellows, and the opportunity he now had of observing closely the life of the men-of-the-ice in all its details could not be otherwise than full of interest to an inquiring and large-minded man.|$|E
60|$|Ant. What is't, Ventidius? it out-weighs them all; Why, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> conquered Cæsar now: My queen's {{not only}} innocent, but loves me.

Down on thy knees, blasphemer as thou art, And ask {{forgiveness}} of wronged innocence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! my boy," [...] {{the gentleman}} said, [...] "you {{have asked the}} only thing, perhaps, which I should feel obliged to refuse you. Already <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> our number, and to avoid the importunity of the many who wish to go, or of my {{powerful}} friends who desired to place sons or relations in my charge, I have been obliged to swear that I would take no other sailor, {{in addition to those}} already shipped.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{swear it}} would be," [...] I insisted, with a convincing force {{that left her}} staring at me and {{wondering}} whence I derived so much assurance. [...] "We must wait. From now till Christmas <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> two months. In two months much may befall. As a last resource we may consider communication with the Lord Giovanni. But it is a forlorn hope, Madonna, and so we will leave it until all else has failed us." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'October 11th.--A topsail {{schooner}} in sight, between Ambrym and Paama--one {{of those}} kidnapping vessels. I have {{any amount of}} (to me) conclusive evidence of downright kidnapping. But I don't think I could prove any case in a Sydney Court. They have no names painted on some of their vessels, and the natives can't catch nor pronounce {{the names of the}} white men on board. They describe their appearance accurately, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> suspicions about some of these fellows.|$|E

5000|$|Competition and Costing: While Mayor of Indianapolis in the mid-1990s, Stephen Goldsmith spearheaded {{a program}} to privatize city {{services}} through managed competition, improving efficiencies and cutting unnecessary costs. “As {{a result of the}} recognition we received from the Innovations Award, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3,000 officials from around the country and beyond coming to see how we did it,” said Goldsmith. Mayor Goldsmith went on to serve {{as the director of the}} Innovations in Government Program, overseeing the Innovations Awards program. He later served as deputy mayor of New York City.|$|R
6000|$|Marion was silent. This had not {{occurred}} to her before. But love {{is not to be}} turned from its object by trifles. She was all that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once described her to be; but she was not a meta-physician or a philosopher, capable of comprehending and explaining occult mysteries. Enough for her if she loved Miles and Miles loved her, and then, even if he did not deserve her love, she would remain true--secretly but unalterably true--to him as the needle is to the pole! ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Ashweesha, and her father, Sidi Cadua, perished {{under the}} rod and the bow-string; and Hadji Baba, the story-teller, {{continued}} {{to tell stories}} and to jest {{to the end of}} his days. How the Deys tolerated him has ever remained a matter of surprise to the thoughtful. Ziffa, his naughty daughter, became a wife and a mother, in connexion with three other wives, who were also mothers, and belonged to the Turk whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once mentioned as the captain of the port.|$|E
60|$|Now it so {{happened}} that the shouts and yells, to which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> once made reference in this chapter, attracted {{a band of}} savages who had been put to flight by Henry Stuart's party. These rascals, not knowing what {{was the cause of}} so much noise up on the heights, and, being much too well acquainted with the human voice in all its modifications to fancy that ghosts {{had anything to do with}} it, cautiously ascended towards the cavern, just a few minutes after the disappearance of John Bumpus and his companions.|$|E

We were absent from Mota about seven years, during which time we visited Santa Cruz, and many of the Solomon Isles. Mr. Atkin spent three weeks in one of the isles, and Mr. Brooke in another, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> thirty natives of the Solomon Islands on board, {{including}} old scholars, when we left Ulava, the last island of the Solomon group at which we called.|$|R

60|$|They {{returned}} the moon last night, and I was SO happy! I {{think it is}} very honest of them. It slid down and fell off again, but I was not distressed; {{there is no need to}} worry when one has that kind of neighbors; they will fetch it back. I wish I could do something to show my appreciation. I would like to send them some stars, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> we can use. I mean I, not we, for I can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things.|$|E

I will comfort my soul, by telling my beads over the kitchen-fire, and for every Paternoster my wife shall give thee a rasher of kid, and for every Ave a tumbler of Augsburg, which Our Lady forget me if I did not myself {{purchase}} but yesterday se'nnight from the pious fathers of the Convent of St. Florian!" ...|$|E
