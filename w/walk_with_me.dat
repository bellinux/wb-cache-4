25|$|Although it {{has long}} been {{reported}} that Fire <b>Walk</b> <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> was greeted at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival with booing and jeers from the audience, co-writer Robert Engels denies that this event ever happened.

25|$|The 1992 film Twin Peaks: Fire <b>Walk</b> <b>with</b> <b>Me</b> is a prequel to the TV series. It {{tells of}} the {{investigation}} into the murder of Teresa Banks and the last seven days in the life of Laura Palmer. Director David Lynch and most of the television cast returned for the film, with the notable exceptions of Lara Flynn Boyle, who declined to return as Laura's best friend Donna Hayward and was replaced by Moira Kelly, and Sherilyn Fenn due to scheduling conflicts. Also, Kyle MacLachlan returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot about five hours of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes. Most of the deleted scenes feature additional characters from the television series who ultimately did not appear in the finished film. Around ninety minutes of these scenes are included in the complete series Blu-ray that was released on July 29, 2014.|$|E

The band incorporates thrash metal elements, which was shown as a direction on Resolution and Wrath.|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come <b>Walk</b> <b>With</b> <b>Me,</b> Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound like anyone else." ...|$|E
