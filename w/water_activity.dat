5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable and breathing gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
25|$|Solutes {{in water}} also affect <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> that affects many {{chemical}} reactions {{and the growth}} of microbes in food. <b>Water</b> <b>activity</b> can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water. Solutes in water lower water activity—this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of <b>water</b> <b>activity.</b> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.|$|E

The study {{focuses on}} the role of <b>water</b> <b>activities</b> in the {{advancement}} of environmental literacy in grade six learners. The study is important as South Africa is experiencing a water crisis due to below average rainfall, overpopulation and poor management of water sources. The implementation of <b>water</b> <b>activities</b> in primary and secondary school education is needed for the development of environmentally literate citizens who understand the connection between the environment, available water and poverty and who possess the skills to sustain water sources. Environmental problems can be solved through environmental literacy (UNESCO, 1994 : 11). The purpose of the study is to determine how environmental literacy can be advanced by means of <b>water</b> <b>activities</b> carried out by grade six learners. The study is quantitative and a before- and after test questionnaire was used to compile data from an experimental and control group. Five schools that are located near water sources took part in the research.

25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality for so long that, in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E
25|$|Surfing is also {{a popular}} <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> in Indonesia and the sites are {{recognised}} as world class. The well-known sports are mostly located on the southern, Indian Ocean side of Indonesia, for example, the large oceanic surf breaks on southern Java. However, the north coast does not receive the same surf from the Java Sea. Surf breaks can be found all the way along Sumatra, down to Nusa Tenggara, including Aceh, Bali, Banten, Java, Lombok, the Mentawai Islands, and Sumbawa. Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers are came from abroad, especially Australia and United States. However, the seed of local surfing enthusiast began develop in Bali and West Java's Pelabuhan Ratu and Pangandaran beach, mostly came from nearby cities of Jakarta and Bandung. On Bali, there are about 33 surf spots, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of Nusa Lembongan. In Sumbawa, Hu'u and Lakey Beach in Cempi Bay are popular surfing spots among surfing enthusiast. Sumatra is the second island, with the most number of surf spots, with 18 altogether. The common time for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds tend {{to come from the}} west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.|$|E

2500|$|Mixing is a {{critical}} step in batter preparation since overmixing causes the gluten to develop excessively and create a batter with too high of a viscosity {{that is difficult to}} pour and does not expand easily. A thick batter that is difficult spreading in the baking iron has an increased <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> of around 0.85. The increased viscosity made it harder for water to evaporate from the waffle causing an increase in <b>water</b> <b>activity.</b> The control waffles with a softer texture had a <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> of 0.74 after cooking. The Aw is less because the softer texture allows the water to evaporate. With an increased storage time, waffle physical and textural properties changes regardless of the batter viscosity. [...] Aged waffles shrink because air bubbles leak out and the structure starts to condense. Hardness and viscosity also increases as time goes by. Aged waffle samples displayed a starch retrogradation peak that increased with storage time {{due to the fact that}} more crystalline structures were present. Starch retrogradation is mentioned previously in this paper. The enthalpy value for melting of starch crystals increased with storage time as well.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nutrient}} content of mayonnaise (>50% edible oil, 9–11% salt, 7–10% {{sugar in the}} aqueous phase) makes it suitable as a food source for many spoilage organisms. A set of condition such as pH between 3.6 and 4.0, and low <b>water</b> <b>activity</b> a'w of 0.925, restricts the growth of yeasts, a few bacteria and molds. Yeasts of the genus Saccharomyces (Lactobacillus fructivorans and Z. bailii) are the species responsible for the spoilage of mayonnaise. The characteristics of spoilage caused by Z.bailli are product separation and a [...] "yeasty" [...] odor. A study suggests that adding encapsulated cells of Bifidobacterium bifidum and B. infantis prolongs the life of mayonnaise up to 12 weeks without microorganism spoilage.|$|E
2500|$|The 'Special Regions assessment' says of them: [...] "Although {{no single}} model {{currently}} {{proposed for the}} origin of RSL adequately explains all observations, they are currently best interpreted as being due to the seepage of water at > 250 K, with [...] (<b>water</b> <b>activity)</b> unknown and perhaps variable.

There are other features on Mars with characteristics similar to RSL, but their relationship to possible liquid water is much less likely." [...] They were first reported in 2011. They were already suspected as involving flowing brines back then, as all the other models available involved liquid water in some form.|$|E
