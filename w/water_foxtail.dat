50|$|Alopecurus geniculatus is {{a species}} of grass known by the common name <b>water</b> <b>foxtail</b> or marsh foxtail.It is native to much of Eurasia and {{introduced}} into North America, South America, and Australia. It grows in moist areas.|$|E
50|$|This {{plant was}} first {{collected}} in 1981 during a survey for the rare Limnanthes floccosa ssp. grandiflora, the big-flowered woolly meadowfoam. It {{was described as}} a new species in 1986. The plant grows only in the Agate Desert of Jackson County and the Illinois Valley of Josephine County in southwestern Oregon. It occurs in vernally wet habitat types, including vernal pools and adjacent mounds and wet floodplains. One population of the plant occurs at Rogue Valley International-Medford Airport, where soil has been deposited over hardpan such that conditions are similar to vernal pool margins, allowing it to take hold there. Other plants that {{can be found in the}} vernal pool and floodplain habitat types include Limnanthes floccosa (woolly meadowfoam), Alopecurus geniculatus (<b>water</b> <b>foxtail),</b> Deschampsia danthonioides (annual hairgrass), Danthonia californica (California oatgrass), Poa scabrella (pine bluegrass), and Brodiaea spp. (brodiaeas or clusterlilies).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop an eco-friendly control method for <b>water</b> <b>foxtail</b> in the field sowing barley seeds before rice harvesting. When sea water was applied pre-emergent, 1 and 2 leaves, little injury was observed on barley. Percent of <b>water</b> <b>foxtail</b> control with sea water (100 %) was more than 50 % at 1 leaf application timing. When sodium chloride was applied 400, 800 and 1, 600 kg ha- 1, little injury was observed on barley. Percent of <b>water</b> <b>foxtail</b> control with sodium chloride was 36 - 44 % at 30 days after sowing. When ferrous sulfate was applied at 400, 800 and 1, 600 kg ha- 1, emergent injury wa...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePotato {{has become}} one of the primary cash crops in the arid region of the Loess Plateau. However, what and how cereal crops to rotate with potato is better for the farmer’s income and {{environment}} is unclear now. 11 potato based rotation systems were simulated in Yulin, using EPIC model based on local information. Results showed 1) Though mean potato yield decreased from 6. 84 to 5. 38 t/hm 2, the mean value of farmer’s gross income increased from 12807 to 20185 Yuan/hm 2, when the frequency of potato increased from 0. 25 to 0. 50 for potato based rotation sequence. 2) By comparing, spring maize was better to increase potato yield, while it used more <b>water</b> than <b>foxtail</b> millet and broomcorn millet; Foxtail millet was one of the better preceding crops for potato, and its effects on potato yield was depended on its sequence in potato based rotation system. 3) Comparing with spring maize/potato system, foxtail millet/potato and spring maize/potato/foxtail millet/potato were two better rotation systems to use soil water sustainably and to increase farmer’s gross income for a long period in the arid region of the Loess Plateau...|$|R
40|$|Summary 	The thesis {{studied the}} effect of water deficit on gas {{exchange}} in young plants sorghum and foxtail. These crops could replace maize cultivation in some areas, because their use is similar. Our country is currently facing shortage of rainfall. In 2015, this phenomenon was very noticeable. Therefore, {{it is appropriate to}} see how the plants of sorghum and <b>foxtail</b> respond to <b>water</b> deficit during their ontogenetic development. On the water deficit are very sensitive plants {{in the early stages of}} growth, and therefore the influence of water deficit was observed on young plants of sorghum and foxtail. 	Plant genotypes 121, 304, Ruzrok Red and Plant foxtail were divided into four variants: KK (fully irrigated throughout the experiment) KS (14 days full of grout, 10 days water deficit, 4 days full dressing), SK (10 days water deficit, 18 days full of dressing), SS (10 days water deficit, four days filled with grout, water deficit 10 days, four days full of topping). The speed of exchange of gases were measured in the greenhouse device LCpro+ and chlorophyll fluorescence apparatus OS 1 - FL. The rate of photosynthesis and transpiration and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured in the morning. The difference between the measured values of the rate of photosynthesis and transpiration value was calculated water use efficiency (WUE). 	Most sensitive to water deficit responded genotype 121 which had a value of water use efficiency (WUE) 9. 95 (10 - 3) and also had the genotype and the lowest value of chlorophyll fluorescence and 0. 765. Resistant to <b>water</b> deficit seems <b>foxtail</b> plants, which had the lowest photosynthesis difference between control and stressed variant in the range of 14. 59 mikromol CO 2. m- 2. s- 1 (SS) to 15. 38 mikromol CO 2. m- 2. s- 1 (KK). At the same time it also foxtail lowest difference between chlorophyll fluorescence variant KK (0. 814) and SS variant (0. 781). From the perspective of transpiration as most resistant to <b>water</b> deficit appeared <b>foxtail</b> (0. 08 mmol H 2 O. m- 2. s- 1 (SS) to 2. 13 mmol H 2 O. m- 2. s- 1 (KS)). Conversely, the least resistant genotype was 121, which was in the control variant 1. 17 mmol H 2 O. m- 2. s- 1 and stressed 1. 50 mmol H 2 O. m- 2. s- 1...|$|R
