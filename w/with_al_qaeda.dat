500|$|He was {{questioned}} {{several times over}} the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as [...] "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell {{for the next two weeks}} and questioned on a number of occasions. Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact <b>with</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators pulled on the collar of his hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be electrocuted and executed. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{disagreed}} {{strongly with}} the plurality's determination that {{the legality of}} the charges against Hamdan are doubtful because he was charged [...] "not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded ... but with an 'agreement' the inception of which long predated ... the [...] ". He lambasted the plurality for second-guessing the Executive's judgment, arguing that the Court's disagreement was based upon [...] "little more than its unsupported assertions" [...] and constituted [...] "an unprecedented departure from the traditionally limited role of the courts with respect to war and an unwarranted intrusion on executive authority". Thomas further disagreed with the plurality's assumption that the date of the enactment of the AUMF constituted the start of war, suggesting that Osama bin Laden's declaration of jihad in August 1996 could be considered a declaration of war. Under this view, the enactment by Congress of the AUMF did not mark the beginning of the conflict <b>with</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> but rather authorized the Executive to use force to combat it. Additionally, Thomas wrote that under the common law of war, which is [...] "flexible and evolutionary in nature", war courts are permitted a degree of latitude in their jurisdiction. In holding otherwise, the plurality failed to properly defer to the judgment of the Executive and military commanders.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 September 2001, at Camp David, U.S. {{president}} George W.

[...] And the American people must be patient. [...] I'm going to be patient." [...] Shortly after, the White House said the president regretted use of the term crusade, as it might have been misunderstood as reference to the historical Crusades; the word crusade was not used again. On 20 September 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of Congress, George Bush said, [...] "Our war on terror begins <b>with</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> but it does not end there.

2500|$|U.S. President Barack Obama {{touched on}} the subject of combat drones in a speech on Counterterrorism {{delivered}} on 23 May 2013 at the National Defense University. [...] "It is a hard fact that US strikes have resulted in civilian casualties," [...] he said, adding, [...] "These deaths will haunt us. But as commander-in-chief I must weigh these heartbreaking tragedies against the alternative. To do nothing in the face of terrorist networks would invite far more civilian casualties." [...] Obama said new guidance allowed targeting only those terrorists posing [...] "a continuing and imminent threat to the American people", which administration officials said meant only individuals planning attacks on the U.S. homeland or against U.S. persons abroad. Obama defended the use of drones as just because America [...] "is at war <b>with</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda,</b> the Taliban and their associated forces". To stop terrorists from gaining a foothold, drones will be deployed according to Obama, but only when there is an imminent threat; no hope of capturing the targeted terrorist; [...] "near certainty" [...] that civilians won't be harmed; and [...] "there are no other governments capable of effectively addressing the threat". Never will a strike be punitive.|$|E
