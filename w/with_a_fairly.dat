5|$|The E3 Harelbeke {{takes place}} on roads in Flanders, {{starting}} and ending {{in the town of}} Harelbeke. The primary difficulty in the race is the series of short climbs known as hellingen, some of which are cobbled; most of these came in the middle part of the race, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> flat final part.|$|E
5|$|Debuting {{to strong}} viewing figures and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> {{positive}} critical reception, Scott & Bailey ran from 29 May 2011 until 3 July {{over the course}} of six episodes. The second series premiered 12 March 2012 and consisted of eight episodes. A third series was announced 28 May 2012, began filming November 2012, and premiered on 3 April 2013. In August 2013, it was announced that a fourth series had been commissioned, with production set to begin in the spring of 2014. With filming several months earlier in the year, series 4 began broadcasting on ITV on 10 September 2014 and finished on 29 October 2014. On 31 July 2015, ITV renewed Scott & Bailey for a three-part fifth series.|$|E
5|$|The smalltail shark is a slender-bodied species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> long, pointed snout. The leading {{margin of}} each nostril is {{enlarged}} into a narrow, pointed lobe. The large, circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes, and behind them {{are a series of}} prominent pores. The mouth bears short furrows at the corners and contains 13–15 tooth rows on either side of both jaws (usually 14 upper and 13 lower). The upper teeth are tall and triangular with strong serrations, becoming increasing oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are comparatively narrower and more upright, with finer serrations. The five pairs of gill slits are short.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensification}} trend {{picked up}} {{again the next}} day <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July15. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. On July16, Emily strengthened considerably, making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form {{in the month of}} July with peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), the earliest known Category 5 in the Atlantic basin. Initially at this point Emily was thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category5 hurricane. The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category4 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July17, the Cayman Islands. Hurricane Emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30UTC on July18. Sustained winds were 135mph (215km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{integrated}} FET or MOSFET op-amps approximate {{more closely}} the ideal op-amp than bipolar ICs {{when it comes}} to input impedance and input bias currents.

25|$|In {{comparison}} to later aircraft, the Vampire had a relatively disorganised cockpit {{that in some}} aspects lacked ergonomic measures; such as the fuel gauges being difficult for the pilot to observe without pulling the control column back. A few controls, such as the low-pressure fuel cock, were known for being difficult to move or were otherwise obstructed by other controls. The pilot was provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> favourable external view, in part aided by the relatively small size of the Vampire.|$|E
25|$|In 1996 the {{government}} of Guatemala and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, the guerilla movement, signed a peace accord which ended 36years of a civil, guerilla war. This conflict left over 100,000 Guatemalans dead and created over 1million internally displaced refugees. This recent tumultuous history, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> new constitution written in 1985 and then again amended in 1993, can explain a lack of information regarding water and sanitation, as well as low service coverage.|$|E

25|$|Howard {{called a}} snap {{election}} for October 1998, three months sooner than required. The Coalition actually lost the national two-party preferred vote to Labor, suffering a 14-seat swing. However, the uneven {{nature of the}} swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12). Howard himself finished just short of a majority on the first count in his own seat, and was only assured of reelection on the ninth count. He ultimately finished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> comfortable 56 percent of the two-party preferred vote.|$|E
25|$|Both {{hydrogenation}} and dehydrogenation of LOHCs requires catalysts. It {{was demonstrated}} that replacing hydrocarbons by hetero-atoms, like N, O etc. improves reversible de/hydrogenation properties. The temperature required for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of drops significantly with {{increasing numbers of}} heteroatoms. Among all the N-heterocycles, the saturated-unsaturated pair of dodecahydro-N-ethylcarbazole (12H-NEC) and NEC has been considered as a promising candidate for hydrogen storage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> large hydrogen content (5.8wt%). The figure on the top right shows dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of the 12H-NEC and NEC pair. The standard catalyst for NEC to 12H-NEC is Ru and Rh based. The selectivity of hydrogenation can reach 97% at 7 MPa and 130°C-150°C. Although N-Heterocyles can optimize the unfavorable thermodynamic properties of cycloalkanes, {{a lot of issues}} remain unsolved, such as high cost, high toxicity and kinetic barriers etc.|$|E

At the far northeast is a remnant of Lake Texcoco and an artificial lake was built here as part of the Parque del Puebla to serve as an ecological reserve. The climate is temperate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>fairly</b> cold winter and rain mostly falling between June and October.
