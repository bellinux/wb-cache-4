They had no faith in {{him that he would}} become successful, and instead wanted him to become a doctor or a lawyer. Saher's brother once took him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to do it the bad <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> {{that the only way to}} achieve success is if you respect your music and respect yourself.|$|E
500|$|Lord Phillips {{noted that}} expert {{witnesses}} (unlike witnesses giving evidence of facts) {{had volunteered to}} give evidence and were doing so for payment. [...] He saw [...] "no justification" [...] for the assumption that experts would be discouraged from providing their services {{if they could be}} sued. As for the effect on an expert's willingness to give frank evidence, there was no empirical evidence either <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> However, a witness of integrity would concede a change of view where necessary to do so and ought not to be concerned about being sued.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing the entire thing here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with." [...] When questioned on why the band took the approach they did, he stated, [...] "We just had a particular atmosphere that we were working in that inspired the particular {{kind of things that}} were on the album." [...] Author Domenic Priore notes that when the Beach Boys were taken out of professional studios, [...] "the discipline of the clock, rates and overtime disappeared".|$|E

2500|$|Wisconsin State Assembly member Roger Rivard {{became the}} subject of {{controversy}} in October 2012 because of his 2011 comment about a case against a high school senior for raping a 14-year-old girl. He said that when he was a teenager his father had warned him that, [...] "Some girls rape easy". Rivard later told the Journal-Sentinel that his words had been taken out of context and that [...] "it was advice to me, telling me, 'If you're going to , you may have consensual sex that night and then the next morning it may be rape.' So the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> it was, 'Just remember, Roger, some girls, they rape so easy. It may be rape the next morning.'" [...] Rivard lost the election to Democrat Stephen Smith.|$|E
2500|$|Brando {{was an avid}} {{student and}} proponent of Stella Adler, from whom he learned the {{techniques}} of the Stanislavski system. This technique encouraged the actor to explore {{both internal and external}} aspects to fully realize the character being portrayed. Brando's remarkable insight and sense of realism were evident early on. Adler used to recount that when teaching Brando, she had instructed the class to act like chickens, and added that a nuclear bomb was about to fall on them. Most of the class clucked and ran around wildly, but Brando sat calmly and pretended to lay an egg. Asked by Adler why he had chosen to react this <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I'm a chicken—what do I know about bombs?" [...] Despite being commonly regarded as a Method actor, Brando disagreed. He claimed to have abhorred Lee Strasberg's teachings: ...|$|E

It's another example of how different constituencies are working together. Much of this was initiated by Charlie Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee in New York and other groups within the labor movement." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1890, Peter von Bradke {{published}} Concerning Method and Conclusions of Aryan (Indogermanic) Studies, {{in which}} he identified the same division (Trennung) as did Brugmann, but he defined {{it in a different}} <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that the original Indo-Europeans had two kinds of gutturaler Laute, [...] "guttural sounds" [...] the gutturale oder velare, und die palatale Reihe, [...] "guttural or velar, and palatal rows", each of which were aspirated and unaspirated. The velars were to be viewed as gutturals in an engerer Sinn, [...] "narrow sense". They were a reiner K-Laut, [...] "pure K-sound". Palatals were häufig mit nachfolgender Labialisierung, [...] "frequently with subsequent labialization". The latter distinction led him to divide the palatale Reihe into a Gruppe als Spirant and a reiner K-Laut, typified by the words satem and centum respectively. Later in the book he speaks of an original centum-Gruppe, from which on the north of the Black and Caspian Seas the satem-Stämmen, [...] "satem tribes", dissimilated among the Nomadenvölker or Steppenvölker, distinguished by further palatalization of the palatal gutturals.|$|E
2500|$|Casting {{all of the}} {{characters}} in The French Kissers took place over three months. Sattouf cast the teenage characters through casting agent Stéphane Batut [...] whose team he described as [...] "experts in casting teenagers" [...] and chose from taped auditions of 500 Parisian high school students. He did not want to work with professional actors who he feared would be egotistical and may have thought that he was not legitimate as a first-time director. He wanted to cast unknown actors due to his [...] "phobia of stars", but after considering that he might not make another film, he asked Emmanuelle Devos, Irene Jacob and Valeria Golino to appear in the film and they all accepted. Sattouf sought actors who were [...] "ugly ducklings with unusual features, and their own way of talking, of walking" [...] and who could express emotions without [...] "acting". He struggled to find teenage actors who were like their characters and were willing to be filmed in an unflattering <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>said</b> that Vincent Lacoste and Anthony Sonigo were less concerned about their appearances when he showed them a picture of himself as a [...] "very ugly" [...] teenager. Three days before the beginning of principal photography, Lacoste broke his knee at a music concert, and so his resulting limp was added to the character. According to Sattouf, Lacoste and Sonigo were completely at ease with filming scenes of masturbation, and all of the actors treated their French kisses [...] "like a hug".|$|E

But his answer {{was that he was}} no different to a Renaissance artist, striving again and again to paint the perfect Madonna-and-Child. Since then, I've never had a problem about the idea of reusing and reworking my material. Like Tass, I've come to look on my whole output as one slowly emerging work".|$|R
