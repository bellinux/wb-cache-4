40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} between presence and imaging is examined with the view to establish how our understanding of imaging, and subsequently the design process, may be reconceptualised to give greater focus to its experiential potential. First, the paper outlines the research project contributing to the discussion. Then, it provides brief overviews of research on both imaging and presence in the process highlighting the narrow conceptions of imaging (and {{the recognition of the}} need for further research) compared to the more holistic and experiential understandings of presence. The paper concludes with an argument and proposed study for exploring the role of digital technology and presence in extending the potential of imaging and its role in the design process. As indicated in the DRS Conference Theme, this paper focuses “…on what people experience and the systems and actions that create those experiences. ” Interface designers, information architects and interactive media artists understand the powerful influence of experience in design. ‘Experience design’ is a community of practice driven by individuals within digital based disciplines where the belief is that understanding people is essential to any successful design in any medium and that “…experience is the personal connection with the moment and… every aspect of living is an experience, whether <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>creators</b> or simply chance participants” (Shedroff, 2001, p. 5).

40|$|If {{we heard}} about the word "information", many assortments come in our mind. Society {{interpretation}} towards information was information is a knowledge that can be assessed {{through a variety of}} formats as for example through mass media, like newspapers and conferences, social media such as twitter, facebook, Instagram and so forth. In brief, information is data that is processed or formulated in the form of codes which is symbol or a sound in which humans need to encode the messages and adapt them in a verbal and non- verbal communication. It is ideas, opinions, notions, word, or something new that can be shared as a new knowledge to all users. However, it is not an extraordinary to us to hear the misuse of information cases. Fraud does not just happen in big organizations only, but without realizing it, we as individually can also lead to misappropriation of information. This is not an easy fact to be accepted as a whole, but this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reality Sometimes, our actions may lead to plagiarism when we copy others works without credited the author or owner of the information used. In fact, the way of the adaptation, maintenance, and management information lies in us. If we have an identity, have a faith, principles and ethics, we will respect the rights of others as we care for our own rights. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>creator</b> which characterize ourselves what we want to do.

40|$|Can {{the need}} for {{inclusion}} result in certain social norms remain unchallenged, and over time become hard to identify? To “fit in” and be accepted in different social contexts we have to behave according to the dominating rules and conventions. We accept characteristics and make use of attributes specific for the group <b>we</b> want to <b>be</b> a part of. When we accept these attributes we contribute to keep the concept of them alive. Further on these attributes will {{be picked up by}} the next person who wants {{to become a part of}} that specific context. This means that in <b>the</b> same moment <b>we</b> <b>are</b> being created, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> also <b>the</b> <b>creators.</b> In <b>the</b> same way, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> cause of, and a result of, the fact that certain concepts remain unchallenged. Individuals are raised within a fixed structure in society. That structure defines principles of heteronormativity, for example the concept of right or wrong, masculinity and femininity, and good or bad. <b>The</b> fact that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> born and raised within it leaves us with a very narrow space in which we can interpret alternative ways. This does not mean that these alternative interpretations do not exist. To question existing and accepted structures can be a first step away from the safe environment that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> a part of. Awareness of the risks of this could be an explanation of why people refrain from questioning it. In this paper we try to penetrate the problems through the glasses of Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler and Berger and Luckmann to mention a few. The reason why this paper focuses on society, and norms in specific, emanate in an interest for invisible and sometimes indistinct structures. By indistinct we mean structures that exist in an extent that makes it hard to identify. The aim of this thesis is divided in two parts. <b>The</b> first part <b>is</b> to critically examine the social construction of heteronormativity. <b>The</b> second part <b>is</b> to examine how plural sexual identities function in relation to the heterosexual norm that we assume exists in society. The distinction in an individual’s hetero- or homosexuality is made difficult because of the spectrum of sexual identities. The grayscale of alternatively interpreted sexual identities that fits between the two poles of sexuality (hetero and homosexuality) are easily forgotten and thus treated as deviant behaviors. The issue of sexual identities is a complex one. To speak of it in a natural way to express sexuality, and not of its moral right or wrong, requires the understanding and acceptance of an individual’s differences as well as similarities. It is through ten interviews, where individuals share their experiences of both heteronormativity and sexuality that we get to know how and in which ways they feel affected by these two...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{influence}} of an important project of our time, the creation of thinking machines or cyborgs, on the essence of human spirituality. The popular work of Kurzweil was used as a starting point. Kurzweil believes that the cyborgs or man-machine hybrids will not only be a simulation of human cognition but also of consciousness and spirituality. In fact, they will be more than a simulation; they will enhance and alter consciousness and spirituality in a radical, unfathomable way. The basis of Kurzweil's argument is his law of accelerating returns, which predicts such a progress in technology that, if an algorithm for the working of the brain can be formulated, {{it will be possible to}} develop software emulating the conscious brain. In this way, current limitations experienced by human beings, including mortality, will be overcome. This assumption was investigated from an anthropological view using Janicaud's concepts. The cyborg is seen as an illustration of people's innate desire to overcome the human condition. Humanity is characterised by a constant struggle to find a balance between the superhuman and the inhuman as the extreme states of human spirituality. This also characterises human liberty - humans are free to choose. Given this characterisation of humanity, the nature of the cyborg as superhuman is then considered. Different possibilities are sketched: the superhuman who will exercise the pure will to power (awakening the inhuman) or a person with a complete naïve freedom. The future is not easy to predict. Janicaud considers the view of the cyborg as superhuman to be a myth. The real danger facing humanity is the inhuman. The growth and progress of technology do not guarantee moral progress. Currently, technology seems to create a sharp divide between a privileged few and the rest. The two world wars in the previous century illustrated ways in which technology could be used to commit cold-blooded barbaric acts on a mass scale. In addition, biotechnology and other technological innovations could give rise to new forms of violence which can effectively be spread by new media. The inhuman is a place from where it is difficult to return. The challenge of our time is to carry the responsibility of our freedom in such a way that we can defend ourselves against our inhumanity; but in a manner that would enable us also to open up to the radical creativity and strangeness of superhumans lying dormant in us. It is clear that now, more than ever before, human spirituality needs to be as alive and rich as possible to rise to the challenge. However, the belief in technology as utopia enslaves the human spirit. We forget that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>creators</b> of technology and fabricate excuses for moral and intellectual abdications. Furthermore, the assumption that cognition can be mechanised or formalised leads to the disembodiment of intelligence and thought. Humans are placed outside of the world to which they belong. We become estranged from ourselves and each other. The human spirit seems to be wounded by the prevailing metaphors of disembodiment and mechanisation accompanying technological dominance. This article contributes to the call for the struggle for the re-enchantment of the human spirit. It is imperative that thinkers and innovators - leaders - create new metaphors to provide richer descriptions of humanity. Social sciences, having studied the human condition for centuries, might contribute valuable ideas. Technology can be used in this struggle, but only if human beings understand their own paradoxical nature as well as that of technology. The fortified spirit is one that accepts its mortality and fragility but takes responsibility for its freedom. In this way, meaning is re-introduced in the lives of human beings. In hierdie artikel word die invloed van die projek van die bou van denkende masjiene of kuborge op die grondslag van menslike geestelikheid bespreek. Die idee van die kuborge word gebruik om die toekoms te bedink. Die kuborg as supermens word as mite uitgewys, terwyl die ontaarding van die mens as 'n realistiese moontlikheid geskets word. Mense, as geestelike wesens, kom noodgedwonge te staan voor die uitdaging om verantwoordelikheid te aanvaar en die toenemend moeilike balans te bewaar tussen die onmenslike en die supermens wat in ons sluimer. Die onmenslike moet in toom gehou word te midde van 'n openheid vir die radikale kreatiwiteit van die supermens. Dit blyk egter dat die gees verwond en aan bande gelê word deur die onderliggende metafore van meganisering en ontliggaming van die tegnologieë van ons tyd. Die gesprek sluit aan by die stryd om die heropluistering van die gees. Tegnologie kan gebruik word in hierdie stryd maar slegs as mense hulle eindigheid verstaan en aanvaar asook dié van tegnologie. Sodoende sal 'n ryker begrip van menslikheid vorendag kom wat betekenis in mense se lewens bring deur die ontwikkeling en gebruik van tegnologie sinvol te rig. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|While we {{move through}} our environment, we {{constantly}} {{have to deal}} with new sensory input. Especially the visual system has to deal with an ever-changing input signal, since we continuously move our eyes. For example, we change our direction of gaze about three times every second to a new area within our visual field with a fast, ballistic eye movement called a saccade. As a consequence, the entire projection of the surrounding world on our retina moves. Yet, we do not perceive this shift consciously. Instead, we have the impression of a stable world around us, in which objects have a well-defined location. In my thesis I aimed to investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of the visual perceptual stability of our environment. One hypothesis {{is that there is a}} coordinate transformation of the retinocentric input signal to a craniocentric (egocentric) and eventually even to a world centered (allocentric) frame of reference. Such a transformation into a craniocentric reference frame requires information about both the location of a stimulus on the retina and the current eye position within the head. The physicist Hermann von Helmholtz <b>was</b> one of <b>the</b> first who suggested that such an eye-position signal <b>is</b> available in <b>the</b> brain as an internal copy of the motor plan, which <b>is</b> sent to <b>the</b> eye muscles. This so-called efference copy allows the brain to classify actions as self-generated and differentiate them from being externally triggered. If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>creator</b> of an action, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> able to predict its outcome and can take this prediction into consideration for the further processing. For example, if the projection of the environment moves across the retina due to an eye movement, <b>the</b> shift <b>is</b> registered as self-induced and the brain maintains a stable percept of the world. However, if one gently pushes the eye from the side with a finger, we perceive a moving environment. Along the same lines, it is necessary to correctly attribute the movement of the visual field to our own self-motion, e. g. to perform eye movements accounting for the additional influences of our movements. The first study of my thesis shows that the perceived location of a stimulus might indeed be a combination of two independent neuronal signals, i. e. the position of the stimulus on the retina and information about the current eye-position or eye-movement, respectively. In this experiment, the mislocalization of briefly presented stimuli, which is characteristic for each type of eye-movement, leads to a perceptual localization of stimuli within the area of the blind spot on the retina. Yet, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> region where the optic nerve leaves the eye, meaning that there are no photoreceptors available to convert light into neuronal signals. Physically, subjects should be blind for stimuli presented in this part of the visual field. In fact, a combination of the actual stimulus position with the specific, error-inducing eye-movement information is able to explain the experimentally measured behavior. The second study in my thesis investigates the underlying neural mechanism of the mislocalization of briefly presented stimuli during eye-movements. Many previous studies using animal models (the rhesus monkey) revealed internal representations of eye-position signals in various brain regions and therefore confirmed the hypothesis of an efference copy signal within the brain. Although these eye-position signals basically reflect the actual eye-position with good accuracy, there are also some spatial and temporal inaccuracies. These erroneous representations have been previously suggested as the source of perceptual mislocalization during saccades. The second study of my thesis extends this hypothesis to the mislocalization during smooth pursuit eye-movements. We usually perform such an eye movement when we want to continuously track a moving object with our eyes. I showed that the activity of neurons in the ventral intraparietal area of the rhesus monkey adequately represents the actual eye-position during smooth pursuit. However, there was a constant lead of the internal eye-position signal as compared to the real eye-position in direction of the ongoing eye-movement. In combination with a distortion of the visual map due to an uneven allocation of attention in direction of the future stimulus position, this results in a mislocalization pattern during smooth pursuit, which almost exactly resembles those typically measured in psychophysical experiments. Hence, on the one hand the efference copy of the eye-position signal provides the required signal to perform a coordinate transformation in order to preserve a stable perception of our environment. On the other hand small inaccuracies within this signal seem to cause perceptual errors when <b>the</b> visual system <b>is</b> experimentally pushed to its limits. The efference copy also plays a role in dysfunctions of the brain in neurological or psychiatric diseases. For example, many symptoms of schizophrenia patients could be explained by an impaired efference copy mechanism and a resulting misattribution of agency to self- and externally-produced actions. Following this hypothesis, the typically observed auditory hallucinations in these patients might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> result of an erroneously assigned agency of their own thoughts. To make a detailed analysis of this potentially impaired efference copy mechanism possible, the third study of my thesis investigated eye movements of schizophrenia patients and tried to step outside the limited capabilities of laboratory setups into the real world. This study showed that results of previous laboratory studies only partly resemble those obtained in the real world. For example, schizophrenia patients, when compared to healthy controls, usually show a more inaccurate smooth pursuit eye-movement in the laboratory. Yet, in the real world when they track a stationary object with their eyes while they are moving towards it, there are no differences between patients and healthy controls, although both types of eye-movements are closely related. This might <b>be</b> due to <b>the</b> fact that patients were able to use additional sources of information in the real world, e. g. self-motion information, to compensate for some of their deficits under certain conditions. Similarly, the fourth study of my thesis showed that typical impairments of eye-movements during healthy aging can be equalized by other sources of information available under natural conditions. At the same time, this work underlined the need of eye-movement measurements in the real world as a complement to laboratory studies to accurately describe the visual system, all mechanisms of perception and their interactions under natural circumstances. For example, experiments in the laboratory usually analyze particularly selected eye-movement parameters within a specific range, such as saccades of a certain amplitude. However, this does not reflect everyday life in which parameters like that are typically continuous and not normally distributed. Furthermore, motion-selective areas in the brain might play a much bigger role in natural environments, since we generally move our head and/or ourselves. To correctly analyze the contribution to and influences on eye-movements, one has to perform eye-movement studies under conditions as realistic as possible. The fifth study of my thesis aimed to investigate a possible application of eye-movement studies in the diagnosis of neuronal diseases. We showed that basic eye-movement parameters like saccade peak-velocity can be used to differentiate patients with Parkinson’s disease from patients with an atypical form of Parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy. This differentiation is of particular importance since both diseases share a similar onset but have a considerably different progression and outcome, requiring different types of therapies. An early differential diagnosis, preferably in a subclinical stage, is needed to ensure the optimal treatment of the patients in order to ease the symptoms and eventually even improve the prognosis. The study showed that mobile eye-trackers are particularly well-suited to investigate eye movements in the daily clinical routine, due to their promising results in differential diagnosis and their easy, fast and reliable handling. In conclusion, my thesis underlines the importance of an interaction of all the different neuroscientific methods such as psychophysics, eye-movement measurements in the real world, electrophysiology and the investigation of neuropsychiatric patients to get a complete picture of how the brain works. The results of my thesis contribute to extent the current knowledge about the processing of information and the perception of our environment in the brain, point towards fields of application of eye-movement measurements and can be used as groundwork for future research...|$|R
