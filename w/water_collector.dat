All {{her friends and}} family are present and her {{grandfather}} Tangle says he has an amazing gift. But then Lyra hears a whisper and everyone disappears. Lyra stays alone in her beloved town of Wish, trapped in a parallel dimension which {{is very similar to}} her own. Guided by the messages left by Tangle and using her father's airship, Lyra tries to find the Clockmaker, the only person who can help Lyra get back home and reunite with her family and friends. She finally finds the Clockmaker in his hideout, and thankfully he agrees to help her. Lyra must find 3 keys in 3 separately hidden areas - the Treehouse Village, the Wind Music Island and the <b>Water</b> <b>Collector</b> - to re-activate the Clockmaker's Time Synchronization Machine. On arriving in the Wind Music Island, Lyra is notified that the music eons in this island was once created by fairies who used to live there. Lyra finds her grandfather's notified note confusing but she gradually believes what is happening with her is touched by fairies' hands: the magical chalkboard, the hidden airship, the strange whisper..., not including those powerful powers that Lyra discovers by herself. After finding all 3 keys, Lyra backs to the Clockmaker's house to finish her mission there and can finally head back to her original dimension with so much questions that are yet to be answered. But instead of welcoming Lyra with sunshine, the Village of Wish becomes dark and full of thunders. Lyra wonders what will be waiting her next.|$|E

40|$|This data {{is from a}} {{study that}} investigates how a honey bee colony {{develops}} and quenches its collective thirst when it experiences hyperthermia of its broodnest, the nest region whose temperature and humidity are precisely regulated. We found that in this emergency situation a colony must strongly boost its water intake because evaporative cooling is critical to avoiding broodnest hyperthermia, and it must rapidly boost its water intake because a colony maintains only a small water reserve. We also shed light on how the worker bees functioning as <b>water</b> <b>collectors</b> know when to spring into action—by sensing either more frequent requests for fluid or greater personal thirst, or both—and we demonstrate that this sensing mechanism is sufficiently fine-tuned to prevent overheating and desiccation of the colony's brood.

The relative efficiency of four types of eolian {{dust collectors}} was investigated by examining dust deposition efficiency in an eolian dust tunnel, and measuring long-term accumulation efficiency during a 24 -month field experiment in a desert environment. The deposition and accumulation surfaces of the collectors tested, were: (1) a dry and flat surface, (2) a flat but moist surface, (3) a surface composed of two superimposed layers of marbles, and (4) a free water surface. The <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> showed the highest efficiency, both for deposition and accumulation. Deposition efficiency of the marble collector was {{comparable to that of}} the <b>water</b> <b>collector,</b> but the former was more sensitive to post-depositional erosion.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of the evaporation {{heat transfer coefficient}} {{is important for the}} design and operation of horizontal tube spray film evaporators. The water spray on a horizontal tube bundle is numerically studied in steady state conditions. The objective of the present work is to numerically study the effect of the tube configuration and the operating conditions on the evaporation heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the {{enhancement of}} the evaporation rate ratio by constructing a <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> around the bottom-heated tube is also numerically studied. In order to evaluate the evaporation rate ratio and the heat transfer coefficient of the falling liquid film on the horizontal tube bundle, the non-dimensional governing equations of the mass, momentum and energy of the created liquid film around the hot tube surface are solved numerically using the finite difference method. The results show that the evaporation rate ratio is mainly increased by increasing both the surface temperature and the tube’s outer diameter. The evaporation rate ratio enhances by decreasing the chamber pressure and inlet liquid subcooling. The falling distance has little influence on the evaporation rate ratio. Moreover, constructing a <b>water</b> <b>collector</b> around the bottom-heated tube enhances the evaporation rate ratio. The increase in the evaporation rate ratio increases by higher heat flux and also by larger the gap between the collector and the tube surface...|$|E

40|$|Remote {{communities}} in the high altitude areas of Nepal suffer both chronic and acute malnutrition. This {{is due to a}} shortage of arable land and a harsh climate. For seven months of the year, the harvesting of fresh vegetables is almost impossible. Greenhouse technology, if appropriate for the location and its community, can extend the growing season considerably. Experience in the Ladakh region of India indicates that year-round cropping is possible in greenhouses in cold mountainous areas. A simple 50 -m 2 greenhouse has been constructed in Simikot, the main town of Humla, northwest Nepal. This paper describes the evaluation of the thermal performance of that greenhouse. Both measurement and simulation were used in the evaluation. Measurements during the winter of 2006 - 7 indicate that the existing design is capable of producing adequate growing conditions for some vegetable crops, but that improvements are required if crops like tomatoes are to be grown successfully. Options to improve the thermal performance of the greenhouse have been investigated by simulation. Improvements to the building envelope such as wall insulation, double-glazing and using a thermal screen were simulated with a validated TRNSYS model. The impact of the addition of nighttime heat from internal passive solar <b>water</b> <b>collectors</b> was also predicted. The simulations indicate that the passive solar <b>water</b> <b>collectors</b> would raise the average greenhouse air temperature by 2. 5 °C and the overnight air temperature would increase by 4. 0 °C.
