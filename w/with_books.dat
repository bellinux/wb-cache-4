5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a {{small rural}} town. The family's house was {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him <b>with</b> <b>books</b> from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote. Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E

5|$|Some Heathens {{practice}} {{forms of}} divination using runes; {{as part of}} this, items with runic markings on them might be pulled out of a bag or bundle, and read accordingly. In some cases, different runes are associated with different deities, one of the nine realms, or aspects of life. It is common for Heathens to utilize the Common Germanic Futhark as a runic alphabet, although some practitioners instead adopt the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc or the Younger Futhark. Some non-Heathens also use runes for divinatory purposes, <b>with</b> <b>books</b> on the subject being common in New Age bookstores. Some Heathens practice magic, although this is not regarded as an intrinsic part of Heathenry {{because it was not}} a common feature of pre-Christian rituals in Iron Age and Early Medieval Germanic Europe.|$|E

5|$|The charismatic and {{sophisticated}} vampire of modern fiction {{was born in}} 1819 {{with the publication of}} The Vampyre by John Polidori; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula is remembered as the quintessential vampire novel and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire genre, still popular in the 21st century, <b>with</b> <b>books,</b> films, and television shows. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the horror genre.|$|E
5|$|Japan's first {{experience}} <b>with</b> <b>books</b> and written language came from books written in Classical Chinese in China, brought to Japan from the Korean kingdoms, {{at least by}} the 5th and probably {{by the end of}} the 4th century. According to legend, the scholar Wani came to Japan in 406 and brought with him the Confucian Analects and Thousand Character Classic. These were followed, in later years, by the Five Classics (Book of Odes, Book of History, Book of Rites, Book of Changes and the Spring and Autumn Annals), which, by the 6th century, became well-known among the Japanese literary elite. The Seventeen-article constitution, compiled in 604 by Prince Shōtoku, has quotations that allow the identification of 18 Chinese books known to have existed in Japan at the time: Odes, Rites, Classic of Filial Piety, Analects, Chronicle of Zuo, the Han Chronicles (Book of Han and Book of the Later Han), Wen Xuan anthology, Zhuangzi and other classical Chinese writings.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of Chinese books to Japan reached its first {{peak in the}} Sui and Tang dynasties. During this period books were brought to Japan through two sources: people, who were mostly literate, moving from the continent; and by official missions sent out by the Japanese court. Four envoys to Sui China were dispatched under Prince Shōtoku, but this number quickly increased during the Tang dynasty, which saw 16 envoys of circa 200 to 600 people, each sent to study Chinese culture and to acquire Chinese books. One of the most well-known missions was that by Kibi Makibi who left Japan in 717, spent 17 years in China and returned <b>with</b> <b>books</b> on various subjects. Examples of works imported during this period include the first Chinese pharmacopoeia (Xinxiu Bencao), compiled and imported {{in the same year}} (713), and Tang poetry by Li Bai, Wang Wei and Bai Juyi. Towards the end of the Tang Dynasty, {{at the end of the}} 9th century, about half of the canon of Chinese literature was present in Japan, including texts of all major Tang poets. The Book Catalogue in Japan, compiled between 876 and 884 by the aristocrat and scholar Fujiwara no Sukeyo, showed entries for 1,568 Chinese books, located in Japan, in classics, history, philosophy and anthologies. Due to the cessation of missions to China in the late 9th century, relatively few Chinese books were imported through the mid and late Heian period.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools <b>with</b> <b>books</b> and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E
