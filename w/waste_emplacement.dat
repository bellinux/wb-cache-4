40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} {{effect on}} the exploratory ramps, drifts, and shafts {{as a result of}} high-level nuclear waste disposal is examined using a three-dimensional thermo-elastic model. The repository layout modeled is based on the use of mechanical mining of all excavations with equivalent <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> areal power densities of 57 and 80 kW/acre. Predicted temperatures and stress changes for the north and south access drifts, east main drift, east-west exploratory drift, the north and south Calico Hills access ramps, the Calico Hills north-south exploratory drift, and the optional exploratory studies facility and man and materials shafts are presented for times 10, 35, 50, 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10, 000 years after the start of <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement.</b> The study indicates that the east-west exploratory drift at the repository horizon is subject to the highest thermomechanical impact because it is located closest the buried waste canisters.

40|$|This report {{describes}} a scientific analysis to bound credible horizontal peak ground velocities (PGV) for the repository <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level at Yucca Mountain. Results {{are presented as}} a probability distribution for horizontal PGV to represent uncertainties in the analysis. The analysis also combines the bound to horizontal PGV with results of ground motion site-response modeling (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170027]) to develop a composite hazard curve for horizontal PGV at the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level. This result provides input to an abstraction of seismic consequences (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169183]). The seismic consequence abstraction, in turn, defines the input data and computational algorithms for the seismic scenario class of the total system performance assessment (TSPA). Planning for the analysis is documented in Technical Work Plan TWP-MGR-GS- 000001 (BSC 2004 [DIRS 171850]). The bound on horizontal PGV at the repository <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level developed in this analysis complements ground motions developed {{on the basis of}} PSHA results. In the PSHA, ground motion experts characterized the epistemic uncertainty and aleatory variability in their ground motion interpretations. To characterize the aleatory variability they used unbounded lognormal distributions. As a consequence of these characterizations, as seismic hazard calculations are extended to lower and lower annual frequencies of being exceeded, the ground motion level increases without bound, eventually reaching levels that are not credible (Corradini 2003 [DIRS 171191]). To provide credible seismic inputs for TSPA, in accordance with 10 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 63. 102 (j) [DIRS 156605], this complementary analysis is carried out to determine reasonable bounding values of horizontal PGV at the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level for annual frequencies of exceedance as low as 10 {sup - 8 }. For each realization of the TSPA seismic scenario, the results of this analysis provide a constraint on the values sampled from the horizontal PGV hazard curve for the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level. The relation of this analysis to other work feeding the seismic consequence abstraction and the TSPA is shown on Figure 1 - 1. The ground motion hazard results from the PSHA provide the basis for inputs to a site-response model that determines the effect of site materials on the ground motion at a location of interest (e. g., the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level). Peak ground velocity values determined from the site-response model for the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level are then used to develop time histories (seismograms) that form input to a model of drift degradation under seismic loads potentially producing rockfall. The time histories are also used to carry out dynamic seismic structural response calculations of the drip shield and waste package system. For the drip shield, damage from seismically induced rockfall also is considered. In the seismic consequence abstraction, residual stress results from the structural response calculations are interpreted in terms of the percentage of the component (drip shield, waste package) damaged as a function of horizontal PGV. The composite hazard curve developed in this analysis, which reflects the results of site-response modeling and the bound to credible horizontal PGV at the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> level, also feeds the seismic consequence abstraction. The composite hazard curve is incorporated into the TSPA sampling process to bound horizontal PGV and related seismic consequences to values that are credible...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater {{remediation}} {{has become}} increasingly necessary for environmental sustainability in industrial, agricultural and urban settings. One reason for this need has been the <b>emplacement</b> of rock <b>waste</b> materials (e. g. coal washery discard (CWD) and blast furnace slag (BFS)) from mining and metallurgical industries {{in areas such as}} the Illawarra region of New South Wales. Since there has been a lack of rigorous research into the potential for these emplacements to pollute groundwater, the majority of these emplacements were constructed without the installation of engineering leachate controls. Indeed, until research over the last 15 to 20 years proved the contrary, available evidence suggested that these rock wastes were inert and would not threaten groundwater quality. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} identify the environmental impacts of these rock <b>waste</b> <b>emplacements</b> and develop groundwater remediation strategies at existing emplacement sites, as well as develop economically and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for these rock waste materials. This thesis presents a field study of a BFS emplacement located within the Illawarra region of New South Wales. High pH groundwater (pH 12 - 13) has been found to be migrating from this emplacement into an adjacent coastal saline lake, resulting in severe impacts on fish and benthic fauna. An innovative engineering solution, which involves the installation of a low pyrite CWD permeable reactive wall at the site, has been proposed and tested. Depending on the particle size, the equilibrium pH of this CWD material ranges from about 7. 5 to over 9. 0. Field monitoring has been conducted to assess the hydraulic performance and reactivity of the CWD wall. A consistent and significant pH drop across the wall has been observed; the pH at the effluent end of the wall averaged 7. 2 over the 825 day monitoring period. In addition, the wall was not found to impede natural groundwater flow. A three-dimensional MODFLOW model of the site and the wall reveals that flow through the wall conforms to fundamental flow equations. Laboratory batch and column tests have been conducted to develop a conceptual model of the chemical interactions within the CWD wall. According to this model, the primary pH reduction mechanism is the deprotonation of reactive amphoteric oxygen sites at the clay edge surfaces and gibbsite basal surfaces within the CWD. This is an acid-base controlled reaction in which protons are drawn into solution by the concentration of hydroxide ions. Deprotonation of clay surfaces results in negatively charged surfaces that attract and adsorb available cations (primarily calcium) from solution. The conceptual model has been used to develop a quantitative PHREEQC geochemical model of the wall. This model has been thoroughly tested using column test data and found to be valid. It is used to show that exhausted CWD is chemically stable and that the worst-case reactive life of the CWD permeable reactive wall at the BFS emplacement site will be 3. 23 years. Under average rainfall conditions, the life of the wall should exceed 60 years. This solution is shown to be an efficient and economical engineering application of clay surface chemistry. It simultaneously addresses three issues relevant to groundwater remediation: the need for groundwater remediation strategies at existing rock <b>waste</b> <b>emplacements,</b> the need to develop economical and environmentally sustainable utilisation technologies for rock waste and the need for new field applications for permeable reactive walls...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this model report is to {{document}} the drift scale radionuclide transport model, {{taking into account the}} effects of emplacement drifts on flow and transport {{in the vicinity of the}} drift, which are not captured in the mountain-scale unsaturated zone (UZ) flow and transport models ''UZ Flow Models and Submodels'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169861]), ''Radionuclide Transport Models Under Ambient Conditions'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 164500]), and ''Particle Tracking Model and Abstraction of Transport Process'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 170041]). The drift scale radionuclide transport model is intended to be used as an alternative model for comparison with the engineered barrier system (EBS) radionuclide transport model ''EBS Radionuclide Transport Abstraction'' (BSC 2004 [DIRS 169868]). For that purpose, two alternative models have been developed for drift-scale radionuclide transport. One of the alternative models is a dual continuum flow and transport model called the drift shadow model. The effects of variations in the flow field and fracture-matrix interaction in the vicinity of a <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> drift are investigated through sensitivity studies using the drift shadow model (Houseworth et al. 2003 [DIRS 164394]). In this model, the flow is significantly perturbed (reduced) beneath the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> drifts. However, comparisons of transport in this perturbed flow field with transport in an unperturbed flow field show similar results if the transport is initiated in the rock matrix. This has led to a second alternative model, called the fracture-matrix partitioning model, that focuses on the partitioning of radionuclide transport between the fractures and matrix upon exiting the <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> drift. The fracture-matrix partitioning model computes the partitioning, between fractures and matrix, of diffusive radionuclide transport from the invert (for drifts without seepage) into the rock water. The invert is the structure constructed in a drift to provide the floor of the drift. The reason for introducing the fracture-matrix partitioning model is to broaden the conceptual model for flow beneath <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> drifts in a way that does not rely on the specific flow behavior predicted by a dual continuum model and to ensure that radionuclide transport is not underestimated. The fracture-matrix partitioning model provides an alternative method of computing the partitioning of radionuclide releases from drifts without seepage into rock fractures and rock matrix. Drifts without seepage are much more likely to have a significant fraction of radionuclide releases into the rock matrix, and therefore warrant additional attention in terms of the partitioning model used for TSPA...|$|E

A particularly important area of concern with the proposed repository is the site`s hydrology. The faculty of the DRI have long been involved with research throughout the State and have particular expertise in groundwater studies related to radionuclide migration and hydrologic safety of underground nuclear testing by DOE and predecessor agencies. In addition, we utilize laboratory personnel for chemical and isotopic analyses in both of the DRI-WMC water chemistry laboratories...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>waste</b> packages for <b>emplacement</b> in a tuff repository has been proceeding {{during the past}} year on a broad front. Experimental work has been focused on determination of important package environment parameters and testing the response of waste forms and package materials to the anticipated environment. Conceptual designs have been selected with alternatives to accommodate present uncertainties in the environment and material performance. Computational capabilities are being adapted to provide analyses of anticipated package performance, and plans are being developed for in-situ testing. The waste package activities have been integrated into the overall NNWSI project to assure timely completion consistent with the statutory and regulatory requirements leading to repository site selection around the end of the decade. 7 references...|$|R
40|$|We provide in {{this report}} a {{methodology}} to estimate bounds on the changes in fracture permeability due to thermal-mechanical processes associated with excavation of drifts and emplacement of waste. This report is the first milestone associated with Task A of the LLNL initiative to evaluate available methods for estimating chamges in fracture permeability surrounding drifts in the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) and the potential repository at Yucca Mountain in response to (1) construction-induced stress changes and (2) subsequent thermal pulse effects due to <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement.</b> These results are needed for modeling changes in repository-level moisture movement and seepage...|$|E
40|$|Predicting {{the amount}} of water that may seep into <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> tunnels (drifts) is {{important}} for assessing the performance of the proposed geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The repository will be located in thick, partially saturated fractured tuff that-for the first several hundred years after emplacement-will be heated to above-boiling temperatures as a result of heat generation from the decay of radioactive waste. Heating of rock water to above-boiling conditions induces water saturation changes and perturbs water fluxes that affect the potential for water seepage into drifts. In this paper, we describe numerical analyses of the coupled thermal-hydrological (TH) processes in the vicinity of <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement</b> drifts, evaluate the potential of seepage during the heating phase of the repository, and discuss the implications for the performance of the site. In addition to the capillary barrier at the rock-drift interface-independent of the thermal conditions-a second barrier exists to downward percolation at above-boiling conditions. This barrier is caused by vaporization of water in the fractured rock overlying the repository. A TOUGH 2 dual-permeability simulation model was developed to analyze the combined effect of these two barriers; it accounts for all relevant TH processes in response to heating, while incorporating the capillary barrier condition at the drift wall. Model results are presented for a variety of simulation cases that cover the expected variability and uncertainty of relevant rock properties and boundary conditions...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of numerical analyses to estimate the extent of rock mass modification resulting from the presence of a High Level Waste (HLW) repository. Changes in rock mass considered are stresses and joint deformations resulting from disposal room excavation and thermal efffects induced by the heat generated by nuclear waste. rock properties and site conditions are taken from the Site Characterization Plan Conceptual Design Report for the potential repository site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Analyses were conducted using boundary element and distinct element methods. Room-scale models and repository-scale models were investigated for up to 500 years after <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement.</b> Results of room-scale analyses based on the thermoelastic boundary element model indicate that a zone of modified rock develops around the disposal rooms for both vertical and horizontal <b>waste</b> <b>emplacement.</b> This zone is estimated to extend a distance of roughly two room diameters from the room surface. Results from the repository-scale model, which are based on the thermoelastic boundary element model and the distinct element model, indicate a zone with modified rock mass properties starting approximately 100 m above and below the repository, with a thickness of approximately 200 m above and 150 m below the repository. Slip-prone subhorizontal features are shown to have a substantial effect on rock mass response. The estimates of rock mass modification reflect uncertainties and simplifying assumptions in the models. 32 refs., 57 figs., 1 tab...|$|E
40|$|Calculations {{made by the}} U. S. Department of Energy's Yucca Mountain Project {{as part of the}} {{licensing}} of a proposed geologic repository (in southwestern Nevada) for the disposal of high-level radioactive <b>waste,</b> predict that <b>emplacement</b> tunnels will remain open with little collapse long after ground support has disintegrated. This conclusion includes the effects of anticipated seismic events. Natural analogues cannot provide a quantitative test of this conclusion, but they can provide a reasonableness test by examining the natural and anthropogenic examples of stability of subterranean openings. Available data from a variety of sources, combined with limited observations by the author, show that natural underground openings tend to resist collapse for millions of years and that anthropogenic subterranean openings have remained open from before recorded history through today. This stability is true even in seismically active areas. In fact, the archaeological record is heavily skewed toward preservation of underground structures relative to those found at the surface...|$|R
40|$|In Germany the {{reference}} concept for {{the disposal of}} heat generating radioactive <b>waste</b> considers the <b>emplacement</b> of vitrified <b>waste</b> canisters in deep vertical boreholes inside a salt mine. Whereas spent fuel will be disposed of in self shielding the 65 t heavy carbon steel POLLUX ¬Æ casks in horizontal drifts of the disposal zones in the salt dome in a depth of 870 m. The space between casks and drift walls will be backfilled with crushed salt. The transport, the han-dling and the emplacement of POLLUX ¬Æ cask were subject of successfully performed demonstration and in situ test in the nineties. The design {{and the results of}} the demonstration tests will be presented.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} is to document (1) the Waste Package Degradation (WAPDEG) version 3. 09 (CRWMS M&O 1998 b). Software Routine Report for WAPDEG (Version 3. 09) simulations used to analyze waste package degradation and failure under the repository exposure conditions characterized by the open loop option of the post-closure ventilation design and, (2) post-processing of these results into tables of waste package degradation time histories suitable for use as input into the Integrated Probabilistic Simulator for Environmental Systems version 5. 19. 0 1 (RIP) computer program (Golder Associates 1998). Specifically, the WAPDEG simulations discussed in this calculation correspond to <b>waste</b> package <b>emplacement</b> conditions (repository environment and design) defined in the Total System Performance Assessment-Viability Assessment (TSPA-VA), with the exception that the open loop option of the post-closure ventilation License Application Design Selection (LADS) Design Alternative (Design Alternative 3 b) was analyzed. The open loop post-closure ventilation design alternative, under which airways to the surface remain open after repository closure, could result in substantial cooling and drying of the potential repository. In open loop post-closure ventilation, expanded air heated by waste decay would move up an exhaust shaft, pulling denser, cooler air into the repository through intake shafts. The exchange of air with the atmosphere could remove more heat and moisture. As {{a result of the}} enhanced ventilation relative to the TSPA-VA base-case design, different temperature and relative humidity time histories at the waste package surface are calculated (input to the WAPDEG simulations), and consequently different waste package failure histories (as calculated by WAPDEG) result...|$|R
