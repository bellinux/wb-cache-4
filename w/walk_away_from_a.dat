25|$|In the {{subsequent}} off-season, Wellwood became a restricted free agent. After taking the Canucks to arbitration on July 28, 2009, he was re-signed to a one-year, $1.2 million contract {{two days later}} on July 30; terms in the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) did not allow the Canucks to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> ruling of less than $1.57 million. Having earned a reputation in his first Canucks season {{for a lack of}} fitness, Wellwood reported to training camp for the 2009–10 season 15 pounds lighter than in the previous year. He began the season playing on the third line with Steve Bernier and Mason Raymond, a combination that Head Coach Alain Vigneault carried over from the latter stages of the 2008–09 season and playoffs. Wellwood was sidelined early in the season, suffering a broken toe after blocking a shot from Maple Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek in a game on October 24, 2009, but he returned to the lineup just eight days later, on November 1. He finished the campaign with 14 goals and 25 points in 75 games. He followed that up with a seven-point post-season as the Canucks were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Chicago Blackhawks, in the second round.|$|E

You don't have to die to prove you're a man". [...] "Human Nature", co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, [...] "Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street".|$|E

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A {{lot of people want to}} hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chorus {{has a new}} melodic {{arrangement}} and a crescendo. It is ensued by chord-buoyed builds and drops comprising finger snaps and pan flute melodies. The same synthesizers from the verses are repeated with a piano in the background. Gomez's vocals in the drop are reduced to syllables from her verses such as a recurring [...] "whiskey neat" [...] and are accompanied by percussion instruments. [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] is a breakup song with a theme of nostalgia. The lyrics are about standing up for yourself {{in the face of}} a toxic relationship. Gomez narrates the regret of a previous relationship ruined by her former lover's habits of drinking and partying too often. The lyrics specifically address alcohol abuse, a type of alcoholism. Tamposi explained that [...] "It Ain't Me" [...] is about a woman finding the strength to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> toxic relationship despite the pressure she receives from society to stand by her man. Although the lyrics are sombre, the song has a distinctly uplifting and empowering sound.|$|E
