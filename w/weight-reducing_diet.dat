40|$|Abstract: This study aims at {{assessing}} nutritional {{and health}} quality {{aspects of a}} group of popular weightreducing diets in Jordan. Twenty two popular <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets</b> were collected from dieters and their essential nutrients were analyzed using Food Processor SQL software (2008). Dietary reference intakes were used as reference values for nutritional assessment. Characteristics of the diets were compared with the criteria of healthy <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets.</b> The results showed that the daily energy contents of the diets ranged between 352 - 1632 Kcal/day, with an average value of 985 ± 77. 6 Kcal/day. The percentages of diets provided the AMDR of carbohydrate, protein and fat, were 36, 82 and 73 %, respectively; none of the diets did meet all the AMDR values collectively. Fourteen percent of the diets contained the AMDR of dietary fibers, while 50 % contained cholesterol more than 300 mg/day. The diet coverages of DRIs ranged from 5 - 50 % and from 5 - 77 % for minerals and vitamins, respectively. Half of the diets contained {{one or more of the}} criteria of unhealthy faulty <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets.</b> Furthermore, only 3 diets encouraged dieters to practice physical activity, whereas only two instructed the adoption of healthy eating behaviors.

The present study aims to test the association between health-care access and weight change. DESIGN: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a multicentre population-based prospective study. Weight change was calculated at 3 and 13 years after CARDIA year 7 (1992 - 1993). Health-care access was defined as no barriers or one or more barriers to access (health insurance gap, no usual source of care, not seeking care due to expense). Intermediary variables evaluated included history of dieting and use of diet pills, meal replacements or weight-control programmes. SETTING: Four cities in the USA. SUBJECTS: Participants were aged 18 - 30 years at baseline (1985 - 1986). Analyses include 3922 black and white {{men and women with}} relevant data from CARDIA years 7, 10 and 20 (1992 - 1993, 1995 - 1996 and 2005 - 2006, respectively).

The essential feature is the restriction of time daily intake of carbohydrate to some 50 or 60 g, but no conscious restriction of protein or fat. The result, it is claimed, is a diet that has several advantages over other <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets,</b> a major ad-valmtage being its high nutritional value (2). In time United States of America, this diet is condemned by most authoritative lnedical and miutritional opinion (3), a!-tlmouglm, as in Britain, it is widely used by the lay public.

40|$|SUMMARY Antihypertensive drugs reduce {{cardiovascular}} {{morbidity and}} mortality. This was demon-strated by controlled dinlcal trials. While most complications are dramatically reduced {{it is not}} certain whether the incidence of myocardiai infarction is decreased by treatment or whether {{the severity of the}} infarct is reduced. The prognosis in patients with borderline and mild hypertension varies widely depending on the number of other risk factors present. Patients with mild hypertension and low risk profiles may not obtain enough benefit from treatment to justify the side effects, inconvenience, and expense of such therapy. Such pa-tients should be individually evaluated as to the need and desirability of treatment. Patients who are not treated with drugs should be seen for an annual follow-up to detect progression. Low sodium diets are effective but they are not practical because it is difflcuit to adhere to the required degree of sodium restriction. <b>Weight-reducing</b> <b>diets</b> also reduce blood pressure but compliance again is difficult, although it is worth advocating for the few patients who will maintain the diet more or less indefinitely. Between 1973 and 1977 in the United States there has been an 8 % decline in deaths due to heart disease, a 17 % decrease in deaths due to stroke, and an increase in average life expectancy from 71. 3 to 72. 8 years.

40|$|Sunil J WimalawansaRobert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, USAAbstract: Over {{the past}} 40 years, the {{prevalence}} of obesity {{has more than doubled}} in the United States. Approximately 67 % of American adults older than 20 years of age are either obese or overweight. Obesity has now become a critically important issue facing more than 40 % of Americans and has become a major burden on the American health care system. Today, obesity cannot be considered a simple lifestyle issue; it is a disease with major public health and economic consequences that requires serious attention by all stakeholders. Each individual has different causes and risk factors that lead to obesity and its associated complications. In addition to preventing becoming overweight, focusing on identifying the causes of obesity and then individualizing care and treatment plans to targeting weight loss, particularly intra-abdominal fat, could potentially generate huge cost savings. Excess intra-abdominal fat (visceral adiposity) is linked to excess morbidity and mortality, and positively correlates with the risks of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, certain cancers, and premature death. Therefore, overweight and obese patients should be offered healthy lifestyle changes including education about causes leading to excess weight, <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets,</b> physical activity regimens, and monitoring for progress. Medications and bariatric surgery are effective but are the last options and should be complementary to lifestyle and behavioral changes. The costs associated with managing obesity-related disorders and their complications are astounding; unless we intervene now, these are likely to triple over the next 2 decades. Thus, policymakers must pay serious attention to this progressive, insidious epidemic and determine the right paths for tackling obesity, which requires a paradigm shift in thinking and combined approaches. The increasing prevalence of obesity is a major health hazard in all health sectors, in both low and high income societies and countries. Thus, comprehensive programs are needed to minimize the effects of the epidemic. Keywords: metabolism, epidemic, cytokines, body mass index, cardiovascular, overweight, obesit...|$|R

40|$|Obesity. 2007; 15 : 3013 – 3022. Objective: Reduced {{intake of}} {{sweetened}} caloric beverages (SCBs) is recommended to lower total energy intake. Re-placing SCBs with non-caloric diet beverages {{does not automatically}} lower energy intake, however. Compensatory increases in other food or beverages reportedly negate ben-efits of diet beverages. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate drinking water as an alternative to SCBs. Research Methods and Procedures: Secondary analysis of data from the Stanford A TO Z intervention evaluated change in beverage pattern and total energy intake in 118 overweight women (25 to 50 years) who regularly con-sumed SCBs (12 ounces/d) at baseline. At baseline and 2, 6, and 12 months, mean daily beverage intake (SCBs, drink-ing water, non-caloric diet beverages, and nutritious caloric beverages), food composition (macronutrient, water, and fiber content), and total energy intake were estimated using three 24 -hour diet recalls. Beverage intake was expressed in relative terms (percentage of beverages). Results: In fixed effects models that controlled for total beverage intake, non-caloric and nutritious caloric beverage intake (percentage of beverages), food composition, and energy expenditure [metabolic equivalent (MET) ], replac-ing SCBs with drinking water was associated with signifi-cant decreases in total energy intake that were sustained over time. The caloric deficit attributable to replacing SCBs with water was not negated by compensatory increases in other food or beverages. Replacing all SCBs with drinking water was associated with a predicted mean decrease in total energy of 200 kcal/d over 12 months. Discussion: The results suggest that replacing SCBs with drinking water can help lower total energy intake in over-weight consumers of SCBs motivated to diet.

However, the comparative efficacy of this approach is debatable. Whilst short-term dietary intervention studies show that low-fat diets lead to weight loss in both healthy and overweight individuals, it is less clear if a reduction in fat intake is more efficacious than other dietary restrictions in the long term. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of low-fat diets in achieving sustained weight loss when used {{for the express purpose of}} weight loss in obese or overweight people. A comprehensive search identified six studies that fulfilled our criteria for inclusion (randomized controlled trial, participants either overweight or obese, comparison of a low-fat diet with another type of <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diet,</b> follow-up period that was at least 6 months in duration and inclusion of participants 18 years or older without serious disease). There were a total of 594 participants in the six trials. The duration of the intervention varied from 3 to 18 months with follow-up from 6 to 18 months. There were no significant differences between low-fat diets and other weight-reducing diets in terms of sustained weight loss. Furthermore, the overall weight loss at the 12 - 18 -month follow-up in all studies was very small (2 - 4 kg).

40|$|International audienceAim: Type II {{diabetes}} and obesity {{are associated with}} an enhanced release {{of a number of}} adipocytokines. Hyperinsulinemia - frequently present in type II {{diabetes and}} obesity - might be one of the drivers of the enhanced production of adipocytokines. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the interstitial levels of cytokines in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) in response to hyperinsulinemia and the effect of <b>weight-reducing</b> hypocaloric <b>diet</b> on this regulation in obese subjects. Methods: 13 obese pre-menopausal women participated in the study. Concentrations of 7 cytokines were measured in plasma and in AT interstitial fluid collected by microdialysis method during euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and during control infusion of physiological saline. A subgroup of 6 women underwent a 4 -week very-low-calorie diet (VLCD). Microdialysis during the clamp was performed before and at the end of VLCD. Results: Hyperinsulinemia induced an increase of monocyte chemoatractant protein (MCP- 1) and IL- 6 SCAT interstitial and plasma levels, and elevated IL- 8 levels in SCAT. The relative changes of IL- 6 levels in the dialysate correlated with changes of IL- 8 and MCP- 1. The interstitial and plasma levels of IL- 1 beta, IL- 10, TNFalpha and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI- 1) remained unchanged in response to hyperinsulinemia. VLCD resulted in an enhancement of the hyperinsulinemia-induced augmentation of MCP- 1, IL- 6 and IL- 8 interstitial levels. Conclusion: Hyperinsulinemia upregulates the interstitial levels of MCP 1, IL- 6 and IL- 8 in SCAT in obese women while it does not affect IL- 1 beta, IL- 10, TNFalpha and PAI- 1 levels.

OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate, in cross-sectional and prospective design, the relationship between sCD 163 circulating levels and CD 163 mRNA expression in adipose tissue and insulin sensitivity assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: Two cohorts of subjects were examined in the study. Cohort 1 included 42 women with a wide range of body mass index (17 - 48 kg/m(2)); cohort 2 included 27 obese women who followed a dietary intervention consisting of 1 month of a very low-calorie diet and 5 months of a weight-stabilization period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of CD 163 and mRNA expression of CD 163 and CD 68 in sc and visceral (visc) AT were determined, and insulin sensitivity [expressed as glucose disposal rate (GDR) ] was measured in cohort 1. In cohort 2, serum levels of CD 163, mRNA expressions of CD 163, CD 68, and CD 163 -shedding factors [TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP 3) ] in sc AT were examined and GDR was measured before and during dietary intervention. RESULTS: In cohort 1, circulating sCD 163 correlated with CD 163 mRNA levels in both sc and visc AT. sCD 163 and CD 163 mRNA expression in both fat depots correlated with GDR. In cohort 2, the diet-induced changes of sCD 163 levels did not correlate with those of CD 163, CD 68, TACE, and TIMP 3 mRNA levels. Although the pattern of the diet-induced change of sCD 163 paralleled that of GDR, there was no correlation between the changes of these two variables.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies have {{suggested}} that moderately high protein diets may be more appropriate than conventional low-fat high carbohydrate diets for individuals at risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. However in most such studies sources of dietary carbohydrate {{may not have been}} appropriate and protein intakes may have been excessively high. Thus, in a proof-of-concept study we compared two relatively low-fat weight loss diets - one high in protein and the other high in fiber-rich, minimally processed cereals and legumes - to determine whether a relatively high protein diet has the potential to confer greater benefits. Methods Eighty-three overweight or obese women, 18 - 65 years, were randomized to either a moderately high protein (30 % protein, 40 % carbohydrate) diet (HP) or to a high fiber, relatively high carbohydrate (50 % carbohydrate, > 35 g total dietary fiber, 20 % protein) diet (HFib) for 8 weeks. Energy intakes were reduced by 2000 - 4000 kJ per day in order to achieve weight loss of between 0. 5 and 1 kg per week. Results Participants on both diets lost weight (HP: - 4. 5 kg [95 % confidence interval (CI) :- 3. 7, - 5. 4 kg] and HFib: - 3. 3 kg [95 % CI: - 4. 2, - 2. 4 kg]), and reduced total body fat (HP: - 4. 0 kg [5 % CI:- 4. 6, - 3. 4 kg] and HFib: - 2. 5 kg [95 % CI: - 3. 5, - 1. 6 kg]), and waist circumference (HP: - 5. 4 cm [95 % CI: - 6. 3, - 4. 5 cm] and HFib: - 4. 7 cm [95 % CI: - 5. 8, - 3. 6 cm]), as well as total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose and blood pressure. However participants on HP lost more body weight (- 1. 3 kg [95 % CI: - 2. 5, - 0. 1 kg; p = 0. 039]) and total body fat (- 1. 3 kg [95 % CI: - 2. 4, - 0. 1; p = 0. 029]). Diastolic blood pressure decreased more on HP (- 3. 7 mm Hg [95 % CI: - 6. 2, - 1. 1; p = 0. 005]).

40|$|In {{parallel}} with the world wide increase in obesity {{there has been a}} dramatic rise in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) which is associated with a number of micro- and macro-vascular complications and increases the risk of coronary heart disease. Lifestyle intervention incorporating a hypocaloric weight loss diet and exercise training is currently recommended as the cornerstone of diabetes management and has been demonstrated to improve glycemic control and reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in individuals with T 2 DM. Previous research suggests that manipulating the dietary macronutrient composition may enhance the weight loss and improve the health status in patients undertaking a hypocaloric, <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diet.</b> Within a low fat caloric restricted diet replacing a portion of carbohydrate with protein has been demonstrated to provide beneficial effects for weight loss, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk outcomes in overweight and obese individuals including patients with T 2 DM. Moreover combining a high protein, low fat hypocaloric diet with exercise training may provide additive benefits, however the efficacy of this strategy in patients with T 2 DM who may achieve the greatest benefits has been largely unexplored. The first study in this thesis was a randomised-controlled clinical study which investigated the effects of a high protein, low fat hypocaloric diet combined with exercise training compared to an isocaloric high protein, low fat diet without exercise training or an isocaloric standard protein, low fat diet with or without exercise training on weight loss, body composition and cardiometabolic risk markers in overweight and obese patients with T 2 DM. The results showed that compared to caloric restriction alone participation in exercise training during caloric restriction produced greater reductions in body weight and total body fat mass (FM) and increases in muscular strength. Additionally, replacement of some carbohydrate with protein further magnified these effects resulting in participants who consumed the high protein diet and participated in resistance exercise training experiencing the greatest reductions in weight, total body FM, abdominal FM and insulin levels. All treatments had similar improvements in glycemic control and CVD risk factors. These results suggest a lifestyle modification program that combines a calorie restricted high protein diet and exercise training appears to be a preferred treatment strategy in overweight/obese patients with T 2 DM. A separate line of evidence suggests manipulating the timing of protein intake in relation to exercise training (consuming protein adjacent to exercise training compared to a delayed intake) stimulates greater muscle protein synthesis and hypertrophy. This strategy may therefore promote greater muscle tissue retention and improvements in body composition during calorie-restricted induced weight loss. This hypothesis was tested in the second study in this thesis. However, this study showed in overweight and obese patients with T 2 DM undertaking a 16 week hypocaloric high protein, low fat diet plus exercise training lifestyle intervention program, that altering the timing of protein ingestion relative to exercise (by consuming a 21 g protein supplement immediately before exercise compared to delaying ingestion 2 hours post-exercise) provided no additional benefit to weight loss and changes in body composition or cardiometabolic risk. The sustainability of the benefits obtained from intensive short-term research-based lifestyle intervention programs which incorporate an energy restricted diet and exercise is often poor, with a rebound frequently occurring following the cessation of the intensive support. The final study in this thesis followed up participants 1 -year after the commencement of a 16 -week research-based intensive lifestyle (diet and exercise) intervention program and reported factors identified by those participants as enhancing or impeding post-intervention program sustainability. Participants identified multiple reasons for the discontinuation of program components including; a desire for increased diet variety, a desire for increased portion size, limited access to appropriate exercise programs and facilities, the cost of gym membership and the withdrawal of professionals to motivate them. The main factors identified that would have facilitated continuation included having continued supervision or having to report to someone, having regular recorded weight checks and diet visits and access to affordable and appropriate exercise facilities. The findings of this thesis provide information that can be used by health professionals and policy makers for the development of evidence based recommendations and programs for the management of T 2 DM through diet and exercise based lifestyle intervention.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Overweight {{and obesity}} are global health {{problems}} contributing to an ever increasing noncommunicable disease burden. Calorie restriction can achieve short-term weight loss but the weight loss {{has not been}} shown to be sustainable in the long-term. An alternative approach to calorie restriction is to lower the fat content of the diet. However, the long-term effects of fat-restricted diets on weight loss have not been established. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of advice on low-fat diets as a means of achieving sustained weight loss, using all available randomised clinical trials. This review focused primarily on participants who were overweight or clinically obese and were dieting for the purpose of weight reduction. Since we were particularly interested in the ability of participants to sustain weight loss {{over a longer period of}} time, we focused on studies of 'free living' men and women who were given dietary advice rather than provision of food or money to purchase food. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2001), MEDLINE (up to February 2002), and EMBASE (up to February 2002). We also searched the Science Citation Index (up to January 2001) and bibliographies of studies identified. Date of latest search: February 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: Trials were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: 1) they were randomised controlled clinical trials of low-fat <b>diets</b> versus other <b>weight-reducing</b> <b>diets,</b> 2) the primary purpose of the study was weight loss, 3) participants were followed for at least six months, 4) the study participants were adults (18 years or older) who were overweight or obese (BMI > 25 kg/m 2) at baseline. Studies including pregnant women or patients with serious medical conditions were excluded. Two people independently applied the inclusion criteria to the studies identified. Disagreement was resolved by discussion or by intervention of a third party. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by three independent reviewers and meta-analysis performed using a random effects model. Weighted mean differences of weight loss were calculated for treatment and control groups at 6, 12 and 18 months. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies were included at the six month follow-up, five studies at the 12 month follow-up and three studies at the 18 month follow-up. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at six months (WMD 1. 7 kg, 95 % CI - 1. 4 to 4. 8 kg). The weighted sum of weight loss in the low fat group was - 5. 08 kg (95 % CI - 5. 9 to - 4. 3 kg) and in the control group was - 6. 5 kg, (95 % CI - 7. 3 to - 5. 7 kg). There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at 12 months (WMD 1. 1 kg, 95 % CI - 1. 6 to 3. 8 kg). The weighted sum of weight loss in the low fat group was - 2. 3 kg (95 % CI - 3. 2 to - 1. 4 kg) and in the control group was - 3. 4 kg (95 % CI - 4. 2 to - 2. 6 kg). There was no significant difference in weight loss between the two groups at 18 months (WMD 3. 7 kg, 95 % CI - 1. 8 to 9. 2). The weighted sum of weight loss in the control group was - 2. 3 kg (95 % CI - 3. 5 to - 1. 2 kg) and in the low fat group there was a weight gain of 0. 1 kg (95 % CI - 0. 8 to 1 kg). There was significant heterogeneity in the results for weight loss at six months and 12 months. Apart from one study which showed a slight but statistically significant difference in total cholesterol in the low fat group at one year follow-up, there were no significant differences between the dietary groups for other outcome measures such as serum lipids, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Studies measuring other factors such as perceived wellness and quality of life reported conflicting results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The review suggests that fat-restricted diets are no better than calorie restricted diets in achieving long term weight loss in overweight or obese people. Overall, participants lost slightly more weight on the control diets but this was not significantly different from the weight loss achieved through dietary fat restriction and was so small as to be clinically insignificant...|$|R
