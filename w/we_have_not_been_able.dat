500|$|In his {{confession}} Lace described {{how he had}} disposed of DeSimone's jewellery by throwing the items on to the railway embankment beneath Copnor Bridge in Portsmouth. In September 2009 a team of six British Transport Police officers with specialist training in forensic search techniques spent two days examining the area {{in an attempt to}} recover the jewellery. Although the ground had been the subject of extensive redevelopment in previous years and recovery of the items was considered unlikely, detectives authorised the operation to ensure every attempt had been made to find and return them to her parents. None of the items was discovered. DCI McTavish said of the search: [...] "It is recognised that in the years since Teresa's murder {{there has been a lot}} of disturbance and redevelopment around the railway track, but there was still a possibility that items may have lain undisturbed. Although <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to recover any items linked to either Teresa or the suspect it was important we did everything to explore this final aspect of the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Saban {{engineered}} {{a number}} of trades before the 1967 season. He brought Gilchrist to the team from Miami in a seven-player deal; Denver had sent Gilchrist to Miami the previous season. He also acquired quarterback Steve Tensi from the Chargers in August for first-round draft picks in 1968 and 1969. Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971. He said resigning was [...] "my responsibility to the team" [...] and what while the club made progress, [...] "my only regret is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to give Denver a championship". Saban's record as Denver's coach was 20–42–3. Although he was not successful in Denver, Saban became well known for his intensity and occasional temper tantrums. A much-watched clip of him bemoaning to Denver line coach Whitey Dovell that [...] "They're killin' me out there, Whitey, they're killin' me!" [...] introduced Saban to a wider audience when it was aired by NFL Films.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we believe, {{as one of its}} chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led to a discussion of Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E

An army helicopter arrived to survey the crash site at 10:30 local time (04:30 UTC) but was not able to land. All 152 passengers have been confirmed dead. All hospitals in Islamabad were declared in a state of emergency.|$|E
2500|$|Have {{the governments}} of Australia, New Zealand and South Korea been accomplices of the United States in the {{aggression}} against Vietnam in violation of international law? Yes (unanimously).

We intend to examine at the next session legal aspects of the problem and to seek proofs of any incriminating facts.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Only a precedent,' said Blanche, {{blushing}} a little, {{but still}} grave. 'We {{have had some}} experience, you know.

"See {{you there}} now," [...] said the Queen to the Lady Lochleven; [...] "we could not persuade you, our dearest hostess, that your {{household}} goods were in all safe keeping and surety.

The fact that you are well-known to Lady Cranston is, of course, an entirely satisfactory explanation of your presence here. At the same time, there is certain information concerning strangers of which we keep a record, and in your case there is a line or two which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to fill up." ...|$|E

She has an odd belief in dreams and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to laugh it out of her. I must own, too, that some of her dreams--but there, it would not do to let Gilbert hear me hinting such heresy. What have you found of much interest, Susan?" ...|$|E

[...] "And, indeed, I have lost all spirit about carrying on my life here." [...] He paused a moment and then, following the impulse to let Dorothea see deeper into the difficulty of his life, he said, [...] "The fact is, this trouble has come upon her confusedly. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to {{speak to each other}} about it. I am not sure what is in her mind about it: she may fear that I have really done something base. It is my fault; I ought to be more open. But I have been suffering cruelly." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to {{ascertain}} from travellers why the owls {{have gone to}} live with these doggies, so we beg humbly to offer our own private opinion to the reader. We assume, then, that owls find it absolutely needful to have holes. Probably prairie-owls cannot dig holes for themselves. Having discovered, however, a race of little creatures that could, they very likely determined to take forcible possession of the holes made by them. Finding, no doubt, that, when they did so, the doggies were too timid to object, and discovering, moreover, that they were sweet, innocent little creatures, the owls resolved to take them into partnership, and so the thing was settled-- that's how it came about, no doubt of it! ...|$|E

So far <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to bring any news of value, and at any rate I think {{we might as well}} cruise about here a little longer. There is one thing, if we should fall in with anyone bigger than ourselves and have to fight for it, those fellows who have just gone below will be a valuable addition to our strength.

We have heard of strange doings--that the butchers have, with the countenance of Burgundy, bearded the Duke of Aquitaine, and even carried off some of his friends from before his face; also that the houses of three of those who had withstood them had been burned, among them that of Maître Leroux; also that two traders had been killed, though which two they were <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> to learn." ...|$|E
