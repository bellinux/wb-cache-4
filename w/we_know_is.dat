25|$|One {{can think}} of each row {{operation}} as the left product by an elementary matrix.

The plot follows the fictional {{story of a}} photographer as she encounters emotional and existential obstacles in her life and begins to consider the idea that individual and group consciousness can influence the material world. Her experiences are offered by the filmmakers to illustrate the movie's thesis about quantum physics and consciousness.

25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this democracy has been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E
500|$|Initially, All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling only charted on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, peaking {{at number}} 30 in September 2006. After {{the success of}} their second studio album Riot! (2007), the album sales {{gradually}} built. Although it never charted on Billboard 200, it did manage to take number eight on the Billboard Catalog Albums chart in 2009. All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling only reached number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, but still received gold certification in 2009 by the British Phonographic Industry for shipping over 100,000 copies. It was then certified in Australia in 2012, where it went gold for shipments of over 35,000 units despite never reaching an Australian chart. In 2014, the album was certified gold in the United States for shipments of over 500,000 copies.

500|$|Typically, Farro {{would write}} the music while Williams wrote the lyrics. On occasion, Farro would {{contribute}} lyrics as well.

500|$|All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Paramore, {{released}} on July 26, 2005 under the Atlantic-distributed Fueled by Ramen in the United States. The production {{was led by}} James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick Trevisick, and Roger Alan Nichols. All songs were written by vocalist Hayley Williams and guitarist Josh Farro. The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, which occurred {{a few days after}} arriving in Orlando, served as the album's main theme. This theme was reflected especially in the album's cover and title. Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been labeled a [...] "scene classic".|$|E

500|$|Hayley Williams was {{originally}} signed to Atlantic Records in 2003 {{as a solo}} pop singer. However, Williams resisted the label's solo-career wishes, saying she did not envision herself as [...] "the next Madonna". As a result, she formed Paramore with Josh Farro, Zac Farro, and Jeremy Davis. In her short solo career, Williams recorded some demos, which were later re-recorded with the band for a [...] "more authentic" [...] sound. However, the band was almost fired because the label thought they [...] "were terrible." [...] Williams and Farro wrote two new songs, [...] "Here We Go Again" [...] and [...] "Hallelujah", which saved the group from being fired. The former song became the fifth track on All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling, while [...] "Hallelujah" [...] was saved for their sophomore album Riot! (2007).|$|E
500|$|Williams {{went on to}} add: If {{you really}} analyze that, the most {{inspiration}} is probably deep inside a synesthesiac. So for us, 'seeing sounds' is what we relate to the most. We figured we'd make an album out of it. Energy and emotion was the criteria , but we made the music anticipating the [...] show. That {{was the most important}} thing… 'Spaz' is [...] old school, hip hop feeling with some drum and bass. It becomes a big, tall monster. It's almost like this big gorilla looking down at you. If he smacks you, he kills you. His fingers are the size of your body. That's kinda what we're doing.

500|$|Critics have {{variously}} called All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling a pop punk, emo, or pop rock album. Trevor Kelley at Alternative Press categorized {{the music}} on the album as [...] "vaguely emo, but mostly mall-punk". Tom Whitson of Click Music defined {{the music on}} the album as emo with [...] "pop-punk beats", drawing comparisons from Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy. The Allmusic Neil Z. Yeung referred to the album as a [...] "formulaic" [...] pop punk album, complete with [...] "head-bobbing drums, straightforward riffs, and a midtempo sameness throughout". In a retrospective Alternative Press review by Tyler Sharp, the album {{was referred to as}} what would have been [...] "just another pop-rock effort that ultimately fell short in the face of its true potential" [...] if not for the band's later success. Gigwise reviewer David Renshaw also drew comparisons to Lavigne, but believed that the songs on the album were inferior to that of Lavigne's.|$|E

[...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 13 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list.

500|$|The album's {{production}} {{took place}} in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards radio, the band's A recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. Initially, the album received mixed reviews by music critics, who however praised the voice of Hayley Williams. The album had a weak domestic commercial performance: it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboards Heatseekers Chart. It reached No. 4 on the UK Rock Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach No. 51 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a gold certification by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its following records, All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

500|$|Paramore {{released}} All <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>Is</b> Falling on July 26, 2005 in the United States.

In his own words, Robertson [...] "wanted kids to discover the band without it being shoved down their throats." [...] In September 2005, a special Japanese edition containing a previously unreleased song [...] "O Star" [...] was made available. In January 2009, the album was released on vinyl for the first time. On May 19, 2009, a deluxe edition of the album was released exclusively on iTunes with live versions of [...] "Pressure" [...] and [...] "Here We Go Again", and the music videos for all the singles.
