5000|$|Each {{regiment}} in the Egyptian {{the army}} {{could have been}} identified by the weapon they carried: archers, lancers, spear men, and infantry. The lancers not only carried their long-range weapon, the lance, but also a dagger on their belt and a short-curved sword. Depicted in Egyptian art is a cane or <b>wand</b> <b>type</b> object that has been assigned to each fifth member in a group. This may indicate that the man carrying the cane or wand {{was in charge of}} a unit of men beside him (Girard).|$|E
5000|$|Players {{control a}} wand-wielding {{character}} that fires {{different types of}} projectiles based on the <b>wand</b> <b>type</b> the player has selected. The wand selection is signaled by {{the changes in the}} player's outfit color. The powers included are the normal shot (red outfit), the phoenix ability (pink outfit), the freeze shot (blue outfit), the bouncing ball shot (green outfit), the shield ability (orange outfit), and the broom ability (purple outfit). The game play resembles Capcom's Mega Man series, while the cutscenes resemble the ones in Tecmo's NES version of Ninja Gaiden. However, unlike the first three Mega Man titles, The Krion Conquest allows players to shoot directly upward, crouch to dodge enemies and projectiles, and charge attacks. (This action was later incorporated in Mega Man 4 and most of the later Mega Man titles that feature the charging [...] "Mega Buster".) ...|$|E

In this paper we specialize Wands approach {{in order to obtain}} principal types. We develop a novel technique for the treatment of imperative constructs that fits well with <b>Wands</b> <b>type</b> inference. The result is type inference for a &# 92;lambda-calculus with records and imperative features. One application of this result is type checking for the object-oriented language OSMALL...|$|R

40|$|Machine checked proofs of type {{inference}} algorithms often axiomatize MGU {{behavior as}} a set of axioms. Idempotent MGUs for a list of equational constraints are needed to reason about the correctness of <b>Wand’s</b> <b>type</b> inference algorithm and our extension of it. To characterize the behavior of idempotent MGUs, we propose a set of seven axioms; four of which have been proven in our earlier paper, where we formally verify that the first order unification is a model for the axioms. This paper shows that the first order unification is a model for the remaining three idempotent MGU axioms. Coq’s method of functional induction is the main proof technique used in proving the axioms. ...|$|R
40|$|Tagged Types encode some {{families}} of types indexed by labels. Like <b>Wand's</b> row <b>types,</b> they {{make use of}} specific variables from which new fields can be extracted, and like Rémy's record types, the types introduced in these fields can be parameterized. However, the logical and technical treatment of tagged types is original; it is claimed that they combine the intuitiveness of row types {{with most of the}} expressiveness of record types. Their use is illustrated by the design of polymorphic typing systems for various process calculi extending CCS. Processes are assigned types which associate polymorphic types with all communication labels. 1. Introduction 1. 1 Types for tagged expressions Typing record expressions or some behavior expressions, or inferring signatures in module systems, require collections of types associated with labels. A number of proposals have been done to give such structures some extensions capabilities. Wand introduced row variables in [20] to type records with pa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Vacuum spacetimes admitting a {{non-twisting}} geodetic multiple Weyl aligned null direction (WAND) {{are analyzed}} in arbitrary dimension using recently developed higher-dimensional Newman-Penrose (NP) formalism. We determine {{dependence of the}} metric and of the Weyl tensor on the affine parameter r along null geodesics generated by the <b>WAND</b> for <b>type</b> III and N spacetimes and for a special class of type II and D spacetimes, containing e. g. Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes and black strings and branes. For types III and N, all metric components are at most quadratic polynomials in r while for types II and D the r-dependence of the metric {{as well as of}} the Weyl tensor is determined by an integer m corresponding to the rank of the expansion matrix S_{ij}. It is shown that for non-vanishing expansion, all these spacetimes contain a curvature singularity. As an illustrative example, a shearing expanding type N five-dimensional vacuum solution is also re-derived using higher-dimensional NP formalism. This solution can be, however, identified with a direct product of a known four-dimensional type N metric with an extra dimension. Comment: 25 pages, version to be published in Class. Quantum Grav.

40|$|Interaction {{devices for}} virtual environments haveevolved slowly. Most systems still employ tracked <b>wands</b> or some <b>type</b> of gloves, {{as in the}} first days of vir-tual reality systems. Only {{recently}} have prop-based interfaces in combination with two-handed interaction techniques become increasingly popular. Passive real-world props augment interaction through tactile feed-back and often lead to more intuitive interaction techniques. The Cubic Mouse 1, 2 is a new, 3 D input device based on the prop idea. It consists of a cube-shaped box with three perpendicular rods passing through its center (Figure 1). We use a six-degrees-of-freedom (6 -DOF) tracker embedded in the Cubic Mouse to track the device’s position and orientation. The rods can be pushed and pulled, allowing the constrained input o...|$|R
50|$|The CWT is {{not visible}} {{once inside the}} fish; its {{presence}} is detected at close range by using a handheld <b>wand</b> or tunnel <b>type</b> detector that can sense the magnetized metal. A number code unique to either a group of fish or an individual fish is etched into {{the surface of the}} CWT, and to read the code the fish is killed first so that the tag can be removed and inspected under a microscope. Upon insertion, information about the fish such as hatching date, release date, location, species, sex, and length are recorded along with the corresponding tag code into a database, so that codes on recovered tags can be matched to information within that database. Coded wire tags have been used to research fish species from over 40 different families.|$|R
