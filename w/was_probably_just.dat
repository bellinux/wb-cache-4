5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had been dragged from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the Roman praenomen (given name) Caeso {{was said}} to be given to {{children}} who were born via C-section. While this <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> folk etymology made popular by Pliny the Elder, it was well known by the time the term came into common use.|$|E
25|$|In 1820, several {{expedition}}s {{claimed to}} have been the first to have sighted the ice shelf or the continent. A Russian expedition was led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev, a British expedition was captained by Edward Bransfield and an American sealer Nathaniel Palmer participated. The first landing <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> over a year later when American Captain John Davis, a sealer, set foot on the ice.|$|E

25|$|However, {{despite the}} fact that the papyrus is in the form of a letter to the vizier, it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a {{personal}} copy. According to Černý, a letter to the vizier would have begun with a long address enumerating the numerous titles of the vizier. In addition, such a letter would be in the archives of the Vizier, and would not have made their way into the hands of Henry Salt.|$|E
500|$|The Grade II listed 18th-century King's Head is {{probably}} the oldest public house in the village; the nearby Lion and Royal dates from 1824 and is also Grade II listed. It <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> called [...] "The Lion" [...] when it first opened, but added [...] "Royal" [...] to its name in honour of a special visitor. There is a large emblem over the front door, topped by the Prince of Wales's feathers, presented after the Prince (later Edward VII) stayed there, albeit briefly, in 1870.|$|E

"You Know What You Did" [...] was {{produced}} by Tony DiSanto, Adam DiVello, Liz Gateley, Sara Mast, Andrew Perry, Jason Sands, Robyn Schnieders, Sean Travis, Michael [...] "Spike" [...] Van Briesen, and Rick Van Meter. Rumors of a sex tape involving Conrad and Wahler, in addition to stories alleging that she invaded his house to retrieve it, surfaced in April 2007. Conrad adamantly denied both reports, commenting that [...] "if I ever tried to get something back from Jason, it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> photo albums and stuff" [...] and the producers [...] "videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The St. Petersburg Times editors {{decided the}} {{exchange}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> [...] "friendly chit-chat". Nonetheless, they assigned two reporters to investigate in November 2005. The {{recipient of the}} e-mail refused {{to cooperate with the}} reporters, and no other pages they interviewed had complaints about correspondence with Foley. The Times revisited their investigation [...] "more than once", ultimately choosing not to break the story.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Zito – {{soldier in}} the Manhattan faction (the West Side Crew) under capo Rosario Gangi. Zito was {{involved}} in bookmaking and loansharking business. Law enforcement labeled Zito as acting underboss from 1997 through 2003, but he <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a top lieutenant under official underboss Venero [...] "Benny Eggs" [...] Mangano. In the mid-1990s, Zito frequently visited Mangano in prison after his conviction in the Windows Case. Zito relayed messages from Mangano {{to the rest of}} the family leadership.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transition}} {{of the name}} from [...] "São João" [...] to [...] "Fernando de Noronha" [...] <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> natural usage. A royal letter dated May 20, 1559, to descendants of the Loronha family, still refers to the island by its official name of ilha de São João., but already in other places, e.g. the logbook of Martim Afonso de Sousa in the 1530s, [...] it {{was referred to as}} the [...] "island of Fernão de Noronha" [...] ("Noronha" [...] being a common misspelling of [...] "Loronha"). The informal name eventually displaced the official name.|$|E

2500|$|A memoir titled Rickles' Book was {{released}} on May 8, 2007 by Simon & Schuster. , a documentary about Rickles directed by John Landis, made its debut on HBO on December 2, 2007. Rickles won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program, besting a number of notable comics, including David Letterman, Jon Stewart, and Stephen Colbert. Rickles remarked, [...] "Stephen Colbert's a funny man, but he's too young. He has got {{plenty of time to}} win awards, but this may be my last year and I think that I made it count. On second thought it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a mercy award for an old man." [...] Rickles reprised his role of Mr. Potato Head for the Toy Story Midway Mania! attraction at Disney California Adventure Park, Disney's Hollywood Studios and Toy Story 3.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{recording}} of [...] "Money for Nothing", the signature sound of Knopfler's guitar may have been enhanced by a [...] "happy accident" [...] of microphone placement. Knopfler was using his Gibson Les Paul going through a Laney amplifier. While setting up the guitar amplifier microphones {{in an effort to}} get the [...] "ZZ Top sound" [...] that Knopfler was after, guitar tech Ron Eve, who was in the control room, heard the [...] "amazing" [...] sound before Dorfsman was finished arranging the mics. [...] "One mic was pointing down at the floor," [...] Dorfsman remembered, [...] "another was not quite on the speaker, another was somewhere else, and it wasn't how I would want to set things up—it <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> left from the night before, when I'd been preparing things for the next day and had not really finished the setup." [...] What they heard was exactly what ended up on the record; no additional processing or effects were used during the mix.|$|E
2500|$|The {{surveyor}} F. P. McCabe, under {{instructions from}} the Colonial Secretary, surveyed a number of reserves on the lower Murrumbidgee River in about 1849. [...] The reserves were finally gazetted in October 1852. [...] They included the [...] "Pin Pan Pa" [...] reserve of , described as being [...] "situated on cattle runs, occupied by Phelps and Darchey", just over a mile downstream from [...] "the hut at Pin-pan-pa". [...] The reserve was taken from Phelps and Chadwick’s [...] "Pimpampa" [...] and Thomas D'Archy’s [...] "Budgee Budgee" [...] runs. [...] During the 1850s the Pimpampa Reserve {{was used as a}} crossing place for stock and drays. [...] Being close to the Lachlan–Murrumbidgee junction the crossing-place was probably used by those who were unwilling to leave the river frontages during hot and dry conditions. [...] Feldtmann (1976) states that a hotel was built at the locality by the late 1850s; if true, it was certainly not licensed and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a bush shanty serving a passing trade and workers on local pastoral runs.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 Vincent self-published {{his first}} book The Dead Philosophers Society (SPAV: Socrates Plato Aristotle Vincent).

25|$|Genealogical {{material}} about Vortigern's ancestry, {{including the}} names of his four sons (Vortimer, Pascent, Catigern, and Faustus), his father Vitalis, his grandfather Vitalinus, and his great-grandfather Gloui, who <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> an eponym which associates Vortigern with Glevum, the civitas of Gloucester.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War it was {{suggested}} that the tower should be demolished to prevent it from being used as a navigation aid by German bombers. A few bombs were dropped near the tower in 1940 and 1941, but <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> randomly jettisoned.|$|R

6000|$|At {{the door}} Mary turned round. [...] "Good-night," [...] she said, and {{wondered}} {{as she said}} the words why Anne was smiling in that curious way.

5000|$|Rockabill (...) is a {{group of}} two islands, [...] "The Rock" [...] and [...] "The Bill", lying in the western Irish Sea about 6 {{kilometres}} east-north-east of Skerries, County Dublin, Ireland.

50|$|Name of {{the village}} is unusual, but the origin of it is obscured. One of the {{explanations}} {{is that it is}} because the village is closed or covered by the surrounding hills (in Serbian: zaklopiti) while the other is that a certain Turkish pasha was slaughtered (Serbian: zaklati) in the area. Both those explanations, though, <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> folk etymology.|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding this procedure, which denoted a wise {{distrust}} of these Indian allies, the governor manifested {{a certain degree}} of confidence towards a portion of them, that <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> as discreet in another way. A part of the crew of every vessel, with the exception of those that went to the Peak, was composed of Kannakas; and no less than ten of them were habitually employed in the Anne, which carried two whale-boats for emergencies. None of these men were sent away, or were in any manner taken from their customary employments. So much confidence had the governor in his own authority, and in his power to influence these particular individuals, that he did not hesitate about keeping them near himself, and, in a measure, of entrusting the safety of his person to their care. It is true, that the Kannakas of both the Anne and the Martha were a sort of confidential seamen, having now been employed in the colony several years, and got a taste for the habits of the settlers.|$|E
60|$|From a {{consensus}} of the nerves of all the ladies left in town so late in the season, {{she knew that the}} only place on any steamer where your room ought to be <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> where they could not get it. If you went too high, you felt the rolling terribly, and people tramping {{up and down on the}} promenade under your window kept you awake the whole night; if you went too low, you felt the engine thump, thump, thump in your head the whole way over. If you went too far forward, you got the pitching; if you went aft, on the kitchen side, you got the smell of the cooking. The only place, really, was just back of the dining-saloon on the south side of the ship; it was smooth there, and it was quiet, and you had the sun in your window all the way over. He asked her if he must take their room there or nowhere, and she answered that he must do his best, but that she would not be satisfied with any other place.|$|E
60|$|They had plenty, {{on these}} lines, the two elder women, {{to give and}} to take, and it was even not quite clear to the pilgrim from Boston that what she should mainly have {{arranged}} for in London was not a series of thrills for herself. She had a bad conscience, indeed almost a sense of immorality, in having to recognise that she was, as she said, carried away. She laughed to Milly when she also said that she didn't know where it would end; and the principal of her uneasiness was that Mrs. Lowder's life bristled for her with elements that she was really having to look at for the first time. They represented, she believed, the world, the world that, {{as a consequence of}} the cold shoulder turned to it by the Pilgrim Fathers, had never yet boldly crossed to Boston--it would surely have sunk the stoutest Cunarder--and she couldn't pretend that she faced the prospect simply because Milly had had a caprice. She was in the act herself of having one, directed precisely to their present spectacle. She could but seek strength in the thought that she had never had one--or had never yielded to one, which came to the same thing--before. The sustaining sense of it all, moreover, as literary material--that quite dropped from her. She must wait, at any rate, she should see: it struck her, so far as she had got, as vast, obscure, lurid. She reflected in the watches of the night that she <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> going to love it for itself--that is for itself and Milly. The odd thing was that she could think of Milly's loving it without dread--or with dread, at least not on the score of conscience, only on the score of peace. It was a mercy, at all events, for the hour, that their fancies jumped together.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from brackish water by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> ecomorphs.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} written {{mention of}} the town {{dates back to the}} 12th century, when Saxo Grammaticus in Gesta Danorum refers to it as Portus Mercatorum, which translates into Merchants' Harbour or in the Danish of the time Købmannahavn. In a letter from 1186, Pope Urban III refers to the city as Hafn, but this <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> a shortened version of the full name.|$|R
2500|$|Although no Halaf {{settlement}} {{has been}} extensively excavated some buildings have been excavated: the tholoi of Tell Arpachiyah, circular domed structures approached through long rectangular anterooms.

They were constructed of mud-brick sometimes on stone foundations and may have been for ritual use (one contained a large number of female figurines). Other circular buildings <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> <b>just</b> houses.|$|R
