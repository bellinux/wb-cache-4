5|$|He was {{a member}} of the International Panel of the Commission of Enquiry into the Activities of Nazism in Argentina (CEANA) which was {{established}} in 1997 to identify Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> who had emigrated to Argentina, and transferred victim assets (Nazi gold) there.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Wiesenthal {{dedicated}} most of {{his life}} to tracking down and gathering information on fugitive Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> so that they could be brought to trial. In 1947 he co-founded the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, where he and others gathered information for future war crime trials and aided refugees in their search for lost relatives. He opened the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime in Vienna in 1961 and continued to try to locate missing Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> He played a small role in locating Adolf Eichmann, who was captured in Buenos Aires in 1960, and worked closely with the Austrian justice ministry to prepare a dossier on Franz Stangl, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1971.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} months, {{a number of}} <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> {{from the ranks of}} the Waffen-SS were released. Many of them were made eligible for prisoner-of-war compensation from local governments. In 1956 the Federal Ministry of Defence announced that former members of the Waffen-SS, up to the grade of lieutenant colonel, would be accepted to the Bundeswehr at their old rank.|$|E

5|$|Ostensibly, HIAG existed {{to provide}} aid to veterans, but it {{included}} many members who were convicted <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> These included Bittrich, Dietrich, Meyer and Gustav Lombard. Kumm managed to avoid extradition to Yugoslavia to stand trial for war crimes by fleeing over {{the wall of the}} Dachau internment camp.|$|E
5|$|An {{influential}} group {{assembled in}} Britain {{to lobby for}} his release from prison. Headed by Lord Hankey, the group included politicians Lord de L'Isle and Richard Stokes, Field Marshal Alexander and Admiral of the Fleet The Earl of Cork and Orrery, and military historians Basil Liddell Hart and J. F. C. Fuller. Upon re-gaining the prime ministership in 1951, Winston Churchill, who was {{closely associated with the}} group, gave priority to the quick release of the <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> remaining in British custody.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{historian}} Joseph Wulf {{proposed that}} the Wannsee House should {{be made into a}} Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the West German government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminals,</b> Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E

5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, {{the shrine}} {{has become a}} controversial symbol for Japanese nationalists. While many citizens of various political persuasions visit the site to honor relatives killed in battle, whose kami (spirit) {{are said to be}} enshrined there, so too are the kami of several class-A <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> These criminals were enshrined in a secret ceremony in 1978, which has raised the ire of Japanese pacifists and the international community.|$|E
5|$|Prime Minister Suzuki felt {{compelled}} to meet the Japanese press, to whom he reiterated his government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on. The Japanese government did not react. Emperor Hirohito, the government, and the war council considered four conditions for surrender: {{the preservation of the}} kokutai (Imperial institution and national polity), assumption by the Imperial Headquarters of responsibility for disarmament and demobilization, no occupation of the Japanese Home Islands, Korea, or Formosa, and delegation of the punishment of <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> to the Japanese government.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{established}} occupation administrations in Austria and Germany. The former {{became a}} neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter {{was divided into}} western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A denazification programme in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> {{and the removal of}} ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.|$|E

5|$|The Allies of World War II held {{a series}} of {{military}} tribunals and trials, beginning with a trial of the major <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> from November 1945 to October 1946. Hess was tried with this first group of 23 defendants, all of whom were charged with four counts—conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity, in violation of international laws governing warfare.|$|E
5|$|The Association of Shinto Shrines is {{politically}} active in encouraging {{support for the}} Emperor, including campaigns such as distributing amulets from Ise Shrine. Ise Shrine {{was one of the}} most important shrines in State Shinto, symbolizing Amaterasu's presence and connection to the Emperor. In contrast, the Meiji-era Yasukuni Shrine is frequently the target of State Shinto controversies, mostly owing to its enshrinement of Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b>|$|E
5|$|The accused Fritz Knöchlein, a German national, in {{the charge}} of the Hamburg Garrison Unit, {{pursuant}} to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of <b>War</b> <b>Criminals,</b> is charged with committing a war crime in that he {{in the vicinity of}} Paradis, Pas-de-Calais, France, on or about 27 May 1940, in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the killing of about ninety prisoners-of-war, members of The Royal Norfolk Regiment and other British Units.|$|E

5|$|The book praises Dallaire's {{commitment}} to his peacekeeping mission, but {{is critical of}} MacKenzie, who is depicted as being ignorant of the Bosnian political situation. In response to Off's portrayal of him, MacKenzie considered suing for libel, but opted not to. The book praises Arbour's efforts at building the legitimacy of International Criminal Tribunals and her efforts in indicting alleged <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> from the massacres in Rwanda and Bosnia. Through these biographies, the book addresses themes of morality and UN effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Labuan was one {{of several}} {{locations}} at which the Australian military conducted trials to prosecute suspected Japanese <b>war</b> <b>criminals.</b> A total of 16 trials were held on the island between 3 December 1945 and 31 January 1946, during which 128 men were convicted and 17 acquitted. Labuan War Cemetery was also established as the burial place for all of the Commonwealth personnel killed on or near Borneo. It includes 3,900 graves, most of which are for prisoners of war who died while being held by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|After these territories {{returned}} to Yugoslav control, {{the military and}} national courts in Bačka prosecuted collaborators who had killed about 10,000–20,000 civilians. The Security Service of Vojvodina captured {{the majority of these}} people. Meanwhile, some of those who were responsible for the 1942 massacres in southern Bačka were captured in, and extradited from, the newly formed People's Republic of Hungary. In his book Mađari u Vojvodini: 1941–1946 ("Hungarians in Vojvodina: 1941–1946"; Novi Sad, 1996), Professor Sándor Kaszás from the University of Novi Sad listed a total of 1,686 executed <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> by name, of whom around 1,000 were Hungarian.|$|E

High Representative Valentin Inzko described the decision as [...] "pitiful" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "test of maturity of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political establishment", further saying that: [...] "The money is of the taxpayers, but also of the mothers of Srebrenica.

5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi <b>War</b> <b>Criminals</b> only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to}} be able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped {{that this would}} bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries and NATO, thereby allowing Partner countries {{to choose their own}} priorities for cooperation. It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected <b>war</b> <b>criminals</b> from the Balkans.|$|E
