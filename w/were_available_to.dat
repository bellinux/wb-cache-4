5|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the Australian and New Zealand economies, Nauru and Ocean islands had been allocated a low priority for the limited military assets which <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> protect the Australia Station and both islands were undefended in December 1940. Strategic stockpiles of phosphate had been built up in Australia, however, to lessen the impact of {{an attack on the}} islands.|$|E
5|$|With {{a stadium}} {{capacity}} of 70,500, a {{total amount of}} 46,000 tickets <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> fans and the general public, with the two finalist teams receiving 20,000 tickets each and with 6,000 tickets being available for sale to fans worldwide via UEFA.com from 5 to 23 March 2015 in four price categories: €390, €280, €160, and €70. The rest of 24,500 tickets were allocated to sponsors and officials.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> make {{up some of the}} difference. Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E

5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed {{what remained of the}} Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> support this and the project came to nothing. The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of the}} site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the raid, it was decided by the British naval command that unless {{sufficient}} destroyers <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> protect the barrage, the drifters would have to be withdrawn at night. The drifters would only be operating for less than twelve hours a day, and would have to leave their positions by 15:00 every day. Despite the damage received by the Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the pursuit by Dartmouth and Bristol, the Austro-Hungarian forces inflicted more serious casualties on the Allied blockade. In addition to the sunk and damaged drifters, the cruiser Dartmouth was nearly sunk by the German submarine UC-25, the French destroyer Boutefeu was mined and sunk, and a munitions convoy to Valona was interdicted.|$|E

At {{the end of each}} round, NL teams could protect an additional three players and AL teams could protect an additional four. To further protect the AL teams, a maximum of eight AL teams could have three players chosen.|$|E

5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together to make do. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, roughly equivalent to two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s, {{when the}} only {{anticonvulsant}} drugs were the sedative bromides (discovered 1857) and phenobarbital (1912), the ketogenic diet was widely used and studied. This changed in 1938 when H. Houston Merritt and Tracy Putnam discovered phenytoin (Dilantin), and the focus of research shifted to discovering new drugs. With the introduction of sodium valproate in the 1970s, drugs <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> neurologists that were effective across {{a broad range of}} epileptic syndromes and seizure types. The use of the ketogenic diet, by this time restricted to difficult cases such as Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, declined further.|$|E

He had also expressed desire to amalgamate the existing city of Edmonton {{with the city of}} Strathcona, which was divided from Edmonton by the North Saskatchewan River, situated on the south. Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E

The group included fifteen who were tried in absentia. In 2009, the process was split for Milan Tepavac and Ilija Vorkapić who <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> Croatian authorities, and once more a year later when Tepavac was judged not fit to stand trial. Vorkapić was acquitted in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In May and June, at {{the very}} western end of the English Channel, U-boats began {{operating}} effectively. Some 17 attacks were made by aircraft on the U-boats, none successful. The ASB was ordered to be replaced with the DC. No specialised aerial DCs were available. A modified 450lb Naval DC was used. No effective tactics <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> locate U-boats. By 1940, they attacked at night, and on the surface. ASDIC was useless against surfaced submarines, and flares {{could not be used}} at the low altitude required by aircraft to make an attack. To combat this, closer co-operation by the Navy and Coastal Command was needed.|$|E

5|$|Italian armies easily outnumbered {{those of}} the British, who were {{defending}} multiple areas in North Africa with skeleton forces. With Cyrenaica and the Sudan under threat as well as Somaliland, only token units <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> control what was considered a relatively unimportant possession. In fact, until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon Somaliland altogether {{in the face of}} invasion. However, General Archibald Wavell, the newly appointed commander of British armies in Africa, successfully recommended to the British Chiefs of Staff that Somaliland be defended. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force that was adjudged capable of defending the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring {{used the}} Jews of Rome as slave labour on the {{construction}} of fortifications – as he had earlier done with those of Tunis. When ordered to deport the Roman Jews, Kesselring resisted. He announced that no resources <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> carry out such an order. Hitler then transferred responsibility to the SS. About 2,000 Roman Jews were ultimately deported between October 1943 and June 1944, half of them on 16 October 1943. During the German occupation of Italy, the Germans were believed to have killed some 46,000 Italian civilians, including 7,000 Jews.|$|E

5|$|Norsk Spisevognselskap A/S, often {{abbreviated}} NSS or shortened to Spisevognselskapet, was a Norwegian {{state enterprise}} which operated restaurant carriages on Norwegian trains and restaurants at railway stations and railway hotels. The company {{was established in}} December 1918, and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, it was acquired by the state in 1926. Meals served in the restaurant carriages were relatively expensive, although they <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> all passengers. In the 1950s, the company began using serving trolleys on trains.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at GCI {{viewed the}} CheMin {{instrument}} aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient {{works of art}} without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments <b>were</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on Curiosity directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the X-Duetto. Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{air support}} in the {{southern}} part of the salient was provided by the 2nd Air Army and the 17th Air Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Stepan Krasovsky and Lieutenant General Vladimir Sudets, respectively.
