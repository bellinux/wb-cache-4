The fact that it was a fully coined term and related to so many people that have existed and do exist made me feel it was okay to not exist on the same level as everyone else, it was okay to be comfortable doing your own thing. ‘Are <b>We</b> <b>Ready?</b> (Wreck)’ was me… not attacking the world around me but outlining why I don’t really get it and why I don’t fit in with it.|$|E
