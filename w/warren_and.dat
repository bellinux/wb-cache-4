5|$|<b>Warren</b> <b>and</b> her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. <b>Warren</b> <b>and</b> Tyagi {{point out that}} a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is that even with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Warren {{was asked}} to advise the National Bankruptcy Review Commission.

5|$|Although initial {{box office}} {{reception}} was positive {{both in the}} United Kingdom and overseas, Inseminoid has since failed to impress a majority of critics, who have faulted Warren's film for perceived poor acting, special effects and set design. Despite praise for actress Judy Geeson's depiction of the lead character, Sandy, approval of the film in general has been tarnished due to its concept of an extraterrestrial insemination, which has been viewed negatively {{in comparison to the}} premise of Alien (1979). Both <b>Warren</b> <b>and</b> Alien distributors 20th Century Fox have rejected claims that the script of Inseminoid was influenced by that of the earlier film.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs between Albany (35°S) and the Stirling Range (34°24'S) in the {{southwest}} of Western Australia, at the juncture of the Esperance Plains, <b>Warren</b> <b>and</b> Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions.

It is cool and wet, with temperatures between four and 30°C (39–86°F) and rainfall of around 800 millimetres (31in). The species occurs there in two distinct population clusters: southern populations occur among low woodland of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) in shallow, nutrient-poor white or grey sand over laterite; Stirling Range populations occur at altitudes of between 500 and 1100 metres (1640–3960ft), among heath on rocky mountain slopes and tops, and in shale in gullies.|$|E
