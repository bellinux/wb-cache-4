25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury {{if she did not}} testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

500|$|During pre-production, {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that several actresses including Genelia D'Souza, Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor were {{being considered for}} the role of Kaali Gawde. However, Chopra was approached over the others, who agreed to do the film instantly. While initial reports suggested that Chopra would be playing the role of a sex worker in the film, they were later denied as rumours. In an interview with Rediff.com, she clarified that she was playing a prostitute's daughter. On Chopra's character, Malhotra commented, [...] "Despite being a male dominated film, the part played by Priyanka is very prominent. It isn't that of a simple or ordinary lover. She is there for Vijay unconditionally and without any expectations. With all the dangerous people around her, she is like this pretty flower standing there <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face." [...] In preparation for her role, Chopra wanted to visit a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
500|$|The story {{continues}} with the Stranger traveling south. In the song [...] "Denver," [...] the character {{falls in love}} with a woman he meets in a bar in town. One of the lines from [...] "Blue Rock Montana" [...] is repeated, with a variation: [...] "And they danced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their faces". The following song, [...] "Can I Sleep in Your Arms?", shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love. Next is [...] "Remember Me", where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love. The story ends with [...] "Hands on the Wheel", which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child, presumably his grandson, and his new love. The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song [...] "Bandera".|$|E

Meredith is {{relatively}} unscathed, {{while the rest}} have serious injuries: the pilot, Jerry (James LeGros), has a major spine injury, and Yang dislocates her arm. Robbins' femur is broken and sticking through the skin, Sloan has serious internal injuries; though initially adrenaline keeps him on his feet. Shepherd is sucked out {{the side of the}} plane and awakens alone in the wood; his mangled hand having been pushed through the door of the plane. However, none are in as bad shape as Lexie, who is crushed under a piece of the plane. While Meredith searches for Shepherd, Yang and Sloan try to move the debris off Lexie. Eventually, the two realize that they cannot save her, so Sloan holds her hand while she dies, telling her that he loves her. As Sloan tells her of the life the two were meant to have together, Lexie dies <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face just as Meredith and Yang are approaching.|$|E

500|$|The {{story begins}} with [...] "Time of the Preacher", where the {{character}} evokes {{his love for}} his wife, whom he suspects is unfaithful. In the following song, [...] "I Couldn't Believe It Was True", the infidelity is revealed. This leads to a short version of [...] "Time of the Preacher," [...] wherein the singer ends with the line [...] "Now the lesson is over, and the killing's begun". The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of [...] "Blue Rock, Montana" [...] and [...] "Red Headed Stranger". The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states [...] "And they died <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their faces." [...] This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger. This section is followed by Nelson's cover of the 1947 Fred Rose, song [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain", where the fugitive laments {{the loss of his}} wife. In [...] "Red Headed Stranger," [...] the protagonist commits a subsequent murder—he kills a woman who merely reaches out to touch one of his horses. [...] The horse means more to him than life because it had belonged to his wife. [...] But the Stranger goes free because [...] "you can't hang a man for killin' a woman who's tryin' to steal your horse." ...|$|E
500|$|Eckhart's {{next project}} was Thank You for Smoking, {{in which he}} played Nick Naylor, a tobacco {{lobbyist}} whose firm researched the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer. Eckhart said that he felt challenged playing the role: [...] "You have to say these words that are crazy, and yet do it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> your face and have the audience like you. At one point, I'm doing a talk show with a kid who's dying of cancer, and he's going through chemotherapy and the whole thing, and I spin it so the anti-smoking people are the bad guys and I'm the good guy, and I'm this guy's best friend. I mean, it's whacked out." [...] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 30th annual Toronto International Film Festival in 2005. It had a limited release in March 2006 and was released worldwide the following month. For his performance, Eckhart received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. A contributor of USA Today wrote that he gave a [...] "standout, whip-smart performance" [...] citing that as Nick Naylor he kept him [...] "likable even in his cynicism." [...] In the Seattle Post-Intelligencer review of the film, {{it was reported that}} [...] "Under his chummy but compassionless smile" [...] Eckhart radiated charm and [...] "Naylor's true joys: manipulating arguments, steering debate, cooking words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Redmond {{also argued}} that [...] "No people {{can be said to}} have rightly proved their {{nationhood}} and their power to maintain it until they have demonstrated their military prowess".

2500|$|The veteran West Indies cricket writer Tony Becca {{wrote in}} the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "Mendis bowls everything. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> {{his face as he}} caresses the ball before {{delivering}} it, he bowls the offbreak, he bowls the legbreak, he bowls the googly, he bowls the flipper, he bowls a straight delivery, he bowls them with different grips and different actions, he bowls them with a different trajectory and at a different pace, and he disguises them brilliantly. The result is that he mesmerises, or bamboozles, batsmen.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to that, Lee {{noted that the}} song was also inspired by other events in her life, including people who she was collaborating with, [...] "holding me down and manipulating me and betraying me", eventually leading her {{to make the decision}} of [...] "put my foot down and walk out the door". During a 2011 interview with Spin magazine, Lee described [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] as [...] "mostly a chick anthem: 'You only want me when you're drunk. You only want me because I'm not there'" [...] and deemed it empowering for her female audience of listeners due to the response she had received from them. In retrospect, Lee mentioned in 2016, [...] "I love this song because it has this fun spirit that was new for us as a band.

Dilshan was somewhat angry at this and asked the fan, [...] "Are you going to replace me?" [...] The issue came on social media as well. After Dilshan landed in Sri Lanka, he stated to the media that he would know when to retire, just as he had in test cricket and Sri Lankans who are engaged outside the country must know their limits.|$|E
