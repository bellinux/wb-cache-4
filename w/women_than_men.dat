Up to 10% of women have a urinary tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E

There were 260 and 90 recorded Sallekhana deaths among Svetambara and Digambara Jains respectively between 1993 and 2003. According to Jitendra Shah, the Director of L D Institute of Indology in Ahmedabad, {{an average of}} about 240 Jains practice Sallekhana each year in India. Most of them are not recorded or noticed. Statistically, Sallekhana is undertaken both by men and women of all economic classes and among the educationally forward Jains. It is observed more often by <b>women</b> <b>than</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Obesity is {{a leading}} {{preventable}} cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2015, 600 million adults (12%) and 100 million children were obese. Obesity {{is more common in}} <b>women</b> <b>than</b> <b>men.</b> Authorities view it {{as one of the most}} serious public health problems of the 21stcentury. Obesity is stigmatized in much of the modern world (particularly in the Western world), though it was seen as a symbol of wealth and fertility at other times in history and still is in some parts of the world. In 2013, the American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women {{are far more likely}} to be the primary caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, depression is the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> <b>men</b> (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E

5|$|Attitudes {{and social}} {{stereotypes}} can create {{barriers to the}} detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This {{is more of a}} barrier for <b>women</b> <b>than</b> <b>men.</b> Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.|$|E

Loryan et al. suggested this sex difference was {{due to the fact that}} women’s livers have 1.9 -fold greater CYP 2 B 6 protein levels <b>than</b> <b>men</b> [7]. In this study, the mean PE in the perioperative period was significantly lower in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men,</b> which might be caused by the sex difference of propofol pharmacokinetics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Studies have {{suggested}} that the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease may not have been as effective in women as in men. Therefore, we aimed to examine whether the incidence, attack rate and mortality of myocardial infarction (MI) events have declined less in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men.</b> Methods Two large population-based MI registers, the FINAMI register and the Finnish Cardiovascular Disease Register (CVDR) were used for comparing the event rates among men and women aged ≥ 35 years in two time periods, 1994 – 1996 and 2000 – 2002. Results In the FINAMI register a total of 5, 252 events were recorded in men and 4, 898 in women. Corresponding numbers in the CVDR were 78, 709 and 70, 464. Both FINAMI and CVDR data suggested smaller declines in incidence and attack rate of MI events in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men.</b> In CVDR data the decline in mortality was also smaller in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men,</b> while in FINAMI data this difference did not reach statistical significance. In the large CVDR data set, negative binomial regression models revealed smaller declines in incidence (p = 0. 006), attack rate (p = 0. 008) and mortality (p = 0. 04) in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> aged Conclusion The incidence and attack rate of MI events have declined less in women aged < 55 <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> of similar age. In older persons no significant differences were observed. Further studies are warranted to find out the reasons why the development has been less favourable for young <b>women</b> <b>than</b> for <b>men.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{management}} and prognosis of heart diseases (HD) or arrhythmias {{may depend on}} the patient gender. The {{purpose of the study}} was to look for the influence of gender on the indications and the long-term results of ablation of atrial flutter (AFl). Methods 965 patients, 743 males, 222 females (23 %), mean age 64 ± 12 years were consecutively referred for radiofrequency ablation of recurrent or poor-tolerated AFL Clinical history, other arrhythmias as atrial fibrillation (AF), data of echocardiography were collected. The patients were followed from 3 months up to 10 years. ResultsWomen tended to be older <b>than</b> <b>men</b> (65. 5 ± 12 vs 64 ± 11. 5 years) (p< 0. 08). Underlying HD was as frequent in women as in men (76 %). HD nature differed: women had more congenital HD (10 vs 2 %, p< 0. 0001), more valvular HD (17. 5 vs 10 % p< 0. 002) and less respiratory failure (4. 5 vs 10 %) (p< 0. 01), less ischemic HD (5 vs 20 %) (p< 0. 0000) <b>than</b> <b>men.</b> Hypertensive HD, dilated cardiomyopathy or various HD's did not differ. Previous history of AF was more frequent in women (31. 5 %) <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (26 %) (p< 0. 012). AFl-related rhythmic cardiomyopathy tended to be less frequent in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (4 vs 8 %) (p< 0. 07). Presentation with 1 / 1 AFl was as frequent in women as in men (10 % vs 7 %). AFl ablation-related major complications as complete AV block, death or cardiac shock were more frequent in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (4 vs 1 %) (p< 0. 004). After 3 ± 3 years, AFl recurrences tended to be less frequent in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (8. 5 vs 13 %) (p< 0. 06). AF occurrence was more frequent in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (24 vs 14 %) (p< 0. 0002). Among these patients 66 % of women and men had no history of AF before AFl ablation. Their risk of AF remains higher in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men</b> (16 % vs 8 %) (p< 0. 007). ConclusionsThere gender-related differences in the prevalence, clinical presentation, ablation-related complications and AF incidence. AFL is less common in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men,</b> despite similar age and as frequent underlying HD. The risk of AFl ablation-related major complications is higher in <b>women</b> <b>than</b> in <b>men.</b> <b>Women</b> have more frequently history of AF and an independent higher risk <b>than</b> <b>men</b> of developing AF after ablation of atrial flutter...|$|R
