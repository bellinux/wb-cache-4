5|$|Unsurprisingly, Ostapchuk {{was against}} Alliance Atlantis’s plans for Whyte Avenue, believing {{that it would}} put both the Garneau and the Princess out of business. The Old Strathcona Foundation sided with Magic Lantern, and fought the plans. The {{argument}} {{went all the way}} to Edmonton City Council, which was asked to <b>waive</b> Old Strathcona’s four-story height limit for the six-story multiplex. Council sided against Alliance Atlantis when Councillor Terry Cavanagh changed his vote at the last minute, defeating the motion 6-5.|$|E
5|$|After Burrows {{was asked}} to <b>waive</b> his no trade clause on February 27, 2017 he was traded by the Canucks to the Ottawa Senators in {{exchange}} for Jonathan Dahlén. Ottawa immediately signed Burrows to a two-year contract extension. He made his debut for the Senators on March 2, 2017, scoring both goals in a 2–1 victory over the Colorado Avalanche. Burrows played 15 games in the 2017 playoffs before suffering an injury in game 3 of the eastern conference finals on May 17, subsequently ending his season. His Ottawa Senators were eliminated in 7 games by the Pittsburgh Penguins.|$|E

5|$|After {{the season}} had concluded, word was leaked that star forward Heatley had demanded a trade, placing GM Murray in a {{precarious}} position. On June 30, {{a deal to}} Edmonton was finalized, but Heatley rejected it by refusing to <b>waive</b> his no-trade clause. On September 12, 2009, Heatley was traded, along with a fifth-round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft, to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo, {{as well as a}} second-round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft. Michalek would play well for the Senators, but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off-season.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 NHL trade deadline, the Toronto Maple Leafs {{reportedly}} {{attempted to}} acquire Kiprusoff, but he elected not to <b>waive</b> his no-trade clause amid speculation {{that he intended}} to retire at season's end. Finnish news agency STT-Lehtikuva reported in June that the goaltender had informed the Finnish national team that he had decided to end his playing career, and the Flames formally announced his retirement on September 9, 2013. He ended his career as the Flames' franchise leader in wins (305), shutouts (41) and games played by a goaltender (576).|$|E
5|$|Burnside {{was ordered}} to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built {{it up to a}} {{strength}} of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to <b>waive</b> his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E

5|$|Sebille {{enlisted in}} the United States Army Air Corps {{two weeks after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan. He began flight {{training}} in January 1942, in spite of being two months older than the cutoff age of 26, as the desperate need for pilots combined with Sebille's skills as a pilot allowed him to <b>waive</b> the age restriction. During that time he was described as an outstanding pilot and leader, and his maturity was helpful for the younger flight trainees. After completing flight training, Sebille was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the 450th Bombardment Squadron, 322nd Bombardment Group 3rd Bombardment Wing at MacDill Field, Florida. Sebille flew B-26 Marauder aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The crew of Atlantis had six {{possible}} landing opportunities on Saturday. Managers {{evaluated the}} best three opportunities {{of the day}} to try bring the orbiter home. Saturday's first landing opportunity at Kennedy Space Center was waived due to poor weather forecasts, and observed weather violations for the landing criteria. After further evaluating weather patterns around Florida, managers on the ground chose to <b>waive</b> the second opportunity as well, and wait one more day to attempt to get the orbiter into Florida on Sunday. Weather in California had excellent forecasts, so if the attempts on Sunday to land in Florida were not successful, the shuttle would be able to land at Edwards Air Force Base without weather being an issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice, a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the hospice benefit must <b>waive</b> other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the hospice benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the hospice is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the hospice re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|Shakur {{and four}} others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in Bronx on December 31, 1973, {{on charges of}} {{attempting}} to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O'Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in St. Albans, Queens on January 28, 1973. On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New York to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to <b>waive</b> her right to an extradition hearing, {{and asked for a}} full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E.

5|$|The Buccaneers signed their first-ever {{free agents}} in January: former Birmingham Americans and Nebraska guard Tom Alward, Denver Broncos and Notre Dame {{defensive}} end Pete Duranko, and Chicago Bears wide receiver Wayne Wheeler. Having not selected a {{quarterback in the}} veteran allocation draft, they addressed that need in their first-ever trade, a deal to get local favorite Steve Spurrier from the San Francisco 49ers. The former Heisman Trophy winner was obtained for a second-round draft choice {{and two of the}} veteran draftees, Bruce Elia and Willie McGee. An earlier attempt to obtain a quarterback failed when the team sent a future draft pick to the Saints for backup quarterback Larry Cipa, only to <b>waive</b> him when he failed his physical. The Buccaneers also used a third-round pick to obtain defensive back Mike Washington from the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), {{successor}} to the GNR, was compelled by the Ministry of Transport to <b>waive</b> the veto or proceed with its own electrification. In November 1925, the LNER abandoned its electrification scheme. In 1929 the incoming Second Labour Government initiated a policy of direct subsidy for major infrastructure projects, and in 1930 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London began work on extending the GNP, now the Piccadilly line. The Piccadilly line extension to Cockfosters opened in stages, with stations at Wood Green and Turnpike Lane – both on {{the western edge of}} Noel Park, at the junctions of Wood Green High Road and Lordship Lane, and Wood Green High Road and Westbury Avenue, respectively – opening on 19 September 1932. With the area now connected to west and central London by clean, rapid and frequent electric trains, the population of the surrounding areas began to rise rapidly.|$|E
5|$|The next {{landmark}} {{decision of}} the U.S. Supreme Court involving the Oregon Supreme Court was Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994). In that land use case the Oregon court found the requirements placed on the business owner as conditions to approve an expansion were not a taking under the United States Constitution’s takings clause. However, the U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and overturned the Oregon court. Then the Oregon court ruled in February 2006 that Oregon’s land use law, Measure 37, was constitutional. Macpherson v. Department of Administrative Services, 340 Or. 117, 130 P.3d 308 (2006) allowed people to make claims against the government forcing the government to either pay compensation when land use regulations reduced {{the value of a}} property owners land or <b>waive</b> the regulation.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{distinct}} protocols for awarding the Medal of Honor. The {{first and most}} common is nomination and approval through {{the chain of command}} of the service member. The second method is nomination {{by a member of the}} U.S. Congress, generally at the request of a constituent. In both cases, if the proposal is outside the time limits for the recommendation, approval to <b>waive</b> the time limit requires a special Act of Congress. The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of, and in the name of, the Congress. Since 1980, nearly all Medal of Honor recipients--or in the case of posthumous awards, the next of kin--have been personally decorated by the Commander-in-Chief. Since 1941, more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously.|$|E
5|$|While {{over the}} western Atlantic Ocean {{as a major}} hurricane, forecasters {{predicted}} Isabel would pass through the central portion of the state. Successive forecasts shifted the track slightly further to the west, though its track into Ohio was not anticipated. Hours before it entered the state, the National Hurricane Center continued to predict Isabel would traverse {{the entire length of}} the state from south to north and later entering New York before crossing Lake Ontario into Canada. Around 3% of those who evacuated in North Carolina and in the Eastern Shore of Virginia stayed in Pennsylvania during the storm. The threat of the hurricane canceled some flights in and out of the state. To compensate, Delta Air Lines allowed those flying to or from Philadelphia, Allentown, and Harrisburg to reschedule to a later date. American Airlines offered a similar option. United Airlines and United Express opted to <b>waive</b> charging fees for travelers in and out of the state.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to <b>waive</b> its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had found their way into Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E
