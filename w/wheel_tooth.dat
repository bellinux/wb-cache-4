50|$|Each type of {{conveyor}} chain {{is available in}} a range of different pitches. The minimum pitch is dictated by the need for adequate <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> strength and the maximum is determined by plate rigidity. The maximum pitch can be exceeded if the chain is strengthened with bushes between the link plates and there is still enough clearance with the wheel teeth.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{frictional}} escapement; {{the pendulum}} is always being pushed by an escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> throughout its cycle, and {{never allowed to}} swing freely. This makes the clock's rate sensitive {{to changes in the}} drive force. Any small changes in the force applied to the pallets, for example by a change in lubrication due to oil ageing, or the declining force of a clock's mainspring as it runs down, will change the period of the pendulum's swing. Anchor escapement clocks driven by a mainspring required a fusee to even out the force of the mainspring.|$|E
50|$|The anchor {{escapement}} {{consists of}} two parts: the escape wheel, which is a vertical wheel with pointed teeth on it rather like saw teeth, and the anchor, shaped vaguely like a ship's anchor, which swings {{back and forth on}} a pivot just above the escape wheel. On the two arms of the anchor are curved and flat faces which the teeth of the escape wheel push against, called pallets. The central shaft of the anchor is attached to a fork pushed by the pendulum, so the anchor swings back and forth, with the pallets alternately catching and releasing an escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> on each side.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the backward slant of the anchor escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth,</b> the deadbeat escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> are radial or slant forward {{to ensure that the}} tooth makes contact with the 'dead' face of the pallet, preventing recoil.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic cutter {{assemblies}} have {{a standard}} length of 2.8 m, with various widths, varying from 60 cm up to 250 cm. Cutting <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> depend {{mainly on the}} type of soil intended to be excavated.|$|R
50|$|In {{the anchor}} escapement, an {{increase}} of drive force causes the pendulum to swing back and forth more quickly, but does not increase the pendulum's amplitude, the length of its swing, much. The increased force of the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> on the pallet during the recoil part of the cycle tends to decrease the pendulum's swing, while {{the force of the}} tooth during the forward impulse part of the cycle tends to increase the pendulum's swing. These tend to cancel each other out, leaving the swing unchanged. But both these effects decrease the time of swing. In other words, increased force knocks the pendulum back and forth in a fixed arc faster.|$|E
5000|$|One recent {{trend in}} {{escapement}} design {{is the use}} of new materials, many borrowed from the semiconductor fabrication industry. [...] A problem with the lever escapement is friction. The escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> slides along the face of the pallet, causing friction, so the pallets and teeth must be lubricated. The oil eventually thickens, causing inaccuracy, and requiring cleaning and reoiling of the movement about every 4 years. A solution is to make the escape wheel and other parts out of harder materials than steel, eliminating the need for lubrication. Materials being tried include silicon, nickel phosphorus, diamond, and diamond-on-silicon. Ulysse Nardin in 2001 and Patek Philippe in 2005 introduced watches with silicon escape wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The detent is a {{detached}} escapement; {{it allows the}} balance wheel to swing undisturbed during most of its cycle, except the brief impulse period, which is only given once per cycle (every other swing). [...] Because the driving escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> moves almost parallel to the pallet, the escapement has little friction and did not need oiling. For these reasons among others the detent was considered the most accurate escapement for balance wheel timepieces. [...] John Arnold {{was the first to}} use the detent escapement with an overcoil balance spring (patented 1782) and with this improvement his watches were the first really accurate pocket timekeepers, keeping time to within 1 or 2 seconds per day. These were produced from 1783 onwards.|$|E
5000|$|The highly {{consolidated}} overburden stratum consists {{mainly of}} Cuddalore sandstone and is hard and abrasive in nature. This problem {{was overcome by}} carrying out suitable modifications in the bucket <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> and by instituting a systematic drilling and blasting programme.|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason the}} escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> are slanted {{backward}} is {{as a safety}} measure. If the clock is moved without immobilising the pendulum, the uncontrolled swinging of the pendulum can cause the anchor pallets to collide violently with the escape <b>wheel.</b> The slanted <b>teeth</b> ensure that the flat faces of the anchor pallets hit {{the sides of the}} teeth first, protecting the delicate points from being broken.|$|R
50|$|In {{cycloidal}} gears, the addenda of the <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> are convex epi-cycloidal and the dedenda of the pinion are concave hypocycloidal curves {{generated by}} the same generating circle. This ensures that the motion of one gear is transferred to the other at locally constant angular velocity.|$|R
5000|$|In the deadbeat, the pallets have {{a second}} curved [...] "locking" [...] face on them, {{concentric}} about the pivot on which the anchor turns. During the extremities of the pendulum's swing, the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> rests against this locking face, providing no impulse to the pendulum, which prevents recoil. Near {{the bottom of the}} pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the locking face onto the angled [...] "impulse" [...] face, giving the pendulum a push, before the pallet releases the tooth. This was the first escapement to separate the locking and impulse actions of the escapement. The deadbeat was first used in precision regulator clocks, but due to greater accuracy superseded the anchor in the 19th century. It is used in almost all modern pendulum clocks except for tower clocks which often use gravity escapements.|$|E
5000|$|The anchor {{consists}} of an escape wheel with pointed, backward slanted teeth, and an [...] "anchor"-shaped piece pivoted above it which rocks from side to side, linked to the pendulum. The anchor has slanted pallets on the arms which alternately catch on {{the teeth of the}} escape wheel, receiving impulses. Mechanically its operation has similarities to the verge escapement, and it has two of the verge's disadvantages: (1) The pendulum is constantly being pushed by an escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> throughout its cycle, and is never allowed to swing freely, which disturbs its isochronism, and (2) it is a recoil escapement; the anchor pushes the escape wheel backward during part of its cycle. This causes backlash, increased wear in the clock's gears, and inaccuracy. These problems were eliminated in the deadbeat escapement, which slowly replaced the anchor in precision clocks.|$|E
5000|$|Today, the Triumph Vitesse is much sought-after car by enthusiasts; parts {{supply is}} excellent, and the cars have a {{reputation}} for near [...] "bullet-proof" [...] mechanics. This is not completely warranted. The gearbox of the 2 litre suffered from wear of the output shaft [...] "nose" [...] that mates with the input shaft. It was under engineered from the first and frequently wore through the hardened surface necessitating a rebuild with metal spraying and resurfacing. Nowadays it is possible to buy 'Heavy-duty' mainshafts for the overdrive gearboxes with a bigger 18mm diameter tip and a much stronger needle roller bearing. This upgrade is based on the re-designed 4-speed gearbox for later TR7 and Dolomite 1850 models, which are basically the same gearbox. The differentials were never up to the power of even the 2 litre and would not stand regular 0-60 blasts without either crown <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> loss or shearing of half shafts. The idiosyncratic threaded front suspension setup is also an area where incorrect maintenance (grease instead of gear oil or no regular lubrication) leads to dramatic failures.|$|E
50|$|The pin pallet {{escapement}} {{was widely}} used as it had many {{of the advantages of}} the lever escapement but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional lever escapement have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth.</b> They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the {{pin pallet escapement}} these faces are designed into the shape of the escape <b>wheel</b> <b>teeth</b> instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the metal pins used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The metal pins also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out.|$|R

5000|$|The deadbeat {{escapement}} has {{two faces}} to the pallets, a 'locking' or 'dead' face, with a curved surface concentric with the axis {{on which the}} anchor rotates, and a sloping 'impulse' face. [...] When an escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> is resting {{against one of the}} dead faces, its force is directed through the anchor's pivot axis, so it gives no impulse to the pendulum, allowing it to swing freely. When the pallet on the other side releases the escape wheel, a tooth lands on this [...] "dead" [...] face first, and remains resting against it for most of the pendulum's outward swing and return. For this period the escape wheel is [...] "locked" [...] and unable to turn. Near the bottom of the pendulum's swing the tooth slides off the dead face onto the slanted 'impulse' face of the pallet, allowing the escape wheel to turn and give the pendulum a push, before dropping off the pallet. It is still a frictional rest escapement because the sliding of the escape tooth on the dead face adds friction to the pendulum's swing, but it has less friction than the recoil escapement because there is no recoil force.|$|E
50|$|The {{escapement}} serves two purposes. First, {{it allows}} the train to advance fractionally and record the balance's oscillations. At the same time, it supplies minute amounts of energy to counter tiny losses from friction, thus maintaining {{the momentum of the}} oscillating balance. The escapement is the part that ticks. Since the natural resonance of an oscillating balance serves as the heart of a chronometer, chronometer escapements are designed to interfere with the balance as little as possible. There are many constant-force and detached escapement designs, but the most common are the spring detent and pivoted detent. In both of these, a small detent locks the escape wheel and allows the balance to swing completely free of interference except for a brief moment at the centre of oscillation, when it is least susceptible to outside influences. At the centre of oscillation, a roller on the balance staff momentarily displaces the detent, allowing one tooth of the escape wheel to pass. The escape <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> then imparts its energy on a second roller on the balance staff. Since the escape wheel turns in only one direction, the balance receives impulse in only one direction. On the return oscillation, a passing spring on the tip of the detent allows the unlocking roller on the staff to move by without displacing the detent. The weakest link of any mechanical timekeeper is the escapement's lubrication. When the oil thickens through age or temperature or dissipates through humidity or evaporation, the rate will change, sometimes dramatically as the balance motion decreases through higher friction in the escapement. A detent escapement has a strong advantage over other escapements as it needs no lubrication. An impulse from the escape wheel to the impulse roller is nearly dead-beat, meaning little sliding action needing lubrication. Chronometer escape wheels and passing springs are typically gold due to the metal's lower slide friction over brass and steel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Worm {{gears used}} for power {{transmission}} commonly {{consist of a}} steel worm running against a bronze or phosphor bronze worm wheel. The wheel teeth are usually manufactured using an ‘oversize ’ hob so that the initial elastic contact between the teeth {{is in the form}} of an ellipse with lubricant entrainment predominantly in the major axis direction. As a result of this unfavourable contact geometry, the lubricant film generated between the worm and wheel teeth is relatively thin. The kinematic configuration is close to that of simple sliding as the velocity of the <b>wheel</b> <b>tooth</b> surface relative to the nominal contact point is very low in com-parison with that of the worm. The combination of poor film forming, high sliding and a soft gear material (to avoid scuffing) leads to the continuous wear seen in these gears. The article presents results obtained using amodel for the prediction of wear for this configur-ation based on the well-known Archard wear law extended to take the variation of pressure and film thickness over the contact area into account in determining the wear rate. The pressure and film thickness distributions are obtained from elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) modelling of the contact over the meshing cycle. Wear patterns are presented corresponding to different film thickness sensitivities in the wear formula, and these predictions, together with the calcu-lated increase in backlash due to wear, give a basis for calibrating the model against experimen-tal wear tests...|$|E
