A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E

5|$|The first horses on the American {{mainland}} {{since the}} end of the Ice Age arrived with the Spanish Conquistadors. Hernán Cortés brought 16 horses of Andalusian, Barb, and Arabian ancestry to Mexico in 1519. Others followed, such as Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, who brought 250 horses of similar breeding to America in 1540. More horses followed <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> arrival of Conquistadors, missionaries, and settlers. Many horses escaped or were stolen, becoming the foundation stock of the American Mustang.|$|E
5|$|The aim of {{the game}} remains the same from its predecessor: {{complete}} increasingly difficult challenges {{to move on to}} the next race. The difficulty level is changed by increasing the top speed of the craft, through four different classes (Vector, Venom, Rapier and Phantom). The number of laps needed to complete a race also increased <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> class. Victory in the challenge modes is the game's ultimate accomplishment. These modes are similar to a championship where players have to race every track to become champion; however, rather than tallying up points, Challenge mode takes a very single player-centric approach by only allowing progress to the next track by coming in first on the current track. Players can lose the mode by losing all three lives, which are lost by finishing a race in worse than third position. By winning all the races, the player is crowned champion and given access to faster modes, new tracks and ultimately the Piranha craft.|$|E
5|$|While it {{contains}} some small role-playing elements, Dawn of Mana diverges from the prior two-dimensional action role-playing game titles {{of the series}} to focus directly on action-adventure gameplay in a full 3D world. Incorporating the Havok physics engine, the gameplay focuses on the player grabbing and throwing objects and monsters in order to startle enemies before attacking them with a sword and magic. Keldric grows more powerful as the player journeys through an area, only to reset to his base abilities <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> zone unless difficult extra challenges are met. Unlike many of its predecessors, the game does not feature any cooperative multiplayer component.|$|E

25|$|Adoption {{practices}} have changed significantly {{over the course}} of the 20th century, <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> movement labeled, in some way, as reform. Beginning in the 1970s, efforts to improve adoption became associated with opening records and encouraging family preservation. These ideas arose from suggestions that the secrecy inherent in modern adoption may influence the process of forming an identity, create confusion regarding genealogy, and provide little in the way of medical history.|$|E

25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 19th century, the use of a {{standardized}} written language increased <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> innovation of communication and transportation. It was however not until the 1960s, when the major demographic situation of Sweden had changed from a quite rural and agrarian society to the highly urbanized society it is today, that the spoken varieties closed up towards unified dialects whose vocabulary and grammatical rules adhered to that of the (written) Standard Swedish. The different phonologies, particularly the different realizations of the tonal word accents, have however proved to be more variable.|$|E

25|$|From the 18th century until 1866, {{the island}} had various names, {{changing}} <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> owner. In that year, it {{was bought by}} Mr. John Hendrick, a local farmer.

As in many of his early portraits, Sargent confidently tries different approaches <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>new</b> challenge, here employing both unusual composition and lighting to striking effect. One of his most widely exhibited and best loved works of the 1880s was The Lady with the Rose (1882), a portrait of Charlotte Burckhardt, a close friend and possible romantic attachment.|$|E
