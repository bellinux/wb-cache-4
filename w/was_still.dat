5|$|Australia <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{some way}} behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson at the crease. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, who appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning. Saggers {{came in and}} only managed five in his first Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker, who <b>was</b> <b>still</b> bowling in an attacking manner and flighting his deliveries, undeterred by the sixes Loxton had hit from him, rather than bowling leg theory. This left Australia at 355/8 ten minutes before tea, with only Johnston and Toshack remaining.|$|E

50|$|The town <b>is</b> <b>still</b> closely {{governed by}} His Majesty Chief Albert Moroka. He <b>is</b> <b>still</b> {{responsible}} for most civil matters and he <b>is</b> <b>still</b> the judge at the tribal court, so the town <b>is</b> <b>still</b> has a very traditional feel despite having a proper court of law and falling under the Mangaung local municipality. It has a very dry and cold winter with periodically wet summers.|$|R
50|$|Mr. Berlitz's {{method of}} {{language}} learning <b>is</b> <b>still</b> used. Many books that were originally published {{during the early}} to mid 1900's <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in print.

5|$|Based on observations, Iridomyrmex {{workers can}} be {{deformed}} {{when they are}} born.

5|$|Despite these precautions, {{pollution}} {{from the power}} stations <b>was</b> <b>still</b> a factor. In 1954, consideration was given to scrapping the plan to build the Union Hall housing estate in Lemington because of probable {{pollution from}} nearby power stations. This was mainly {{because some of the}} houses were as high as, if not higher than, the power stations' chimneys. At times, this meant the estate being exposed to as much as 1.25 parts per million of sulphur dioxide. However the estate <b>was</b> <b>still</b> built, as these peak conditions were thought unlikely to occur on more than 18 days in a year.|$|E

5|$|Emerald <b>was</b> <b>still</b> {{serving on}} the Home Station on 11 April 1811 when she sent into Cork a French privateer.

5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century, the {{consensus}} remained that the road was most probably Roman. It <b>was</b> <b>still</b> referenced as an undoubted Roman road in a 1947 UK Government report and in 1957 Margary, the leading authority on Roman roads at the time, accepted the road as Roman and assigned it the catalogue number 81b in his list of Roman roads in Britain. In the late 1950s and early 1960s this was a definitive and unquestioned interpretation of the monument. Several works in the 1980s and 1990s stated that Roman-era road construction <b>was</b> <b>still</b> the most probable explanation of the structure.|$|E
