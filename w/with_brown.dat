Inside are chamfered oak beams, chimney corner (inglenook) and oak supporting beams (bressumer). The coach house is also oak framed <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> brick and roof tiles.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{also played}} swing and R, Powell {{was known as}} a bebop player. This {{included}} using right-hand single-note lines. In his playing <b>with</b> <b>Brown</b> and Roach, he was fond of inserting musical quotes, including from nursery rhymes and opera.|$|E

5|$|His {{partnership}} <b>with</b> <b>Brown</b> {{was regarded}} as one of the great opening pairings in the history of Australian Test cricket. In ten Tests together as an opening partnership, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian pair with more than 1,000 runs.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has four}} main colors: black and tan, blue and tan, brown and tan, solid red of various shades. Red {{includes}} sable (red where {{the tips of the}} hairs are black, known as overlay) and red sable (red <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> overlay).|$|E
5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> backs and white underparts. They have thin pointed down-curved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves on vertical trees. One species has been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|After his {{military}} service, Parseghian enrolled at Miami University in Ohio and played halfback on the school's football team in 1946 and 1947 under coach Sid Gillman. As <b>with</b> <b>Brown,</b> Parseghian paid {{close attention to}} Gillman, a post-war football pioneer who helped popularize deep downfield passes as the T formation came into vogue. He was named an All-Ohio halfback and a Little All-American by sportswriters in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> or grey, {{which are}} incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Brown bears {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> bears, because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While encounters <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> and black bears appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|E

5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with small pieces of {{limestone}} mixed <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Greater yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather {{lay their eggs}} directly on cliffs, the floors of caves, the ground, or in the hollows of stumps. Eggs are cream-colored and blotched <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> spots, particularly around the larger end. Clutch size ranges from one to three, though two is the norm. The chicks are altricial—blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching, and grow down feathers later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after two to three months.|$|E
5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent wattles, brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> rings, wattles larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Vaccinium species. Full-grown larvae reach {{a length}} of 26 mm. They are <b>brown</b> <b>with</b> light <b>brown</b> and blackish lines and <b>with</b> a <b>brown</b> head <b>with</b> white stripes.|$|R

5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum, in which the findings are described in more detail. Howard-Davis was {{largely responsible for the}} post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, <b>with</b> <b>Brown,</b> for their analysis.|$|E
5|$|In February 2005, Brown {{announced}} his candidacy for Mayor of Buffalo. On April 29, 2005 three-term Democratic Mayor Anthony Masiello {{announced he would}} not seek a fourth four-year term. Masiello had run on both major party lines for his final two terms and had twice endorsed Republican Governor George Pataki. During his tenure, the city population and industrial tax base had decreased. Six candidates, including Brown, entered the race to replace him, <b>with</b> <b>Brown</b> accumulating many endorsements and the backing of organized labor.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say <b>with</b> <b>brown</b> dominant to blue eye color. However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E

5|$|Monty Brown was {{pitted against}} Lance Hoyt {{in the next}} encounter. Hoyt gained a two-count early on by landing on Brown with a moonsault aerial {{maneuver}} from the top rope. This followed <b>with</b> <b>Brown</b> slamming Hoyt against the mat with his signature Alpha Bomb maneuver for a near-fall. Brown won the contest at 6 minutes and 29 seconds after tackling Hoyt with his signature Pounce maneuver.|$|E

5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to complete an}} English season without defeat. Australia batted first against Kent and Bradman made 65, putting on 104 <b>with</b> <b>Brown</b> as Australia made 361 and won by an innings. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Bradman came to the crease at 1/40 and featured in a 180-run second wicket partnership <b>with</b> <b>Brown,</b> before adding another 110 with Hassett. He was out for 150 at 3/331 before declaring at 5/610 against a team that included eight Test players. Australia {{went on to win}} by an innings. He then rested himself as Australia defeated Somerset by an innings and 374 runs. Bradman returned to make 143 against the South of England, adding 188 for the third wicket with Hassett. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 before rain ended the match.|$|E
