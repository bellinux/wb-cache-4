However, wind farm siting often conflicts with aspirations to conserve traditional landscapes and wildlife habitats.

We give particular attention to how tensions between potentially conflicting sustainability objectives are addressed and by whom. Based on a review of this siting discourse and the application of Marcuse’s theory, we find that the Catalan <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>siting</b> discourse is both influenced by and reproducing what Marcuse referred to as the ‘one-dimensional thinking’ of technology as ideology: erasing the possibility of critical dialectical thought by subsuming the question of “what should be” under the question of “what is”. This has implications both for how these conflicts are investigated and for the sustainability of decisions taken.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mathematical approach to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and {{wind energy production}} estimation. The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a power curve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development. Many current methods for assessing uncertainty either oversimplify the process or make faulty assumptions, leading to erroneous estimates of uncertainty. The approach in this paper yields a more accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty, and therefore better decision making when assessing a potential <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site.</b> Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, uncertainty in wind turbine power output and energy production is characterized.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Multiple linear {{regression}} {{was used to}} develop equations for 12 -, 24 -, and 36 -hour surface wind forecasts for the <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site</b> at Goodnoe Hills. Equations were derived separately for warm and cool seasons. The potential predictors included LFM II model output, MOS surface wind forecasts extrapolated from surrounding stations, pressure observations corrected to mean sea level, and two types of climatological variables. Forecasts of wind speed and direction were formulated for an independent sample of predictands and predictors. The forecasts were evaluated using standard methods of forecast verification {{and the results are}} summarized in terms of several verification scores. Comparisons of scores were made by season, projection time, and cycle (or preparation) time, and some patterns were evident in the scores with respect to these stratifications. The minimum value of the mean absolute error attained by the forecast system presented here was 5. 64 mph for a 12 -hour, cool season forecast equation. The minimum value of the root mean square error was 7. 57 mph for a 12 -hour, warm season forecast equation. Comparison of these results with the results of other statistical wind forecasting studies indicates that the forecast equations for Goodnoe Hills are of comparable accuracy to the equations developed for other wind energy sites.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a mathematical framework to properly account for uncertainty in wind resource assessment and {{wind energy production}} estimation. A meteorological tower based wind measurement campaign is considered exclusively, in which measurecorrelate- predict is used to estimate the long-term wind resource. The evaluation of a wind resource and the subsequent estimation of the annual energy production (AEP) is a highly uncertain process. Uncertainty arises at all points in the process, from measuring the wind speed to the uncertainty in a power curve. A proper assessment of uncertainty is critical for judging the feasibility and risk of a potential wind energy development. The approach in this paper provides a framework for an accurate and objective accounting of uncertainty and, therefore, better decision making when assessing a potential <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site.</b> It does not investigate the values of individual uncertainty sources. Three major aspects of site assessment uncertainty are presented here. First, a method is presented for combining uncertainty that arises in assessing the wind resource. Second, methods for handling uncertainty sources in wind turbine power output and energy losses are presented. Third, a new method for estimating the overall AEP uncertainty when using a Weibull distribution is presented. While it is commonly assumed that the uncertainty in the wind resource should be scaled by a factor between 2 and 3 to yield the uncertainty in the AEP, this work demonstrates that this assumption is an oversimplification and also {{presents a}} closed form solution for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Concerns over {{climate change}} and energy {{security}} have spurred governments worldwide to encourage the development of renewable energy. Although public attitudes and macro-politics, in general, show moderate to strong support for renewables- in particular, wind power- {{largely because of the}} economic and environmental benefits associated with it. However, local politics and public mobilization in regard to <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> facility <b>siting</b> at a community level is not always favorable. So, understanding the site-specific factors that motivate people to mobilize against <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> facility <b>siting</b> is crucial for future planning and decision making of a successful <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> scheme. In particular, the state of Oregon is aggressively expanding the RPS to increase the share of renewables in their energy mix. That makes it even more important to understand the factors and processes of mobilization against wind facility siting because such mobilization and controversy might act as a barrier to reach the target set by State of Oregon. In this regard, I conducted a qualitative study on <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> facility <b>siting</b> issues in two central Oregon counties: Harney and Crook, using framework on place attachment.

40|$|Wind {{energy has}} been the fastest growing and most {{promising}} renewable energy source in terms of profitability in recent years. The annual installed capacity in the European Union (EU) has risen from 814 Â MW in 1996 to 10, 163 Â MW in 2009. However, one major drawback of wind energy is the variability in production due to the stochastic nature of wind. Integrating the risk of wind energy uncertainty into profitability assessments is important for investors in wind energy. The article presents statistical simulation methods to incorporate risks from stochastic wind speeds into profitability calculations. We apply the Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) Method within the Variance Ratio Method to generate long-term wind velocity estimates for a potential <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site</b> in Austria. The bootstrapping method is applied to generate wind velocities for the economic life-time of a wind turbine. The Internal Rate of Return is used as profitability indicator. We use the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approach to derive probability levels for certain internal rate of returns, as the CVaR is a reliable risk measure even if return distributions are not normal. Our approach closes {{the gap in the}} scientific literature on statistical simulation methods for the economic evaluation of wind energy sites. In contrast to other scientific publications, our methodology can be generally applied, because we do not rely on estimated distributions for wind speed predictions, but on measured wind speed distributions, which are usually readily available. In addition, the CVaR has not been applied as a measure of risk for wind site evaluation before and it does not rely on any specific function regarding the profitability distribution. The approach has been developed in collaboration with a leading Austrian utility company and has been applied to a wind park in Austria.

40|$|In North America, the {{migration}} corridors of passerine birds between breeding and non-breeding grounds are relatively well documented, and along these corridors passerines generally {{move in a}} broad-front fashion interspersed with stopover periods in which to rest and replenish fuel stores. Understanding movement patterns at individual locations along these routes is required to identify whether anthropogenic developments, such as wind energy installations, can lead to disruption or collision risk during migrations. Wind energy installations are becoming more numerous in the corridors along migration routes as they use the same wind resources exploited by migratory birds. Documenting collision risk to nocturnal migrants, particularly passerines, through the collection of accurate data on the movement patterns and flight altitudes at wind energy sites during both pre-operational and operational phases is needed to correctly assess the level of risk to these birds. Using standard marine radar units equipped with an inexpensive digital interface system, I automated the detection and extraction of radar echo signatures or target information for nocturnal migrants (Chapter 2) at a <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site</b> in northeast British Columbia. Using the open source software program radR, I identified optimal values for input criteria to automatically detect and track these migrants with high accuracy from the digital radar data, when compared to known, manually-tracked targets (R²= 0. 94). The program was also effective in {{reducing the amount of}} insects that were detected and tracked. Use of the auto-tracking software also increased the number of detected targets by over 500 % compared to the real-time collection of radar data. Using radR, I analyzed the micro-scale movements of nocturnal migrants during the pre-operational and operational periods of the wind energy project (Chapter 3).

40|$|This {{research}} develops superior {{approaches to}} the traditional site assessment process, as well as novel strategies that offer a distinct advantage over the traditional process. Two major contributions are presented: new analysis approaches for site assessment, and new technical approaches to wind resource monitoring. ^ Two new analysis approaches for <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site</b> assessment are developed. The first is a method for site assessment uncertainty analysis. Analytical expressions for the sensitivity factors of the Weibull parameters are developed, which yield exact values for any combination of wind resource, power curve, and energy losses. This enables better determination of the uncertainty in the annual energy production estimate. The second approach is a decision making strategy {{to determine whether or}} not to stop measuring the wind resource at any point in the process. In contrast, in the standard approach, the wind resource is almost always measured for a full year, which can be inefficient in many cases. The results show that this approach is just as accurate as measuring for a year, but saves significant time and money. ^ Two new technical approaches for measuring the wind resource are developed. The first measures multiple sites in a year using one ground-based device, which is brought back and forth between sites, resulting in two discontinuous measured data sets, each distributed over the year. The accuracy and uncertainty of the predictions of the wind resource are equivalent to those using a full year of measured data. The second new technical approach can improve shear extrapolation. It relies on short-term data from a ground-based device at a site where a met tower is installed for a year. The short-term data are used to correct the year-long shear parameter. The results show substantial improvements in the accuracy and uncertainty of shear predictions. ^ These new analysis approaches and technical monitoring strategies are unified into a comprehensive 2 ̆ 2 Streamlined Site Assessment Methodology. 2 ̆ 2 It provides a flexible, unified approach for executing the site assessment process in which the specific priorities and constraints of the project dictate the resulting approach. This methodology can drastically alter and improve site assessment. ...|$|E

Both copper and iron losses for three different machine designs are evaluated. A very important consideration taken in this design is the elimination of gearbox requirements for coupling to the turbine. Although the devel-oped approach makes the machine somewhat voluminous, the overall performance is highly improved because a direct-drive flux-switching electrical generator becomes very competitive for small-scale wind turbines.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of the energy system pushes the expansion of wind power in Germany towards the installation of new wind farms in complex and forest covered terrain. The primary objective of this thesis is to derive forest structure parameters in high resolution as input for flow simulations used in <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>site</b> assessment. For this purpose, airborne LiDAR data is processed, and a digital terrain model (DTM), as well as forest heights and forest densities, are determined. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a new technique for land surface applications. A fast development could be observed in recent years, and it is about to supersede the traditional ground-based measurement techniques. This bears new challenges for the forest parametrisation, especially the estimation of the vegetation density. In literature, different approaches to determine the plant area index (PAI), which {{is a measure of}} the canopy density, can be found. Three methods are analysed within this work: One method is based on the number of first echoes that can be recorded from the different canopy levels. The other two methods make use of the intensities of the echoes to estimate the transmittance of the canopy. The plant area density is assessed based on the Beer-Lambert law for light attenuation. Hence an exponentially falling correlation between the PAI and the number of ground echoes can be observed. Furthermore, it can be seen that the PAI results from the three methods differ significantly for locations predominantly covered with beech trees. For coniferous forest areas, the PAI results are more similar. A differentiated approach depending on the forest type is necessary. Hence, the variation of the PAI between the methods is implemented as an indicator for the identification of beech forests. The comparison of the three methods to each other, to photographs, and measurement data shows that the first return method used in most papers misses important information given with the intermediate echoes. In forests with homogeneous, dense canopies, first echoes can only be recorded from the crown. The two other methods which include all returns and their intensities achieve to describe the full density profile over the whole forest height. However, the PAI levels are significantly lower, especially in beech tree areas. This could cause an underestimation of the drag relevant for wind flow simulations. Deciduous forests have a higher density during summer. Since ALS flights are usually performed during leaf-off season, a method to derive the leaf-on PAI is developed. For the forest during winter, the method based on first returns is selected, because of the higher PAI level. Above that, previous studies showed that assuming a drag coefficient of 0. 2, this approach gives reliable results. For the forest during summer, the PAI of the areas defined to be beech forest are raised by a leaf factor of 1. 8 in order to account for the PAI increase during frondescence...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Wind {{environment}} {{is the most}} important factor for <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>siting.</b> The power production is much dependent on the wind environment of each site. To estimate the power production in a particular location, it is desirable that wind data has been measured at the site for long term enough to be already averaged over years. However, in many cases, shorter data is only available and modification is necessary to exclude some bias in that period. Especially in Asia, where seasonal change of wind climate is generally significant, this prediction technique is more important to get more accuracy. In this research, prediction technique is discussed. Wind data from several meteorological stations was analysed. Several estimation techniques were compared with different length of available data. The error in the estimated results was investigated. Prediction of long-term wind climate may contain large error in the calculation process. To get better results, the calculation method should be carefully selected. Further investigation is necessary to improve the way of estimation...|$|R

The findings show that the localized framing of threat, limited political opportunity, and limited resources contributed to opposition being largely project-specific, while the countywide framing of benefits, significant political opportunity, and well-mobilized resources allowed support to carry across projects. This study helps provide context for not only the nature of opposition to <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> projects, but of support as well. In addition, this research can help understand how to best move forward with energy policy in Washington and ensure greater democratic participation in the <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>siting</b> process...|$|R
30|$|The {{most common}} sources of {{renewable}} energy are solar and <b>wind</b> <b>energy.</b> The <b>siting</b> of <b>wind</b> turbines must ensure maximum exposure to wind {{in order to achieve}} <b>wind</b> <b>energy,</b> but not every province in Turkey can provide such conditions. Also, wind turbines must be built far from residential areas, {{due to the fact that}} the sound of wind turbines greatly inconveniences people. In addition to this, the rural setting of wind turbines is generally on the migration route of birds. Research shows that birds often change their migration routes or that birds die by hitting operational turbines due to the siting of such turbines (Akkaya et al. 2002). Accordingly, it is observed that solar farms, as a source {{of renewable energy}}, are more widespread than wind turbines.|$|R
40|$|This article {{shows how}} a non-decimated wavelet packet {{transform}} (NWPT) {{can be used}} to model a response time series Y t in terms of an explanatory time series X t. We apply our technique to an important problem from the <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> industry: how to model wind speed at a target location using wind speed and direction from a reference location. Our technique transforms the explanatory series, X t, into a NWPT representation and then uses standard statistical modelling methods to identify which wavelet packets are useful for modelling Y t. Our methods often generate better target site wind speed predictions compared to those produced by industry standard techniques. However, of more importance, our wavelet packet techniques produce models to which we can attach physical and scientific interpretations to understand more about the transfer of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> from <b>site</b> to site...|$|R
40|$|The coastal Isthmus of Tehuantepec {{region of}} Oaxaca, Mexico – {{known locally as}} the Istmo – is {{regarded}} as one of the best <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> generating <b>sites</b> in the world. Marketed as a preeminent solution to mitigating climate change, <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> is now applying increasing pressure on indigenous groups in the region. The article begins by outlining a definition of colonialism that assists in identifying the temporal continuity of the colonial project to understand its relationship with <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> development. The next section briefly reviews colonial genocide studies, discussing disciplinary debates between liberal and post-liberal genocide scholars, the relevance of self-management within colonial systems, the genocide-ecocide nexus and the ‘intent’ of destructive development projects. This leads into reviewing the claims and findings that emerged from fieldwork in the Istmo, which is divided into the north and south to show the different, yet similar dynamics taking place in the region. Finally, the article concludes that <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> development as a ‘solution’ to climate change not only distracts from its dependence on fossil fuels and mining, but renews and continues a slow industrial genocide, assimilating and targeting (indigenous) people who continue to value their land, sea and cultural relationships...|$|R
