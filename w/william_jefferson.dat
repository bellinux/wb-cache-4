5|$|Clinton {{was born}} <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. He {{was the son}} of <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> Blythe Jr. (1918–1946), a {{traveling}} salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley: 1923–1994). His parents married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife. Soon after Bill was born, Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing. She left her son in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races. In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks. The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.|$|E

25|$|Just {{two years}} after the American Civil War, the Augusta Institute was founded by Rev. <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> White, an Atlanta Baptist {{minister}} and cabinetmaker (<b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> White's half brother James E.

Edmund Turney, organizer of the National Theological Institute for educating freedmen in Washington, D.C. The institution was founded to educate African American men in theology and education and was located in Springfield Baptist Church,(Augusta, Georgia), the oldest independent black church in the United States. The institution moved from Augusta, Georgia, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1879. The school received sponsorship from the American Baptist Home Mission Society, an organization that helped establish several historically black colleges. The Institute's first president was Rev. Joseph T. Robert (1871-1884) (father of Brigadier General Henry Martyn Robert, author of Robert's Rules of Order). An anti-slavery Baptist minister from South Carolina and 1828 graduate of Brown University, Robert raised funds, taught the classes, and stabilized the institution.|$|E

25|$|In a low-scoring {{match at}} New Road in Worcester, Essex Eagles prevailed {{to take a}} four-point lead into the month-long break in the National League, {{defending}} 203 for 9 with relative ease. Having won the toss, skipper Ronnie Irani was the first victim of the Worcestershire Royals bowling with a three-ball duck. Chaminda Vaas and Ray Price got two wickets each as Essex' batting faltered, but 34 from Ryan ten Doeschate saved the visitors. Worcestershire started positively, Graeme Hick and Stephen Moore pairing up for 66 for the first wicket, but part-timer <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> removed both of them in quick succession to start the Worcestershire rot. With only Stephen Peters surviving hostile bowling, scoring 41 not out, Worcestershire eventually finished on 164 all out.|$|E
25|$|With every Essex batsman except number 11 Steyn (run out for 0) scoring {{in double}} figures, Essex showed a real team effort, with in-form opener <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> top-scoring with 93 as Essex {{got into a}} {{relatively}} comfortable lead of 142. Leicestershire fought back well on the third day, though, having lost Maddy before stumps {{on the second day}} to be 57 for 1. Robinson, Dinesh Mongia, Aftab Habib and HD Ackerman all passed 30, and Claude Henderson chipped in with a fine 55 from number 9, as Leicestershire made their way to a lead of 190. Only Gough showed consistent threat, taking four wickets for 60, while Steyn again became too inconsistent - he conceded 102 runs in his 21-over effort, although he did get the wickets of Robinson and Ottis Gibson.|$|E

First, {{that he was trying}} to attract her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, to serve on the board of Stan Lee Media after leaving office. Second, that he hoped to negotiate a pardon for his previous criminal convictions. Paul produced and underwrote what he described as the largest fund raising event ever held for a federal candidate, in Los Angeles, days before the 2000 Democratic Convention began. The Hollywood Farewell Gala Salute to President <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> Clinton featured prominent entertainers singing for the President, while raising over $1 million for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. The event cost $1.9 million to organize according to Paul and $500,000 according to the Federal Election Commission filing, much of it borrowed fraudulently by Paul from Merrill Lynch. Later indictments would state that Merrill Lynch lost about $5 million it had lent to Paul.|$|E
25|$|In these teams' last match {{before the}} Twenty20 season started, played at New Road in Worcester, Essex Eagles prevailed {{to take a}} four-point lead into the month-long break as their bowlers took out Worcestershire for 164 to defend a total of 203 for 9. Having won the toss, skipper Ronnie Irani was the first victim of the Worcestershire Royals bowling, as he {{departed}} for a three-ball duck in the third over. Chaminda Vaas and Ray Price got two wickets each as Essex' batting made it to 167 for 8, but Ryan ten Doeschate took them past 200 with a 38-ball 34. Worcestershire started with a 66-run opening stand between Graeme Hick and Stephen Moore, but part-timer <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> removed both of them in quick succession. Jefferson ended with the bowling analysis of 4–0–9–2, in his only bowling effort of the season, as Worcestershire put on 98 for the last nine wickets – 40 short of the required runs to win. Stephen Peters made 41 not out from number six, but after Moore and Hick {{he was the only}} batsman to pass 20, as James Middlebrook grabbed three wickets and Andre Adams and Ravinder Bopara two each.|$|E
25|$|Economical bowling from André Nel and Danish Kaneria gave Essex Eagles {{the victory}} over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, {{and the four}} points for the win {{increased}} their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title. Essex opener <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> kept his calm {{while the rest of}} the top order deserted him, making 88, but when three wickets fell for only three runs and the score was 172 for 7 Hampshire would have fancied their chances of bowling Essex out. Only two more wickets fell, though, as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria kept his calm, only allowing 26 runs off his nine overs, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – they could put some of the blame on their overseas players, as Australians Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributed only four runs off 18 deliveries.|$|E

25|$|André Nel and Danish Kaneria conceded runs at {{less than}} four runs an over to help Essex Eagles to victory over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, and the four points for the win {{increased}} their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title for Essex. After an opening stand of 70 between <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> and Ronnie Irani, Hampshire got four wickets for 31 as three Essex batsmen were dismissed in single figures before James Middlebrook put on 68 with Jefferson. However, three wickets fell for three runs and the score was 172 for 7, with Jefferson caught for 88, but Hampshire could only take two more wickets in the last half-hour as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 {{at the end of}} their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria dismissed Pothas and went on to concede 26 in nine overs – well short of the required run rate at five an over, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – with their overseas players Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributing four runs off 18 deliveries, for a run rate of 1.33 an over.|$|E
25|$|Somerset {{exploited}} Essex' declarations {{to take a}} five-wicket win despite rain dominating at Colchester, Somerset's fourth win of the season. After {{the first}} day was over, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but good contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up - <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> top-scoring with 93 - gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They powered on to 400 before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster made 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel whipped out two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth made 76 not out before the close of day three to set Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out. André Nel removed Michael Wood for a duck again, but Arul Suppiah added a quick 29, and former England Under-19 player Hildreth settled in well. He made his second unbeaten score of the match, this time worth 125, guiding Somerset past the winning target in 66.1 overs with five wickets to spare. Danish Kaneria bowled 24 of Essex' 66 overs, but to little effect, ending with one wicket for 80 runs, while Nel got William Durston for a duck to end with four wickets for the match - all ducks.|$|E
25|$|After run {{rates of}} just above 2.5 {{on the first}} two days, the third day gave the spectators nearly 400 runs while {{eighteen}} wickets fell. Graeme Welch took two wickets in consecutive deliveries in the early stages, as Essex were 128 for 6, but Ronnie Irani made a four-hour 99 and also had support from James Middlebrook (42) and Darren Gough – the latter registering 51 off just 38 deliveries. Welch finished with figures of five for 68, his second five-for of the season, as Essex finished on 306. Then, Essex' bowlers got wickets at a much more rapid rate than in the first innings, where Derbyshire had made 206 for the first four. In the second, they managed 34, as Ravinder Bopara got two wickets and Danihs and Graham Napier dug out one each. Another three-hour effort from Luke Sutton and a 91-ball 74 from Jonathan Moss saw Derbyshire to stumps with a lead of 314 with eight down – Sutton still not out with 38. A further 22 runs were added on the second day, while Danish dismissed Jake Needham to complete his second five-for of the match – Sutton was left stranded on 46 not out, setting Essex 337 to win. As Alastair Cook (14), Grant Flower (11-ball duck) and Bopara (10) were dismissed in succession, Essex lost their first three wickets for 82, but <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> made 83 to set them back on track, and a 177-run partnership between Andy Flower and Ronnie Irani left Essex with 33 to hit with five wickets to spare. Ronnie Irani and James Foster made it with five wickets to spare, and Derbyshire's run of matches without a win continued.|$|E

After the first day was over with only three overs bowled and Alastair Cook dismissed for a duck, Somerset's overseas player Charl Langeveldt dug out Grant Flower on the second morning, but double-digit contributions {{from the rest of}} the batting line-up – <b>William</b> <b>Jefferson</b> top-scoring with 93 – gave Essex a relatively comfortable 220 for 5 by stumps on day two. They made their way to 400 and the five batting points before declaring, losing only one wicket while James Foster added 87 to his overnight score to end with 107 not out. When Somerset were asked to bat, André Nel whipped out two Somerset wickets with the first three balls of the game, but no Essex bowler could get any more wickets as James Hildreth scored twelve boundaries for an unbeaten 76 at the close of day three to see Somerset to 112 for 2. Overnight, the two captains agreed to a mutual forfeiture of innings, so that Essex would not have to bat again. Hence, Somerset would have to chase 289 in a day to win, while Essex would have to bowl them out.
