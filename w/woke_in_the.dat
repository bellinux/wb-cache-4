500|$|The cast {{did many}} rehearsals, {{including}} on-location rehearsals, which Dennings described as [...] "the most practical thing I've ever heard of". During {{the course of}} filming, the actors slept during the day, <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, had their make-up applied on set, and filmed from dusk until dawn. The cast and crew members would often sit inside The Jerk-Offs' van between takes to avoid the cold, and sometimes stayed inside, out of sight, while scenes were being filmed in the van. Reshoots of the film began in May 2008; the film had originally begun at The Jerk-Offs' show where Nick and Norah first meet, and all prior scenes were written in later. Editor Myron Kerstein cut some of the shots on set due to time and budgetary restraints.|$|E
2500|$|Just after Christmas 1993, Wynette <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of}} the night with severe pain and was rushed to The Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee.

She resumed touring not long afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|Her last play, 4.48 Psychosis, was {{completed}} shortly {{before she died}} and was performed in 2000, at the Royal Court, directed by James Macdonald. This, Kane's shortest and most fragmented theatrical work, dispenses with plot and character, and no indication is given as to how many actors were intended to voice the play. Written {{at a time when}} Kane was suffering from severe depression, it has been described by her fellow-playwright and friend David Greig as having as its subject the [...] "psychotic mind". According to Greig, the title derives from the time—4:48a.m.—when Kane, in her depressed state, frequently <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning.|$|E

2500|$|On 25 October {{the court}} heard {{testimony}} from two further {{men who had}} survived attempts by Nilsen to strangle them. The first of these individuals, Paul Nobbs, provided testimony which the prosecution asserted was evidence of Nilsen's self-control and ability to refrain from homicidal impulses. A university student, Nobbs testified that he accompanied Nilsen to Cranley Gardens for alcohol and sex and <b>woke</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{early hours of the}} morning with [...] "a terrible headache". Upon washing his face in Nilsen's bathroom, as Nobbs noted his eyes were bloodshot and his face completely red, Nilsen had exclaimed, [...] "God! You look bloody awful"! Nilsen then advised the youth to see a doctor. Nobbs had not reported the attack to police for fear of his sexuality being discovered. Contrary to the prosecution claims, the defence counsel asserted that Nobbs' testimony reflected Nilsen's rational self was unable to control his impulses. Moreover, the fact Nilsen had selected a university student as a potential victim was at odds with the prosecution's claim that Nilsen intentionally selected rootless individuals whose disappearance was unlikely to be noted.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{aerospace}} technology to study aircraft wakes is reviewed. It is shown how aerospace vehicles {{can be used}} to provide data for increased understanding of the atmosphere and of aircraft exhaust trails where knowledge is inadequate to evaluate fully the potential impact of the engine emissions. Models of aircraft near-field exhaust wakes are characterized by jet, vortex, and dispersion regimes. <b>Wake</b> growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> jet regime is self-determined and rapid, whereas further spreading is inhibited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vortex regime because of circulating vortex motion. <b>Wake</b> diffusion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dispersion regime is initially influenced by aircraft induced turbulence but is dominated later by small-scale atmospheric turbulence. Computed fluid mechanical results show the importance of effects such as wake buoyancy, wind shear, turbulence, and traffic corridor exhaust buildup on dispersion of <b>the</b> <b>wake.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> jet regime the exhaust characteristics and thermochemistry serve to illustrate initial chemical changes involving potential pollutant species...|$|R
