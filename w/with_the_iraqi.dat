50|$|Fighting was fierce, {{especially}} around midday, but ended around 14:00 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> {{taking control of}} the palace.

Among the casualties was the Emir's younger brother, His Excellency Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who stood his ground heavily outnumbered and was killed battling in defense of Dasman Palace.|$|R
25|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle has been a subject of much public debate with British {{military}} commanders calling it a 'complete disaster'.

Although Mahdi Army fighters withdrew from the streets, clashes between Iraqi Security Forces and militia continued.|$|E
25|$|Kataib Hezbollah helicoptered in 50 of {{its best}} fighters, {{according}} to Abu Abdullah, a local Kataib Hezbollah commander.

25|$|Shalikashvili {{achieved}} real distinction {{with his}} considerable success as {{the commander of}} Operation Provide Comfort, the peacekeeping and humanitarian activity in northern Iraq after the Gulf War.

25|$|The need to {{work closely}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{government}} was not something many of shield volunteers felt comfortable with. Some felt that the list delivered by the officials compromised their autonomy. Others felt that they would rather be deployed in schools, hospitals, and orphanages. These shield volunteers left Iraq. The rest took up residence at the sites, a list of which {{was sent to the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff together with a request that they recognize the activists' assertion that targeting these sites would be in violation of Article 54 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Convention. There was no response to the letters.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{the party}} began {{cooperating}} with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The party organized the first general conference of Iraqi opposition groups in Damascus in 1989. It also participated in a conference of Iraqi opposition groups in Beirut in 1991. In 1999, Radhi was staying in the United Kingdom. The party {{was one of three}} main groups (along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Communist Party and the Islamic Dawa Party) which formed the Coalition of Iraqi National Forces. The Coalition was opposed to Saddam Hussein as well as U.S. military intervention. During the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the party publicly denounced U.S. involvement in the organization of Iraqi dissidents in exile.|$|E
25|$|On December 18, 2008 the Iraqi {{government}} {{published a}} law that covered the status of non-U.S. foreign forces in the country {{from the end of}} the U.N.'s mandate on December 31, 2008 through to their withdrawal on July 31, 2009. The Iraqi parliament voted on Saturday December 20, 2008, after a second reading of this law, to reject it and send it back to the Iraqi cabinet. The majority of Iraqi parliamentarians wanted it to be made into a binding international agreement rather than simply presenting it as a local Iraqi law. A compromise was reached and the law passed on December 23, 2008, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government agreeing to then sign bilateral agreements with the affected countries.|$|E

25|$|The branch {{supports}} full Arabisation of the country, a view considered racist by critics. Ould Haidalla {{introduced an}} anti-ba'athist policy which continued under his successor, Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. However, the Mauritanian government supported Iraq during the Gulf War; Iraq–Mauritania relations became {{so close that}} (inaccurate) rumours circulated internationally that Saddam's family had taken refuge in the country following the American invasion. Repression against the ba'athists has not been reduced; in 2003, several ba'athists were jailed on suspicion of trying to overthrow the government. A reason for the close relationship between Iraq and Mauritania was {{the strength of the}} Mauritanian ba'athist party. The party was banned in 1999, following the restoration of bilateral relations with Israel. The National Vanguard Party was accused of developing plans in collaboration <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government to foment unrest in the country.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1950s, as the {{strength}} of nationalism in Iraq grew, the focus came to bear on foreign control over the oil production of the country. Abd al-Karim Qasim was a nationalist Iraqi Army general who seized power in a 1958 coup d'état in which the Iraqi monarchy was eliminated. He ruled the country as Prime Minister of Iraq until his downfall and death in 1963. Before the coup, he used {{the fact that the}} IPC was producing oil for western nations rather than for the benefit of Iraq citizens as one of his main points of contention <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government. Once in power, he was critical of several aspects of the IPC. First, he was critical of the monetary arrangement between the IPC and the government. He also did not appreciate the monopoly that the IPC had been granted.|$|E
25|$|On 16 November 2012, a {{military}} clash between the Iraqi {{forces and the}} Peshmerga resulted in one person killed. CNN reported that 2 people were killed (one of them an Iraqi soldier) and 10 wounded in clashes at the Tuz Khurmato town. On the night of November 19, clashes between security forces of the central Iraqi government and the KRG forces in Tigrit left 12 Iraqi soldiers and one civilian dead, according to Doğan news agency. The clash erupted when Iraqi soldiers attempted to enter northern Iraq; peshmargas tried to prevent the Iraqi soldiers from entering the area upon Barzani’s instructions. On November 25, {{it was reported that}} Iraqi Kurdistan sent reinforcements to a disputed area where its troops are involved in a standoff <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> army, despite calls on both sides for dialogue to calm the situation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the years}} after 1998 when UNSCOM was kicked out by the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein and during the Iraq disarmament crisis, in which the United States blamed UNSCOM and former IAEA director Hans Blix for failing to properly disarm Iraq, Scott Ritter the former UNSCOM chief weapons inspector, blamed Annan for being slow and ineffective in enforcing Security Council resolutions on Iraq and was overtly submissive {{to the demands of the}} Clinton administration for regime removal and inspection of sites, often Presidential palaces, that were not mandated in any resolution and were of questionable intelligence value, which severely hampered UNSCOM's ability to cooperate <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government and contributed to their expulsion from the country. Ritter also claimed that Annan regularly interfered with the work of the inspectors and diluted the chain of command by trying to micromanage all of the activities of UNSCOM, which caused intelligence processing (and the resulting inspections) to be backed up and caused confusion with the Iraqis as to who was in charge and as a result, they generally refused to take orders from Ritter or Rolf Ekéus without explicit approval from Annan, which could have taken days, if not weeks. He later believed that Annan was oblivious to the fact the Iraqis took advantage of this in order to delay inspections. He claimed that on one occasion, Annan refused to implement a no-notice inspection of the SSO headquarters and instead tried to negotiate access, but the negotiation ended up taking nearly six weeks, giving the Iraqis more than enough time to clean out the site.|$|E

500|$|On 29 June 2014, it was {{reported}} that Iraq claimed to have received the first batch of second hand Su-25s ordered from Russia in order to fight Sunni rebels of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.
