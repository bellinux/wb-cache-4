25|$|To {{those who}} worked with him at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing the report of the Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E

500|$|At first, Henson's Muppets {{appeared}} {{separately from}} the realistic segments on the Street, but after a poor test-screening in Philadelphia, the show was revamped to integrate the two, placing much greater emphasis on Henson's work. Though Henson would often downplay his role in Sesame Street’s success, Cooney frequently praised Jim's work and, in 1990, the Public Broadcasting Service called him [...] "the spark that ignited our fledgling broadcast service." [...] The success of Sesame Street also allowed Henson to stop producing commercials. He later remembered that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> {{to get out of}} that world".|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain would she have been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although I admit, that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. But I say, It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E

According to a teammate, O'Mullane's reputation as a first-rate boxer was enough to dissuade the opposition from getting into melees with his club. Harrison remembered O'Mullane as a strong, but good-tempered player, and stated that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to meet him on the football field—even when the meeting was shoulder to shoulder, and you happened to get the trifle worst of it." ...|$|E

[...] American law did not then allow a vessel to operate without a certificate and a certificate could not be lawfully issued if creditors had unpaid claims against the vessel. [...] Worse yet, the official in charge of enforcing this law was the Astoria customs inspector, General Adair, who was a co-owner the Columbia, the only other steamboat on the Columbia River at the time, and as such the chief rival of Lot Whitcomb. [...] More stock was sold to pay off the ship's debts, and regularized operations were finally able to begin.|$|E

2500|$|In the 19th century smoking {{was common}} {{as a symbol}} of simple pleasures; the pipe smoking [...] "noble savage", solemn contemplation by Classical Roman ruins, scenes of an artists {{becoming}} one with nature while slowly toking a pipe. The newly empowered middle class also found a new dimension of smoking as a harmless pleasure enjoyed in smoking saloons and libraries. Smoking a cigarette or a cigar would also become associated with the bohemian, someone who shunned the conservative middle class values and displayed his contempt for conservatism. But this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> that was to be confined to a male world; women smokers were associated with prostitution and smoking was not considered an activity fit for proper ladies. It was not until the start of the 20th century that smoking women would appear in paintings and photos, giving a chic and charming impression. Impressionists like Vincent van Gogh, who was a pipe smoker himself, would also begin to associate smoking with gloom and fin-du-siècle fatalism.|$|E
2500|$|Walt Simonson {{took over}} both writing and art as of #337 (Nov. 1983). His stories placed a greater {{emphasis}} on the character's mythological origins. [...] Simonson's run as writer-artist lasted until #367 (May 1986), although he continued to write – and occasionally draw – the book until issue #382 (Aug. 1987). Simonson's run, which introduced the character Beta Ray Bill, was regarded as a popular and critical success. Simonson's later stories were drawn by Sal Buscema, who describes Simonson's stories as [...] "very stimulating. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> working on his plots, because they were {{a lot of fun to}} illustrate. He had a lot of great ideas, and he took Thor in a totally new direction." [...] Asked why he was leaving Thor, Simonson said that he felt the series was due for a change in creative direction, and that he wanted to reduce his work load for a time. After Simonson's departure, Marvel's editor-in-chief at the time, Tom DeFalco, became the writer. Working primarily with artist Ron Frenz, DeFalco stayed on the book until #459 (Feb. 1993).|$|E
