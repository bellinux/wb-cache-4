25|$|Big-spending Paris Saint-Germain {{had to face}} Greek outfit Olympiakos Volou in the UEFA Europa League play-offs {{over two}} legs for {{a place in the}} group stages. Olympiakos Volou, however, were {{excluded}} from the Europa League for their involvement in a match-fixing scandal, with UEFA handing the Greek club a three-season ban from continental competition. Differdange from Luxembourg replaced Olympiakos Volou. The UEFA Appeals Body seconded the decision of the Control and Disciplinary Body to exclude Olympiakos Volou from the Europa League competition. Javier Pastore provided two assists in his debut to help Paris Saint-Germain take a commanding lead into the second leg of their UEFA Europa League play-off tie against Differdange. Paris Saint-Germain never looked in danger of squandering their first-leg lead as they claimed a convincing win over Differdange to take the tie 6-0 on aggregate and advance to the group stages. However, it did take Antoine Kombouaré's star-studded side more than an hour to break down the Luxembourgish outfit, but Nenê's spectacular strike from distance was <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait.</b> Paris Saint-Germain were top seeds for the draw in Monaco and were placed in a testing Group F alongside Athletic Bilbao, Slovan Bratislava and Red Bull Salzburg.|$|E
500|$|Alex Simmons, Doug Johns, and Andy Mitchell {{reviewed}} the Amiga version of Pool of Radiance for Amiga Action magazine in 1990, {{giving it a}} 79% overall rating. Mitchell preferred the game Champions of Krynn, which had been released {{by the time the}} Amiga version of Pool of Radiance became available; he felt that Pool of Radiance was [...] "more of the same" [...] when compared to Champions, but was less playable and with more limited actions for players. Simmons felt that Pool of Radiance looked primitive and seemed less polished when compared with Champions of Krynn; he felt that although Pool was not up to the standard of Champions, he said it was still [...] "a fine little game". Johns, on the other hand, felt that Pool of Radiance was well <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> considering it very user-friendly despite being less polished than Champions of Krynn.|$|E

In his review for GameSpot, Frank Provo found it [...] "absolutely astonishing that Nintendo let 13 years go by before making Super Metroid readily available again", but considered the most important thing was that players [...] "can now play this masterpiece without having to track down the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System cartridge or fumble with legally questionable emulators". Despite admitting that the Virtual Console version was essentially [...] "nothing more than a no-frills, emulated version of a 13-year-old SNES game" [...] that was no longer cutting-edge, he was still pleased with it and reiterated his belief that Super Metroid is [...] "one of the best 2D action adventure games ever produced".|$|E

The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one.

Rock Sound made a favorable comparison to Thin Lizzy for the track [...] "Lunar", and to Baroness for [...] "The Gem", giving the album a score of 9 out of 10. The PRP described the album as [...] "heavier" [...] than Hello Master, with its songs having [...] "an alarming amount of depth", but referred to the track [...] "Murphy's Law" [...] as [...] "questionable" [...] in an otherwise favorable review which gave the album 4 out of 5 stars. Artrocker's Stuart Gadd also gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, as he enjoyed the stylistic reminders of Iron Maiden and other classic metal he heard on the album, and went as {{far as to say that}} despite being released in early 2010 it was already the best metal record of the year. David Marchese, writing for Spin, also praised the album with a score of 8 out of 10, even saying that [...] "Someone should be fired for the delay , because this baby burns".|$|E

Our journey began by landing on a good new jetty, and being transferred at once to the tramway which adjoined it. A truck, with chairs on it, as usual here, carried us off at a good mule-trot; and we ran in the fast-fading light through a rolling hummocky country, very like the lowlands of Aberdeenshire, or the neighbourhood of Waterloo, save that, as night came on, the fireflies flickered everywhere among the canes, and here and there the palms and Ceibas stood up, black and gaunt, against the sky.

500|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth {{received}} generally favorable reviews, but {{was also}} often criticized for being buggy and inaccessible for many players because of its high difficulty. GameSpy ranked it as the tenth best game of E3 2004 while GameSpot nominated it for their [...] "Most Surprisingly Good Game of 2005" [...] award, with a comment that [...] "after a development cycle that was nearing infinity, it's {{hard to imagine a}} world where this H.P.

[...] According to IGN, the game [...] "succeeds brilliantly in some areas," [...] making [...] "great use of the source material" [...] and forcing players [...] "to accept some realistic responsibility for their character" [...] due to the sanity system and HUD-less display, but can make the players [...] "cringe at the difficult nature of the game." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot opined [...] "a thick, unsettling atmosphere fills this ambitious first-person action-adventure, which makes up for some frustrating moments and dated graphics with plenty of chills, variety, and originality." [...] Cheat Code Central's Cole Smith called it [...] "one of the greatest book to game translations ever" [...] and a game [...] "that is full of twists, turns and incredibly wonderful scary surprises. It's got a great atmosphere which is sustained by dark and grainy graphics, chilling sound effects and an incredibly improbable storyline that is treated properly as to suspend reality from creeping in and ruining your experience." [...] GameSpy's Allen Rausch wrote [...] "this disturbing slice of Lovecraft's America is well worth the time to visit," [...] as [...] "despite the occasional missteps, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth is a more than fitting tribute to its literary inspiration." [...] Similarly, Kyle Williams of Gaming Target called it [...] "a labor of love" [...] that [...] "defies convention in favor of creating a videogame experience that is a worthy heir to the Lovecraft name." [...] Team Xbox's Matthew Fisher wrote that, despite some of the game's various shortcomings regarding the graphics and some of the detective aspects, [...] "this is an immersive experience that is a new and unique title for the Xbox, which is more than a welcome change.

His verdict was to wait. Matthew Cox (Rock, Paper, Shotgun) said it was good that the developers switched to the Unity engine in late 2014 due to the instability of the game. He found many glitches in the late 2014 version, including unresponsive animals, framerate issues and sometimes servers would randomly disconnect him.

Jaz Rignall said it {{was among}} the best arcade adventures on the Commodore 64 since it had the right balance of frustration and addiction to keep him playing the ZX Spectrum version for weeks. Gary Penn, however, considered the game average when it first released for the ZX Spectrum and thought that the port of the year-old game had out-of-date sounds, out-of-tune title music, and was overall not among the Commodore 64's best adventure games. Gary Liddon thought that the Commodore 64 version appeared [...] "crude" [...] compared to other releases for the platform, though perhaps par for the ZX Spectrum. The magazine noted the difficulty of traversing the vertical caverns and found the eagles annoying, especially when they dropped Sabreman to his death. Zzap!64 critics felt that the game presented well, but was less accessible, overpriced for its age, and poorly animated. Ultimately, they considered the game better than the developer's previous two 1985 releases, but {{not as good as}} it could have been.
