5|$|The first Guardian {{video was}} shot on {{a digital camera}} by an {{investment}} fund manager from New York who was in London on business, and who attended the protests out of curiosity. On his way to Heathrow airport, {{he realized that the}} man he had filmed being assaulted <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had reportedly died of a heart attack. At that point, 2 am on 7 April, he passed his footage to The Guardian, which published it on its website that afternoon. The newspaper passed a copy to the IPCC, which opened a criminal inquiry.|$|E
5|$|The shape-shifting Mystique gains {{information}} about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics {{for a second}} Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X-Jet is attacked by fighter jets en route back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.|$|E

A government re-enactment that aired on television days after the shooting alleged that Galman hid under the service staircase while Aquino and the boarding party descended it, and as Aquino neared the van, Galman emerged from under the staircase and shot Aquino {{in the back of}} the head. Several members of the security detail in turn fired several shots at Galman, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Peter Robinson, {{a member}} of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a {{prominent}} businessman from York, Upper Canada <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} after the Second World War that Manchester United became a {{fully-fledged}} footballing power, but they picked up three league titles during the 1950s. Matt Busby <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had coached Manchester United to glory and he remained at the club until 1969. Meanwhile, across to the east, Leeds United had signed up former player Don Revie as their player-manager and he soon took the manager's post full-time. Manchester United's side during this era featured the likes of Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best, while under Revie Leeds had gained {{a reputation as a}} tough, uncompromising side, with the likes of Bobby's brother Jack Charlton, Billy Bremner, and Norman Hunter. Another key member of Revie's side was the Irishman Johnny Giles, who joined Leeds from Manchester United for £33,000 in 1963.|$|E

25|$|Causes for {{the high}} female {{dismissal}} rate were studied at Jimma University. Students re-admitted in 2007-08 and staff completed questionnaires and took part in focus groups. Only 37% of female students had been taught by female teachers. The advantages of having female teachers were that female teachers were better than male teachers at understanding their problems, they could share their experiences of the challenges they had to overcome, they could discuss their problems freely and find solutions. In class, female students felt free to ask and answer questions and female teachers showed them {{that it was possible}} for them to attain higher levels if they worked hard like men. Only 27% of female students had received assertiveness training. However, female students had received informal orientation advice from senior female students in their first year. Lack of assertiveness training encourages female students to feel inferior about their abilities and to lack confidence in speaking up when conflict arises. This contributes to low achievement, dismissal and dropping out. Feelings of powerlessness make them dependent on others such as male students. Some students (46%) had not chosen their university and 74.1% had not chosen their department. The former increased homesickness when they were too far away to visit their parents, and the latter reduced interest in the university and in attending lessons. There was a guidance and counseling service but only 22% of students were aware of its existence and none had attended. Poor time management could be another reason for dropping out. When female students first arrived, their time was wasted by male students repeatedly trying to start love affairs. If a love affair did start, it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> decided when they would meet so interrupting the woman's studies. The women agreed with the man's decisions to maintain the relationship and avoid losing the academic benefits the relationship provided. Many students were from poor families and could not afford necessities for education and university life. They might try to resolve their economic difficulties through high risk sexual activity. There was widespread sexual harassment and discrimination from male students and, sometimes, male teachers. Both consensual and non-consensual sex could result in HIV, pregnancy and drop out.|$|E

[...] During the 1884 season, Anson refused to play against Toledo until the Walker {{brothers}} were benched. [...] In 1887, Anson again refused to play against the Newark team on which Fleetwood played. [...] Anson biographer David L.

In 1930, Gandhi wrote, [...] "Such <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now." [...] 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi.

Five games into the season, however, with the Patriots at 2–3, Saban was fired and replaced by assistant Mike Holovak. Patriots owner Billy Sullivan said {{the decision was made}} by a majority vote of the team's board of directors, who [...] "just simply felt all the talent on our team had not been used and felt Mike <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would {{be able to use the}} talent we had to the extent that it is capable of performing." ...|$|E
500|$|Longacre became apprenticed to George Murray, {{principal}} in the engraving firm Murray, Draper, Fairman & Co. at 47 Sansom Street in Philadelphia. [...] This business {{derived from the}} firm established by the Philadelphia Mint's first chief engraver, Robert Scot. [...] Longacre remained at the Murray firm until 1819; his major work there was portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hancock which were placed on a facsimile of the Declaration of Independence by publisher John Binns; the work cost Binns a total of $9,000 (equal to $ today). Also employed at the Murray firm from 1816 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> would be Longacre's predecessor as chief engraver, Christian Gobrecht. Longacre's work at the company gave him a good reputation as an engraver skilled in rendering other artists' paintings as a printed engraving, and in 1819, he set up his own business at 230 Pine Street in Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I {{thought he was a}} little bit crazy, and I told him I wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Man Who Never Lied" [...] is a pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 25 seconds. It is written in the key of D major, in common time, with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Levine's vocal range spans from the low note of A4 to the high note of B5. Lyrically, the song finds the protagonist in a {{relationship}} trouble where he is playing a role of a good person: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> never lied... but I couldn't break your heart like you did yesterday." [...] According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in [...] "The Man Who Never Lied", Levine sings [...] "about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone concluded that in the song, the singer confesses that the honesty is the worst policy. According to the reviewer, that's a [...] "dubious motto for real life – but it's always a promising one for a pop sharpie." ...|$|E
500|$|British novelist Justin Cartwright, {{who wrote}} the book The Song Before It Is Sung {{about one of the}} plot's conspirators, wrote, [...] "The film is true to most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and {{political}} vortex into which Germans were being drawn." [...] Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, who was disenchanted with the Nazis. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden ("poets and heroes"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing." [...] The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a [...] "troublesome cop". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.|$|E
500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January.

[...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> put the bomb in the baggage. I think he had checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage.

500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
