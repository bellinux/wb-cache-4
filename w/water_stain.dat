5000|$|A Catholic, Mac is {{the only}} member of The Gang to profess a {{religious}} faith. In [...] "The Gang Exploits a Miracle", Mac fears that the Lord will show his wrath if they continue to exploit a <b>water</b> <b>stain</b> in the bar that appears to depict the Virgin Mary. Throughout the series, Mac refuses to wear a condom during sex because, as he explains to Charlie, he went to Catholic school. Though Mac seems to care more about issues such as abortion, community activism, and parenting than the rest of The Gang, his views on such subjects are invariably twisted, ignorant, or prejudiced and his actions regarding them are always hypocritical and selfish. For instance, after pretending to be adamantly pro-life in order to attract a female activist, Mac later demands that she get an abortion when he thinks she has become pregnant by him. In another instance, Mac discovers that Carmen has married and had the operation to remove her penis. He then belittles Carmen and her husband by quoting the Bible to them and calling them gay; however, he only reacts so because he expected Carmen to call him after the operation so they could date again. Mac constantly drinks alcohol, like the rest of The Gang, and abuses other substances, such as poppers and glue. In recent seasons, Mac has sometimes expressed Anti-Semitism, from his rant about Mark Zuckerberg and [...] "his Jews" [...] using Facebook and other social media to take over the world in [...] "The Anti-Social Network" [...] and, in [...] "The Gang Group Dates", telling a disgusted Frank and Charlie that he wants to make sure any women he might date are not Jewish.|$|E

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of high-performance fabrics requires numerous {{chemical treatment}} steps that involve {{the use of}} per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) to protect apparel against <b>water,</b> <b>stain,</b> and oil penetration. However, air and wastewater emissions of PFASs generated during this manufacturing are a potential threat to both factory workers and the environment. We investigated the occurrence and distribution of PFASs in wastewater, air, airborne particles, and settled dust in a textile manufacturing plant in China. PFOA and PFDA or their precursor compounds 8 : 2 FTOH and 10 : 2 FTOH were the dominant compounds in all environmental media tested, revealing that long-chain PFASs were preferably used for the manufacturing of functional garments. Besides, PFASs were detected along the textile manufacturing chain, indicating that they were used as durable water repellents and as surfactants in, for example, coating agents. The workers' exposure to FTOHs via air inhalation was up to 5 orders of magnitude higher than the background exposure of the general western population. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, information regarding the emission of PFASs during the manufacturing of textiles via various this is the first study providing environmental media...|$|E
40|$|Camelids {{are known}} for {{frequent}} occurrence of general ill-thrift. In other species, neutrophil dysfunction {{has been identified as}} a cause of ill-thrift, and linked to chronic fungal and bacterial infections. However, no reference values exist for neutrophil function testing in camelids, which inhibits accurate evaluation of neutrophil deficiency in this species. Neutrophil adhesion values were investigated in six healthy alpacas. Neutrophils were isolated from whole, EDTA-treated blood once per week for three weeks and suspended in RMPI 1560, supplemented with 1 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Five hundred thousand cells were added to each well in a 96 -well non-tissue culture treated plate and either untreated or stimulated with phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA). Non-adherent cells were discarded, adhered cells were stained with crystal violet gram staining solution, and plates were washed with deionized <b>water.</b> <b>Stain</b> was solubilized with 1 % SDS and percent adherence determined by absorbance at 570 nm. No significant difference was found in the percent neutrophil adherence between weeks (p = 0. 59). Mean percent neutrophil adhesion was 12. 4 % ± 3. 0 % (9. 4 % – 15. 4 %). Given that results from individual alpacas appear to be relatively consistent at different time points, use of this adhesion assay may be a valuable tool in investigating neutrophil function in camelids...|$|E

Repeat washes with 75 %, and two 100 % acetone changes. - Embed in Epon resin. - Suspend cells in 1 / 3 plastic: 2 / 3 acetone and leave the tube uncovered overnight in the hood. If possible, put the tubes on a rotary shaker. The acetone will gradually evaporate and increase the concentration of plastic. - The next day gently pellet the cells, remove the acetone:plastic mix and add fresh 100 % plastic. I generally underlay the cells with plastic, let them sit for ~ 30 min, and place the tubes in a vacuum chamber - pumped by house vacuum. Cells will settle {{to the bottom of the}} tube within 1 - 2 hrs. Pellet the cells in the clinical centrifuge and remove the plastic above the cells. - Put BEEM capsules in the bottom of plastic or glass centrifuge tubes, fill about half full with fresh plastic, and overlay with cells from the above pellets. Spin at top speed for ~ 10 min.

40|$|Author: Matt Lewis ### Notes Alpha {{satellite}} sequences, whilst highly repetitive, {{are specific}} to each individual chromosome. These sequences flank the centromeres and can present a target measured in megabases. In this protocol a biotin or digoxigenin labelled DNA probe is detected using HRP-conjugated antibodies. The signal is visualised with diaminobenzidine (DAB). Normal, healthy nuclei show two spots. Aneusomic nuclei show 1, 3, 4 or more spots. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1 **. A 6 mm section of a paraffin embedded raft culture hybridised to a chromosome 17 specific alpha satellite probe. We buy our probes from Appligene/Oncor although they are very expensive and the telesales staff are rude. ### Starting material We have two types of starting material; (i) tissue culture cells attached to glass slides, (ii) sections taken from paraffin embedded tissue. 1. Tissue culture cells. We use multispot slides with 4 wells separated by PTFE coating. The slides are treated with APES prior to use (see below). The cells are trypsinised and resuspended as usual then one or two drops are placed onto the end well of a labelled slide. The cells are allowed to attach overnight in a humid chamber in the CO 2 incubator. Next day the slides are immersed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin. After 2 days fixation the slides are rinsed in H 2 O and allowed to air dry. Store dry, dust-free. - Paraffin sections. Take 6 mm sections onto APES treated slides (see below) and bake overnight at 60 C. Dewax in Xylene, 2 x 5 minutes. Then immerse as follows; 100 % ethanol 2 x 5 minutes, 90 % Ethanol 5 minutes, 75 % ethanol 5 minutes, H 2 O 2 x 5 minutes and allow to dry. Store dry, dust-free. ### Typical Protocol 1. Immerse the slides in 1 M sodium thiocyanate at 80 C for 10 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O and allow to dry. - *This treatment strips away the histones*. - *If using cheap glass coplin jars, allow to heat up slowly with the water bath, otherwise they crack*. - Treat the slides with 4 mg/ml pepsin at 37 C for 30 minutes. Rinse in H 2 O, 2 x 5 minutes, and allow to dry. - *This opens up the fixed (crosslinked) cytoplasm to allow probe access. Make up 0. 2 M HCl [50 mls H 2 O + 800 ml conc. HCl], weigh out a little pepsin (Sigma P 7012) into a universal and add the 0. 2 M HCl to make 4 mg/ml. Place the slides flat in a humid chamber (eg a large square plastic petri dish) and drop the pepsin gently onto the slide. Then place in the 37 C incubator*. - *This pepsin digestion is the most crucial step. Too little digestion and the probe {{will not be able}} to access the chromosomes. Too much and the morphology will all be chewed up*. - Prepare the hybridisation solution. - *One well of a multispot slide needs 6 ml of hyb with a 13 mm circular coverslip*. - *A square 22 mm coverslip uses 10 - 12 ml*. - *For larger than this you can put two slides face to face (acting as each other's coverslip) with 30 ml of hyb solution*. ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 4. Apply an appropriate amount of hybridisation solution onto the slide and cover with a coverslip. 5. Incubate at 80 C for 10 minutes. This denatures the DNA 6. Transfer to a humid chamber and incubate overnight at 37 C 7. Dip the slides into a coplin jar containing wash solution, allow the coverslips to slide off. Immerse the slides in formamide wash solution for 20 minutes at 42 C. - *We wash in formamide wash solution at 42 C. The wash can be done without formamide at higher temperature (try 0. 25 x SSC at 72 C for 5 minutes) Formamide wash solution: 60 ml formamide TOXIC (Sigma F 7503), 30 ml H 2 O, 10 ml 20 x SSC, 80 ml conc. HCl (to bring the pH to 7) * - *Do not allow the slides to dry at any stage until after DAB detection*. 8. Immerse briefly in PBS to wash, then incubate with blocking solution for 20 minutes at room temperature. - *Lay the slides flat in a humid chamber and drop the solution onto them* - *Do not allow the slides to dry* - *Blocking solution: 100 ml PBS, 2 g BSA (Sigma A 3059), 50 ml Tween 20 *. - *I carefully dry around the tissue (or round the edge of the slide if I cannot see the tissue) with a paper towel to define a wet area for the various washes*. 9. Drain off the blocking solution and replace with mouse anti-biotin antibody diluted 1 : 100 in blocking solution for 40 minutes at 37 C. - *We currently use DAKO antibody #M 0743, 100 - 200 ml per slide*. 10. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 11. Incubate with rabbit anti-mouse HRP antibody diluted 1 : 80 for 40 minutes at 37 C - We use DAKO P 0260 12. Wash with blocking solution for 10 minutes 13. Incubate with swine anti-rabbit HRP antibody diluted 1 : 100 for 40 minutes at 37 C - *We use DAKO P 0217 * 14. Wash in PBS for 5 minutes 15. Detect the signal using Diaminobenzidine (DAB) - *I use DAB tablets (Sigma D 4293) to make 5 ml of DAB solution and then carefuuly drop the DAB onto the slides. DAB is carcinogenic so take care. The signal takes about 10 minutes to develop. If you're lucky you may be able to see tiny spots at low power under the microscope (take care not to dip the lens in the DAB solution) * - *Follow these URLs to learn about safe disposal of DAB:* [[URL] [[URL] 16. Rinse in tap <b>water,</b> <b>stain</b> the nuclei using haematoxylin, de-hydrate through the ethanol series and mount in DPX. - *The length of the haematoxylin stain depends on the kind of haemaotoxylin and how much it has been used. Try 30 secs at first. Check under the low power microscope*. **APES treatment of slides** *This is an alternative to poly-L-lysine treatment. The APES coating makes the slides more adhesive for fixed tissue and living cells*. Fill several big metal slide racks with slides (I do hundreds at a time), then treat each rack sequentially as follows; 1. Immerse in 1 % acid/alcohol 30 mins - *Acid alcohol is [1 % (v/v) concentrated HCl, 70 % Ethanol, 29 % H 2 O]* - *This is to clean the slides* - Rinse in water and allow to dry - *First rinse in running tap water, then immerse in distilled water, then allow to dry*. - Immerse in acetone for 10 minutes - Immerse in [2 %(v/v) APES in acetone] for 5 minutes. - *APES is aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma A 3648) * - Immerse briefly in 2 sequential rinses of distilled H 2 O - Allow to dry and store in a dust-free container - *Use within months not years...|$|E
