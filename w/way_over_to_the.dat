500|$|Originally, Constable was {{a member}} of the Whig party, likely due to the close {{friendship}} of his father-in-law and Henry Clay. Due mainly to frustrations over how the Whig party had treated him, Constable decided to switch parties. He is quoted as saying, [...] "that the party was dominated by old fogies who are indifferent to younger men." [...] His inclination toward the Democratic Party almost led to a fistfight between himself and Lincoln in a tavern in Paris, Illinois. Lincoln was quoted as saying, [...] "Mr. Constable, I understand you perfectly, and have noticed for some time that you have been slowly and cautiously picking your <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Democratic party." [...] After this heated exchange, the men reconciled, but by 1856 Lincoln claimed that Constable had left the party. In 1858, Constable was the Illinois elector at-large for the election of President James Buchanan, a Democrat.|$|E
500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never saw. He later recalled, [...] "I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised." [...] Eaton brought his {{crippled}} aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying. It was something which, at the time, didn't bear much dwelling on." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. I made my <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E

6000|$|That is imaginative, impressive, poetic; but when, almost {{immediately}} afterwards, the author {{goes on to}} say that [...] "the minister looking upward to the zenith, beheld there the appearance of an immense letter--the letter A--marked out in lines of dull red light," [...] we feel that he goes too far and is in danger of crossing the line that separates the sublime from its intimate neighbour. We are tempted to say that this is not moral tragedy, but physical comedy. In the same way, too much is made of the intimation that Hester's badge had a scorching property, and that if one touched it one would immediately withdraw one's hand. Hawthorne is perpetually looking for images which shall place themselves in picturesque correspondence with the spiritual facts with which he is concerned, and of course the search is of the very essence of poetry. But in such a process discretion is everything, and when the image becomes importunate it is in danger of seeming to stand for nothing more serious than itself. When Hester meets the minister by appointment in the forest, and sits talking with him while little Pearl wanders away and plays by the edge of the brook, the child is represented as at last making her <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side of the woodland stream, and disporting herself there in a manner which makes her mother feel herself, [...] "in some indistinct and tantalising manner, estranged from Pearl; as if the child, in her lonely ramble through the forest, had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together, and was now vainly seeking to return to it." [...] And Hawthorne devotes a chapter to this idea of the child's having, by putting the brook between Hester and herself, established a kind of spiritual gulf, on the verge of which her little fantastic person innocently mocks at her mother's sense of bereavement. This conception belongs, one would say, quite to the lighter order of a story-teller's devices, and the reader hardly goes with Hawthorne in the large development he gives to it. He hardly goes with him either, I think, in his extreme predilection for a small number of vague ideas which are represented by such terms as [...] "sphere" [...] and [...] "sympathies." [...] Hawthorne makes too liberal a use of these two substantives; it is the solitary defect of his style; and it counts as a defect partly because the words in question are a sort of specialty with certain writers immeasurably inferior to himself.|$|E

6000|$|She {{remained}} {{out with}} him for a time of which she could take no measure save that it was too short for what she wished to make of it--an interval, a barrier indefinite, insurmountable. They walked about, they dawdled, they looked in shop-windows; they did all the old things exactly as if to try to get back all the old safety, to get something out of them that they had always got before. This had come before, whatever it was, without their trying, and nothing came now but the intenser consciousness of their quest and their subterfuge. The strangest thing of all was what had really happened to the old safety. What had really happened was that Sir Claude was [...] "free" [...] and that Mrs. Beale was [...] "free," [...] and yet that the new medium was somehow still more oppressive than the old. She could feel that Sir Claude concurred with her {{in the sense that the}} oppression would be worst at the inn, where, till something should be settled, they would feel the want of something--of what could they call it but a footing? The question of the settlement loomed larger to her now: it depended, she had learned, so completely on herself. Her choice, as her friend had called it, was there before her like an impossible sum on a slate, a sum that in spite of her plea for consideration she simply got off from doing while she walked ab{{out with him}}. She must see Mrs. Wix before she could do her sum; therefore the longer before she saw her the more distant would be the ordeal. She met at present no demand whatever of her obligation; she simply plunged, to avoid it, deeper into the company of Sir Claude. She saw nothing that she had seen hitherto--no touch in the foreign picture that had at first been always before her. The only touch was that of Sir Claude's hand, and to feel her own in it was her mute resistance to time. She went about as sightlessly as if he had been leading her blindfold. If they were afraid of themselves it was themselves they would find at the inn. She was certain now that what awaited them there would be to lunch with Mrs. Beale. All her instinct was to avoid that, to draw out their walk, to find pretexts, to take him down upon the beach, to take him to the end of the pier. He said no other word to her about what they had talked of at breakfast, and she had a dim vision of how his way of not letting her see him definitely wait for anything from her would make any one who should know of it, would make Mrs. Wix for instance, think him more than ever a gentleman. It was true that once or twice, on the jetty, on the sands, he looked at her for a minute with eyes that seemed to propose to her to come straight off with him to Paris. That, however, was not to give her a nudge about her responsibility. He evidently wanted to procrastinate quite as much as she did; he was not a bit more in a hurry to get back to the others. Maisie herself at this moment could be secretly merciless to Mrs. Wix-- to the extent at any rate of not caring if her continued disappearance did make that lady begin to worry about what had become of her, even begin to wonder perhaps if the truants hadn't found their remedy. Her want of mercy to Mrs. Beale indeed was at least as great; for Mrs. Beale's worry and wonder would be as much greater as the object at which they were directed. When at last Sir Claude, at the far end of the plage, which they had already, in the many-coloured crowd, once traversed, suddenly, with a look at his watch, remarked that it was time, not to get back to the table d'hôte, but to get over to the station and meet the Paris papers--when he did this she found herself thinking quite with intensity what Mrs. Beale and Mrs. Wix WOULD say. On the <b>way</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station she had even a mental picture of the stepfather and the pupil established in a little place in the South while the governess and the stepmother, in a little place in the North, remained linked by a community of blankness and by the endless series of remarks it would give birth to. The Paris papers had come in and her companion, with a strange extravagance, purchased no fewer than eleven: it took up time while they hovered at the bookstall on the restless platform, where the little volumes in a row were all yellow and pink and one of her favourite old women in one of her favourite old caps absolutely wheedled him into the purchase of three. They had thus so much to carry home that it would have seemed simpler, with such a provision for a nice straight journey through France, just to [...] "nip," [...] as she phrased it to herself, into the coupé of the train that, a little further along, stood waiting to start. She asked Sir Claude where it was going.|$|E

Some of the new arrivals are under the power of Swedish Migration Board {{and some of them}} are by a contract handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> municipalities. The evaluation is based on Michael Lipskys street-level bureaucracy which puts its focus on the lower level of bureaucrats meeting with clients.

The material for this evaluation is empirical in the sense of interviews made in the municipalities and document handed from each responsible bureaucrat.

40|$|Connexin 40 (Cx 40) -containing gap-junction {{channels}} {{are expressed in}} the atrial myocardium and provide a low-resistance passage for rapid impulse propagation. A germline mutation in the GJA 5 gene, which encodes Cx 40, resulting in a truncated Cx 40 (Q 49 X) was identified in a large Chinese family with lone (idiopathic) atrial fibrillation (AF). This mutation co-segregated with seven AF probands in an autosomal-dominant <b>way</b> <b>over</b> generations. <b>To</b> test <b>the</b> hypothesis that this Cx 40 mutant affects the distribution and function of atrial gap junctions, we studied the Q 49 X mutant in gap-junction-deficient HeLa and N 2 A cells. The Q 49 X mutant, unlike wild-type Cx 40, was typically localized in the cytoplasm and failed to form gap-junction plaques at cell-cell interfaces. When the Q 49 X mutant was co-expressed with Cx 40 or Cx 43, the mutant substantially reduced the gap-junction plaque formation of Cx 40 and Cx 43. Electrophysiological studies revealed no electrical coupling of cell pairs expressing the mutant alone and {{a significant decrease in}} the coupling conductance when the mutant was co-expressed with Cx 40 or Cx 43. Further colocalization experiments with the organelle residential proteins indicate that Q 49 X was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings provide evidence that the Q 49 X mutant is capable of impairing gap-junction distribution and function of key atrial connexins, which might play a role in <b>the</b> predisposition <b>to</b> and onset of AF...|$|R
