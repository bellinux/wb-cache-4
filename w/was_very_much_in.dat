5|$|Brettingham was {{commissioned}} in 1742 to redesign Langley Hall, a mansion standing {{in its own}} parkland in South Norfolk. His design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Palladian style of Holkham, though much smaller: a large principal central block linked to two flanking secondary wings by short corridors. The corner towers, while similar to those later designed by Brettingham at Euston Hall, were {{the work of a}} later owner and architect. The neoclassical entrance lodges were a later addition, by Sir John Soane. In 1743, Brettingham began work on the construction of Hanworth Hall, Norfolk, also in the Palladian style, with a five-bay facade of brick with the centre three bays projected with a pediment.|$|E
5|$|Several {{universities}} on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, {{replaced the}} sport with rugby. At the time, {{the future of}} football <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off {{the loss of the}} teams and continued playing football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, small rock {{tumblers}} were {{a common}} hobby item, and jewelry decorated with tumbled semi-precious stones <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> fashion. Likewise, dishes and decorative glass jars filled with tumbled stones (often including common rocks not suitable even for costume jewelry) were frequently used as household ornaments.|$|E

25|$|The few Roman Catholics, Baptists and Quakers {{were now}} largely free of persecution. During the {{remainder}} of the 18th century Cornish Anglicanism <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the same state as Anglicanism in most of England. Wesleyan Methodist missions began during John Wesley's lifetime and had great success over a long period during which Methodism itself divided into a number of sects and established a definite separation from the Church of England.|$|E
25|$|The Cuban {{struggle}} for independence had captured the North American imagination for years and newspapers had been agitating for intervention with sensational stories of Spanish atrocities against the native Cuban population. Americans {{came to believe that}} Cuba's battle with Spain resembled United States's Revolutionary War. This continued even after Spain replaced Weyler and said it changed its policies, and the North American public opinion <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favour of intervening in favor of the Cubans.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally shophouses {{were built}} with {{structural}} (i.e. load bearing) timber beams which carried {{the weight of}} the roof and floors. Floor were similarly made of timber planks, often with narrow gaps in between them to allow air to filter through and to help the building (and its inhabitants) to 'breathe' better. The use of timber beams and floor boards <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> line with local building traditions. Modern shophouses, on the other hand, use reinforced concrete beams and slabs.|$|E
25|$|The ladies' {{version of}} the roadster's design <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> place by the 1890s. It had a step-through frame rather than the diamond frame of the gentlemen's model so that ladies, with their dresses and skirts, could easily mount and ride their bicycles, and {{commonly}} came with a skirt guard to prevent skirts and dresses becoming entangled in the rear wheel and spokes. As with the gents' roadster, the frame was of steel construction and the positioning of the frame and handlebars gave the rider a very upright riding position. Though they originally came with front spoon-brakes, technological advancements meant that later models were equipped with the much-improved coaster brakes or rod-actuated rim or drum-brakes.|$|E
25|$|Read, {{like most}} other people in Delaware, <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favor of trying to {{reconcile}} differences with Great Britain. He opposed the Stamp Act and similar measures of Parliament but supported anti-importation measures and dignified protests. He was quite reluctant to pursue the option of outright independence. Nevertheless, from 1764, he led the Delaware Committee of Correspondence and was elected to serve along with the more radical McKean and Rodney in the First and Second Continental Congress from 1774 to 1777. He was frequently absent, and when the Congress voted on American Independence on July 2, 1776, Read surprised many by voting against it. That meant that Rodney had to ride overnight to Philadelphia to break the deadlock in Delaware's delegation for independence. However, when the Declaration of Independence was finally adopted, Read signed it despite his natural caution.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} design stages, the {{aircraft}} had grown from being {{roughly the same}} size as the Mosquito to being around double its weight. Although jet-powered, the Canberra design philosophy <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the Mosquito mould, providing room for a substantial bomb load, fitting two of the most powerful engines available, and wrapping it in the most compact and aerodynamic package possible. Rather than devote space and weight to defensive armament which historically could not overcome fighter aircraft, the Canberra was designed to fly fast and high enough to avoid air-to-air combat entirely. On 7 January 1946, the Ministry of Supply placed a contract for the development and production of four English Electric A.1 aircraft. It continued to be known as the English Electric A.1 until it was given the name Canberra after the capital of Australia in January 1950 by Sir George Nelson, chairman of English Electric, as Australia had become the aircraft's first export customer.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?" [...] {{was written}} by McCartney in India after he saw two monkeys copulating {{in the street and}} {{wondered}} why humans were too civilised to do the same. He played all the instruments except drums, which were contributed by Starr. The simple lyric <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> Lennon's style, and Lennon was annoyed about not being asked to play on it. McCartney suggested it was [...] "tit for tat" [...] as he had not contributed to [...] "Revolution 9".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{wrote and}} {{produced}} the song with Steve Bray. According to her, [...] "True Blue" [...] takes its title from a favourite expression of her then husband Sean Penn {{and to his}} very pure vision of love and was a direct tribute to him {{as well as the}} album, which was as a whole inspired by her [...] "unabashed valentine" [...] for Penn. In an interview, Bray said, [...] "She [...] <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> love. It was obvious if she's in love she'll write love songs. If she's not in love she definitely won't be writing love songs." [...] In 2015, Madonna said that [...] "True Blue" [...] is [...] "a song about true love.

500|$|Before her own marriage, Stone {{felt that}} women {{should be allowed to}} divorce drunken husbands, to {{formally}} end a [...] "loveless marriage" [...] so that [...] "a true love may grow up in the soul of the injured one from the full enjoyment of which no legal bond had a right to keep her ...Whatever is pure and holy, not only has a right to be, but it has a right also to be recognized, and further, I think it has no right not to be recognized." [...] Stone's friends often felt differently about the issue; [...] "Nettee" [...] Brown wrote to Stone in 1853 that she was not ready to accept the idea, even if both parties wanted divorce. Stanton was less inclined to clerical orthodoxy; she <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favor of giving women the right to divorce, eventually coming to the view that the reform of marriage laws was more important than women's voting rights.|$|E
500|$|The Commission, in {{its report}} on 27 August 1966, found that such {{equality}} was best protected by giving minority rights equal footing with the fundamental liberties in the Constitution. In addition, it recommended a [...] "Council of State", an advisory body that would inform the Government of the effects its laws would have on minorities. This concept {{was based on the}} Kenyan Council of State which was established in 1958 during its phase of transition to African majority rule. The idea of an advisory body which could not significantly impede the legislative agenda was viewed by lawmakers as a promising innovation. In addition, the creation of an advisory council ensuring equal treatment in legislation <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> line with the idea that, as citizens become increasingly aware of racial and religious issues, national growth will very much depend on an approach to such problems that is not fraught with religious and racial tensions.|$|E
500|$|In 1906, citing {{concerns}} about the violence in American Football, universities on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, replaced the sport with rugby union.

500|$|In the studio, the New York Dolls {{dressed in}} their usual flashy clothes. Rundgren, who did not approve of their raucous sound, at one point yelled at them during the {{sessions}} to [...] "get the glitter out of your asses and play". Sylvain recalled Rundgren inviting Buell and their Chihuahua to the studio and putting the latter atop an expensive mixing console, while Johansen acknowledged that his recollections of the sessions have since been distorted by what he has read about them: [...] "It was like the 1920s, with palm tree décor and stuff. Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album. According to Scopa, the group's carefree lifestyle probably conflicted with Rundgren's professional work ethic and schedule: [...] "He doesn't put up with bullshit. I mean, [...] rarely started their live sets before midnight, so who knows? Todd <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> charge in the studio, however, and I {{got the impression that}} everybody was looking to him." ...|$|E
500|$|Seung Sahn {{was accused}} of {{carrying}} out sexual relationships with students secretly while supposedly celibate. The first accusations of sexual relationships between Seung Sahn and students came about in 1988. Sonia Alexander, former director of Cambridge Zen Center, has claimed that Seung Sahn had carried out long-term sexual relationships {{with a number of}} his female followers. Journalist Rick Fields confirms this, writing “the supposedly celibate Korean Zen master Seung Sahn (Seon-sa-nim) revealed long-term relationships with two students.” According to Sonia Alexander, when questioned about the nature of these relationships Seung Sahn stated that [...] "it wasn't [...] love, it wasn't lust." [...] These alleged relationships caused Alexander to end her involvement with the Kwan Um School, believing in retrospect that she had been used over the years only to help build more Zen Centers for the lineage. In addition to Alexander, author Sandy Boucher spoke with several other women who lived at the Cambridge Zen Center at the time, one of whom said that in her opinion Sonia <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the minority in feeling used and that Soen Sa Nim's affairs had not been hurtful to the women involved. [...] Notwithstanding her reservations, Alexander still has reverence for Seung Sahn, feels her time spent in the school was to her benefit, and subsequently rejoined the Kwan Um School as a Senior Dharma Teacher in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{also claimed}} that Lodge put Diệm on hold {{in order to}} inform Conein where the Ngô {{brothers}} were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh was astounded and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive." ...|$|E
