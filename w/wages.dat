40|$|This {{dissertation}} empirically {{investigates the}} extent of ripple effects associated with changes in mandated <b>wage</b> floors in the United States. Ripple effects are generally theorized to exist because employers provide <b>wage</b> increases beyond those legally {{required in order to}} preserve a particular <b>wage</b> hierarchy. This research thus addresses an important policy question: What is the overall impact of mandated <b>wage</b> floors on the <b>wage</b> structure? I examine two types of mandated <b>wage</b> floors: federal and state minimum <b>wage</b> laws and state prevailing <b>wage</b> laws. ^ I use a semi-parametric approach to estimate the <b>wage</b> effect of state and federal minimum <b>wage</b> changes at fourteen different <b>wage</b> percentiles. I find a limited minimum <b>wage</b> ripple effect. Workers earning up to the 15 th <b>wage</b> percentile (within 135 percent of the minimum <b>wage</b> prior to the increase) experience a <b>wage</b> effect from minimum <b>wage</b> changes. Although limited in extent, these estimates imply a ripple effect multiplier of approximately 2. 40 to 2. 50. This expanded effect modestly improves the target efficiency of minimum <b>wage</b> laws. Also, because the <b>wage</b> growth of these lower <b>wage</b> percentiles lag the rest of the <b>wage</b> distribution in the absence of minimum <b>wage</b> changes, they appear to comprise a minimum <b>wage</b> contour. A separate analysis of the retail trade industry produces similar results. ^ To observe prevailing <b>wage</b> law ripple effects, I estimate the <b>wage</b> effect of the repeal of state prevailing <b>wage</b> laws at five different points in the <b>wage</b> distribution using quantile regression. I use mean regression on samples of workers divided by union status and work experience to further specify the location of <b>wage</b> effects. The results suggest that prevailing <b>wage</b> laws produce limited or no ripple effects. The repeal of prevailing <b>wage</b> laws specifically impact the union <b>wage</b> premium of relatively more experienced construction workers and do not appear to spillover significantly to uncovered workers. The pattern of construction premiums across states suggests that prevailing <b>wage</b> laws may substitute as a source of bargaining power for union density. ...|$|R

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in <b>wages.</b> The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in <b>wages,</b> the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate <b>wages</b> could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift. This was to a large extent thanks to the competent leadership of royal administrators such as Treasurer William Edington and Chief Justice William de Shareshull.|$|E

The CGT rejected this, and proposed instead that <b>wages</b> be determined by free negotiations. Alfonsín allowed strike actions, which were forbidden during the dictatorship, which gave the unions another way to expand their influence. There were thirteen general strikes and thousands of minor labor conflicts. However, unlike similar situations in the past, the CGT sided with Alfonsín during the military rebellions, and did not support the removal of a non-Peronist president. The conflicts were caused by high inflation, and the unions requested higher <b>wages</b> in response to it.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{increase}} in <b>wage</b> inequality, the decline in collective bargaining, {{and the development of}} the gender <b>wage</b> gap in West Germany between 2001 and 2006. Based on detailed linked employer-employee data, we show that <b>wage</b> inequality is rising strongly – driven not only by real <b>wage</b> increases {{at the top of the}} <b>wage</b> distribution, but also by real <b>wage</b> losses below the median. Coverage by collective <b>wage</b> bargaining plummets by 16. 5 (19. 1) percentage points for male (female) employees. Despite these changes, the gender <b>wage</b> gap remains almost constant, with some small gains for women at the bottom and at the top of the <b>wage</b> distribution. A sequential decomposition analysis using quantile regression shows that all workplace related effects (firm effects and bargaining effects) and coefficients for personal characteristics contribute strongly to the rise in <b>wage</b> inequality. Among these, the firm coefficients effect dominates, which is almost exclusively driven by <b>wage</b> differences within and between different industries.

5|$|In {{efficiency}} wage models, {{workers are}} paid at levels that maximize productivity instead of clearing the market. For example, in developing countries, firms might {{pay more than}} a market rate to ensure their workers can afford enough nutrition to be productive. Firms might also pay higher <b>wages</b> to increase loyalty and morale, possibly leading to better productivity. Firms can also pay higher than market <b>wages</b> to forestall shirking. Shirking models were particularly influential. Carl Shapiro and Joseph Stiglitz (1984) created a model where employees tend to avoid work unless firms can monitor worker effort and threaten slacking employees with unemployment. If the economy is at full employment, a fired shirker simply moves to a new job. Individual firms pay their workers a premium over the market rate to ensure their workers would rather work and keep their current job instead of shirking and risk having {{to move to a}} new job. Since each firm pays more than market clearing <b>wages,</b> the aggregated labor market fails to clear. This creates a pool of unemployed laborers and adds to the expense of getting fired. Workers not only risk a lower wage, they risk being stuck in the pool of unemployed. Keeping <b>wages</b> above market clearing levels creates a serious disincentive to shirk that makes workers more efficient even though it leaves some willing workers unemployed.|$|E
