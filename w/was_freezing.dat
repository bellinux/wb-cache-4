5|$|According to Dallas, {{it rained}} on days that were {{supposed}} to be sunny, while other days of production lacked rain when {{they were supposed to be}} rainy. Goodwin added that the scene of Snow and Charming releasing the birds <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> because of the heavy rain. Their scene in the cabin took place on the first day of the episode's production. Her near-death scene involved a real cliff, though the height was exaggerated later using CGI and a green screen; a stunt double stood in for some of the shots.|$|E
25|$|Once upon a {{time there}} were a pig, a wolf, a fox and a hare. One day they {{gathered}} together and decided that today they would send the wolf into the mountains for a sheep and they would eat. The pig sent the hare for water and sent the wolf and the fox into the mountain for a ram. At night, {{when they came to}} the flock of sheep, the fox began to moan from the eastern side. Since they heard the fox's moaning, the dogs ran in that direction and the wolf went towards the flock from the west and found a fat ram. Having taken the ram, the wolf and the fox returned to the camp. They put the pan on the fire and sent the hare for water. At the spring the cat <b>was</b> <b>freezing.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 12 February 2011, the {{government}} of Switzerland announced it <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> the Swiss bank accounts of Mubarak and his family. On 20 February 2011, the Egyptian Prosecutor General ordered the freezing of Mubarak's assets and those of his wife Suzanne, his sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and his daughters-in-law Heidi Rasekh and Khadiga Gamal. The Prosecutor General also ordered the Egyptian Foreign Minister to communicate this to other countries where Mubarak and his family could have assets. This order came two days after Egyptian newspapers reported that Mubarak filed his financial statement. Egyptian regulations mandate government officials to submit a financial statement listing their assets and sources of income while performing government work. On 21 February 2011, the Egyptian Military Council, which was temporarily given the presidential authorities following 25 January 2011 Revolution, said it had no objection to a trial of Mubarak on charges of corruption.|$|E

500|$|During November 1862, the 2nd Loyal Virginia Volunteer Cavalry camped a {{few miles}} upriver from Charleston. On November 23, Colonel Paxton was ordered to attack two rebel cavalry camps in Sinking Creek Valley, located north of Lewisburg near the Greenbrier County border. One {{regiment}} of infantry, which was camped in Summerville, was supposed to assist Paxton. The cavalry departed on the next day, and traveled over [...] in two days.

They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. I like to do all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} {{after the first}} day's shooting, Corbijn told the band about Joshua trees (Yucca brevifolia), hardy and twisted plants in the deserts of the American Southwest, and he {{suggested}} their use on the sleeve. Bono was pleased to discover the religious significance of the plant's etymology; according to Mormon legend, early settlers named the plant after the Old Testament prophet Joshua, as the tree's stretching branches reminded them of Joshua raising his hands in prayer. The following day, Bono declared that the album should be titled The Joshua Tree. That morning, while driving on Route 190 near Darwin, they spotted a lone-standing tree in the desert. Corbijn had been {{hoping to find a}} single tree, as he thought it would result in better photographs than if he shot the band amongst a group of trees. They stopped the bus and photographed with the lone plant for about 20 minutes, something the Edge called [...] "fairly spontaneous". Despite shooting in the desert, the group dealt with cold weather during parts of the trip. Bono explained, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> and we had to take our coats off so it would at least look like a desert. That's {{one of the reasons we}} look so grim." [...] Regarding the serious tone of the images, Corbijn said, [...] "I guess people felt they took themselves too seriously. It was definitely the most serious, I think, that you can photograph a band. You couldn't go any further down that line unless you start photographing graves." ...|$|E

500|$|THQ was the {{publisher}} of the first game, but the studio put little effort into helping the game's development, leading to numerous technical issues and a lack of polish. However, the game's sales surprised THQ, and as a result, {{the publisher}} considered the first game a missed opportunity, and began to treat Metro as a franchise. Danny Bilson, then CEO of THQ, promised that the company would offer 4A more support and dedicate more resources in both the game's actual development and its marketing. Former THQ President Jason Rubin offered details of extremely difficult working conditions and demands put on the 4A Games team while completing the game. Their office <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> due to frequent power failures, and the team was forced to smuggle computer equipment into the offices to avoid corrupt customs officials. Rubin added that {{the publisher of}}fered an unreasonably small budget to the development team, accounting for only 10% of its competitor's budget and that their workspace was so crowded and small that he compared it to [...] "a packed grade school cafeteria", and an [...] " [...] gym at EA Los Angeles". Rubin praised the team for producing a game that successfully achieved high critical praise in spite of the harsh working conditions. According to Andrew Prokhorov, Rubin was the only THQ president that to visit the studio. He noted that the team [...] "deserve the ratings [...] get" [...] and [...] "need no indulgence" [...] from consumers who do not care about their working conditions.|$|E
500|$|While Morris (who by now had {{resigned}} from St James) edited the magazine from Hulton's premises at Shoe Lane in London, the comic {{was created in}} a converted bakery in the Churchtown district of Southport. [...] The building was described by Eagle artist Greta Tomlinson as [...] "very basic, a flagstone floor and a tin roof; there was cold running water in the corner. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> cold {{in the winter and}} boiling hot in the summer". [...] Working to a tight schedule, Hampson created each Dan Dare episode first in pencil, and then in ink and colour. [...] He and his team of artists posed for photographs, in the positions drawn in his pencil sketches (Hampson usually posed for Dan Dare). [...] These photographs were combined with the rough sketches, and his colleagues then worked on the strip while he tackled the opening frame of each week's story. [...] His drawings of the technology Dan Dare employed were meticulous, and were based on a large body of research and reference material, as well as space ship models, plaster heads, mocked-up space suits, and a complete model of a space station. [...] He also wrote the dialogue for several of the comic's pages. [...] Hampson was assisted in his work by expert consultants, among them Arthur C. Clarke (then an aspiring young science fiction writer). [...] Scriptwriters included Anglican priest Chad Varah (founder of Samaritans). [...] Varah also accompanied Morris on tours of Cathedrals often filled with Eagle readers keen to meet the comic's creators. [...] Peter Ling and Macdonald Hastings were contributors, as was Harris Tweed's creator John Ryan, who was also responsible for Captain Pugwash, printed in the first 19issues.|$|E

[...] Lidegaard gives the following figures for 1941: 6,000 Danish citizens had signed up to German army duty; 1,500 of these belonged to the German minority in Denmark.|$|E

2500|$|... "We went {{up there}} on a windy day, and it <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> cold. Every time we opened a plan it blew away. And we said Christ! What {{are we going to}} do with these students, where are they going to sit in the sun and all that? Well, we decided, it's got to be cloisters. All of the {{buildings}} have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|A South Carolina native, Rick Link {{became a}} fan of {{professional}} wrestling {{at a young age}} and was the president of the Ron Garvin Fan Club in his teens. One Man Gang was also one of his childhood friends while growing up in the Carolinas. Link started training to become a pro wrestler at the age of 15. He was taught by Johnny Hunter, an older NWA veteran who also trained Ken Spence and George South, who set up a ring in Link's backyard and worked out with the teenager 7 days a week unless Hunter was on the road. The training conditions, according to Link, were [...] "brutal" [...] as the two wrestled [...] "stiff" [...] and regardless of [...] "whether it <b>was</b> <b>freezing</b> or it was in 100 degree heat". The lessons learned from Hunter, that hardship would teach students to have a love and old-school respect for the business, would carry over as a trainer years later.|$|E
