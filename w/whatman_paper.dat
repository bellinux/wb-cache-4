40|$|Identification of {{the source}} of {{mosquito}} blood meals is an important component for disease control and surveillance. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling has emerged as an effective tool for mosquito blood meal identification, using the abdomens of freshly engorged mosquitoes. In the field, mosquito abdomens are crushed on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> to determine the host feeding patterns by identifying the origin of their blood meals. The aim {{of this study was to}} test whether crushing engorged mosquito abdomens on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> was compatible with MALDI-TOF MS for mosquito blood meal identification. Both laboratory reared and field collected mosquitoes were tested. Sixty Anopheles gambiae Giles were experimentally engorged on the blood of six distinct vertebrate hosts (human, sheep, rabbit, dog, chicken and rat). The engorged mosquito abdomens were crushed on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> for MALDI-TOF MS analysis. 150 <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers,</b> with mosquitoes engorged on cow and goat blood, were preserved. A total of 77 engorged mosquito abdomens collected in the Comoros Islands and crushed on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> were tested with MALDI-TOF MS. The MS profiles generated from mosquito engorged abdomens crushed on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> exhibited high reproducibility according to the original host blood. The blood meal host was correctly identified from mosquito abdomens crushed on <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> by MALDI-TOF MS. The MS spectra obtained after storage were stable regardless of the room temperature and whether or not they were frozen. The MS profiles were reproducible for up to three months. For the Comoros samples, 70 / 77 quality MS spectra were obtained and matched with human blood spectra. This was confirmed by molecular tools. The results demonstrated that MALDI-TOF MS could identify mosquito blood meals from <b>Whatman</b> filter <b>papers</b> collected in the field during entomological surveys. The application of MALDI-TOF MS has proved to be rapid and successful, making it a new and efficient tool for mosquito-borne disease surveillance...|$|R

50|$|Thematic {{compositions}} {{occupy a}} special place in Pryimachenko's creative legacy as far as the complexity of compositional arrangement and harmonious balance are concerned. Raw actuality and fairy-tale become blended in her compositions into one single whole, triumphantly demonstrating the unity of Nature. People depicted in these compositions are composed and full of dignity and self-respect. Her early compositions were executed against a white background, associated with the whitewashed walls of peasant cottages. But in the 1970s-1980s the artist turned to coloured backgrounds. It seems that colour itself creates the effect of colour-bearing space. There are no professional secrets in her arsenal: she paints on <b>Whatman</b> <b>paper</b> with factory-manufactured brushes and uses gouache and water colours. She prefers gouache which gives a bright and thick decorative base with graphic contours. Apart from searches in colour scheme, the artist strives to achieve expressive outlines and an effective rhythmical arrangement. Another salient feature of Prymachenko's art is a keen sense of composition, which is especially evident in her choice of format. Horizontal formats are most suitable for topical and multifigured compositions depicting subsequent scenes of the narration, while the vertical format is used for representative decorative compositions.|$|E

The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805.Boydell was responsible for the [...] "splendor", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the [...] "correctness of text". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was [...] "at first an ardent advocate of the plan" [...] but [...] "soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition: The thirty-six plays, printed from the texts of Reed and Malone, divide into the following three groups: (1) five plays of the first three numbers printed from Reed's edition of 1785 with many changes adopted from the Malone text of 1790 (2) King Lear and the six plays of the next three numbers printed from Malone's edition of 1790 but exhibiting conspicuous deviations from his basic text (3) twenty-four plays of the last twelve numbers also printed from Malone's text but made to conform to Steevens's own edition of 1793. Throughout the edition, modern (i.e. 18th-century) spelling was preferred as were First Folio readings.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} the effect of lignosulfonate (LS) on enzymatic saccharification of lignocelluloses. Two commercial LSs and one laboratory sulfonated kraft lignin were applied to <b>Whatman</b> <b>paper,</b> dilute acid and SPORL (sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocelluloses) pretreated aspen, and kraft alkaline and SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine. All three lignin samples inhibited cellulose saccharification of <b>Whatman</b> <b>paper,</b> but enhanced the saccharification of the four lignocellulosic substrates. The level of enhancement was related to the molecular weight and degree of sulfonation of the lignin as well as the substrate lignin structure. When different molecular weight (MW) fractions of one commercial LS (SXP), generated from sulfite pulping of hardwood, were applied to the <b>Whatman</b> <b>paper,</b> the large MW fraction (SXP 1) with the lowest degree of sulfonation inhibited cellulose saccharification while the intermediate (SXP 2) and smallest (SXP 3) MW fractions enhanced saccharification. All MW fractions enhanced saccharification of the four lignocellulosic substrates with maximal enhancement by the smallest MW fraction, SXP 3. The enhancement was most significant for the kraft lodgepole pine substrate and least significant for the SPORL pretreated lodgepole pine using all three LS and SXP fractions. The results suggest that LS acts as a surfactant to enhance pure cellullose saccharification. When LS is applied to lignocelluloses, it acts as a surfactant to block bound lignin from binding cellulase nonproductively leading to enhanced saccharification. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose has been identified as one o...|$|E

40|$|Background: Diagnosis of {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis (CL) is often made based on clinical manifesta-tion. Correct diagnosis and {{identification of the}} parasite are crucial for choosing the effective treat-ment and for epidemiological studies. On the other hand, determination of Leishmania species is nec-essary for designing appropriate control programs. Diagnosis by PCR is becoming a 'gold standard'. For PCR preparation, storage and shipments of specimens are necessary. In this study, Whatman filter paper (FTA Card) was used to store and transfer samples for Leishmania identification using PCR. Methods: Among the patients who had CL lesion and referred to Parasitology Laboratory of Emam Reza Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, 44 consented cases with positive results in their direct smear were se-lected. An informed consent form and a questionnaire were completed and three different types of samples (direct smear, NNN culture, and spot on FTA card) were collected. DNA extraction and PCR were carried out on three different samples from each patient.
