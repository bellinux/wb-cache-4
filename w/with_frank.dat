40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mobile receiving performance based on measured DVB-T signals. During mobile reception, the OFDM system suffers ICI because of time-varying channel. In this paper, the ICI effect is reduced in time domain utilizing the ISI-free region by using receiver windowing method <b>with</b> <b>Franks</b> window coefficients. The partial ensemble correlation symbol timing synchronization algorithm is applied here for its smaller timing estimation error and also estimates the ISI-free region. A time domain channel estimation method, frequency-domain pilot time-domain correlation (FPTC), {{is applied to}} estimate channel impulse response. The results show that using FPTC channel estimation method <b>with</b> <b>Franks</b> windowing method improves the mobile receiving performance. The performance improvement is verified through the demodulated constellation...|$|R
