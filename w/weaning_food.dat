40|$|Nutrition {{in infancy}} - Clinical studies on dietary intake, {{metabolism}} and growth Our aims were {{to try to}} determine an appropriate formula protein concentration to be used {{during the second half}} of infancy and to evaluate the effects on plasma lipids when breast milk was exchanged for formula and/or <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Both aspects were studied with special regard to the influence of traditional <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Nutrient intake, protein and fat metabolism, and growth were studied from 3 to 12 months in Swedish and Italian infants. Breast milk was gradually exchanged for formula with the same fat but different protein concentrations (13, 15 or 18 / 20 g/l) and given together with Swedish or Mediterranean <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Swedish infants given the lowest protein (13 g/l) formula had lower total dietary intake of protein and indices of protein metabolism more similar to those of breast-fed infants in mid-infancy compared with infants assigned to higher protein (15 - 18 g/l) formulas. Sufficient amounts of protein was provided to Swedish and Italian infants, since serum proteins and growth were normal in both populations. However, plasma concentrations of some essential amino acids were lower in Italian infants fed low-protein formula, despite higher protein intake. This may indicate that dietary protein from Italian <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> was less available in mid-infancy compared with protein from Swedish <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Dietary intake of protein was found to be associated with plasma levels of insulin-releasing amino acids, with renal excretion of C-peptide from insulin synthesis and also with growth. High dietary supply of protein may probably increase growth by promoting insulin release during infancy. Swedish breast-fed infants had higher plasma cholesterol than those fed formula, possibly since breast milk provides much saturated fat, more cholesterol and less unsaturated fat than formula. These differences decreased {{during the second half of}} infancy, when more <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> were provided. Moreover, residual effects of breast milk on the plasma lipid profile were lost soon after the termination of breast-feeding. Plasma lipids were lower in Italian infants at 6 and 12 months of age, partly since Italian <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> – and possibly also breast milk – differed in lipid composition from Swedish ones. Higher protein and lower fat and energy contents of Italian compared with Swedish <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> may explain why Italian infants were given excessive protein but less fat and energy in late infancy. In conclusion, protein needs during mid- and late infancy seem to be better met by lower (13 g/l) than by higher (18 g/l) protein-containing formula when combined with high-quality <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> Plasma lipids respond to changes in dietary intake from breast milk to formula and <b>weaning</b> <b>foods,</b> and differ between the Swedish and Italian infant populations in mid- and late infancy, which may partly be due to differences in fat composition of their <b>weaning</b> <b>foods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{usefulness}} of <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> {{to meet the}} nutrient needs of children is well recognized, {{and most of them}} are precooked roller dried mixtures of cereal and/or legume flours which posses a high viscosity and bulk when reconstituted. The objective of this study was to formulate composite <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> using cereals, malted legumes and vegetable powders and analyze them for nutrients, functional properties and sensory attributes. Selected legumes (green gram and lentil) were germinated, dried and dehulled. Roasted wheat, rice, carrot powder and skim milk powder also were used. All the ingredients were mixed in different proportions to get four formulations, made into 30 % slurry and dried in roller drier. The products were analyzed for proximate principles, mineral content, functional and sensory qualities. The results of analysis showed following range of constituents per 100 g of formulations on dry weight basis, protein, 18. 1 - 18. 9 g; fat, 0. 78 - 1. 36 g; iron, 5. 09 - 6. 53 mg; calcium, 265 - 310 mg.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} inter-relationships {{between the}} feeding, health, {{and growth of}} infants (aged 0 - 24 months) in low-income households in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Mixed-longitudinal {{data were collected from}} a sample of 113 infants and their mothers in Kebele 11, Keftegna 24 from November 1987 to April 1988. Breastfeeding is the culturally esteemed mode of infant feeding. The culture-specific concept of weaning places the emphasis on the termination of breastfeeding, with little consideration of {{the quality and quantity of}} <b>weaning</b> <b>foods.</b> As a result, <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> are basic and monotonous. Survival data analysis shows that weaning is commenced at the mean age of 9. 2 months, and completed at the median age of 20 months. A probabilistic model is proposed that includes a set of inter-related 'infant-centred', 'mother-centred', and other factors such as the seasonal availability of <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> influencing the process of weaning. Culturally-prescribed norms appear to play little or no part in the timing of weaning, in particular, the infant's age is of secondary importance. Direct observations of suckling behaviour and infant care reveal that 'on demand' breastfeeding was practised, and the mean duration of suckling sessions was 10. 96 minutes. The duration of breastfeeding was influenced significantly by maternal body-mass index. Seasonal patterns were detected in the prevalence of fever, coughing, and vomiting in the infants. Associations between morbidity and other data using log-linear models suggest that infant's diarrhoea is closely linked to the level of household hygiene, maternal education, and mother's morale. Infant's ilnesses caused appreciable deficits in weight, but not in stature. Processes of 'catch-up' and 'catch-down' growth are demonstrated by the seasonal effect of diarrhoeal illness on weight. Avenues for further research and policy reform suggested by the findings of this study are discussed. </p...|$|R

(2) "Flake food", which was used in order to save time in cooking porridge, was very suitable as a <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> in the early period, and later it could be favorably replaced by soft boiled-rice, supplying enough calorie and ample protein. As the flake food Was best ingested in the 5 th experiment, it was revealed that its density should be 15 % at the beginning and less than 30 % in the later period and its quantity should be as follows: 6 months old (50 - 90 gr.) 7 months old (100 - 150 gr.) 8 months old (200 gr.) 9 months old (200 gr.) 10 months old (150 gr.) (3) Though "Milk Food" is better than home-made "Instant Food" in the respect of ingestion by infants; but the former is regrettbly more expensive, and the latter should be improved on the point of taste. In addition "Oatmeal" is also considered to be quite excellent as a kind of <b>weaning</b> <b>food.</b> (4) By using "Flake Food" as a short-period <b>weaning</b> <b>food,</b> those infants who were delayed in weaning could be easily made to complete weaning in 3 - 4 months and at the completion period the amount of calorie and protein ingested by the infants was nearly ideal...|$|E
40|$|Five million {{children}} aged {{less than five}} years die annually due to diarrhoea. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify some possible contributing factors for persistent diarrhoea. Seven weaning foods, including a locally-made food, were evaluated by estimating the microbial load using the most probable number method and aflatoxin levels (AFM 1, AFG 1, AFG 2, and AFB 2) by immunoaffinity column extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with detection of fluorescence. The results showed that the locally-made <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> had the highest microbial count (2, 000 cfu/g) and faecal streptococcal count (25 cfu/g). Moulds isolated were mainly Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. glaucus, Cladosporium sp., and Penicillium sp. The home-made <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> recorded the highest fungal count (6, 500 cfu/g). AFM 1 of the weaning foods was 4. 6 - 530 ng/mL. One <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> had AFB 1 level of 4, 806 ng/g. Aflatoxin metabolites, apart from AFM 1 and AFB 1 present in the weaning foods, were AFG 1 and AFG 2. There were low microbial counts in commercial weaning foods but had high levels of aflatoxins (AFM 1, AFG 1, AFG 2, AFB 1, and AFB 2). Growth and development of the infant is rapid, and it is, thus, possible that exposure to aflatoxins in weaning foods might have significant health effects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology to design feasible interventions to improve <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> hygiene practices of families living in extreme poverty. Educational messages to promote specific behavioural changes were defined and tested by utilizing {{a combination of}} ethnographic, survey and observational methods, and integrating viewpoints and suggestions of mothers and caretakers into the decision-making process. This new approach culminated in a household trial in which five groups, each of 15 non-practising mothers, were invited to adopt defined behaviours (handwashing before and after defined events, boiling water for reconstituting powdered milk, feeding gruel by spoon rather than bottlefeeding, not storing gruels and milks, and all four together). All initiated the advocated behaviours and most (53 - 80 %) sustained the new behaviours and practised them every time during a one-month period. Of the four advocated behaviours, spoon-feeding {{was the most difficult}} to adopt wholly. The methodology was developed in response to the high priority given to reducing <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> contamination for diarrhoeal disease control, and the lack of any existing methodology for defining appropriate educational interventions in resource-poor regions. This approach, with its combination of qualitative and quantitative methods and community focus, is recommended for future studies to design hygiene and other health education interventions in developing countries. infant feeding <b>weaning</b> <b>food</b> contamination food hygiene health education hygiene interventions...|$|E
40|$|The current {{interest}} {{in the use of}} traditional fermented and malted <b>foods</b> for <b>weaning</b> is their potential to reduce the transmission of bacterial enteric pathogens through contaminated <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> as well as improving the nutritional value of the foods. This study was carried out to investigate the potential use of traditional fermented and malted <b>foods</b> for <b>weaning</b> in rural areas. Information was obtained by interviewing randomly selected 150 rural women with children under five years old. Ninety seven percent of the women had knowledge of some traditional fermented foods. The commonest fermented foods known by the women were mahewu (traditional fermented and malted sour, non-alcoholic cereal gruel), sour milk and sour porridge. Most of the women indicated that mahewu (94 %), sour milk (87 %) and sour porridge (71 %) were consumed by all family members. The majority of the women gave the fermented foods to infants from the age of four months. Although most of the infants were introduced to the fermented and malted foods from the age of four months, the foods were not given to infants very often, with the exception of mahewu. The storage period of the fermented foods ranged from one to three days. The results of this study show that mahewu, sour milk and sour porridge have a potential for use as <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> if they are promoted. fermented <b>foods</b> <b>weaning</b> diarrhoea nutrition Zimbabwe...|$|R

This information is used to recommend intervention programmes such as the introduction of improved <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> using local resources, improved sanitation and health care delivery, and implementation of community based health care. These interventions are intended specifically to address identified problems in a feasible and culturally appropriate manner. Ultimately, the solutions to community health problems are not technical, but lie with optimal use of human resources...|$|R
40|$|Soybeans, ripe and unripe banana were dried, milled and {{formulated}} in graded mixtures with maize or sorghum as the food base. The blends were separately fermented at 30 ± 2 Â°C for 72 h. The microbial load and types, pH and proximate {{analyses of the}} fermenting mixtures were investigated. The following bacteria and fungi were isolated during fermentation; Bacillus cereus, Clostridium bifermentans, Corynebacterium sp, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Micrococcus liteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor mucedo, Rhizopus stolonifer and Saccharomyces sp. The bacterial counts ranged between 3. 0 x 10 6 to 10 x 10 6 cfu mL- 1 for blends with maize base and 2. 0 x 10 6 to 24 x 10 6 cfu mL- 1 for blends with sorghum base {{for the period of}} fermentation. Three blend viz; Maize + Unripe banana + Soybean (MUS), Sorghum + Unripe banana + Soybean (SUS) and Sorghum + Ripe Banana (SRB) were found to be adequate in protein (18. 20, 21. 11 and 19. 63 %), fat (14. 60, 7. 76 and 13. 21 %) and ash (3. 87, 2. 33 and 1. 4 %), respectively. These compositions compared favourably with some previously reported studies on <b>weaning</b> <b>foods</b> in Nigeria, such as "soy-ogi" and also with the Protein Advisory Group of United Nations weaning recommendations.
