2500|$|Cantrell is a {{recovering}} addict and alcoholic {{and has been}} sober since 2003. He was awarded the 2012 Stevie Ray Vaughan Award from MusiCares, for his work helping other addicts with the recovery process. Cantrell said in his acceptance speech, [...] "I crash landed here almost 9 years ago, in Los Angeles. Sean [...] was {{at the door with}} my brother, so my choices were open the door and go to rehab or jump out the back window down a cliff into some black berry bushes. That’s the choice I took. Luckily they caught me because I couldn’t go anywhere, I was kind of stuck in a bush {{at the bottom of a}} cliff bleeding, and I ended up here. I didn’t intend to get here but I’m very grateful I am here, and it took a lot of people to help me get here. It's been an amazing day. It's overwhelming. I'm as imperfect as they come. I just don't get high today and wake up the next morning and try and do the same thing. A lot of people stand and get the fuck back up after falling. Some people don't get that chance. My band's been a harsh example of that – what happens when you don't deal with it." [...] Cantrell and his Alice in Chains bandmates played a five-song set at the awards event and Cantrell stated, [...] "We really miss Layne [...] and Mike , and we carry them <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts".|$|E

6000|$|Christianity alone deprives {{old age of}} its bitterness, {{making it}} the gate of heaven. Our bodies will fade and grow weak and shapeless, just when we shall not want them, being ready and in close {{expectation}} of that resurrection of the flesh which is the great promise of Christianity (no miserable fancies about [...] "pure souls" [...] escaped from matter, but)--of bodies, our bodies, beloved, beautiful, ministers to <b>us</b> <b>in</b> all <b>our</b> joys, sufferers <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> all <b>our</b> sorrows--yea, our very own selves raised up again to live and love in a manner inconceivable from its perfection.|$|R

60|$|I {{thought it}} cruel once. It {{was very hard}} of heart, to my mind, I remember. It was an old servant even then; and I felt as though it ought to show some sorrow; as though it wanted sympathy <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> distress, and were a dull, heartless, {{mercenary}} creature. Ah! how soon I learnt to know that in its ceaseless going on, and in its being checked or stayed by nothing, lay its greatest kindness, and the only balm for grief and wounded peace of mind.|$|E
6000|$|Dr McTougall felt as I {{did in the}} matter, and so did {{his friend}} the City man. I had half {{expected}} that Dobson would have laughed at us for what he sometimes styled our softness, because he {{had so much to}} do with sharpers and sharp practice, but I was mistaken. He quite agreed <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> opinion of my little waif, and spoke admiringly of those who sought, through evil and good report, to rescue our [...] "City Arabs" [...] from destruction. And Dobson did more than speak: he gave liberally out of his ample fortune to the good cause.|$|E

Joh describes her teaching philosophy to include “As a teacher, I believe that transformative praxis begins <b>with</b> each of <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> everyday lives. Theological reflection is crucial because the meaning of our lives is often understood through the prism of religious experience. Therefore, theological reflection must be bold and imaginative as well as grounded in the material reality of history of peoples’ lives.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Abbotsford,] April 19.--Returned {{last night}} {{from the house}} of death and {{mourning}} to my own, now the habitation of sickness and anxious apprehension. Found Lady S. had tried the foxglove in quantity, till it made her so sick {{she was forced to}} desist. The result cannot yet be judged. Wrote to Mrs. Thomas Scott to beg her to let her daughter Anne, an uncommonly, sensible, steady, and sweet-tempered girl, come and stay <b>with</b> <b>us</b> a season <b>in</b> <b>our</b> distress, who I trust will come forthwith.|$|R
50|$|Any {{positive}} integer can {{be written}} as 9×n + a, where 'a' is a single digit from 0 to 8, and 'n' is any positive integer.Thus, using the distributive rule, (9×n + a)×(9×m + b)= 9×9×n×m + 9(am + bn) + ab. Since the first two factors are multiplied by 9, their sums will end up being 9 or 0, leaving <b>us</b> <b>with</b> 'ab'. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> example, 'a' was 7 and 'b' was 5. We would expect that in any base system, the number before that base would behave just like the nine.|$|R
60|$|To {{avoid these}} {{and the like}} absurdities, nothing can be of greater use than to {{establish}} in our minds determined ideas of the things under consideration. If the ideas of liberty and volition were well fixed in our understandings, and carried along <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> minds, as they ought, through all the questions that are raised about them, I suppose {{a great part of}} the difficulties that perplex men's thoughts, and entangle their understandings, would be much easier resolved; and we should perceive where the confused signification of terms, or where the nature of the thing caused the obscurity.|$|E
60|$|There {{are some}} {{situations}} in life so unexpected, so trying, that, {{as far as}} concerns our opinion of those subjected to them, we agree, as it were, not to count them; we refuse to allow the victim's behaviour in circumstances so exacting to weigh <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> estimate {{of his or her}} character. We permit the great general, confronted suddenly with a mad bull, to turn and run, without forfeiting his reputation for courage. The bishop who, stepping on a concealed slide in winter, entertains passers-by with momentary rag-time steps, loses none of his dignity once the performance is concluded.|$|E

"But, perhaps," [...] said Elizabeth, [...] "you do {{not join}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> opinion of her beauty; and indeed {{we have known}} men prefer a statelier and more Juno-like form to that {{drooping}} fragile one that hung its head like a broken lily. Ay, men are tyrants, my lord, who esteem the animation of the strife above the triumph of an unresisting conquest, and, like sturdy champions, love best those women who can wage contest with them.--I could think with you, Rutland, that give my Lord of Leicester such a piece of painted wax for a bride, he would have wished her dead ere {{the end of the}} honeymoon." ...|$|E

Today you can find out about Calixto García's son's {{surviving}} granddaughters, Kathleen Garcia and Kareena Piki. When we interviewed them they said 'I still remember the stories my grandfather would say about his father'. I can remember it like it was yesterday' she said. Although many people know her they have never known how much history is in her Cuban family. One of the interviews was very sentimental to her, she said with a low tone of voice 'though my great-grandfather is not <b>with</b> <b>us</b> he will be <b>with</b> <b>us</b> but <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts forever no matter what'! {{and that was the last}} we heard of her when she then left our stage very sentimental and we never saw her again, except her friends but they don't know the history that lives on in her family.|$|R

I do therefore invite my fellow citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next, as a day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the Heavens.|$|R
6000|$|... § LIX. There is, perhaps, {{nothing more}} notable {{in this most}} {{interesting}} system than the profound truth couched under the attachment of so terrible a penalty to sadness or sorrow. It is true that Idleness does not elsewhere appear in the scheme, and is evidently intended {{to be included in}} the guilt of sadness by the word [...] "accidioso;" [...] but the main meaning of the poet is to mark the duty of rejoicing in God, according both to St. Paul's command, and Isaiah's promise, [...] "Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness."[147] I do not know words that might with more benefit be borne <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> and set <b>in</b> <b>our</b> hearts momentarily against the minor regrets and rebelliousnesses of life, than these simple ones: ...|$|R
60|$|For {{it is the}} Spirit of the Lord immediately, {{or through}} the {{ministry}} of his servants, that teacheth his people to profit; and to be sure, {{so far as we}} take him along <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> services, so far we are profitable, and no further. For if it be the Lord that must work all things in us for our salvation, much more is it the Lord that must work in us for the conversion of others. If therefore it was once a cross to us to speak, though the Lord required it at our hands, let it never be so to be silent, when he does not.|$|E
60|$|Upstairs, {{the quality}} has paid its visits and shaken hands: the Syndaco and the well-to-do half-Austrian {{owners of the}} woodyard, the Bertolini, have ostentatiously shown their mutual friendship; our padrone, the Signer Pietro Di Paoli, has visited his {{relatives}} the Graziani in the box next the stage and has spent two intervals <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> box; meanwhile, his two peasants standing down below, pathetic, thin contadini of the old school, like worn stones, have looked up at us {{as if we are}} the angels in heaven, with a reverential, devotional eye, they themselves far away below, standing in the bay at the back, below all.|$|E
60|$|Indeed I {{was glad}} to see the last of those Easterns {{although}} they had brought us safely and treated us well, for all the while I was never sure but that they had some orders to lead us into a trap, or perhaps to make away <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sleep and take back the gold and the priceless, rose-hued pearls, any two of which were worth it all. But such was not their command nor did they dare to steal them on their own account, since then, even if they escaped the vengeance of the King, their wives and all their families would have paid the price.|$|E
60|$|And so {{with the}} last body that floated away down the current of the Tana ended the {{incident}} of our attack on the Masai camp. The spears and shields and other arms we took up to the Mission, where they filled an outhouse. One incident, however, I must not forget to mention. As we were returning from performing the obsequies of our Masai friends we passed the hollow tree where Alphonse had secreted himself in the morning. It so happened that the little man himself was <b>with</b> <b>us</b> assisting <b>in</b> <b>our</b> unpleasant task with a far better will than he had shown where live Masai were concerned. Indeed, for each body that he handled he found an appropriate sarcasm. Alphonse throwing Masai into the Tana {{was a very different}} creature from Alphonse flying for dear life from the spear of a live Masai. He was quite merry and gay, he clapped his hands and warbled snatches of French songs as the grim dead warriors went 'splash' into the running waters to carry a message of death and defiance to their kindred a hundred miles below. In short, thinking that he wanted taking down a peg, I suggested holding a court-martial on him for his conduct in the morning.|$|R
60|$|I had not, indeed I had not, spoke {{a word to}} this {{question}} in this manner, had not Mr. K. sent his paper abroad, and amongst us, for the encouraging this practice <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>in</b> opposition to <b>our</b> peace. I do not say he designed our breach, but his arguments tended thereto; and had not our people been of a wise and quiet temper, his paper might have set us into a flame. But thanks be to God, we are at quiet, and walk in love, notwithstanding the LIFTS that have been to make us do otherwise. There are also the mouths of some opened against me for this, who lie at wait for occasions, and shew that they are glad to take them before they are given by me: to whom I now shew by this ensuing discourse, that I had a reason to do what I did.|$|R
6000|$|Japan {{says that}} she is now civilised. That is {{the crux of the}} whole matter so far as I {{understand}} it. [...] "Let <b>us</b> have done <b>with</b> the idiotic system of treaty-ports and passports for the foreigner who steps beyond them," [...] says Japan in effect. [...] "Give us our place among the civilised nations of the earth, come among <b>us,</b> trade <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> hold land <b>in</b> <b>our</b> midst. Only be subject to our jurisdiction and submit to our--tariffs." [...] Now since {{one or two of the}} foreign nations have won special tariffs for their goods in the usual way, they are not over-anxious to become just ordinary folk. The effect of accepting Japan's views would be excellent for the individual who wanted to go up-country and make his money, but bad for the nation. For <b>Our</b> nation <b>in</b> particular.|$|R
