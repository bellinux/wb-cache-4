5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with heat or acid. Noted examples at the time included albumin from egg whites, blood serum albumin, fibrin, and <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> products containing rice protein {{have also been}} contaminated with melamine. Natural Balance Pet Foods recalled two products on 16 April due to kidney damage associated with melamine contamination despite the products not containing <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b> Melamine has also been implicated in corn gluten in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|The broad {{pet food}} recalls {{starting}} in March 2007 came {{in response to}} reports of renal failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> from a single Chinese company beginning in February 2007. Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods {{with most of the}} recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of melamine in the <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{usefulness}} of <b>wheat</b> <b>glutens,</b> genetic studies have largely focused on wheat genetics. Wheat has three genomes (AABBDD) and it can encode for many variations of the same protein, even in the gliadin subcategories many types of gliadin per cultivar, X = genome (A, B, or D genome chromosomes (1 to 7)). The A and B genomes are derived from wild emmers wheat {{which in turn is}} a natural digenomic species that contains a Triticum monococcum- and Aegilops speltoides-like genome. The D genome is derived from the extant species Aegilops tauschii strangulatum.|$|R
25|$|In {{manufacturing}} <b>wheat</b> products, <b>gluten</b> {{is valuable}} to impart viscoelastic functional qualities in dough, enabling {{the preparation of}} diverse processed foods such as breads, noodles, and pasta that facilitate wheat consumption.|$|R

25|$|Overall, {{several major}} {{companies}} have recalled more than 5300 pet food products, {{with most of}} the recalls coming from Menu Foods. The contamination was caused by melamine in the affected foods. The Chinese company behind the contaminated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> has initially denied any involvement in the contamination, but is cooperating with Chinese and American investigators.|$|E
25|$|Many nonprofit pet shelters rely on donated {{foods to}} feed the animals and remain financially stable, but due to the wide use of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> and other {{contaminated}} ingredients in many wet pet foods and the large portion of foods represented in the recall, many pet shelters have had to discard foods despite the financial burden of doing so.|$|E
25|$|Menu Foods: Over 50 {{brands of}} dog food, and over 40 brands of cat food. Almost {{all of the}} foods are wet foods, {{specifically}} the 'cuts and gravy' varieties. As a precautionary measure, Menu Foods also recalled all brands of food with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> in them even though {{the source of the}} gluten was {{not the same as the}} source behind the contaminated findings.|$|E
50|$|Gliadin (a type of prolamin) is a {{class of}} {{proteins}} present in wheat and several other cereals within the grass genus Triticum. Gliadins, which are a component of gluten, are essential for giving bread the ability to rise properly during baking. Gliadins and glutenins are the two main components of the gluten fraction of the <b>wheat</b> seed. This <b>gluten</b> is found in products such as <b>wheat</b> flour. <b>Gluten</b> is split about evenly between the gliadins and glutenins, although there are variations found in different sources.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its wheat-based products, the rice-based Cream of Rice is also produced {{as part of the}} product line, and is often a recommended early food for infants and toddlers and for people who cannot tolerate <b>wheat</b> or <b>gluten,</b> such as persons with celiac sprue disease.|$|R
50|$|In 1928, the National Research Council {{created the}} Division of Biology and Agriculture. Initially {{working at the}} University of Alberta the Division moved into the new {{laboratory}} in Ottawa in 1932 and studied the biochemistry of <b>wheat</b> rust, <b>gluten</b> proteins and mutation in cereals among other things.|$|R
25|$|Wheat {{is often}} a cryptic {{contaminant}} of many foods; more obvious items are bread crumbs, maltodextrin, bran, cereal extract, couscous, cracker meal, enriched flour, gluten, high-gluten flour, high-protein flour, seitan, semolina wheat, vital gluten, wheat bran, wheat germ, <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> wheat malt, wheat starch or whole wheat flour. Less obvious sources of wheat could be gelatinized starch, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, modified food starch, modified starch, natural flavoring, soy sauce, soy bean paste, hoisin sauce, starch, vegetable gum, specifically Beta-glucan, vegetable starch.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{pet food}} recalls {{comprise}} the contamination and wide recall of many brands of {{cat and dog}} foods beginning in March 2007, and the ensuing developments involving the human food supply. The recalls in North America, Europe, and South Africa came in response to reports of renal failure in pets. Initially, the recalls {{were associated with the}} consumption of mostly wet pet foods made with <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> from a single Chinese company. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on 16 March 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure. In the following weeks, several other companies who received the contaminated <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. One month after the initial recall, contaminated rice protein from a different source in China was also identified as being associated with kidney failure in pets in the United States, while contaminated corn gluten was associated with kidney failure with pets in South Africa. As a result of investigating the 2007 pet food recalls, a broader Chinese protein export contamination investigation unfolded, raising concerns about the safety of the human food supply.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a {{pet food}} recall was {{initiated}} by Menu Foods and other pet food manufacturers who had found their products had been contaminated and caused serious illnesses or deaths {{in some of}} the animals that had eaten them. In March 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration reported finding white granular melamine in the pet food, in samples of white granular <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten</b> imported from a single source in China, Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology as well as in crystalline form in the kidneys and in urine of affected animals. Further vegetable protein imported from China was later implicated.|$|E

25|$|Respiratory allergies are an {{occupational}} disease that develop in food service workers. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat; some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens. A later study showed that baker's allergy extend over {{a broad range of}} cereal grasses (wheat, durum wheat, triticale, cereal rye, barley, rye grass, oats, canary grass, rice, maize, sorghum and Johnson grass) though the greatest similarities were seen between wheat and rye, and that these allergies show cross reactivity between seed proteins and pollen proteins, including a prominent crossreactivity between the common environment rye pollen and <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten.</b>|$|E
25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
25|$|Reports of {{widespread}} and possibly intentional adulteration of Chinese animal feed with melamine {{have raised the}} issue of melamine contamination in the human food supply, both in China and abroad. On 27 April, the U.S. FDA subjected all vegetable proteins imported from China, intended for human or animal consumption, to detention without physical examination, including: <b>wheat</b> <b>gluten,</b> rice gluten, rice protein, rice protein concentrate, corn gluten, corn gluten meal, corn byproducts, soy protein, soy gluten, proteins (includes amino acids and protein hydrosylates), and mung bean protein. In a teleconference with reporters on 1 May, officials from the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture said between 2.5 and 3 million people in the United States had consumed chickens that had consumed feed containing contaminated vegetable protein from China.|$|E
