5|$|Boggs is {{led to his}} {{execution}} and sees that Scully has not attended. Scully visits Mulder in hospital, where he is recovering from his gunshot wound. She has come to believe Mulder's assertion that Boggs arranged everything. Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs. She tells him {{that she did not}} need to hear anything, because she already knew what her father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{you could}} have seen as I did the passionate enthusiasm of the whole town of Irkutsk, the capital of Eastern Siberia, at the news of your triumphal march across the {{possession}} of the mad king of Naples, you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> as I did {{that there is no}} longer space or frontiers.|$|E
25|$|The 12th century Icelandic Gray Goose Laws {{state that}} Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, and Danes spoke the same language, dǫnsk tunga ("Danish tongue"; {{speakers}} of Old East Norse <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> dansk tunga). Another term used, used especially commonly {{with reference to}} West Norse, was norrǿnt mál ("Nordic/Northern speech"). Today Old Norse has developed into the modern North Germanic languages Icelandic, Faroese, Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish, of which Norwegian, Danish and Swedish retain considerable mutual intelligibility.|$|E

25|$|Mother {{is picked}} up by Rufus, Knight's pilot, and goes to help Knight while Schofield is {{captured}} by the French and brought to an aircraft carrier {{to explain to him}} why he is to be terminated. At Killian's castle, Gant is brutally murdered on a guillotine. However, Knight escapes, Gant's final words being for Knight to tell Schofield she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> yes to his planned proposal. Rufus, Mother, and Knight go to rescue Schofield.|$|E
25|$|This {{new number}} {{was based on}} {{information}} obtained from two imprisoned Kiowa chiefs at Fort Cobb who faced death by hanging. In view of their predicament, {{it seems likely that}} these men <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> anything to avoid the gallows. But such skepticism is not warranted {{in the case of the}} Washita prisoners. The Cheyenne women were allowed to mingle freely with the officers and knew many of them on an intimate basis. They were assured good treatment and had no apparent reason to distort their statements about dead kinsmen.|$|E
25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on their bed and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting what he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|Bouillé only {{managed to}} summon seven {{witnesses}} – Guillaume Manchon, Isambart de la Pierre, Martin Ladvenu, Guillaume Duval, Jean Toutmouillé, Jean Massieu, and Jean Beaupere – when his inquiry was suddenly broken off in March 1450. He {{had not even}} managed to review the dossiers and minutes of the trial of condemnation. Of the seven witnesses, most denounced the English for their desire for revenge against Joan, and their attempt to dishonor Charles VII's title by associating him with a finding of heresy against Joan. Only one was hostile against Joan – Jean Beaupere, the Canon of Rouen. Interviewed by Bouillé, he refused {{to answer questions about}} the procedure at the trial of condemnation. He stated that Joan was a fraud, believing that if Joan ‘had wise and frank teachers, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> many things serving to justify her, and withheld many which led to her condemnation.’ His testimony {{was not included in the}} report which Bouillé wrote up for Charles written later that year after Charles had closed down the inquiry. Circumstances had changed – the war against the retreating English was still occupying much of his attention, and there was trouble brewing with the Papacy over the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges. Charles could afford to wait, but Bouillé made it clear that it was in the king's interest to clear up the matter once and for all.|$|E

500|$|Latter Days {{was written}} and {{directed}} by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay, Sweet Home Alabama, gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story. Cox based both characters– Christian and Aaron– on himself. He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay, and had wondered what the two halves of himself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to each other if they had ever met.|$|E

500|$|Moreau and Jourdan faced similar difficulties. Jourdan {{continued}} in his single-minded pursuit of Wartensleben, and Moreau continued his single-minded pursuit of Charles, and Moreau in particular penetrated deep into Bavaria. The French armies drew {{further and further}} away from the Rhine, and from each other. Napoleon later wrote of Moreau's actions, [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> that he was ignorant that a French army existed on his left". Historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge asserted that the combined army [...] "could have crushed the Austrians".|$|E
500|$|Ono {{was pleased}} that Jackson had {{acquired}} Northern Songs and called it a [...] "blessing". Speaking in November 1990, Ono stated, [...] "Businessmen who aren't artists themselves wouldn't have the consideration Michael has. He loves the songs. He's very caring." [...] She added that if she and McCartney were to own the songs, there would certainly be arguments. Ono explained that neither she nor McCartney needed that. [...] "If Paul got the songs, people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'Paul finally got John.' And if I got them, they'd say, 'Oh, the dragon lady strikes again.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "It {{would have}} killed me to come back. The show went from art to mediocrity. I'm {{relieved}} that they've freed me legally. I didn't {{want to go back}} to another six months of indecision and hurt. I'm shocked that the other actors re-signed. ... The brilliance of the show under Levinson was lost this season. It's like watching the sinking of the Titanic. The problem is that the iceberg is the guys who built the ship [...] the producers. You can never trust producers. They <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to van Gogh: 'Nice painting. A little lighter on the colors and we can sell it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Max Weinberg 7 {{released}} a self-titled album in 2000 on Hip-O Records; Weinberg said {{he waited until}} then because [...] "I wanted to change my style of playing and hone my style before I committed to a record." [...] He was especially proud that the band had successfully backed Tony Bennett during a late 1990s appearance on Late Night: [...] "Two years ago if you'd asked me if I could play with Tony Bennett, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> absolutely not. I'm not in his league. But we played with him the other night, and it was wonderful. We swung." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{exclusive}} written interview with The Westmorland Gazette nine months into his sentence, Park talked {{of how he}} had struggled with prison, saying: [...] "They [...] may smoke incessantly, play loud music, the TV or video games, rifle your drawers, steal, lie etc. There {{is not a lot}} you can do about it... I watched a guy [...] "chasing the dragon". It frightened me to death. I had never seen that before." [...] He refused to answer detailed questions about the trial or case, but protested his innocence, saying [...] "If I knew who killed my wife, how, where, why, then I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so. I did not know then. I do not know now." ...|$|E
500|$|After he had cut Blakelock, Hill said, Silcott {{told him}} he was cool and asked what he had seen. Hill said he replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] and that Silcott said, [...] "Well, you can go." [...] He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick. In 1991, he told Rose that, {{throughout}} the interview, the police were saying, [...] "Go on, admit it, you had a stab," [...] and [...] "It was Sticks, wasn't it?" [...] He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again. [...] "They could have told me it was Prince Charles and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it was him." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{when we have}} {{realised}} {{all this}} there is something more to be said in connection with Lord Rosebery's vision. What <b>would</b> King Alfred <b>have</b> <b>said</b> if he <b>had</b> been asked to expend the money which he devoted {{to the health and}} education of his people upon a struggle with some race of Visigoths or Parthians inhabiting a small section of a distant continent? What <b>would</b> he <b>have</b> <b>said</b> if he <b>had</b> known that that science of letters which he taught to England would eventually be used not to spread truth, but to drug the people with political assurances as imbecile in themselves as the assurance that fire does not burn and water does not drown? What <b>would</b> he <b>have</b> <b>said</b> if the same people who, in obedience to that ideal of service and sanity of which he was the example, had borne every privation in order to defeat Napoleon, should come at last to find no better compliment to one of their heroes than to call him the Napoleon of South Africa? What <b>would</b> he <b>have</b> <b>said</b> if that nation for which he had inaugurated a long line of incomparable men of principle should forget all its traditions and coquette with the immoral mysticism of the man of destiny? ...|$|R

500|$|Many of {{the themes}} and musical styles of the album were {{inspired}} by Beyoncé's role in Dreamgirls. The plot of the film revolves around The Dreams, a fictional 1960s group of three female singers who attempt success in the mainstream music industry {{with the help of}} their manager, Curtis Taylor. Beyoncé portrays Deena Jones, the lead singer of the group and the wife of Taylor, and is emotionally abused by him. Because of her role, Beyoncé was inspired to produce an album with an overriding theme of feminism and female empowerment. In the bonus track, [...] "Encore for the Fans", Beyoncé says, [...] "Because I was so inspired by Deena, I wrote songs that were saying all the things I wish she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in the film." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mom and Pop Art" [...] {{features}} American contemporary artist Jasper Johns as himself. His {{lines were}} recorded over the telephone, and Jean {{stated that it}} was [...] "extremely exciting" [...] to have him appear in the episode. The episode also features Italian actress Isabella Rossellini as Astrid. Jean stated that her performance was [...] "terrific" [...] {{and that she was}} [...] "wonderful to work with", although there was one line in particular that she had difficulty performing. In a scene in the episode, Astrid introduces the audience in an art club to Homer's art. Originally, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "you snorted my father's ashes", but because of Rossellini's accent, it sounded like she said [...] "you snorted my father's ass", according to Jean. Because none of the recorded takes sounded good, the line was ultimately scrapped from the episode.|$|E
500|$|John Kerr as Francis Barnard. [...] The Tony Award-winning actor (for Tea and Sympathy (1955)) {{had been}} a once-promising leading man in the 1950s, {{featured}} in major roles in the theatrical film versions of Tea and Sympathy (1956) and Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific (1958). His role as the nominal hero in Pit {{would prove to be}} the last notable film appearance of his career. [...] Years later, Kerr expressed surprise that Pit seemed to be his best remembered role, [...] "If you had told me years ago that Pit and the Pendulum would be The One out of all the stuff I've done, if you had told me that this would be the cult-type movie that people would be collecting memorabilia on, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> 'You're out of your gourd.'
