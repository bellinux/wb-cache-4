25|$|New Keynesian {{economist}} and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that MMT {{goes too far}} in its support for government budget deficits and ignores the inflationary implications of maintaining budget deficits <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> growing.|$|E
25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: {{to keep people}} fully employed, governments have to run deficits <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis {{to pick up the}} slack by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the largest}} banks, brokerages, and {{insurance}} companies desired the Act at the time. The justification was that individuals usually put more money into investments <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> doing well, but they put most of their money into savings accounts when the economy turns bad. With the new Act, {{they would be able}} to do both 'savings' and 'investment' at the same financial institution, which would be able to do well in both good and bad economic times.|$|E
50|$|Note: Numbers for {{the year}} 2006 are pro forma to be a reference, an example, to compare (neighboring) regions and changes in {{population}} numbers <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> expanding, growing as opposed to when it was contracting.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s {{problems}} {{had appeared}} in the health system. The high growth rate in hospital expenditure was occurring at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> slowing down. Thus, the government was unable to sustain funding this growth.|$|R
5000|$|Graduating {{in a bad}} {{economy has}} {{long-lasting}} economic consequences. For the next 10 to 15 years, those in the Class of 2013 will likely earn less than if they had graduated <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>were</b> at its potential.|$|R
2500|$|It {{is claimed}} that conditionalities retard social {{stability}} and hence inhibit the stated {{goals of the}} IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programs {{lead to an increase}} in poverty in recipient countries. The IMF sometimes advocates [...] "austerity programmes", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF [...] "was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community".|$|E
5000|$|Movement back to {{the steady}} state is fastest <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> furthest from its steady state.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, a {{structural}} surplus is <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally operating at a surplus {{regardless of its}} point in the business cycle.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the theory}} was proven wrong when many {{businesses}} collapsed during the crisis. Since they were linked through debt guarantees, {{many of the}} companies fell in a chain reaction. The focus on capacity expansion created debt that <b>was</b> manageable <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> growing. However, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> stalled, debt-to-equity ratios became a huge problem.|$|R
50|$|Critics now {{say that}} TANF was {{successful}} during <b>the</b> Clinton Administration <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> booming, but failed to support <b>the</b> poor <b>when</b> jobs were no longer available during the downturn, particularly the Financial crisis of 2007-2010, and particularly after the lifetime limits imposed by TANF may have been reached by many recipients.|$|R
5000|$|Construction of the Epic Center {{began in}} 1987. It officially opened for {{business}} in 1989. Created as a lure for businesses to the downtown area, the Epic Center {{helped create a}} [...] "big city" [...] feel for Wichita at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> fluctuating. <b>The</b> building has 22 stories above ground level.|$|R
50|$|However, Lucas' {{conclusion}} is controversial. In particular, Keynesian economists typically argue that business cycles {{should not be}} understood as fluctuations above and below a trend. Instead, they argue that booms are times <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> near its potential output trend, and that recessions are times <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> substantially below trend, {{so that there is}} a large output gap. Under this viewpoint, the welfare cost of business cycles is larger, because an economy with cycles not only suffers more variable consumption, but also lower consumption on average.|$|E
50|$|Countercyclical indicators: {{move in the}} {{opposite}} direction to the general economy. The unemployment rate and the wage share are countercyclic: in the short run they rise <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> deteriorating.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} the economy can have a {{considerable}} effect on the demand for natural gas in the short term. This is particularly true for industrial {{and to a lesser extent}} the commercial customers. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> booming, output from the industrial sectors generally increases. On the other hand, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a recession, output from industrial sectors drops. These fluctuations in industrial output accompanying the economy affects the amount of natural gas needed by these industrial users. For instance, during the economic recession of 2001, U.S. natural gas consumption by the industrial sector fell by 6 percent.|$|E
50|$|While {{all agreed}} that an {{expanded}} money supply would inevitably raise prices, at issue was {{whether or not this}} inflationary tendency would be beneficial. The issue peaked from 1893 to 1896, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> wracked by a severe depression — remembered as the Panic of 1893 — characterized by falling prices (deflation), high unemployment in industrial areas, and severe distress for farmers.|$|R
50|$|The impetus {{behind the}} efforts to move the state capital was the need to locate it in {{accordance}} with the economic interests of the state. The first state capital, Vila Boa (today City of Goiás), had <b>been</b> chosen <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> based on gold extraction. Later, when cattle-raising and agriculture came to dominate the state's development, the old capital was considered remote.|$|R

50|$|Procyclical indicators: move in {{the same}} {{direction}} as the general economy: they increase <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> doing well; decrease when it is doing badly. Gross domestic product (GDP) is a procyclic indicator.|$|E
50|$|New Keynesian {{economist}} and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that MMT {{goes too far}} in its support for government budget deficits and ignores the inflationary implications of maintaining budget deficits <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> growing.|$|E
5000|$|John Maynard Keynes {{wrote in}} 1937: [...] "The boom, not the slump, {{is the right}} time for {{austerity}} at the Treasury." [...] In other words, the government should act to stabilize economic conditions, reducing the budget deficit <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> booming (or maintaining a surplus) and increasing the deficit (or reducing the surplus) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> in recession. The only fiscal years since 1970 when the U.S. had a budget surplus were 1998-2001, a combination of the booming 1990's economy and Clinton's higher tax rates. Economic stimulus (increasing the deficit) is done by lowering taxes or increasing spending, while the opposite is done for economic austerity.|$|E

2500|$|According to the National Venture Capital Association, {{in all of}} 2008 {{there have}} been just six {{companies}} that have gone public.

[...] (According to Hoover's IPO Scorecard, however, 31, not six companies went public on the major U.S. stock exchanges in 2008, a year <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> much worse than 2007 (when 209 companies went public) or 2006 (205 IPOs).) ...|$|R
40|$|How do {{advertising}} messages {{differ in}} 2006 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{on its way}} up, as compared to in 2009, just after a recession had been declared? This research focuses on the differences in newspaper advertising sponsored by financial institutions, from banks to investment companies.

5000|$|Elizabeth Woyke of Forbes wrote, [...] "at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> melting and {{one-time}} bankers are on {{the street}} Peek is betting customers will embrace the no-fuss simplicity - {{not to mention the}} modest price - of the Peek." ...|$|E
5000|$|The book {{focuses on}} a near-future imagining {{of members of the}} maker culture, a group Doctorow characterizes as being {{composed}} of [...] "people who hack hardware, business-models, and living arrangements to discover ways of staying alive and happy even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> falling down the toilet".|$|E
50|$|Yet another {{regularity}} is the co-movement between {{output and}} the other macroeconomic variables. Figures 4 - 6 illustrated such relationship. We can measure this in more detail using correlations as listed in column B of Table 1. Procyclical variables have positive correlations since it usually increases during booms and decreases during recessions. Vice versa, a countercyclical variable associates with negative correlations. Acyclical, correlations close to zero, implies no systematic relationship to the business cycle. We find that productivity is slightly procyclical. This implies workers and capital are more productive <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a boom. They aren't quite as productive <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a slowdown. Similar explanations follow for consumption and investment, which are strongly procyclical. Labor is also procyclical while capital stock appears acyclical.|$|E

50|$|The cheese {{produced}} {{there is}} called Imsil cheese, following the county name. Imsil cheese is the unusual mission legacy of a Catholic priest from Belgium {{who took the}} Korean name of Ji Junghwan. He arrived in the farming village of Imsil, in <b>the</b> mid-1950s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> still shattered from the Korean war. He started a farmers’ milk cooperative. This cooperative eventually became the Imsil Cheese Factory, which exists today and produces high quality cheese and yogurt for the Korean market.|$|R
50|$|The {{economy may}} {{fluctuate}} during gameplay, with five economic states possible: Booming, Prosperity, Normal, Recession and Depression. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> good, the revenue of hauled goods and stock prices will be higher. Bond {{interest rates will}} also be adjusted with the economy level, including the interest received from cash and the interest paid for the bonds.|$|E
50|$|The most {{immediate}} effect of easy money, if implemented <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> below capacity, {{may be increased}} economic growth. In addition, the value of securities rises in the short term. If prolonged, the policy affects the business sentiment of firms and can reverse course over fears of rampant inflation. This is an effect of forward-looking expectations.|$|E
50|$|Discrete time {{is often}} {{employed}} when empirical measurements are involved, because normally {{it is only}} possible to measure variables sequentially. For example, while economic activity actually occurs continuously, there being no moment <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> totally in a pause, it is only possible to measure economic activity discretely. For this reason, published data on, for example, gross domestic product will show a sequence of quarterly values.|$|E
50|$|During {{the winter}} months, jam, {{preserves}} and pickles {{are brought to}} the table. During <b>the</b> past, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> largely agricultural, <b>the</b> gathering and conserving of fruits, mushrooms and vegetables for winter was essential. Today, gathering and conserving is less common because almost everything can be bought from stores, but preparing food for winter is still very popular in the countryside and continues to retain its charm for many, {{as opposed to the}} commercialization of eating habits. Upholding of traditions is important to many.|$|R
50|$|Largely as {{a result}} of the costly {{military}} expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> severely depressed. Great landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony's revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners were also involved in commerce but their interest differed from the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favored an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite.|$|R
30|$|Stable income {{growth is}} {{fundamental}} to any tax reduction policy. In 2011, government revenue was 10374.001 billion yuan, an increase of 24.8  % over 2010. Thereafter it maintained rapid growth. After 1998, except for the first 6  months of 2009 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{still reeling from the}} crisis, government revenues grew quickly. In 1995, government revenue accounted for 10.83  % of GDP. Since 1998, government revenues have hovered around 20  % of GDP, and it is estimated that government revenues will hit nearly 22  % of GDP in 2011.|$|R
