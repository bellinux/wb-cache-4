5|$|Arkham Origins was {{considered}} an incremental installment for the series, rather than a transformative one. GameSpot said that Arkham City expanded on Arkham Asylum by applying the game mechanics to a larger open-world setting, but criticized Arkham Origins for replicating Arkham City without moving the series forward. Other critics agreed, saying that the game's well-received elements from the previous game <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> developed or augmented and it was routine rather than inspired. However, other reviewers rated it {{on a par with}} Arkham City.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E

5|$|More {{numerous}} than new-build forts {{were old}} forts upgraded to higher defensive specifications. Thus the two parallel ditches common around earlier forts could {{be joined by}} excavating the ground between them. Projecting towers were added. Gates were either rebuilt with projecting towers or sealed off by constructing a large rectangular bastion. The walls were strengthened by doubling the old thickness. Upgraded forts were generally much larger than new-build. New forts were rarely over one hectare in size and were normally placed to fill gaps between old forts and towns. However, {{not all of the}} old forts that continued {{to be used in the}} 4th century were upgraded e.g. the forts on Hadrian's Wall and some other forts in Britannia <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> modified.|$|E
5|$|Reduced {{function}} of NMDA receptors {{play a role}} in schizophrenia. This diminished {{function of}} NMDA receptor may be correlated with the reduced expression of the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (NR2b), which has also been linked to schizophrenia. TBR1, in complex with the protein, CINAP, is responsible for regulating transcription of the NR2b gene. It was hypothesized in one 2010 study that reduced TBR1 and CINAP expression may be responsible for the reduced expression of the NR2b subunit observed in brains of postmortem schizophrenics. However, TBR1 and CINAP expression <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> reduced in the postmortem brains, suggesting that synthesis and processing of NR2b via TBR1 is not responsible for reduced NR2b expression in schizophrenics.|$|E

Most other sharks <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> affected by the end-Cretaceous extinction, also suggesting that competition lead to the demise of hybodonts.|$|E

In addition, during the peak influenza months, the shelter occupants did not test positive for the flu virus and the researchers hypothesize that being isolated from others may have been the reason they were virus-free.

The return of SARS to Asia is likely to cause somewhat less disruption the second time as citizens learn to live with the disease, but more multinational companies probably would reduce their exposure in the region if they concluded that SARS posed a long-term health challenge. Bigger outbreaks in Europe or the United States would hit {{a whole new set of}} business and government players, potentially doing serious damage to trade and growth.|$|E
25|$|Research in Italy {{suggests}} that healthy centenarians have {{high levels of}} both vitamin A and vitamin E and that this seems to be important in causing their extreme longevity. Other research contradicts this, however, and has found that this theory does not apply to centenarians from Sardinia, for whom other factors probably play a more important role. A preliminary study carried out in Poland showed that, in comparison with young healthy female adults, centenarians living in Upper Silesia had significantly higher red blood cell glutathione reductase and catalase activities, although serum levels of vitamin E <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>significantly</b> higher. Researchers in Denmark have also found that centenarians exhibit a high activity of glutathione reductase in red blood cells.
