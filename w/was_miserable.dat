But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber {{when he was}} {{six months}} old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> there, not least because of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand. Former friends alleged that he had broken into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, {{of being involved in}} smuggling heroin.|$|E

25|$|During the {{following}} two years, French troops stayed away from Pforzheim, but the economic situation of the town <b>was</b> <b>miserable.</b> In addition to this, {{the reconstruction of the}} town and the repairs of the fortifications under the supervision of Johann Matthaeus Faulhaber, the chief construction officer of the Margraviate Baden, required a lot of efforts. The accommodation of an imperial garrison under the command of (then) colonel Count Palffy also was a heavy burden.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E
500|$|The {{sequence}} <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> for Ackles, {{who spent}} four hours in make-up having the various hooks and other prosthetics applied. Wired cuffs around his wrists and ankles, {{as well as}} a harness around his waist, were used to lift him 13feet into the air in front of a green screen. To his discomfort, the harness slipped, causing its buckle to continuously dig into his hip throughout the scene's three or four takes. The actor, who [...] "had tears rolling down [...] face" [...] as he was lowered down, deemed it the most physical pain he has endured for a single shot.|$|E

500|$|Crosby {{decided to}} leave the series part way through the first season, due to the {{underdevelopment}} of her character, Tasha Yar. She later said about the situation {{in an interview with the}} official Star Trek website, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>miserable.</b> I couldn't wait to get off that show. I was dying". Roddenberry agreed to her request to leave, and she returned in the [...] episode [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise". Another change to the cast, this time after the end of the first season, was the firing of McFadden, who played Dr. Crusher, from the show. This was later attributed to the actions of Hurley and once he left the crew, she returned to the role at the start of the third season.|$|E
500|$|At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt {{completed}} her formal education {{and returned to}} the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on December 14. She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was so unhappy, because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls I used to know in New York. I <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the first}} season, Crosby asked to be {{released}} from her contract as she was unhappy that her character was not being developed. She later said [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>miserable.</b> I couldn't wait to get off that show. I was dying." [...] Roddenberry agreed to her request, and she left on good terms. The final episode she filmed was [...] "", which was completed after Yar's death in [...] "Skin of Evil".

500|$|Puck {{has been}} granted early release from {{juvenile}} detention {{on the condition}} that he performs community service. He picks Artie Abrams, a paraplegic, to fulfill that service, and the two busk in the school courtyard. They sing a duet of [...] "One Love/People Get Ready" [...] while Puck surreptitiously intimidates their schoolmates into giving donations. He then helps Artie get back together with Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), by setting up a double date with them and Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera). Puck's caseworker Joan Martin (Michael Hyatt) had believed he was working to rehabilitate gang members, and tells him he will have to return to the detention center unless he finds an alternative type of service. Puck admits to Artie that despite his bravado, he <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> when locked up and does not want to return; Artie convinces him to complete the required real community service and offers to tutor him in school.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{reading the}} script, Kristin Kreuk noted {{that she had}} been [...] "entranced", believing that the main message that audiences would take away from the film was that of not judging an individual's {{personality}} based upon their physical appearances. Richardson thought that Caroline Thompson's adaptation was [...] "much more in keeping" [...] with the ethos of the Grimm tale than subsequent adaptations due to its [...] "darker" [...] nature. Praising Miranda Richardson as being perfect for the role of Elspeth, Caroline Thompson asserted {{that she had been}} [...] "a blast to work with." [...] Caroline Thompson noted that she cast the actors to play the dwarves according to their own individual personalities; she remarked that Warwick Davis was a [...] "phenomenal actor" [...] while Penny Blake was [...] "so funny" [...] and Michael J. Anderson was a [...] "genius." [...] Together, she thought that they brought an [...] "array of talents" [...] to the production. Michael J. Anderson himself claimed that he identified with his character, the [...] "philosopher of the group", and really enjoyed playing the role. Commenting on his character of Wednesday, Vincent Schiavelli noted that he <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> because [...] "he really thinks that he's a dwarf" [...] even though he isn't.|$|E

It <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> and the contact lenses were terrible. I don’t wear contacts and I don’t know how people do it, sticking things in their eyeballs all the time." [...] The character's sense of fashion is vital to understanding her past. Benz says Darla is [...] "dressed to the nines" [...] in every time period in which she lives, and [...] "she fully goes after a certain look. If she’s going to be living during the Boxer Rebellion time, she’s got the big Gibson Girl hair style and the beautiful kimono-style clothes." [...] Benz points out that in the Buffy pilot episode, Darla—attempting to dress like a high school student—exaggerates it with a [...] "little twist", wearing a Catholic schoolgirl uniform instead. [...] "I think I influenced Darla fashion-wise in the second season of Angel where she was a little more classic-looking and tailored," [...] Benz says, explaining she collaborated with the costume designer to transition Darla into a [...] "hipper look" [...] when she became a vampire again. Darla shockingly becomes pregnant in the third season of Angel. In an interview with the BBC, Benz admitted: ...|$|E

500|$|Roger advises Lane {{about how}} to ensnare a client at dinner. Roger informs Lane to find the man's source of regret, and make it {{relatable}} to himself, forming a [...] "conspiracy" [...] of feeling between the pair. Pryce's dinner does not go smoothly; the Jaguar representative appears to have no regrets in his life, and Lane is forced to plan another lunch to try again at confirming the new business. Upon hearing of this failure, Pete tactfully tells Lane to maintain a friendly relationship with the target, and to let Accounts take the business from there. Roger compliments Pete's letting Lane down softly and taking the task off his hands, forming a renewed alliance with Pete. At the dinner meeting, Edwin, the Jaguar representative, assures Don, Roger, and Pete they have his business, {{but he wants to}} have some fun. The executives quickly learn what kind of fun Edwin has in mind and they visit a local brothel, where Edwin, Roger, and Pete all cheat on their wives, leaving Don at the bar. Don later shares a cab with Pete on the way home in which the latter, drunk, criticizes Don as hypocritical for judging Pete's adulterous actions. Don explains he is not judging; he merely didn't know Pete <b>was</b> <b>miserable.</b> Pete replies sarcastically that he has everything, and Don warns him not to throw it away.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Breen began {{keeping a}} diary on November 20. He {{primarily}} concerned {{himself with the}} weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries. Life at Truckee Lake <b>was</b> <b>miserable.</b> The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a [...] "disagreeable" [...] glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay {{in front of their}} fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it. After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the emigrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine. Emigrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would {{be able to make the}} full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger. George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{interpreted}} {{to be an}} ode to Noel and Liam Gallagher's mother Peggy. In general the lyrics of the song stress an optimistic outlook. Noel Gallagher explained that [...] "At the time [...] [...] [...] {{it was written in}} the middle of grunge and all that, and I remember Nirvana had a tune called 'I Hate Myself and Want to Die', and I was like [...] [...] [...] 'Well, I'm not fucking having that.' As much as I fucking like him [...] and all that shit, I'm not having that. I can't have people like that coming over here, on smack, fucking saying that they hate themselves and they wanna die. That's fucking rubbish. Kids don't need to be hearing that nonsense." [...] While Gallagher has stated he did not intend [...] "Live Forever" [...] as a direct retort to Nirvana or their music (being a professed fan of the band), he contrasted the lives of Cobain and his band at that point, saying, [...] "Seems to me that here was a guy who had everything, and <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> about it. And we had fuck-all, and I still thought that getting up in the morning was the greatest fuckin' thing ever, 'cause you didn't know where you'd end up at night. And we didn't have a pot to piss in, but it was fucking great, man". Gallagher considers the line [...] "We see things they'll never see" [...] the most important line of the song, explaining that old friends tend to laugh at jokes and stories that [...] "no one else gets".|$|E

Her act featured the songs [...] "The Tiddly Wink", [...] "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and [...] "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, {{partly due to}} the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. [...] The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. [...] She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The New York Telegraph speculated [...] "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition." [...] Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying [...] "until we meet again". [...] She was reported in The Morning Telegraph as saying: [...] "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." [...] Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, [...] the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon.

500|$|Rain World {{punishing}} gameplay frustrated reviewers, {{who often}} descended into apathy. Considering the random enemy spawns, one-hit kills, infrequent game saves, frequent repetition, crushing rain, some inexplicable enemy movements, and sometimes clumsy controls, IGN wrote {{that any of}} the game's challenging elements taken alone would be [...] "tough but fair", but when considered together, [...] "the odds are stacked so high against the player that it risks toppling the entire structure of the game". Reviewers were bored by the repeated navigation of rooms with random enemies after each death, which tempered their strong urge to explore. Polygon reviewer <b>was</b> <b>miserable</b> following the loss of her multi-hour progression. She wrote about futility as a central tenet of Rain World, and felt that she was not given the proper tools to survive. Reviewers lamented, in particular, how Slugcat's jerky animations and imprecise throwing mechanics led to many unwarranted deaths. Multiple reviewers concluded that while some hardcore players might enjoy the tough gameplay, Rain World excluded a large audience with its design choices, as its choice of emergent enemy strategy would feel unfair to most players. Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the game's checkpointing among the worst in modern platformers, and its challenge, unlike the similarly punishing Dark Souls, without purpose. Rain World karmic gates, which require players to have a positive hibernate to death ratio, were arbitrary goals [...] "disrespectful" [...] of the player's time, according to GameSpot. Making players trudge through an area a dozen times, IGN argued, is [...] "antithetical" [...] in a game in which exploration itself is the reward. PC Gamer reviewer, with time, began to see Rain World cumbersome controls less as [...] "bad design" [...] than as [...] "thematically appropriate", given the game's intent to disempower the player.|$|E
