5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand <b>why</b> <b>her</b> mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the intricacies of social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not care what they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders <b>why</b> <b>her</b> mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E

In her interview, she explained how she disliked the fame that came with her celebrity, and how her family was an extremely important part of her life. She also explained <b>why</b> <b>her</b> character, Lee Haines, was not at all like her. During that year, she appeared on the cover of Top Billing.|$|E

25|$|Despite these successes, her {{brilliant}} {{career was}} fading. She lost {{tens of thousands}} in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and she had difficulties with the IRS. Her health suffered, and she worked only sporadically in the following years. In 1950–51 she wrote her autobiography His Eye Is on the Sparrow with Charles Samuels, in which she wrote candidly about her life. She explained <b>why</b> <b>her</b> age had often been misstated: her friends had to sign a paper claiming Waters was four years younger than she was to get a group insurance deal; she stated that {{she was born in}} 1900. His Eye Is on the Sparrow was adapted for a stage production in which she was portrayed by Ernestine Jackson. In her second autobiography, To Me, It's Wonderful, Waters stated that she was born in 1896.|$|E
25|$|Hermia and Lysander {{have escaped}} {{to the same}} forest in hopes of eloping. Helena, desperate to reclaim Demetrius's love, tells Demetrius about the plan and he follows them in hopes of killing Lysander. Helena {{continually}} makes advances towards Demetrius, promising to love him more than Hermia. However, he rebuffs her with cruel insults against her. Observing this, Oberon orders Puck to spread some of the magical juice from the flower on the eyelids of the young Athenian man. Instead, Puck mistakes Lysander for Demetrius, not having actually seen either before, and administers the juice to the sleeping Lysander. Helena, coming across him, wakes him while attempting to determine whether he is dead or asleep. Upon this happening, Lysander immediately {{falls in love with}} Helena. Oberon sees Demetrius still following Hermia and is enraged. When Demetrius goes to sleep, Oberon sends Puck to get Helena while he charms Demetrius' eyes. Upon waking up, he sees Helena. Now, both men are in pursuit of Helena. However, she is convinced that her two suitors are mocking her, as neither loved her originally. Hermia is at a loss to see <b>why</b> <b>her</b> lover has abandoned her, and accuses Helena of stealing Lysander away from her. The four quarrel with each other until Lysander and Demetrius become so enraged that they seek a place to duel to prove whose love for Helena is the greater. Oberon orders Puck to keep Lysander and Demetrius from catching up with one another and to remove the charm from Lysander so Lysander can return to love Hermia, while Demetrius continues to love Helena.|$|E
25|$|Mark was {{originally}} scripted to be a wayward delinquent and {{was due to}} feature heavily within {{the first year of}} the series. However, as soon as the regular gruelling schedule of EastEnders production established itself, it became clear that Scarboro was not happy in the role. The stress of the heavy workload and the sudden fame that came to all the actors became difficult for him to cope with. He became unhappy with the schedule and his scripts and refused to play Mark as a racist as was intended. Holland and Smith decided to write the character out of the show to allow the actor to come to terms with the situation better. On-screen, Mark was being implicated in the murder of Reg Cox (Johnnie Clayton) and was being tempted into heroin by Nick Cotton (John Altman). Fearing Nick and the police, Mark ran away from home in April 1985. As this had not been the original plan for the character, it meant a hectic period of re-writing early in 1985. The first fifty-odd scripts were reworked to accommodate this major change. Many of the stories intended for Mark were subsequently given to Kelvin Carpenter (Paul J. Medford), Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Mark's sister Michelle (Susan Tully) - which partially explains <b>why</b> <b>her</b> character became so prominent in the first year. It still left a gap though, because several of Mark's functions in the serial, as slightly the eldest of the youngsters, could not have been taken over by the others. A new character needed to be introduced to restore the balance to its original shape, which is why the character of Simon Wicks (Nick Berry) was introduced. This meant introducing the audience to a character and a story approximately a year before it had been originally intended.|$|E

Noting that a third of the set-list was made up of covers, she expressed dislike for Lewis' interpretation of [...] "Time After Time". Abbott wrote that her [...] "only real criticism" [...] of the performance was for the stage production, which she described as [...] "five strips of giant toilet paper hanging at the back, occasionally changing colour, and spaced a little too far apart to make for easy viewing of the video footage of Leona explaining <b>why</b> <b>her</b> music is so important to her". Abbott did, however, note that the backdrop did not detract from the [...] "high quality music" [...] or her [...] "incredible, effortless voice".|$|E

Willow changes her shirt again and Xander expresses his desire to find Glory and exact justice, then complains about Joyce's negligent doctors. Anya asks if they will see the body, then if the body will be cut open, and Willow responds angrily. Anya tearfully says she does not understand how to behave, or why Joyce cannot go back into her own body, unable to understand human death, she states that it is all [...] "stupid and mortal", and no one will tell her why things are happening. Xander puts his fist through the wall, making him bleed but feel oddly better. As the group leaves to visit Buffy at the hospital, Xander gets a parking ticket.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{dedicated}} a {{large portion}} of his analysis to Rose. He thought that Billie Piper was [...] "distinctly below par", citing her gaunt and malnourished appearance, new hairstyle, and slight lisp as reasons <b>why</b> <b>her</b> acting was not her finest. He criticised her role in the episode as been [...] "far less well worked out" [...] than Donna's, being inquisitive about several concepts: why Rose was shocked when she heard the Doctor had died, but later being knowledgeable about Donna's history and destiny; whether if Rose was travelling between universes or just time-travelling; why Rose herself didn't convince Donna to turn left instead of sending Donna on a suicide mission; why Rose didn't change her clothes between her appearances; and why Rose refused to tell anyone her name. He noted the allusion to the concept of the power of names previously referred to in [...] "The Shakespeare Code", [...] "Last of the Time Lords", and [...] "Silence in the Library", but ultimately theorised that the reason was so Davies could set up the episode's cliffhanger.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately" [...] is {{described}} as an uptempo dance song.

Lyrically, it involves the singer asking <b>why</b> <b>her</b> lover was not as attentive as he once was. He was not treating her as well as he used to, and she calls him a [...] "loser" [...] in response. [...] "I never ask for more than I deserve, you know it's the truth.

Naomi's first scenes saw her meeting and flirting with Paul Robinson (Dennis), who was later {{surprised to learn that}} she was Sheila's daughter. She then reunited with her mother and her nephew Kyle (Chris Milligan). While Sheila was pleased to see her daughter, she was suspicious of her motives and sudden urge to see her.

500|$|In {{the second}} season of Glee, Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) is {{introduced}} as the new football coach for the McKinley High Titans in the premiere episode, [...] "Audition". Beiste comes to William McKinley High with an enviable record of coaching successful football teams, and Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) boosts the football program budget to support the new coach by reducing the cheerleading and glee club budgets, which alarms coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), respectively, and drives them into a temporary alliance against Beiste. The coach is dismayed by their rudeness, but forgives Will when he apologizes {{and goes on to}} develop a friendship with him. Beiste contemplates resigning as coach upon learning that several students have been fantasizing about Beiste in order to curb their arousal while making out. Will has the students apologize and earn Beiste's forgiveness. Will also learns that Beiste has never been kissed, which leads to him giving the coach a first kiss as a friendly gesture. Beiste later helps the glee club members preserve Brittany's (Heather Morris) continued belief in Santa Claus: disguised as Santa, Beiste explains to Brittany <b>why</b> <b>her</b> wish that paraplegic boyfriend Artie (Kevin McHale) be made to walk cannot be granted; later, Brittany anonymously receives a ReWalk to allow Artie to walk for short periods of time. When antagonism flares between the football team's glee and non-glee factions, Beiste forces the entire football team to work together with the glee club for one week; despite encountering resistance and set-backs, the plan is ultimately successful and the team wins the championship game. During the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", Beiste takes Will out for a fun time at a rodeo bar, which includes the character's first lead vocal performance on the show in the duet [...] "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer".|$|E
