25|$|The Hindu epic, Mahabharata tells {{that the}} Vasus, cursed by Vashishta, had {{requested}} Ganga {{to be their}} mother. Ganga incarnated and became the wife of King Shantanu on condition that at no stage shall he question her actions or she would leave him. As seven Vasus were born as their children, one after the other, Ganga drowned them in her own waters, freeing them from their punishment and the king made no opposition. Only when the eighth was born did the king finally oppose his wife, who therefore left him. So the eighth son, Dyaus incarnated, remained alive, imprisoned in mortal form and later became known in his mortal incarnation as Bhishma (Devavrata), <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most respected characters of Mahabharata.|$|E

25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne {{to admit that she}} and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However the time when the two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E

In response, Fox intended for Toriel's character to be [...] "a mom that hopefully acts like a mom", and [...] "genuinely cares" [...] about players' actions.|$|E
