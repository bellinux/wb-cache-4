The fan club lasted longer than Pregenzer, who pitched in 19 games before being booted to the minors. Before Pregenzer's departure, however, Miss O'Hara had arranged for him to receive a baked pheasant testimonial dinner, a quality transistor radio and a scroll naming him honorary mayor of Fresno."

Overall, our findings suggest that signaling through dynamic thresholds in covenants is credible but costly to borrowers...|$|R

40|$|In 2003 – 04 {{over half}} a million {{students}} attending the 109 California community colleges received about one billion dollars in financial aid to help meet their college expenses. Nearly all of the aided students received Board of Governors <b>Fee</b> <b>Waivers</b> to cover their enrollment fees. Less than one-half of the aided stu-dents also received federal Pell grants to help cover other educa-tion expenses, such as books and supplies, food, housing, and transportation costs, while enrolled. Both {{in terms of the}} number of students served and the total aid funds provided, the federal Pell grants and the Board of Governors <b>Fee</b> <b>Waivers</b> are the most important financial aid programs for California community college students. Both programs are need-based, which means that eligibility is primarily determined by income, and most of the awards go to lower income students. Pell grants require the student to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This long and complicated applica-tion form is used to calculate an index called the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC index, which is largely based on family or personal income and assets (but considers other factors as well), is used to determine eligibility for Pell grants and other federal student aid programs. The federal aid application is also used to qualify applicants for a Board of Governors (BOG) <b>Fee</b> <b>Waiver.</b> However, students may choose to file the shorter and separate BOG <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> application instead of the federal form to qualify for a <b>fee</b> <b>waiver.</b> Since it is shorter and less complicated than the FAFSA, some students file only the BOG <b>fee</b> <b>waiver</b> application and skip the federal aid application...|$|R

40|$|Over half {{of money}} fund {{managers}} voluntarily waive fees {{they have a}} contractual right to claim. Accordingly, the effective fee charged may be substantially less than indicated in expense ratios and may vary over the year despite a constant contractual fee. Retail fund managers use <b>fee</b> <b>waivers</b> to strategically adjust net advisory fees to current realizations in performance and expected fund flows. This paper documents differences in fee waiving practices between retail and institutional funds and relates these findings to differences in the effectiveness of <b>fee</b> <b>waivers</b> in terms of enhancing fund performance and thereby attracting additional funds. 2 This paper investigates the optimal management fee {{under the assumption that}} it is not fixed but variable throughout the year.
