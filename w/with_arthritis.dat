40|$|Echocardiographic early diastolic {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} shown recently in 50 % of men with ankylosing spondylitis. Similar techniques were used to investigate subjects <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> <b>with</b> or without spondylitis. These subjects had no clinical, radiographic, or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac or respiratory disease. Echocardiographic abnormalities seen resembled those of ankylosing spondylitis in that the interval between minimum left ventricular dimension and mitral valve opening was prolonged in 12 of 22 subjects <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and in seven of 11 subjects <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis.</b> Isovolumic relaxation time was significantly prolonged in four subjects <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and one <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis.</b> Unlike ankylosing spondylitis, however, there was consistent reduction in peak rate of left ventricular dimension increase in subjects <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and psoriatic arthritis.

40|$|In iron {{deficiency}} anaemia basic red cell content of ferritin is appreciably reduced.

For 23 patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and normocytic anaemia irrespective of plasma ferritin concentration, red cell ferritin content {{did not differ significantly}} from that for non-anaemic patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis.</b> For 27 patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and microcytic anaemia, the mean red cell ferritin content for patients with a plasma ferritin concentration in the 13 - 110 micrograms/l range was appreciably reduced. It was indistinguishable from that for patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and classical {{iron deficiency anaemia}}, indicated by plasma ferritin concentrations of less than 12 micrograms/l. In contrast, the mean red cell ferritin content for patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> microcytic anaemia, and plasma ferritin concentrations above 110 micrograms/l did not differ from that for patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and normocytic anaemia. Oral treatment with iron in patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> microcytic anaemia, and appreciably reduced red cell ferritin concentrations was accompanied by significant increases in haemoglobin concentration (p less than 0. 01), mean corpuscular volume (p less than 0. 01), and red cell ferritin contents (p less than 0. 05). This treatment, however, did not produce any appreciable change in haemoglobin concentration in patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis,</b> normocytic anaemia, and normal red cell ferritin contents. These findings suggest that the indices for iron deficiency in patients <b>with</b> rheumatoid <b>arthritis</b> and anaemia should include peripheral blood microcytosis together with a plasma ferritin concentration of less than 110 micrograms/l...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{differentiation}} between septic and non-septic arthritis is difficult. A previous study showed promising diagnostic accuracy of serum Procalcitonin (PCT) in septic arthritis, limited by a low sensitive PCT test kit. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of PCT {{in patients with}} septic and non-septic arthritis using a novel test with low detection limit. METHODS: Forty-two patients, 28 with non-septic and 14 <b>with</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> were prospectively included. For each patient, gram stain, culture and polarization microscopy of synovial fluid was done and PCT, C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count, uric acid and blood cultures were taken. Patients <b>with</b> septic <b>arthritis,</b> patients <b>with</b> non-septic <b>arthritis</b> <b>with</b> and without concomitant infection were compared. RESULTS: Patients <b>with</b> septic <b>arthritis</b> had a significant higher PCT concentration than patients <b>with</b> non-septic <b>arthritis</b> (p< 0. 0001). At a cut-off of 0. 1 (0. 25) ng/ml, sensitivity for septic arthritis was 100 (93) % and specificity 46 (75) %. Specificity rose to 93 % after exclusion of patients <b>with</b> non-septic <b>arthritis</b> and concomitant infection. Both sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of septic arthritis were higher for PCT than CRP. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PCT {{seems to be a}} highly sensitive and specific marker for septic arthritis, depending on the clinical setting. Further studies are warranted...|$|R

25|$|But in 1963, <b>with</b> <b>arthritis</b> {{affecting}} his {{spinning and}} his schoolmastering duties increasing, he played only twice and in 1964 not at all. Then, {{at the end}} of the 1964 season, Stephenson, who had been injured for most of it, stepped down from the Somerset captaincy. Bill Alley, rumbustious Australian all-rounder, who had deputised as captain in Stephenson's absence in 1964, was not seen as a long-term captain, and Atkinson was released from school duties to take the job for 1965. He was an instant success: Somerset led the County Championship table in June 1965, an unaccustomed position, and though Atkinson's batting was unreliable– he averaged less than 15 runs per innings for the season– and his spin bowling days were over, he developed as a tight medium-paced bowler, taking 38 wickets at under 24 runs apiece and complementing Somerset's pace attack of Fred Rumsey and Ken Palmer.|$|E

He was disappointing on that tour, but his skill developed in the wet summer of the following year. Though an injury wiped out a quarter of his 1949 season, Wardle was deadly on the few rain-affected pitches that summer, and his bowling helped Yorkshire to make a late, albeit unsuccessful, tilt at the County Championship title.|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the process}} of psoriatic plaque {{formation}} numerous morphological and functional abnormalities, including microvascular changes, are observed.

Objectives: The aim {{of the study was}} assessment of vascular changes in psoriasis vulgaris as well as psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> <b>with</b> emphasis to capillaroscopic differences in these two types of diseases. Material and methods: The study included 111 adult psoriatic patients. 53 patients suffered from psoriatic arthritis while 58 patients had psoriasis vulgaris. Nailfold capillaroscopies of II to V fingers of both hands were performed. Results: 16. 98 % of patients <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> presented pale a capillaroscopic background, which was not observed in patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Sub- -papillary venular plexus was visible significantly more frequently in patients <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> (p= 0. 032). In 30. 19 % of patients <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> a decreased number of nailfold capillaries was found. 43. 40 % of patients <b>with</b> psoriatic <b>arthritis</b> and 24. 14 % of patients with psoriasis vulgaris had thin nailfold capillaries.

2500|$|There are {{advantages}} {{as well as}} disadvantages to both crossed-style (traditional and Burton) and Musser-Stevens.

[...] Despite these advantages of the Stevens grip, it is harder to master than crossed-style grips. Additionally, though the Stevens grip is intended to place minimal tension on the hand muscles, the mallets exert greater leverage when they are in motion (since they are held at the very ends), requiring greater muscle control than with crossed-style grips.
