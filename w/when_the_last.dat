At that point the Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{problems}} {{with some of}} the new features, such as the Bulleid chain-driven valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class.

Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E

5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as a paragon of virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of his sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E

5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, disconnected, segment {{was added to}} the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were added to M-72. M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> segment was completed, the number was removed from the highway, and the freeway was added to I-75.|$|E

This was completed in early December 2015 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> paper farecard was sold.
