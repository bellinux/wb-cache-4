5|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the American Revolution in 1783, a surge of westward {{migration}} into Central and <b>Western</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> began. At the time, most travel west of the Albany area was by water. While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River, there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler (present day Utica), except for an old east–west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path. By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and <b>Western</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> As a result, there was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in <b>Western</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but <b>Western</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
