The future of sustain-able agriculture may be irreversibly jeopardized by contamination of in situ preserved genetic resources threatening a strategic resource for the <b>world’s</b> <b>food</b> <b>security.</b> Because GM crops are truly biological novel-ties, their release into the environment poses concerns about the unpredictable ecological and evolutionary responses that GM species themselves and the inter-acting biota may express in the medium and long term. One {{of the consequences of}} these processes may be a generalized contamination of natural flora by GM traits and a degradation and erosion of the commonly owned genetic resources available today for agricul-tural development.

Three-quarters of the countries where fish contributes {{more than one-third of}} animal protein in the diet are low-income food-deficit countries (Kawarazuka and Béné 2011), where fish is often the cheapest and most accessible animal-source food (Belton and Thilsted 2014).

Responding to this need, the new CGIAR research program (CRP) on fish agri-food systems (FISH) will focus on the three interlinked challenges of sustainable aquaculture, small-scale fisheries (SSF), and enhancing the contribution of fish to nutrition and health of the poor in priority geographies of Africa and Asia-Pacific.

40|$|In an {{increasingly}} <b>food</b> insecure <b>world,</b> {{there is a}} critical need {{for us to have}} a comprehensive understanding of global croplands. The reality that the ―green revolution ‖ has ended is beginning to be felt around the World. Whereas, global population continues to increase {{at a rate of about}} 100 million per year and is expected to reach around 10 billion by 2050, cropland areas are not increasing and have stagnated around 1. 5 billion hectares globally. Indeed, cropland areas have even begun to decrease in some countries with important food contribution (e. g., USA) due to increasing demand of fertile arable lands for alternative uses such as bio-fuels, encroachment from urbanization, and industrialization. The ecological and environmental imperatives have put a cap on further increase of cropland areas to other lands such as forests and rangelands. These issues leave us with a fundamental and urgent question to answer: ―how does the <b>world</b> ensure <b>food</b> <b>security</b> for its ballooning population without having to increase cropland areas and water allocations?‖. Indeed, even better question to ask is: ―how does the <b>world</b> ensure <b>food</b> <b>security</b> for its ballooning population even by reducing the existing cropland areas and water allocations?‖. Solutions such as from bio-technology and precision farming may come through but it is not currently moving at a rate that will ensure global <b>food</b> <b>security</b> over next few decades.
