5|$|Another method {{adopted in}} the past to tackle the phumdis was by way of {{diverting}} them towards the Khordak River. However, as this approach had not been very successful, the State Government planned to construct a canal at Tera Khunou Khong Ahanbi to divert the phumdis to Manipur River. Other methods adopted by the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) to control phumdis and <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> include introducing weevils for the biological control of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth,</b> which was carried out in collaboration with the Horticulture Institute of Bangalore. Reports have shown this to be an effective method in controlling <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a metal {{with low}} toxicity. It is poorly absorbed by human body when digested. Plants {{such as the}} <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> are killed by low levels of {{palladium}} salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though no clear evidence indicates the element harms humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth,</b> has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{indications}} that <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> can provide {{benefits to the}} Lake Victoria Region. <b>Water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> have been planted {{in an attempt to}} purify eutrophicated water.

25|$|Growth of the <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> in Lake Victoria {{has been}} tracked since 1993, {{reaching}} its maxima biomass in 1997 and then declining {{again by the}} end of 2001. Greater growth was observed {{in the northern part of}} the lake, in relatively protected areas, which may be linked to current and weather patterns and could also be due to the climate and water conditions, which are more suitable to the plants growth (as there are large urban areas to the north end of the lake, in Uganda). The invasive weed was first attempted to be controlled by hand, removed manually from the lake; however, re-growth occurred quickly. Public awareness exercises were also conducted. More recently, measures have been used such as the introduction of natural insect predators, including two different <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> weevils and large harvesting and chopping boats, which seem to be much more effective in eliminating the <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth.</b>|$|E

40|$|Malawi {{is one of}} many {{countries}} throughout the world struggling with massive amounts of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> (Eichornia crassipes) in the country’s fresh water resources.   In nutrient-rich ecosystems where the aquatic weed has no natural enemies it will reproduce very rapidly with the consequence that lakes become overgrown, water flow in rivers is reduced, and other water organisms becomes excluded. At the same time, the plants form a good breeding place for species carrying tropical diseases for example Malaria and Bilharzia. <b>Water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> are usually more of a problem for poorer countries since there are often great economic losses caused by the weed and to control their relative abundance is costly. In Malawi, 99 % of the produced electricity is based on water resources, mainly through hydropower turbines in the main river, Shire River. <b>Water</b> <b>hyacinths,</b> aggregated as islands, floating along the river and clogging the turbines cause repeated electricity black-outs and approximately 140 megawatt power is lost every day. To counter the weed interference with the electricity supply, there are great amounts of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> harvested every day and dumped along the road, with no further disposal plan. In this report, soil from one local dumping area is analysed to determine if such places are leaching nutrients or metals to the surrounding environment.   <b>Water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> contain naturally high values of nutrients and farmers use these harvested plants as a green manure to improve soil properties on agricultural land. This paper aims to examine levels of metal in <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> used as green manure. This is of interest since <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> have the ability to effectively absorb substances from the water body which could pose a risk for potentially toxic elements (PTEs) to accumulate in the agricultural soil and subsequently in crops. Sampling and analyses were carried out with standard methods. Metal and nutrient levels in the analysed samples were obtained through detection with atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), ion chromatography (IC) and UV/VIS spectrophotometry at the Department of Chemistry of Chancellor College in Zomba, Malawi. None of the investigated metal ions (Cr, Pb, Cd) were found in the analysed <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> and since soil sampling was done during the dry season this thesis cannot determine if the dumping areas are leaching nutrients. Relatively high amounts of total phosphorus were found in the plants. Overall, the conclusion {{is that there is no}} risk of using <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> harvested in Shire River as a green manure on agricultural land. ...|$|R
40|$|Removal of cadmium {{and nickel}} from static water systems {{utilizing}} <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms) was investigated. This aquatic plant demonstrated {{the ability to}} rapidly remove heavy metals from aqueous systems by root absorption and concentration. <b>Water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> demonstrated the ability to absorb and concentrate up to 0. 67 mg of cadmium and 0. 50 mg of nickel per gram of dry plant material when exposed for a 24 -hour period to waters polluted with from 0. 578 to 2. 00 ppm of these toxic metals. It is found that one hectare of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> {{has the potential of}} removing 300 g of cadmium or nickel from 240, 000 liters of water polluted with these metals during a 24 -hour period...|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{introduced}} Nile perch (Lates niloticus), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth,</b> deforestation {{that led}} to water siltation, and overfishing, many Lake Victoria cichlid species have become extinct or been drastically reduced.

25|$|Other {{factors which}} {{may have contributed to}} the decline of the <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> in Lake Victoria include varying weather patterns, such as El Niño during the last few months of 1997 and first six months of 1998 {{bringing}} with it higher levels of water in the lake and thus dislodging the plants. Heavy winds and rains along with their subsequent waves may have also damaged the plants during this same time frame. The plants may not have been destroyed, instead merely moved to another location. Additionally, the water quality, nutrient supply, temperature, and other environmental factors could have played a role. Overall, the timing of the decline could be linked to all of these factors and perhaps together, in combination, they were more effective than any one deterrent would have been by itself. The <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> is in remission and this trend could be permanent if control efforts are continued.|$|E
40|$|Removal of {{lead and}} mercury by <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> (Eichhornia crassipes) (Mart.) Solms and {{alligator}} weeds (Alternanthera philoxeroides) (Mart.)

One acre of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> is potentially capable of removing 105. 6 grams of lead and 90. 0 grams of mercury per day. Alligator weeds removed 0. 101 mg of lead per gram of dry plant material in a 24 -hour period.

50|$|Heavy {{sedimentation}} in Mount Batur Caldera {{decreases the}} water in the lake. A plan was devised to restrict locations around the lake for tourist accommodations, to inform residents of the problems of fish farm cages in the lake, and perhaps to dredge some of the natural sedimentation from volcanic ash. The lake is subject to water pollution from fishing and agricultural run off, promoting the growth of too many <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths,</b> further worsening conditions in the lake, causing some to wonder if the lake will disappear between heavy sedimentation at the bottom and a dense cover of <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Lake Victoria basin while {{generally}} rural {{has many}} major centres of population.

These cities and towns also are home to many factories that discharge some chemicals directly into the lake or its influent rivers. Large parts of these urban areas also discharge untreated (raw) sewage into the river, increasing its eutrophication that in turn is helping to increase the invasive <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth.</b>|$|E
25|$|Species {{have also}} been {{introduced}} via attachment to sporting boats which are trailered between regions. This is the probable source {{of a number of}} low salinity plants like Egeria densa and <b>water</b> <b>hyacinth</b> (Eichhornia crassipes). These plants have created profound changes in the Delta by disrupting water flow, shading phytoplankton, and providing habitat for piscivorous fish like the striped bass, Morone saxatilis, itself intentionally introduced in the late 1800s from the Chesapeake Bay. The freshwater quagga mussel, originally from Europe, is expected to be introduced by boaters within the next two to ten years, in spite of precautionary measures. Furthermore, the young age and isolated environment of the San Francisco estuary has resulted in the success of invasive invertebrates {{due to the lack of}} biodiversity.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{carried out}} at the NASA National Space Technology Laboratories {{indicate}} that <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> can absorb organic chemicals, heavy metals, nutrients, and other materials from waste water while producing large quantities of biomass, {{which can be used}} to produce a gas containing 60 - 80 % methane.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess whether {{nutrient}} absorption rates by <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> are affected by low-salinity levels. In a controlled experiment, <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> demonstrated the ability to absorb a significant amount of nutrients in low-saline waters while maintaining a slowed growth rate and shortened life span. Nutrient rates were reduced by an average of 36 % in ammonia nitrogen and 48 % in reactive phosphorus in the tanks of 4. 45 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity. Growth rate in the experimental tanks of 4. 45 ppt was observed at 33 % slower than that of the control. The high salinity comparison tank of 7. 0 ppt experienced complete mortality after three days. Phytoremediation practices through the use of an aquatic invader, <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths,</b> can be used to reduce large-scale fish kills along the eastern U. S. ’s major estuarine systems, focusing on Florida’s waters. Toxic dinoflagellates and other harmful algal blooms have been plaguing the contributing waterways of North Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay and are the main causes of these massive fish kills. The characteristics and trends that these upstream estuarine systems are following could serve as a warning for Florida. An analysis of Florida’s fish kill database, as well as patterns and trends of the fish kills in North Carolina and the Chesapeake Bay, were used to determine areas at an increased risk for toxic dinoflagellates and harmful algal blooms to occur. Areas are proposed for <b>water</b> <b>hyacinths</b> to be implemented in a controlled method to reduce massive fish kills in Florida’s waters...|$|R
