Late in the contest, Diesel performed a Jacknife Powerbomb on Sid and <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pinfall. Tatanka came out and attacked Diesel, which resulted in Diesel retaining the championship via disqualification. Tatanka, along with DiBiase, attacked Diesel.

5|$|The semifinals of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament followed, {{beginning}} with Team 3D pitted against Cage and Rhino {{in the sixth}} encounter. The bout lasted ten minutes. Before the contest, the TNA commentators announced that Booker T's attack on Cage and Rhino had caused them to have concussions in the storyline. During the contest, Team 3D associate Johnny Devine came to the ring and handed Ray a kendo stick without the referee's knowledge. Although Rhino tackled Devon and <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> cover, Devine entered the ring to distract the referee, allowing Ray to hit Rhino with the kendo stick and cover to win the contest for his team.|$|E

In this Detour, teams had to choose between <b>Go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Gold and <b>Go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Goal. In <b>Go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Gold, teams had to search amongst the thousands of seats in the stadium to find one of seven gold medals. In <b>Go</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Goal, one team member would kick a penalty shot with a soccer ball and the other team member must successfully rebound it into an unguarded goal using only their head.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for dragging his foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
5|$|In England's second innings, Lindwall bounced Washbrook and the England opener <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> hook shot. The ball flew {{in the air}} {{straight}} towards fine leg, where Hassett {{dropped the}} ball on the third attempt. At the time, Washbrook was on 21. The English batsman had moved to 78 when he again hooked Lindwall to long leg and was again dropped by Hassett. The Australian vice-captain responded by borrowing a helmet from a nearby policeman before humorously gesturing to indicate that he was ready for the next catch, much to the amusement of the crowd. On 80, Washbrook was dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson from the bowling of Toshack. After the day's play, Washbrook shouted Hassett a drink; England were in a strong position at 3/174, with an overall lead of 316. Luckily for Australia, the pair of missed chances from the England opener late in the day cost little. Washbrook remained unbeaten on 85 as England declared without further addition to their score midway through the last day; the entire fourth day and the final morning had been lost to rain. Hassett was not required as Australia batted for 61 overs to reach 1/92 and ensure that the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first to the ball and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E

5|$|The eighth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between then World Heavyweight Champion The Great Khali, Batista, and Kane. In the beginning, Khali {{dominated}} most of the match, applying a nerve hold on Kane and attacking Batista. Outside the ring, they both tried to perform their separate finishers on Khali, who countered both attempts. Batista and Kane performed a double-team spinebuster and chokeslam through a broadcast table. Kane performed a Chokeslam on Batista for a near-fall. Kane then retrieved a steel chair, but Batista countered a chair shot with a Spinebuster, and then performed a Batista Bomb on Kane. As Batista <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> pinfall, Khali pulled Batista outside the ring and threw Batista into the steel steps. Khali executed a Khali Bomb on Kane to win the match and retain the Title.|$|E
5|$|The first main {{match was}} for the WWE Championship, in which {{champion}} Rob Van Dam defended the title against Edge accompanied with Lita. In {{the beginning of the}} match, Edge performed a sunset flip powerbomb on Van Dam outside the ring. Van Dam, however, managed to execute a crossbody on Edge inside the ring, resulting in the two landing {{on the outside of the}} ring floor. Both men took the upper hand in the match, until Van Dam was scripted to knock the referee unconscious. Edge took advantage, as Lita gave him the title. Edge tried to hit Van Dam with the title, but Van Dam dodged the hit as he performed a spinning kick on the title, resulting in hitting Edge's face. Edge, however, got the advantage as he attempted to perform a shoulder block takedown on Van Dam, while Lita propped a chair on a ring corner. Edge <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shoulder block takedown, but Van Dam moved out of the way, resulting in Edge to crash head-first onto the chair. Capitalizing on the situation, Van Dam then performed a body splash from the top turnbuckle on Edge, which he followed with a cover and a pinfall, thus retaining the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage with a knee injury. The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E

25|$|During Agha Mohammad Shah's reign, provincial {{administration}} {{followed the same}} model of the Safavid one; beglerbegis were appointed to govern provinces. A city was {{under the rule of}} a kalantar and darugha, while its quarters was under the rule of the kadkhuda. Governorship of provinces <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part to tribal chieftains—this was later changed by Fath-Ali Shah Qajar, who appointed many of his relatives as governors.|$|E

After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E
