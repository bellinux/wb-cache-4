The woman {{featured on the}} cover of By the Way is Stella Schnabel, Julian Schnabel's daughter and Frusciante's then-girlfriend. Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: [...] "My girlfriend's father offered to do the album art, so <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn't be offended if we didn't like it, but we loved what he did. He's also given us great covers for all the singles. He's a true artist." ...|$|E

500|$|The Katyn {{massacre}} was {{beneficial to}} Nazi Germany, which {{used it to}} discredit the Soviet Union. On 14 April 1943, Goebbels wrote in his diary: [...] "We are now using the discovery of 12,000 Polish officers, murdered by the GPU, for anti-Bolshevik propaganda on a grand style. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> neutral journalists and Polish intellectuals {{to the spot where}} they were found. Their reports now reaching us from ahead are gruesome. The Führer has also given permission for us to hand out a drastic news item to the German press. I gave instructions to make the widest possible use of the propaganda material. We shall be able to live on it for a couple of weeks". The Germans won a major propaganda victory, portraying communism as a danger to [...] "Western civilization".|$|E
500|$|Dylan's {{performances}} in China in April 2011 generated controversy. Some criticised {{him for not}} making any explicit comment on the political situation in China, and for, allegedly, allowing the Chinese authorities to censor his set list. Others defended Dylan's performances, arguing that such criticism represented a misunderstanding of Dylan's art, and that no evidence for the censorship of Dylan's set list existed. In response to these allegations, Dylan posted a statement on his website: [...] "As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for {{the names of the}} songs that I would be playing. There's no logical answer to that, so <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> them the set lists from the previous 3 months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play." ...|$|E

500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> messengers to sound out the situation here [...] We did this so that when we arrive, we would be prepared to act"—they were just [...] "waiting for a date and for power," [...] referring to the brand-new warships.|$|E
500|$|Dan the Automator {{criticized the}} release, stating [...] "That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying to make a little bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|To prevent Channel Orange from leaking {{onto the}} Internet, Ocean planned {{to release it}} {{digitally}} one week earlier than its publicly announced date. He was inspired by Jay-Z and Kanye West, who prevented their 2011 album Watch the Throne from leaking by announcing several misleading release dates. On June 8, Ocean announced a July 17 release date and released a trailer for the album directed by Nabil Elderkin. On July 9, he made his television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed [...] "Bad Religion" [...] with backing from the show's house band The Roots and a strings section. The show announced the album's actual release date and vendor, Universal Music Group, who made it available on July 10 as a digital download on iTunes. Ocean said at the time, [...] "I haven't even held one in my hands ... The [...] are done, but when <b>we</b> <b>sent</b> them in, they were locked down at the manufacturer. They haven't left.

500|$|The Eldredge and Gould {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America in 1971. The symposium focused its attention on how modern microevolutionary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that [...] "Eldredge's 1971 publication [...] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly." [...] According to Gould [...] "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term punctuated equilibrium and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould." [...] In his book Time Frames Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair [...] "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Dimension {{took charge}} of the visual effects of the film. CG {{supervisor}} Jason Crosby pointed out that their studio was mainly selected for the highway sequence after the crew realized real logs only bounced about an inch off the road when dropped from a logging truck. [...] "They were concerned about how they would make the shot happen, not knowing if CG would work. The timing was great because we had just finished a test shot of our CG logs bouncing on the freeway. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> a tape to Vancouver and after seeing it the crew was convinced that any of the log shots could be done with CG," [...] Crosby indicated. [...] "It began with R on the log dynamics. Scripts were written to help manage the dynamic simulations with real world numbers for gravity, density, etc. The results were remarkably similar to the original logs shot in Vancouver, a testament to the accuracy of the software and the data we had collected, however the logs still lacked the 'jumping through windshields killer instinct' we were looking for. By tweaking the parameters, we coaxed the logs into a much livelier role." [...] Senior technical director James Coulter added creative 3D tracking on shots with fast pans, motion blur, and filters such as dust, mist, slabs of bark, broken chains, and other debris. Digital artist Edmund Kozin manipulated high resolution photos which were carefully stitched together to achieve realistic texture amongst the 22 CG logs of the film. Hair shaders were also inputed for splintering and frayed wood looks for the logs. Physics such as speed and height of the logging truck, length and width of the logs, type of wood and density of a Douglas-fir were also considered.|$|E

We knew the place was a free-fire zone and that Suharto was given the green light by the United States {{to do what he}} did. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> the Indonesian generals everything that you need to fight a major war against somebody who doesn't have any guns. <b>We</b> <b>sent</b> them rifles, ammunition, mortars, grenades, food, helicopters.
