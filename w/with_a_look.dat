5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true. At a conference meeting, he vows to keep his promise to make wishes and asks the office members to also be nice to his new girlfriend Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). An emotionally confused Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries {{to be nice to}} Jessica, but ends up drinking too much at the party. In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement. Andy subsequently drives away with a smile on his face.|$|E

25|$|However, Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson both {{reviewed}} and helped out with Lennox's second and most successful novel, The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella, and Henry Fielding praised the novel in his Covent Garden Journal. The Female Quixote was quite popular. It was reprinted and packaged {{in a series}} of great novels in 1783, 1799, and 1810. It was translated into German in 1754, French in 1773 and 1801, and Spanish in 1808. The novel formally inverts Don Quixote: as the don mistakes himself for the knightly hero of a Romance, so Arabella mistakes herself for the maiden love of a Romance. While the don thinks it his duty to praise the Platonically pure damsels he meets (such as the farm girl he loves), so Arabella believes it is in her power to kill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> and it is the duty of her lovers to suffer ordeals on her behalf.|$|E

While loved by devotees, its limited sales prompted LucasArts {{to back away from}} original adventures to simply exploit franchises." ...|$|E
500|$|In rehearsal, Haynes, Blanchett and Mara {{realized}} certain {{lines that}} either character {{did not need}} to say should be cut, which Haynes deemed the [...] "stylistic practice that we all took throughout the creative departments. I feel there was an understanding with them that words and dialogue were never carrying the weight of the story." [...] Costume Designer Sandy Powell said of working with Haynes, [...] "Todd is super visual, super prepared and he provides his own visuals {{at the beginning of the}} film. He starts <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> book of images that he's compiled over the months and months. He's almost OCD about it. In a good way." [...] The look of the film was influenced by the post-war color photography of Ruth Orkin, Esther Bubley, Helen Levitt, and Vivian Maier, as well as the abstract photography of Saul Leiter. Haynes used their works as a visual reference for depicting a [...] "dirty and sagging" [...] New York.|$|E
500|$|Butters and Fazekas {{stated that}} Underwood [...] "doesn’t quite {{understand}} what it’s {{like to be}} a normal woman" [...] after her upbringing in the program, and is intrigued by Carter. Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen anyone like [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E

500|$|The game's humour {{and style}} {{was shaped by}} {{hardware}} limitations; when the hardware rendered the character models in soft focus, the team noted that they resembled Plasticine models, and continued to create the game <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> and style akin to Wallace and Gromit. The game was presented with [...] "distinctive 'British' humour" [...] to distinguish from other games; lead programmer Leslie Benzies and artist Aaron Garbut often presented the team with other Nintendo 64 games, such as Super Mario 64 (1996), to identify the differences. The team ensured that each level felt distinct, while maintaining a coherent style. This diversity was achieved using the development tools, which allowed {{various members of the}} team to experiment in creating designs. Manual text writer Brian Baglow said that the game's music provided freedom to the team, as it [...] "doesn't necessarily have to fit the action on the screen". He explained that the audio was designed to fit with the [...] "cheesy, slightly twisted B-movies animation kind of feel". Baglow found that creating the music on a cartridge instead of a CD prompted the team to discover new techniques of working within the boundaries of the former, stating that [...] "people who are doing music for CD-based systems get very, very lazy".|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{learned of}} the deaths on the {{following}} morning when National Security Council staffer Michael Forrestal rushed into the cabinet room with a telegram reporting the Ngô brothers' alleged suicides. According to General Maxwell Taylor, [...] "Kennedy leaped {{to his feet and}} rushed from the room <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of shock and dismay on his face which I had never seen before." [...] Kennedy had planned that Ngô Đình Diệm would be safely exiled and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. recalled that the US President was [...] "somber and shaken". Kennedy later penned a memo, lamenting that the assassination was [...] "particularly abhorrent" [...] and blaming himself for approving Cable 243, which had authorised Lodge to explore coup options in the wake of Nhu's attacks on the Buddhist pagodas. Forrestal said that [...] "It shook him personally ... bothered him as a moral and religious matter. It shook his confidence, I think, in the kind of advice he was getting about South Vietnam." [...] When Kennedy was consoled by a friend who told him he need not feel sorry for the Ngô brothers on the grounds of despotism, Kennedy replied [...] "No. They were in a difficult position. They did the best they could for their country." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E

500|$|In September 2009, Susan Bower {{announced}} that Neighbours would introduce new opening titles for the 25th anniversary {{and they would}} feature a bit of [...] "bling". The titles were created by Visual Playground, who shot a series of scenes featuring the cast in settings familiar to viewers. The titles made their debut on 18 March 2010. A new set of opening titles made their debut on 15 April 2013, along with {{a new version of}} the theme tune. Visual Playground once again created and produced the titles. The titles depict the Ramsay Street residents gathering outside their houses for a street party. A writer for Visual Playground explained that they [...] "invented a bokeh graphic device that uses the play of light in a formation to locate the houses in the cul-de-sac. Six overlapping circles represent the six houses of Ramsay St and the off street cast members. All the circles together reinforce the sense of community that makes up Neighbours." [...] A new retro-inspired logo, theme tune and opening titles debuted on 5 January 2015 as part of the show's 30th anniversary celebrations. The new logo is a reimagined contemporary version of the original Neighbours logo from 1985. The titles show characters in a variety of familiar settings around Erinsborough and ends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at Ramsay Street from above.|$|E
500|$|For Dunne, the Dooley {{pieces were}} a burden, {{but one that}} brought him fame and money, neither of which was enough to keep him at his desk once he gained the Whitney legacy. Before he died in 1936, Dunne knew that {{interest}} in the Dooley pieces was fading, and this saddened him. [...] Understanding that readers were having trouble with the Irish dialect, he experimented with translating the columns into ordinary English, but published none in that form. In 1938, The New Republic noted in an article, [...] "if you try quoting Mr. Dooley's brogue to the average listener you will be rewarded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> of intense pain. But if you translate Mr. Dooley into ordinary English nearly everything precipitates out as pure wisdom." [...] Ellis, writing in 1941, argued, [...] "that the Dooley essays are journalism of the finest type few will dispute; that they are literature in the more permanent sense {{may not be so}} clear. Were the American-Irish brogue of Mr. Dooley still a living and growing language there might be no doubt about it, but Mr. Dooley's language has become at least obsolescent, and that puts the future of the Dooley essay in serious question." [...] Ellis noted that attempts to imitate Dunne's success with other Irish-dialect columns failed, and suggested the brogue was not essential to the originals' [...] popularity, [...] "Dunne's essays lose nothing today when translated into ordinary English words".|$|E
500|$|The German Army Group Centre (where {{the main}} attack fell) underestimated Soviet {{infantry}} by 40%, mechanized forces by 300% {{and the number}} of tanks as 400 to 1800, instead of the 4000 to 5200 in fact arrayed against them. The German high command (OKH) and Adolf Hitler grossly underestimated the threat to Army Group Centre, confidently redeploying a third of its artillery, half its tank destroyers and 88% of its tanks to the Southern front where OKH expected the Soviet attack. Only 580 German armoured vehicles were in place for the battle. In the battle, Army Group Centre was almost totally destroyed, losing its Fourth Army encircled east of Minsk, its 3rd Panzer Army (LIII Corps encircled in Vitebsk), and its Ninth Army encircled east of Bobruisk. In military historian Bruce Pirnie's view, [...] "the Germans were more completely fooled prior to Operation Bagration than they had been prior to Operation Uranus [...] ". Pirnie concluded, based largely on Bagration and Uranus <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at other Second World War operations, that the Soviet military deception in Bagration was unsophisticated, but [...] "clever and effective". The Soviets succeeded in distorting OKH's intelligence picture, given that German intelligence had to rely mainly on [...] radio intercept, aerial photography and agents left behind in the territory they had once held. Stavka deceived OKH by playing to their three sources of information; Stavka systematically denied the Germans real intelligence on Red Army forces as they concentrated for the attack, and revealed other real and simulated forces in other places. However Stavka may have come to do this, it [...] "played well to the Germans' mental attitude".|$|E
