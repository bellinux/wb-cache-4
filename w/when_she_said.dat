5|$|Dickinson remembers {{relationships}} with fellow celebrities including Sylvester Stallone, Liam Neeson, Warren Beatty, Mick Jagger, and Jack Nicholson. She enjoys her celebrity status and her time with friends John Belushi, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Belushi and Dickinson enable each other's predilections for abusing drugs. She regularly spends time at Studio 54 during this period. Dickinson recounts a {{darker side of}} celebrity, and writes that she trusted in Bill Cosby when he informed her he could help her career in show business, only to experience verbal anger from him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she {{was too tired to}} engage in sexual activity with him.|$|E
5|$|Her book Intercourse, which {{addresses}} {{the role of}} sexual intercourse in society, has been interpreted as opposing all heterosexual intercourse, but Dworkin said it does not and that what she was against was male domination by intercourse. Some critics of Dworkin accused her of supporting incest, and she sued for defamation, but a court did not forbid the criticism. She subsequently wrote much in opposition to incest. She wrote some fiction, some of which was held for a time by Canadian customs authorities before it was released, giving rise to a controversy over whether her support for antipornography law had led to the seizure of her own work. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> she was drugged and raped in a hotel in 1999, controversy over {{the truth of the}} allegations followed. In her later years, she suffered from severe osteoarthritis, which limited her mobility. She died of acute myocarditis at the age of 58.|$|E
5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with the Blade of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed the Blade and departed as Kratos collapsed next to the Blade of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from the Blade with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E

25|$|McCaughey faced {{problems}} with Pataki and Pataki's staff from the start. It is reported that Pataki {{did not like}} McCaughey's relationship with the press or her public discussion of policy differences the two had. McCaughey also lost support from Pataki <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that D'Amato had made suggestive comments to her.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, {{when he was}} 21 and {{a student}} at the University of California, Berkeley, London searched for and read the {{newspaper}} accounts of his mother's suicide attempt and the name of his biological father. He wrote to William Chaney, then living in Chicago. Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> he insisted on an abortion. Chaney concluded by saying that he was more to be pitied than London. London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.|$|E
25|$|King Charles was {{executed}} by Parliament in 1649; his death left Henrietta Maria almost destitute and in shock, a situation not {{helped by the}} French civil war of the Fronde, which left Henrietta Maria's nephew King Louis XIV short of money himself. Henrietta Maria also {{was no longer the}} Queen but the Queen Mother to the young King Charles II. During the ensuing, and final, Third English Civil War the whole of the Royalist circle now based itself from St-Germain, with the Queen Mother's followers being joined by the old Royalist circle who had been with Charles II at the Hague, including Ormonde and Inchiquin and Clarendon, whom she particularly disliked. She also quarrelled with Ormonde: <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that if she had been trusted the King would be in England, Ormonde, with his usual bluntness, retorted that if she had never been trusted the King need never have left England. Co-location began to bring the factions together, but Henrietta Maria's influence was waning. In 1654, Charles II moved his court on to Cologne, eliminating the remaining influence of the Queen Mother in St-Germain.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{stated that}} the [...] "sophisticated love song" [...] is {{difficult}} to class by genre because it was [...] "unconventional", something which Cole agreed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] " [...] totally different from anything I've done [...] or liked before". Some industry critics also noted that [...] "3 Words" [...] was [...] "unlike many things currently [...] on radio or being released". Cole said that the song took its inspiration froms her newly acquired love for dance music on the charts, especially David Guetta & Kelly Rowland's [...] "When Love Takes Over".|$|E
500|$|Gittings {{appeared}} in the documentary films Gay Pioneers, Before Stonewall, After Stonewall, Out of the Past, and Pride Divide. In 1991 she remembered her decisions to be as open as she was throughout her life <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Every time I {{had to make a}} decision to put myself forward or to stay back, to use my real name or not, to go on television or decline, to get out on some of the earliest picket lines or remain behind.

500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was similar}} to what Naomi Watts construed, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> in an interview, [...] "I thought Diane was the real character and that Betty was the person {{she wanted to be}} and had dreamed up. Rita is the damsel in distress and she's in absolute need of Betty, and Betty controls {{her as if she were}} a doll. Rita is Betty's fantasy of who she wants Camilla to be." [...] Watts' own early experiences in Hollywood parallel those of Diane's. She endured some professional frustration before she became successful, auditioned for parts in which she did not believe, and encountered people who did not follow through with opportunities. She recalled, [...] "There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely." ...|$|E
500|$|Barney was {{notoriously}} non-monogamous, a {{fact that}} the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, {{at a time when the}} writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and the mother of two daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel. Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Civilized beings are those who know how to take more from life than others." [...] Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. [...] Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.|$|E
500|$|In November 2016, Madonna, who {{actively}} supported Hillary Clinton {{during the}} 2016 U.S. presidential election, performed an impromptu acoustic concert at Washington Square Park {{in support of}} Clinton's campaign. Upset that Donald Trump won the election, Madonna spoke out against him at the Women's March on Washington, a day after his inauguration. The singer sparked controversy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she [...] "thought a lot about blowing up the White House". The following day, she asserted she was [...] "not a violent person" [...] and that her quote had been [...] "taken wildly out of context", adding [...] "I spoke in metaphor and I shared two {{ways of looking at}} things â€” one was to be hopeful, and one was to feel anger and outrage". In February 2017, Madonna adopted four-year-old twin sisters from Malawi named Esther and Stella. In late summer 2017, Madonna moved to Lisbon, Portugal with her adoptive children.|$|E

500|$|Ten {{thousand}} {{copies of}} The Story of Miss Moppet were released in a panorama format priced at a shilling in November 1906, and another 10,000 copies in December 1906. There were no subsequent printings in the panorama format.

Lear explains that the format [...] "although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful, because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded". Potter referred to this fact late in life <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long stripsâ€”The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again".

500|$|Bazna married twice; {{with his}} first wife, whom he later divorced, he had four {{children}}. He had several live-in mistresses, one of whom, Mara, was a nursemaid {{to the children of}} David Busk, a British ambassador. Mara lived with him in the KavaklÄ±dere hills in a small house that he called [...] "Cicero Villa". Their relationship was tumultuous and Bazna ended the affair due to their fighting and her jealousy. However, she was loyal to him and passed important information to him twice, once about the upcoming arrival of British security men at the embassy and the second time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she had heard rumors that the Germans had a good source of intelligence. Once he began seeing a new mistress, Esra, his relationship with Mara ended permanently. After Esra, he took a woman named Aika as his mistress and set her up in an apartment. She left after his pound notes were determined to be counterfeit. He then married for a second time to a woman named Duriet and had four more children.|$|E
500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939â€“2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physicallyâ€”any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.

Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called their return a [...] "sight-for-sore-eyes". Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune thought Rose was speaking for the fans <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>said</b> [...] "If you say 'live together, die alone' to me, Jack, I'm going to punch you in your face", and hoped Rose and Bernard would feature more often in future episodes. The couple were ranked twelfth in IGN's list of the top fifteen characters from the first three seasons. The critics from IGN also liked Rose's [...] "live together, die alone" [...] line, which they called [...] "both surprising comic relief and the stuff of solid character development; characters like Rose remember and evolve, even if they {{spend most of their}} time on the sidelines". The couple were called [...] "the unofficial heart of the show" [...] by the critics, who noted every appearance made by them was a welcome one. Erin Martell from TV Squad thought Rose's role in [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] was [...] "awesome", because she asked all the questions fans have been asking.|$|E
500|$|The International Olympic Committee {{commissioned}} a song by BjÃ¶rk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.
