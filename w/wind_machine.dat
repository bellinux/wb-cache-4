5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for <b>wind</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
25|$|The {{front cover}} of the album's UK {{pressing}} depicts an artistic black-and-white Dada-esque chequered design featuring a nude woman, which resembled little regarding the music or the band. The back cover included photographs of each member {{in front of a}} <b>wind</b> <b>machine,</b> distorting their faces. The sleeve, designed and photographed by Laurence Sackman and co-ordinated by Graphreaks, was deemed inappropriate by the American record distributors, resulting in the sleeve for the American pressing replaced by a photograph of the band, by which time Howe had replaced Banks, though a picture of Banks remained on the back cover on both pressings. Howe has said it was rejected because it was sexist, and got angry at Atlantic for continually pressing the album with the picture of him on the front. The picture of the group for the American cover was taken by Barrie Wentzell at his studio in Wardour Street, London.|$|E
40|$|A coil <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> is a <b>machine</b> for <b>winding</b> coil onto a spool, bobbin {{and many}} more. This coil <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> {{is one of}} types of <b>winding</b> <b>machine</b> that {{available}} in industries today.

500|$|An {{important}} sequence {{within the}} episode was the time-shift which ends in Tommy returning to 1918.

Anthony Lewis described the <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> used as [...] "the biggest <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> I've {{ever seen in my}} life". [...] He comments that the intensity of the <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> and the lighting enabled an [...] "instant-made reaction" [...] from himself and Mori. Goddard added that his first assistant director was [...] "instrumental in gearing up all the extras into a frenzy". The episode's soundtrack included the song [...] "One of These Mornings" [...] by Moby, which featured the vocals of Patti Labelle, from his 2002 album, 18. The track heard in the pub scene is [...] "She's Got You High" [...] from Mumm-Ra's 2007 debut album These Things Move in Threes.|$|E

Furthermore, a photo double stood in for Leah Cairns in some scenes when Cairns was unavailable to play Tatha.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Tippett {{produced}} three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). [...] The symphony, {{written in the}} manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a <b>wind</b> <b>machine,</b> although other means have been tried, with mixed resultsâ€”according to Bowen [...] "the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". [...] The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in [...] "finding a sound" [...] that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments [...] perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.|$|E

Adam Smith called them [...] "an {{absolute}} nightmare to film with" [...] because {{it took a long time}} for them to get ready and they had to stand still for long periods of time. Smith wished River Song's entrance to be a shocking surprise to the audience. A stunt double was used for some shots of the scene where River flies out of the Byzantium airlock, but Kingston wished to do some of it herself. The scene was filmed on a greenscreen with Kingston hooked up on wires that pulled her up and backwards as a <b>wind</b> <b>machine</b> was blown to create the effect of the airlock. Kingston said she [...] "absolutely loved" [...] filming the scene. For the scene in which sand pours out of Amy's eye as she rubs it, an eye patch containing sand that would be released when Gillan rubbed it was placed over her eye.|$|E

To maintain secrecy of the episode's plot, the model shark was given the codename [...] "Clive".
