While in this book Hollenbach does look to his major {{influences}} such as Aquinas for inspiration, it mainly focuses on Hollenbach's attempt to define the [...] "common good" [...] and find what contrasts this good. Building on his earlier writings, Hollenbach emphasizes relationships as being the source of the common good. There are certain goods that Hollenbach states are essential for modern day democracies to be successful. These goods include mutual respect, self-determination, and individual agency. Hollenbach points out that these essential goods are completely social and depend solely on human interaction. Ultimately this book is a study on how we as humans relate with one another and what <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> better our relationships with one another. Some points of interest that Hollenbach discusses are racism and marginalization.|$|E
