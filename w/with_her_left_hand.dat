5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
25|$|Even {{as a young}} child, {{she wanted}} to be a musician. There was always a piano in the house. She took lessons until a {{conflict}} with her teacher about writing <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
25|$|By 1962, {{she begins}} using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her {{monochrome}} images {{due to their}} large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. The palette of these images often contrast one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963, the wrist she used to paint with. Since she still wanted to work, she painted <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> instead. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained since she is working <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E

25|$|The nude {{woman is}} in fact not perched side-saddle on the horse. As others have pointed out (Antliff and Leighten), and as emerges upon close examination, the nude woman is seated on {{what appears to be}} a {{rectangular}} block or cube, perhaps a model's pedestal (visible to the left). The horse occupies the upper right-hand quadrant as if observed from above. Its head is turned toward the monumental nude while she strokes the horses right ear <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> She cups her hand underneath the horse's mouth, as if feeding the horse a piece of fruit.|$|E
25|$|On March 12, 2011, Giffords's husband {{informed}} her that six {{other people had}} been killed in the attack on her, but he did not identify who they were until months later. In late April, Giffords's doctors reported that her physical, cognitive, and language production abilities had improved significantly, placing her in the top 5 percent of patients recovering from similar injuries. She was walking under supervision with perfect control of her left arm and leg, and able to write <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> She was able to read and understand, and spoke in short phrases. With longer efforts, she was able to produce more complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Mother Bernard, MacKillop was once more elected unopposed as {{superior}} general in 1899, a position she held until her own death. During the later {{years of her life}} she had many problems with her health which continued to deteriorate. She suffered from rheumatism and after a stroke in Auckland, New Zealand in 1902, became paralysed on her right side. For seven years, she had to rely on a wheelchair to move around, but her speech and mind were as good as ever and her letter writing had continued unabated after she learned to write <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Even after suffering the stroke, the Josephite nuns had enough confidence in her to re-elect her in 1905.|$|E
6000|$|Claire {{stumbled}} to <b>her</b> feet, stood <b>with</b> <b>her</b> clenched {{right hand}} to her trembling lips, cupping it <b>with</b> <b>her</b> nervous <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>Her</b> shoulders were dejected. Milt pleaded, [...] "Let's hike out. I don't mind decent honest grease, but this place--look in at table! Dirty dishes---- And gin bottles on the floor!" ...|$|R

500|$|Hazelton {{suffered}} a stroke in 1952, which required her to switch to painting <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] She died at the Newton-Wellesley Hospital on September 13, 1953.|$|E
500|$|... "She is able {{to shoot}} two balls from her {{crossbow}} one after another and make the second ball strike the first and break it in mid-air. Another trick she {{can do is to}} place a ball on the ground, and, by pulling the bow backwards <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> while her right hand draws the bow from behind her back, hit it. Out of a hundred shots, she does not miss a single one.|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides of}} the florin were {{redesigned}} following the accession of Victoria's son, Edward VII, each design being created by the Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint, George William de Saulles. [...] The florin of King Edward VII was minted every year from 1902 to 1910. Its specifications remained at 11.3 grams weight and 28.5 millimetres diameter. The obverse shows the right-facing head of the King, inscribed ,, while the other side features what Coincraft's Standard Catalogue of English and UK Coins deems [...] "a most unusual and original reverse". [...] It shows a windswept figure of Britannia standing holding a shield <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and a trident with her right, and inscribed , with the date below. [...] Peter Seaby, in his history of British coinage, described the figure of Britannia as [...] "standing on some mythical ancient ship which could hardly be sea-worthy under her weight", but [...] "a pleasing composition".|$|E
60|$|She stooped {{and tried}} {{to pick up the}} things she had let fall upon the floor; but she seemed not able to find them. He bent over, and, {{gathering}} them together, returned them to <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> keeping the other in the breast of his coat.|$|R
40|$|The view of {{the female}} statue is from left. The many folds of the draped {{clothing}} are visible. The statue's right hand is outreached <b>with</b> palm upward. <b>Her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> hangs loosely at <b>her</b> side <b>with</b> something lightly held in her hand. The pleats and gathers of the sleeve face the viewer. Her hair is wavy and {{held in place by}} her crown...|$|R
50|$|The obverse of this medal {{bears the}} effigy of the reigning monarch while the reverse has {{the figure of}} Justice <b>with</b> scales in <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and a wreath in her right {{surrounded}} by the inscription 'FOR EXEMPLARY POLICE SERVICE'. The suspender is straight and found in both swivelling and non-swivelling formats.No bars are authorised for this medal. Naming on the rim is in impressed capital letters.|$|R
500|$|In the Vishnudharmottara Purana, Kubera is {{described}} {{as the embodiment of}} both Artha ("wealth, prosperity, glory") and Arthashastras, the treatises related to it—and his iconography mirrors it. Kubera's complexion {{is described}} as that of lotus leaves. He rides a man—the state personified, adorned in golden clothes and ornaments, symbolizing his wealth. His left eye is yellow. He wears an armour and a necklace down to his large belly. The Vishnudharmottara Purana further describes his face to be inclined to the left, sporting a beard and mustache, and with two small tusks protruding from the ends of his mouth, representing his powers to punish and to bestow favours. His wife Riddhi, representing the journey of life, is seated on his left lap, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> on the back of Kubera and the right holding a ratna-patra (jewel-pot). Kubera should be four-armed, holding a gada (mace: symbol of [...] dandaniti—administration of justice) and a shakti (power) in his left pair, and standards bearing a lion—representing Artha and a shibika (a club, the weapon of Kubera). The nidhi treasures Padma and Shankha stand beside him in human form, with their heads emerging from a lotus and a conch respectively.|$|E
500|$|The double-tiered, {{white marble}} {{fountain}} {{rests on a}} concrete base. [...] The upper basin of the fountain, which is approximately [...] high and [...] wide and weighs 15 tons, {{is supported by a}} 8-ton shaft adorned with three allegorical figures, the Arts of Ocean Navigation. [...] The figures, which are approximately [...] tall and [...] wide and weigh 12 tons, represent the Sea, the Stars and the Wind. [...] The Sea is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] Her left foot rests on a dolphin. [...] The Stars is a nude female figure with long hair holding a globe in her left hand and is faced downward. [...] The Wind is a nude male figure draped with a ship sail. [...] He is holding a conch shell with his left hand to use as a horn and is facing right. [...] The water pours over the upper basin into a large lower basin that is approximately [...] tall. [...] The inscription on the outer rim of the lower basin states: [...] "THIS MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN REPLACES A STATUE ERECTED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES IN RECOGNITION OF HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICES. SAMUEL FRANCIS DUPONT UNITED STATES NAVY 1803 - 1865." [...] The circular concrete base features four sets of three steps that lead to the surrounding plaza. [...] Six radial paths corresponding to the surrounding streets lead from the plaza to the edges of the park.|$|E
500|$|The statue {{rests on}} a {{rectangular}} bronze base which is itself {{on top of a}} low granite base. [...] The base is [...] high, [...] long, and [...] wide. [...] It weights approximately [...] [...] A bald eagle symbolizing Patriotism adorns the upper section of each corner of the bronze base. [...] Around the inscription [...] "LOGAN" [...] are palm leaves symbolizing Victory. [...] These are located on the east and west sides of the lower portion of the bronze base. [...] The relief {{on the west side of}} the base depicts Logan surrounded by fellow officers discussing the Civil War. [...] The officers include Generals Francis Preston Blair, Jr., Dodge, William Babcock Hazen, Mortimer Dormer Leggett, Joseph A. Mower, and Henry Warner Slocum, and Captain Bill Strong. [...] On Logan's proper right is a map spread on a table with three of the officers studying it. [...] The remaining officers are looking towards Logan who has his left hand resting on the map. [...] The relief on the east side of the base depicts Logan being sworn into office as a senator by Vice President Arthur. [...] Logan's right arm is raised while Arthur's left hand is raised and holding a book. [...] Other senators depicted in the relief include Roscoe Conkling, Cullom, William M. Evarts, John F.

2500|$|Hill and Benjamin {{also created}} a charity challenge, modeled after the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, known as [...] "Layup4Lauren". Because her cancer caused {{dizziness}} and weakened her normally dominant right hand, {{she was forced to}} shoot primarily <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> The challenge involves spinning in a complete circle three times, and then making a layup with one's non-dominant hand.|$|E
2500|$|In Philadelphia Museum of Art's Portrait of Madame Augustine Roulin and Baby Marcelle Augustine holds baby Marcelle who {{was born}} in July, 1888. [...] The mother, relaxed and her face in a shadow, is passive. [...] We can see by the size of Augustine's sloping shoulders, arm, and hands that she worked hard {{to take care of her}} family. For instance, there were no modern conveniences like washing machines. [...] In a {{traditional}} pose of mothers and new babies, Augustine is holding her baby upright, supporting the baby's back by her right arm and steadying the baby's midsection <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> Marcelle, whose face is directed outward, is more active and engages the audience. [...] Van Gogh used heavy outlines in blue around the images of mother and baby.|$|E
2500|$|One {{side of the}} Warren Cup {{depicts a}} [...] "bearded man" [...] and a [...] "beardless youth" [...] {{engaging}} in anal sex in a reclining position, with the youth lowering himself using a strap or sash to be penetrated. A boy watches from behind a door. The two figures {{do not appear to}} be a great difference in age and are of a similar size. The apparent weight of the upper figure, as he lowers himself onto his lover's penis using the support, makes this a non-traditional passive role. The use of a strap or support during sex can be found in other Greek and Roman artworks, a close example being an erotic cup by Onesimos where a woman spreads her legs in anticipation while grasping a strap <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
40|$|A 19 -year-old female with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) {{presented}} <b>with</b> ischemia of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> following trauma. Medical {{therapy was}} initiated {{but failed to}} improve her symptoms, and revision amputation was ultimately performed. The patient’s final diagnosis was digital ischemia due to secondary Raynaud’s Phenomenon (RP). The authors discuss diagnosis, complications, and treatment of this relatively uncommon disorder. The authors report this case {{in order to discuss}} how secondary RP can be complicated by ischemia and the multidisciplinary approach that needs to take place to prevent the latter from occurring...|$|R
50|$|Another {{fairly common}} variant is the organ trio, {{comprising}} electric organ (typically a Hammond B-3), drums, and usually electric guitar. The bassist is excluded, and the organist instead plays the bassline <b>with</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> (on a keyboard) or their feet (on the bass pedalboard). Organists Jimmy Smith and Jack McDuff and guitarists Grant Green and Wes Montgomery {{are among the}} musicians who have worked in this format. The original line-up of the Tony Williams Lifetime featured Williams (drums); John McLaughlin (guitar); and Larry Young (organ).|$|R
50|$|St. Vincent is {{a public}} artwork by an unknown artist located {{on the grounds of}} St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. The {{sculpture}} sits in front of the entrance to an annex building and is made of marble and sits on a granite base.

To his side is a young girl holding the front of <b>her</b> dress up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> She is wearing a small locket around her neck as she looks up at the saint. The sculpture stands 6 feet tall. This piece was surveyed by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! in 1993.|$|R
2500|$|John McNamara, Esq., gave {{evidence}} {{that on the}} evening of 7 April, he believed at some time after eleven o'clock, {{he came out of the}} playhouse with Martha Ray, and having seen her [...] "in some difficulties at the playhouse", offered his help in handing her to her carriage. She took his arm. As they came out of the passage into the Covent Garden playhouse and were two steps from the carriage, he heard the report of a pistol, while Miss Ray was still holding his right arm <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> She fell instantly. He thought the pistol had been [...] "fired out of wantonness" [...] and that Miss Ray had fainted. He knelt to help her, but found blood on his hands, and got her into the Shakspeare tavern. He did not see Hackman at the time, but after he had been arrested, asked him what had possessed him, and he answered [...] "that it was not a proper place to ask that question, or something to that effect... I asked him his name, and I understood from him that his name was Hackman; I think he pronounced his name with an H. I asked him if he knew anybody. He said, he knew a Mr. Booth, in Craven-street in the Strand, and desired he might be sent for. He desired to see the lady. I did not tell him she was dead; somebody else did. I objected to his seeing her at that time. I had her removed into another room. From the great quantity of blood I had about me I got sick, and was obliged to go home. I know no more about it." ...|$|E

The figure of [...] "History", on the proper right, holds a tablet on <b>her</b> lap <b>with</b> <b>her</b> proper <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> and a writing tool in her proper right hand. Her hair is knotted {{at the back of}} her head. A book rests beneath her proper right foot. The allegorical figures would be approximately [...] tall, if standing. The pedestal rests on a three-stepped platform. It is executed in Baveno granite from quarries at Lake Maggiore, Italy, and was chosen for its structural excellence and color. The granite used in the monument was the first of its kind to be imported into the United States.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they reached}} the temple, a single room, {{surrounded}} by a spacious paved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people. Before the image there were pools of blood, where victims had lately been slaughtered. In the sanctum was Devi, a large black figure with ten arms. With a spear {{in one of her}} right hands she pierced the giant Mahisha; and <b>with</b> one of <b>her</b> <b>left</b> <b>hands</b> she held the tail of a serpent, and the hair of the giant, whose breast the serpent was biting.
