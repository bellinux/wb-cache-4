500|$|Conor Behan of The Independent {{qualified}} {{the clip}} as being [...] "effortlessly sexy". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the video {{for the song}} as the most NSFW from the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out referred to the clip for [...] "Partition" [...] as a classic MTV video. A more negative review came from The Verge Trent Wolbe who panned Nava's contribution to the album as uninteresting. The Daily Telegraph writer Sarah Crompton stated that the video looked suitable for a porn website and described its imagery as [...] "strip club dressed up as a Busby Berkeley musical". Crompton went on to call the message the video sent [...] "peculiar" [...] and added that the singer should try to become a better role model for young girls. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-uk commented that such visuals showed that Beyoncé had [...] "sold out" [...] and undermined her position as a [...] "role model" [...] and previous [...] "powerful messages that empowered women and girls". In early March 2014, Bill O'Reilly criticized the video for [...] "Partition" [...] during his show The O'Reilly Factor broadcast on Fox News. He said that it represented glorification of sex {{in the back of}} a limousine and offered critique that teenage girls are influenced by the singer, adding, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies... and fractured families [...] I think Beyoncé, what she has done here, is inexplicable". In response to these claims, Rutger University's Kevin Allred argues that [...] "Beyonce isn’t sensationalizing her own body and putting it on display for viewers to gawk at. Rather, she performs the historical objectification of black female bodies and replays that objectification in order to point out that, stereotypically, black women have had few means of garnering attention beyond sexual performances. She goes so far as forcing the viewer to be complicit in this objectification by positioning them as the direct viewer of the show she is enacting." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2014 BET Awards. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated in the categories for Best Choreography and Best Female Video.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> How would she take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|E
6000|$|... "What are {{you talking}} about, Jeff Durgin?" [...] Cynthia demanded, severely. [...] "What would your mother do? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> this winter?" ...|$|E
60|$|She acted of her {{own free}} will. What <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> and made nobody responsible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor' bless you, Miss, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for you; {{she said the}} other day <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> and that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not care whether she lost her place or not; <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not want to stop with thieves. Oh, you may depend on her, Miss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, [...] "but as my Majesty promised <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> has {{returned}} to her lawful place {{at the side of}} Pharaoh--never to leave it more." ...|$|R
6000|$|Madge sobbed out {{the whole}} story disconsolately. Burton's father would not let him marry {{her because she was}} an Oliver. And, oh, what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Would she cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|E
6000|$|Siegmund {{went back}} to his seat. He was relieved, but he trembled with sickness. We are all glad when intense moments are done with; but why did she fling round in that manner, {{stopping}} the keen note short; what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Silence!' said Stephen, staunch to Elfride {{in spite}} of himself. 'She would harm nobody wilfully, never <b>would</b> <b>she!</b> How <b>do</b> you come here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Uncle Pentstemon, {{raising his}} voice defiantly: [...] "Trounce 'er again I <b>would</b> if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> as much now. That I would! Dratted mischief!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But nought <b>would</b> <b>she</b> to <b>do</b> with he, [...] But {{turned her}} face away; [...] So gat he gone to far countrye, [...] And left that lady gay.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know how}} that may be, but he hasn't done it yet. Come, father; you don't like the man any more than she does. If {{you get tired of}} him in three days, what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> in her whole life?' ...|$|E
60|$|Making {{a violent}} effort she sat up. The silence of Ciccio {{in his bed}} was as horrible {{as the rest of}} the night. She had a horror of him also. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do,</b> where should she flee? She was lost--lost--lost utterly.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes, though, Tommy felt uneasy. It {{was plain}} {{to be seen}} that Bessie had set her heart on that doll. And what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when the doll was sold, as would {{probably}} happen soon? Tommy thought Bessie would feel awful sad, {{and he would be}} responsible for it.|$|E
5000|$|When Kate {{learns that}} Heath is her cousin's fiancé, she pretends {{that she had}} only been flirting because she thinks that {{falling in love with}} a man who is about to marry someone else is not appropriate. She vows to act in the proper way, {{the way in which the}} {{characters}} in her [...] "modern" [...] novels <b>would.</b> <b>She</b> <b>does</b> her best to bring Heath and Aimee back together again, even though she still loves Heath.|$|R
6000|$|Suppose {{the case}} of an average young lady (conscious of feeling a first love) to whom I might have spoken in the sense that I have just mentioned--what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have <b>done?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|Poor little thing, {{he found}} her meek and {{penitent}} for her unjust anger towards himself. Whatever he desired <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> stay or go with him anywhere except to a sermon at the Moustier, and <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not think that in her heart her good father desired little infants to be beaten--least of all Berenger's little one. And with Rayonette already on his knee, stealing his spectacles, peace was made.|$|R
6000|$|Fifteen {{minutes longer}} did Mary Margaret watch restlessly at the window. Then she {{concluded}} {{that something was}} desperately wrong somewhere. It was half an hour after sunset and the Big Dipper light, {{the most important one}} along the whole coast, was not lighted. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> What could she do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{what the}} devil <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> with a house like this? She doesn't {{know how to}} live in it now she has got it. I have {{provided}} for her; it matters not how. The house and the estate, and the remainder of my money, I have left to Louis Philippe." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{great black}} mass {{brooding}} over our very mastheads began to pivot {{away from the}} ship's side silently. And now I forgot the secret stranger ready to depart, and remembered only that I was a total stranger to the ship. I did not know her. <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it? How was she to be handled? ...|$|E
60|$|Bob wondered, {{in his own}} mind, what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if <b>she</b> {{was making}} bad weather.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hope {{a coyote}} doesn't come along," [...] she said. That possibility, however, did not worry {{her as much}} as getting those packs up on the King. How in the world <b>would</b> <b>she</b> ever <b>do</b> it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Your {{hopes and}} ambitions were so simple,’ I <b>would</b> say, but <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not like that. ‘They werena that simple,’ <b>she</b> <b>would</b> answer, flushing.|$|R
6000|$|Anne felt a queer little {{sensation}} of dismayed surprise. She {{had not known}} this; she had expected that Gilbert would be going to Redmond also. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> without their inspiring rivalry? Would not work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be rather flat without her friend the enemy? ...|$|E
6000|$|Goody Grace, who {{was looking}} after the {{children}} till the stepmother could be found, came and expostulated with Patience, telling her she was foolish to miss such a chance, {{and that she would}} find out her mistake when Stead married and that little flighty, light-headed wench made the place too hot to hold her. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> then? ...|$|E
60|$|She was at sea again now, {{and evening}} was {{falling on the}} waters softly as a dream. Well, the letter was posted. Would it be the last, she wondered? It seemed as though she must write no more letters. And {{what was to be}} done? She would not marry Owen Davies--never <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it. She could not so shamelessly violate her feelings, for Beatrice was a woman to whom death would be {{preferable}} to dishonour, however legal. No, for her own sake she would not be soiled with that disgrace. Did she do this, she would hold herself the vilest of the vile. And still less <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> it for Geoffrey's sake. Her instinct told her what he would feel at such a thing, though he might never say a word. Surely he would loathe and despise her. No, that idea was done with--utterly done with.|$|E
30|$|Patient 1 : And <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it {{at every}} session.|$|R
50|$|Olney {{opposes the}} {{building}} of a third runway at Heathrow Airport. On the topic of Brexit, Olney voted against the triggering of Article 50, as she had indicated during the by-election campaign that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> believes another referendum should be held once the exact terms of Britain's exit from the EU have been announced.|$|R
60|$|Seeing that a {{prolonged}} struggle <b>would</b> follow if <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not get up, Nedda rose and changed chairs.|$|R
60|$|But {{how would}} Beatrice fare? Would she come to herself safely? He thought so, {{it was only}} a fainting fit. But when she did recover, what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Nothing rash, he prayed. And what could {{be the end of it}} all? Who might say? How {{fortunate}} that the sister had been so sound asleep. Somehow he did not trust Elizabeth--he feared her.|$|E
60|$|Siegmund {{could find}} no answer. He tried to imagine her life. It would go on, after his death, just in the same way, for a while, and then? He had not the faintest {{knowledge}} of how she would develop. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> when she was thirty-eight, and as old as himself? He could not conceive. Yet she would not die, of that he was certain.|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll {{be before}} I want to," [...] she replied; {{and at that}} he marched {{out of the house}} with his bundle. She sat {{trembling}} slightly, but her heart brimming with contempt. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>do</b> if he went to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman? But she knew him too well--he couldn't. She was dead sure of him. Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.|$|E
50|$|Per Degaton {{told her}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} terrible, destroying the world.|$|R
60|$|There was a moment's {{suspense}} {{for those}} {{watching to see}} if Cynthia <b>would</b> take it. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> take it.|$|R
6000|$|Knowing, of course, {{what the}} advice <b>would</b> be, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not press him further, {{and was about}} to beckon Marty forward and leave him, when he {{interrupted}} her with, [...] "Oh, one moment, dear Grace--you will meet me again?" ...|$|R
