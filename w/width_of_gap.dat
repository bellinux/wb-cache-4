Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, forty single rooted teeth were prepared and apical portion of the roots were immersed in sulfuric acid to produce open apices.

Then, a 4 -mm apical plug of CEM cement was placed in canals; each root was prepared for observation using scanning electron microscope and the maximum distance between CEM cement and surrounding dentin was measured.

40|$|We {{consider}} the planar magnonic waveguide with a periodic sequence of antidots forming zig-zag pattern, where two neighboring antidots are shifted towards the opposite {{edges of the}} waveguide. This system has a complex base with two antidots in one unit cell. The Brillouin zone is here two-times narrower than the Brillouin zone for the waveguide without displacement of antidots. We have shown that for dispersion relation folded into narrower Brillouin zone, new frequency gap can be opened and their width can be controlled by the shift of the antidots. We found that, the different strength of spin wave pinning {{at the edges of}} the periodic waveguide (and their antidots) determines the dependence of the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>gap</b> on the shift of antidots. For the systems with completely free or ideally pinned magnetization, these dependencies are qualitatively different. We have found an optimum shift of antidot for maximzing the width of the gap for the system with pinned magnetization. More interestingly, we notice that for this kind of geometry of the structure, majority of the modes are doubly degenerate at the edge of Brillouin zone and have a finite group velocity at the very close vicinity of the edge of Brillouin zone, for larger values of antidot shift. This empowers us to design magnonic waveguide to steer the spin waves...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to design and construct a coil {{that could be used to}} selectively heat nanoparticles attached to "molecular beacons" or DNA loop/hairpin structures. Testing was conducted to see if the heat would be sufficient to open the molecular beacon by dehybridizing the dsDNA. This was accomplished by developing a series of seven coils that were tested using a network analyzer and through scans conducted on a fluorometer. The initial design requirements for the coil were that it needed to heat the nanoparticle, should be suitable for optical testing, and require a relatively small sample volume. At the end of the design and testing period, however, a coil that met these requirements was not successfully constructed, but two additional design requirements were developed. Through temperature testing, it was realized that the primary heating of the solution was occurring due to the coil being heated through the power. As a result, a coil that eliminates this source of power dissipation needs to be developed through the use of an air gap, water bath, or similar application, which can draw some of the heat away from the solution. Secondly, in constructing the coils, each was wound tightly so that there was a minimal gap between each loop. However, experiments showed that the proximity effect on resistance could not be neglected. This provided information on future possible designs. Therefore, the coil should be wound so that there is at least one wire's <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>gap</b> between each loop. by Maria E. Tanner. Thesis (S. B.)

In {{order to}} {{understand}} the characteristics of fire whirls in the inclined shaft with corner gap, large eddy simulations (LES) of thermal flow field in a 9 -meter-high inclined shaft were employed. In the inclined shaft, the conrner gap is 0. 3 m and 0. 7 m in width, and the inclination angle is 5 °, 30 °, 45 °, 50 ° and 55 ° from the vertical orientation axes respectively. It is found that a whirling flow field could be formed under proper inclination angles and corner <b>gap</b> <b>width.</b> Rotational axis <b>of</b> fire whirls in the inclined shaft would have same inclination angles with the shaft.

In this paper, for the same fire and inclination angle, the 0. 3 -meter-wide corner gap is easier to form stable fire whirls than the 0. 7 -meter-wide corner gap.

However, a gap cut into the return plane {{has been shown to be}} ineffective at reducing capacitive and inductive coupling. For capacitive coupling, experiments have shown that adding a gap in the return plane actually increases the mutual capacitance. However, the change is rather insignificant unless the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gap</b> is quite large. Two factors determine the effect <b>of</b> the <b>gap</b> on inductive coupling, the length <b>of</b> the <b>gap</b> and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gap.</b> Experiments show that if the gap is long enough to prevent current from flowing underneath the victim trace, then the mutual inductance may decrease slightly (2 dB). When the gap is widened, there is a slight increase in inductive coupling. However overall, the gap has relatively little effect on induc-tive coupling. To reduce crosstalk between circuits on a printed circuit board at frequencies below a few hundred kilohertz, where common-impedance coupling is likely to dominate, it may be advisable to gap the current return plane. However, gapping the return plane is not likely to reduce crosstalk at frequencies above a few hundred kilohertz where inductive and capacitive coupling dominate...|$|R
