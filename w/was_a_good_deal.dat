Though a distribution offer was made by DreamWorks, it was turned down as the filmmakers {{did not feel that}} it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal.</b> As the film neared the end of production, it was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Harvey and Bob Weinstein were also at the festival at the time, screening Robert Rodriguez's film Sin City, which they were distributing through their then newly formed studio, The Weinstein Company. They decided to pick Hoodwinked! up for distribution after it was brought to their attention by Rodriguez's wife, whose attorney also happened to work for Blue Yonder Films.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the overlap between the writers of Unknown and Astounding, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of overlap between their readerships: Asimov records that during the war, he read only these two magazines. Sf historian Paul Carter {{has argued that the}} spectrum of fantastic fiction from Weird Tales through Unknown to Astounding was far less cleanly separated than is sometimes assumed: many stories in the early science fiction magazines such as Wonder Stories were more like the works of Edgar Allan Poe than they were tales of scientific imagination.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that they hope to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

A few good performances saw Voce keep his place despite the strength and variety of Nottinghamshire's bowling. At this stage, Voce was a classical left-arm spinner and some critics viewed him as a successor to Colin Blythe. Thus, when he changed to a faster pace the following year there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of criticism, but, in 1929, Voce returned to his slower style with great success {{in a number of}} games on sticky wickets, notably against Northamptonshire when he took fourteen wickets for 43 runs.|$|E

500|$|Writing for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Marlene Parrish {{gave the}} book a {{favorable}} review, highlighting {{it in her}} article [...] "Favorite Cookbooks for 2002". She wrote that she enjoyed sampling the recipes from the book. Parrish added that Robert Atkins, creator of the Atkins diet, would think favorably of the [...] "Gorgonzola Cheeseburgers with Bacon" [...] dish. The Denver Post included the book in a list of best cookbooks of 2002. Another article for the same newspaper highlighted recipes in the book, including Spaghetti alla Carbonara and Cobb salad, Pear-Apple Crisp with Brown Sugar-Bacon Topping and Bacon Brittle. A review in the Toronto Star criticized Perry's lack of creativity in her choice of recipes. The review concluded the book <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> compared to other cookbooks on the subject, while noting its lack of comprehensiveness with {{the small number of}} total recipes included. Michele Anna Jordan of The Press Democrat recommended Perry's work, and commented that the author's zest for the subject was contagious.|$|E
500|$|Much of Garage Mahal {{was written}} on the road, while touring, and as such had a {{different}} sound from the band's prior work. Most of the writing was done in two places; Mount Macedon in Victoria, and Palindrome Studio in Venice Beach, California, the home of producer Fred Maher. Mixing was done by David Way and Mike Shipley. Despite the change in sound, the band were still seen as purely a pop band—Australian Musician magazine claimed this was because they {{spent too much time}} overseas. Gary Glauber of PopMatters praised the album, noting it had not lost the quality of its predecessor, although it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> heavier. Glauber reported on the overall high quality of songs, noting that [...] "almost any of these songs could work as a single", and calling the lyrics of [...] "Creepin' Up Slowly" [...] "perpetually catchy". Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald said that the band did not hold back in their aim for American radio, calling the lyrics overly generic, and arguing the band only focused on their mainstream image.|$|E

500|$|Nintendo {{referred}} to the game as [...] "the most exclusive Pokémon software ever offered to North American Pokémon fans," [...] but it was {{generally considered to be}} unnecessary, receiving a score of 50% on GameRankings from 1 review. Craig Harris of IGN gave the game a [...] "" [...] rating of 5.0 out of 10, praising the interface, which makes the organization of Pokémon much easier as compared to the Game Boy Advance interface, as well as the emulator which allows Ruby and Sapphire to be played on the GameCube. He also stated that the game <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> due to the inclusion of a Memory Card and Cable. However, Harris cited the [...] "Showcase" [...] as [...] "entirely unnecessary and completely out of place," [...] and said that overall the game lacked much to do. He wrote, [...] "It's targeted specifically for the truly die-hard Pokemon fan, but it requires so many specific elements to actually be useful to anyone." [...] Allgame gave the game three and a half out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held {{his head to}} one side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson {{met with}} Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg {{decided not to}} pursue the offer. [...] The {{following}} year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes' company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. [...] Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. [...] Forbes' editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. [...] There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of confusion between the various participants in the project: according to Locus, a science fiction trade journal, [...] "Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, {{does not know what}} will happen to the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. [...] Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands". The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984. [...] Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. [...] Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. [...] As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. [...] Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. [...] Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. [...] Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. [...] Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.|$|E

500|$|By 1832 {{the amount}} spent on poor relief nationally {{had risen to}} £7million a year, more than 10shillings per head of population, up from £2million in 1784. The large number of those seeking {{assistance}} was pushing the system to [...] "the verge of collapse". The economic downturn {{following the end of}} the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century resulted in increasing numbers of unemployed. Coupled with developments in agriculture that meant less labour was needed on the land, along with three successive bad harvests beginning in 1828 and the Swing Riots of 1830, reform was inevitable. Many suspected that the system of poor relief was being widely abused, and in 1832 the government established a Royal Commission to investigate and recommend how relief could best be given to the poor. The result was the establishment of a centralised Poor Law Commission in England and Wales under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, also known as the New Poor Law, which discouraged the allocation of outdoor relief to the able-bodied; [...] "all cases were to be 'offered the house', and nothing else". Individual parishes were formed into Poor Law Unions, each of which was to have a union workhouse. More than500 were built during the next 50years, two-thirds of them by 1840. [...] In certain parts of the country there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of resistance to these new buildings, some of it violent, particularly in the industrial north. [...] Many workers lost their jobs during the major economic depression of 1837, and there was a strong feeling that what the unemployed needed was not the workhouse but short-term relief to tide them over. By 1838, 573 Poor Law Unions had been formed in England and Wales, incorporating 13,427parishes, {{but it was not until}} 1868 that unions were established across the entire country, the same year that the New Poor Law was applied to the Gilbert Unions.|$|E
