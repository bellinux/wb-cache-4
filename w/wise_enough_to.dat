With this knowledge, he also {{realized}} what his brother had to face, and wished that he had gone on the quest himself — knowing that Boromir {{would not have been able}} to resist the temptation to seize the Ring for himself. Giving the Hobbits provisions, he sent them on their way to continue their quest, but warned Frodo that their guide, Gollum, was a treacherous creature, and that an unknown terror lived in Cirith Ungol, where Gollum was leading them.|$|E

In Raiders, however, he is <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> close his eyes {{in the presence of}} God in the Ark of the Covenant. By contrast, his rival Rene Belloq is killed for having the audacity to try to communicate directly with God.|$|E
500|$|Mermaids {{appear in}} British {{folklore}} as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. [...] Several variants of the ballad Sir Patrick Spens depict a mermaid {{speaking to the}} doomed ships. [...] In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> know means the same thing.

500|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Briskin had gained a {{reputation}} of being a very thrifty producer. However, he was also known for putting {{the quality of the}} product over saving money. Joseph Walker, the cinematographer for the 1931 film Dirigible, directed by Frank Capra, explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps, which would have been much less expensive: , the studio's general manager, who personally supervised the making of the picture, and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar's worth of production for every dollar spent than any other executive in the business, was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made [...] "merely adequate". Therefore he spared no expense in assuring absolute authenticity in every detail of the production.|$|E
500|$|Itanhaém {{was chosen}} for the post because he was {{considered}} submissive and easily manipulated. The new guardian {{proved to be a}} man of mediocre intelligence, though honest. He was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> provide the young Emperor with an extraordinary education. The guardian had a [...] "great influence on the democratic character and thought of Pedro II." [...] The professors who were already teaching Pedro II and his sisters under José Bonifácio were retained by the new guardian. The exception was Friar Pedro de Santa Mariana who was nominated to occupy the place of aio (supervisor) formerly held by Friar Antonio de Arrábida (who had tutored Pedro I as a child). General supervision of Pedro II's education fell to Friar Pedro Mariana, and he took personal charge of his Latin, religion and mathematics studies. He {{was one of the few}} people outside his family for whom Pedro II held great affection.|$|E
2500|$|Later, when Cao Cao {{was leading}} his forces from Chang'an to {{reinforce}} Hanzhong, he received {{news about the}} strategy proposed by Fa Zheng to Liu Bei to attack Hanzhong. He remarked, [...] "I know Xuande (Liu Bei) is not capable of doing this. He must be following somebody's advice." [...] The historian Pei Songzhi commented that Cao Cao made that remark – which suggests that Liu Bei was not <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> notice Hanzhong's strategic importance – because of his personal disdain for Liu, and {{that it should not}} be taken seriously. He felt that a lord acting on his adviser's suggestion should not be interpreted as a sign that the lord was not <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make his own judgment. He pointed out that Cao Cao himself also followed the advice of his adviser Guo Jia.|$|E
6000|$|As {{to telling}} {{how he felt}} {{when he saw the}} good ship Alcestis blown to fragments, that was past Harry, and all but Blanche were <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> ask. She had by way of answer, [...] "Very glad to be safe out of her." ...|$|R

The bulk of his enormous winnings is now devoted to encouraging transitional and emerging nations to become [...] "open societies," [...] open not only in the sense of freedom of commerce but—more important—tolerant of new ideas and different modes of thinking and behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Decatur {{found the}} classic studies prosaic and {{life at the}} {{university}} disagreeable, and {{at the age of}} 17, with his heart and mind set on ships and the sea, discontinued his studies there. Though his parents were not pleased with his decision, they were apparently <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> now let the aspiring young man pursue his own course through life. Through his father's influence, Stephen gained employment at the shipbuilding firm of Gurney and Smith, business associates of his father, acting as supervisor to the early construction of the frigate [...] He was serving on board this vessel as a midshipman when it was launched on May 10, 1797, under the command of Commodore John Barry.|$|E
2500|$|The Talmud at Sanhedrin 21b says Solomon {{knew that}} there were {{regulations}} in the Torah against some of his actions but at the time he felt he was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> disregard them and not fall into sin [...] "it is written: He shall not multiply wives to himself, whereon Solomon said, ‘I will multiply wives yet not let my heart be perverted.’ Yet we read, When Solomon was old, his wives turned away his heart.

6000|$|Margaret was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> press her, and she {{sat down}} and sighed pitifully.

60|$|But {{the goat}} was now so wild and excited {{that it was}} not safe for anyone to stand in his way. None of the men were armed and when one or two tried to head off the goat, Bilbil sent them {{sprawling}} upon the ground.

2500|$|The Allegory of the Cave (often said by {{scholars}} to represent Plato's own epistemology and metaphysics) is intimately connected to his political ideology (often said to also be Plato's own), that {{only people who}} have {{climbed out of the}} cave and cast their eyes on a vision of goodness are fit to rule. Socrates claims that the enlightened men of society must be forced from their divine contemplations and be compelled to run the city according to their lofty insights. Thus is born the idea of the [...] "philosopher-king", the wise person who accepts the power thrust upon him by the people who are <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> choose a good master. This is the main thesis of Socrates in the Republic, that the most wisdom the masses can muster is the wise choice of a ruler.|$|E

60|$|Very {{soon the}} dragon stole softly into the room, {{and gave a}} {{tremendous}} blow on the spot where Stan's head should have been. Stan groaned loudly from under the bed, and the dragon went away as softly as he had come.

60|$|The rest of {{the party}} were <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> {{interfere}} with the lion. They were at that time inexperienced. To have wounded him would have brought disaster, perhaps death, on some of them. George Rennie (who afterwards became a celebrated lion-hunter) was emphatic in advising caution. After gazing in quiet surprise on the intruders {{for a minute or}} so, he turned and retired; first slowly, and then, after getting some distance off, at a good round trot.|$|R
6000|$|The {{corporal}} appeared embarrassed, but was <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> involve himself further.

50|$|From {{this time}} Moltke's {{strategy}} is remarkable for its judicious economy of force, {{for he was}} <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> never <b>to</b> attempt more than was practicable with the means at his disposal. The surrender of Metz and of Paris was {{just a question of}} time, and the problem was, while maintaining the sieges, to be able to ward off the attacks of the new French armies levied for the purpose of raising the Siege of Paris. The Siege of Metz ended with its surrender on October 27.|$|R

60|$|It was delightful, I {{have been}} told, {{to see him}} sitting on the low wall with as many {{children}} as possible scrambling over him, or sometimes standing up, holding a prize above his head, to be scrambled for by the lesser urchins.

50|$|While Thanos' {{possession}} of the Reality Gem could grant him virtually anything that he desired, a temporarily resurrected Captain Marvel suggested that Thanos was chosen by Warlock {{because he was the}} only being in the universe <b>wise</b> <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> use it.

Thanos also knew that the Reality Gem was in its own way the most dangerous of the Gems, and required the simultaneous use of the other Gems to keep its powers under control.|$|R
