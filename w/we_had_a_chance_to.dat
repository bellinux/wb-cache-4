60|$|In the sixth, after {{a desperate}} rally, we crowded the bases {{with only one}} out. Then Mullaney's hard rap to left, {{seemingly}} good for three bases, was pulled down by Stone with one hand. It was a wonderful catch and he doubled up a runner at second. Again in the seventh <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> score, only to fail on another double play, this time by the infield.|$|E

2500|$|On 8 July, Tisza {{informed}} {{another meeting}} of the Crown Council that any attack on Serbia was bound to lead to [...] "intervention by Russia and consequently world war". On the same day, Kurt Riezler's diary has his friend Bethmann Hollweg saying: [...] "If the war comes from the East, so that we are marching to Austria-Hungary's aid instead of Austria-Hungary to ours, then <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of winning it.

60|$|On the {{way back}} to Stawell <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> see a group of {{boulders}} called the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon high ground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it from whence the boulders could have rolled down. Relics of an early ice-drift, perhaps. They are noble boulders. One of them has the size and smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.|$|E

25|$|Runoff {{can also}} induce heavy metal {{poisoning}} in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans. These metals are ingested by ocean life.
