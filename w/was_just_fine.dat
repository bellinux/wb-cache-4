500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of his sophomore season, Ulis announced his intention to forgo his final two seasons of eligibility and enter the 2016 NBA draft. During the 2016 NBA Draft Combine, Ulis {{was not only the}} second-shortest player to participate in the event (behind only Kay Felder, who measured at 5'9.5" [...] with shoes on (5'8.5" [...] without shoes) as opposed to an even 5'10" [...] with shoes on (5.8.75" [...] without them)), but he was also the lightest recorded player in draft combine history at 149 pounds, which affected his draft stock. Furthermore, about two weeks before the draft began, it was revealed that Ulis had a problem with his hip that may one day require surgery. As a result, his draft stock declined from being an expected mid-first round selection to being either a projected late-first round or early-second round selection. Ulis downplayed the issue, claiming that his hip <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b> However, Ulis was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round with their 34th selection, being reunited with his best friend and former college teammate Devin Booker in the process. On July 7, he signed with the Suns and joined the team for the 2016 NBA Summer League. Ulis received the equivalent of a late first-round pick's contract, starting at around $1 million and having the same two guaranteed years with two team option years. In the Summer League, his play compared favorably to the four point guards who were taken in the first round. Over six games at the Las Vegas Summer League, he averaged 14.5 points and 6.3 assists per game, subsequently earning All-NBA Summer League Second Team honors.|$|E
2500|$|The hammers or [...] "stamps" [...] in a {{stamping}} mill {{consisted of}} vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams {{attached to the}} waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone.

At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the stamp heads were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the crushed ore once it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> enough to pass through the grill.

50|$|The Chevrolet Impala (fourth generation) are {{full-size}} automobiles {{produced by}} Chevrolet for the 1958 through 1970 model years. The 1965 Impala was all new, while the 1967 and 1969 models featured new bodies {{on the same}} redesigned perimeter frame introduced on the 1965 models. All Impalas of this generation received annual facelifts as well, distinguishing each model year. Throughout the early 1960s, Chevrolet's basic body designs became increasingly subtle, while the bright trim {{that was part of}} the Impala package added more than a touch of luxury to the look. The same pattern was followed in the interiors, where the best materials and equipment Chevrolet had to offer were displayed. In short, the Impala was on its way to becoming a kind of junior-grade Cadillac, which, for both the company and its customers, <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine.</b>|$|E

In mid-1965, Salant gave Peters the go-ahead to complete the episode. Peters worked with the New York chapter of the Mattachine Society to secure interviews with two additional gay subjects, Lars Larson and Jack Nichols, {{both of whom were}} fully accepting of their sexuality. Nichols later recalled his encounter with Wallace: [...] After we finished and the camera was turned off, Mike Wallace sat down with me and talked for about half an hour. He said, [...] "You know, you answered all of my questions capably, but I have a feeling that you don't really believe that homosexuality is as acceptable as you make it sound." [...] I asked him why he would say that. [...] "Because," [...] he said, [...] "in your heart I think you know it's wrong." [...] It was infuriating. I told him I thought being gay <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine,</b> but that in his heart he thought it was wrong. [...] Peters added more footage of psychiatrists espousing that model along with scenes from the 1965 convention of the East Coast Homophile Organizations. CBS gave final approval to [...] "The Homosexuals" [...] and scheduled it to air in the spring of 1966.|$|E

40|$|Innovative {{teachers}} can make writing an invaluable part of math instruction. One reason I chose mathematics for my undergraduate major {{was that it}} didn't require papers. Math homework called for solving problems or proving theorems, and that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> with me. Math and writing, like oil and water, seemed to have little in common. And for my first 20 years as a middle school and elementary school teacher, writing played no role in my math teaching. Today, my view has changed completely. I can no longer imagine teaching math without making writing an integral aspect of students ' learning. This transition occurred {{over a period of}} years as I gradually overcame my own writing phobia. After writing children's books, professional books, and numerous articles, I've faced my writing dragon. I've even come to appreciate writing as a tool for clarifying my thinking. As Zinsser says, “Writing is a way to work yourself into a subject and make it your own ” (1988, p. 16). But the results I experienced with students were what clinched my commitment to making writing a regular part of math instruction. Not only did I see how writing helped students think more deeply and clearly about mathematics, but I also discovered that students ' writing was an invaluable tool to help me assess their learning. Writing in math class supports learning because it requires students to organize, clarify, and reflect on their ideas—all useful processes for making sense of mathematics. In addition, when students write, their papers provide a window into their understandings, their misconceptions, and their feelings about the content they're learning. Of course, the writing that students do in math class generally differs from the writing they do in other subjects, such as language arts or social studies. Writing in math class isn't meant to produce a product suitable for publication, but rather to provide a way for students to reflect on their own learning and to explore, extend, and cement their ideas about the mathematics they study. Aside from the students themselves, I consider myself the primary audience for my students ' writing, and I pay attention to what that writing shows about their math understanding—what they write, not how they write it...|$|E
