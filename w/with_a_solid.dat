5|$|The pre-game buildup was {{primarily}} {{focused on the}} rematch. A slight plurality of experts picked Tulsa over Iowa State, but most predicted the game to be very close. Tulsa was considered a strong running team <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> defense, while Iowa State was balanced offensively and struggled at times on defense. This was the only rematch of the 2012-13 college bowl season.|$|E

40|$|A common {{wastewater}} treatment process practiced by zinc production facilities is the single-stage mixing of acidic wastewaters with slaked lime, inducing the reactive precipitation of fine (∼ 1 mum) gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O) and other <b>solids</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solids</b> density less than 10 %.

5|$|Wetting is {{the ability}} of a liquid to {{maintain}} contact <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid.

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid.</b> By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E

5|$|As he {{had done}} in 1984 when Bill Parcells {{restored}} him to the starting quarterback's job, Phil Simms responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> season in 1993. Playing in all 16 games, he completed almost 62% of his passes, threw for over 3,000yards, 15 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. The season {{marked the first time}} in seven years that Simms started every game for the Giants. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates all made the Pro Bowl. In addition, Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. Following the season Lawrence Taylor retired and Phil Simms was released by the team, leading to his eventual retirement. Simms and Taylor had been the faces of the franchise since 1979 and 1981 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E

40|$|A common {{wastewater}} treatment process practised in zinc production plants {{is the single}} stage mixing of acidic wastewaters with slaked lime, inducing the reactive precipitation of fine (∼ 1 mum) gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) and other <b>solids</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solids</b> density of less than 10 %. These solids report to tailings ponds for containment. The solid-liquid separation step would be more efficient if the size and density of the precipitated solids were increased. Tailings pond life would be increased if the solids density of the precipitated solids was improved. It is {{the scope of this}} thesis to report on how high density and clean gypsum may be produced by implementing staging and product recycling. According to this work a staged neutralisation process (each neutralisation reactor operating at different pH) leads to production of large sized gypsum crystals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high <b>solids</b> density. <b>A</b> continuous lab scale circuit run with synthetic zinc plant effluent produced large (∼ 100 mum) gypsum crystals <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solids</b> density of 35 %. The effect of various metal impurities (such as Zn, Mn, Mg, Fe(II), Cd, Na) in concentrations ranging from 0. 1 g/l to 10 g/l on the morphology of gypsum and their uptake by gypsum is investigated with the view of ultimately controlling gypsum contamination. By implementing staging and product recycling gypsum was produced containing less than 0. 025 % zinc and minor quantities of other elements hence meeting all industrial specifications for synthetic gypsum...|$|R
5|$|The fruit bodies {{can last}} for some {{considerable}} time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name forma rainierensis. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, {{such as in the}} redwood forests, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma wilsonii. American mycologist R. H. Petersen described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form. These forms are not recognised as distinct.|$|E
5|$|Upon first forming, {{the system}} contended with the {{entrainment}} of dry {{air to the}} northwest of the storm, which was expected to limit intensification. The storm steadily intensified, and early on June 2 the IMD upgraded it to deep depression status. Later in the day the IMD classified the system as Cyclonic Storm Gonu about 760km (470mi) southwest of Mumbai, India. As a mid-latitude trough developed over Pakistan, Gonu turned {{to the north and}} northeast, though it resumed a westward track after ridging built {{to the north of the}} storm. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> area of intense convection, it rapidly intensified to attain severe cyclonic status early on June 3, and with good outflow the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane. The dry air ultimately had a smaller impact on the intensification than previously estimated. A well-defined eye developed in the center of convection, and after moving over a local increase in ocean heat content, Gonu rapidly deepened.|$|E
5|$|With Stivetts now established, Clarkson became {{expendable}} and {{was released}} from the team on June30, leaving Boston <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> three-man pitching rotation {{for the remainder of the}} season. On August6, 1892, Stivetts pitched a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, an 11–0victory. Later, on September5, he started, completed, and defeated Louisville in both games of a doubleheader. The following day, the press credited the victories to his ability to work well with runners on the bases. The regular season for the Beaneaters closed on October15 with a doubleheader against the Washington Senators. Stivetts pitched the second game, and delivered a complete game shutout, his third shutout of the season, and his 35th victory. Although he finished within the top-ten in several pitching statistical categories, his strikeout total dropped to 180in 1892.

From their 25-yard line, the Yellow Jackets gained 38 yards on seven plays, advancing into Clemson territory in the process. Facing fourth down at the Clemson 37-yard line, the Yellow Jackets attempted to gain a first down rather than kick a long field goal. When they were stopped short of the first-down line, Clemson's offense returned to the field. Spiller again drove the Tigers down the field, opening the drive with a 54-yard run on its first play. Three plays later, Ellington capitalized the drive with a one-yard run for a tying touchdown. The following extra point gave Clemson a one-point lead, 34–33, with 6:11 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, Pinocchio and Jiminy {{find the}} workshop vacant. They soon {{get a letter}} from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out in search of Pinocchio, but was swallowed by a giant sperm whale named Monstro, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale chases them, and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. They are all washed up on a beach on the other side. Geppetto and Jiminy survive, but Pinocchio lies motionless face down in a tide pool nearby. Back home, the group mourns him. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, that he is reborn as a real human boy (his donkey ears and tail also gone), and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid</b> gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.|$|E
5|$|Although English {{furniture}} derives so extensively {{from foreign}} and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case {{down to the}} end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross-bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north-western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solid,</b> more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill-proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight.|$|E

40|$|In {{pneumatic}} conveying systems, two distinct dense phase modes of flow exist; either plug flow for granular material or an aerated dense flow for powdered material. When conveying powdered materials, {{the flow of}} the dense phase material layer is transient and pulsatile. In investigating this transient behaviour, Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT) was used as it provided a non-invasive investigation capability of the internal flow structure of the material pulses. The twin plane ECT system used in for the experiments provided a pixel resolution of approximately 1. 5 mm which provided important information on the internal structure of the material pulses, with the twin planes providing a velocity determination capability. This paper reports on the results of the ECT analysis on two material pulses; one pulse was analysed from a dilute type flow <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solids</b> loading ratio of 10 and another pulse from a denser flow test <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>solids</b> loading ratio of 50.
