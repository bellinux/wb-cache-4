5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ian Maxtone-Graham, though the {{original}} draft of the plot was much different. Originally, Homer <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> {{that he was a}} Native American, and would try to exploit it to not have to pay taxes. The idea had been going well for a few days, but the staff did not actually know whether Native Americans had to pay taxes. When the writers found out that they did, the whole plot had to be scrapped. Executive producer Mike Scully's brother Brian pitched the idea of the trillion-dollar bill, which they accepted, as they were out of ideas.|$|E
5|$|The task of {{capturing}} Lang Vei was entrusted to the 24th Regiment, Vietnam People's Army 304th Division, led by Colonel Le Cong Phe. The regiment {{was to be}} supported by the 2nd Battalion (part of the 101D Regiment, 325th Division), the 2nd Artillery Battalion (part of the 675th Artillery Regiment), one tank company (part of the 198th Tank Battalion, 203rd Armored Regiment), two sapper companies, one anti-aircraft gun company, and one flamethrower platoon. One {{of the most important}} features of the North Vietnamese formation were the elements of the 203rd Armoured Regiment; the Route 9-Khe Sanh Campaign marked the first time the Vietnam People’s Army deployed its armored forces on the battlefield. In 1964, soldiers of North Vietnam’s first armored unit—the 202nd Armored Regiment—was sent into South Vietnam without their T-34 main battle tanks, because their prime mission <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> enemy armor tactics in order to prepare for future missions. On 22 June 1965, the North Vietnamese Ministry of Defense passed Resolution 100/QD-QP, to establish the 203rd Armored Regiment, and Resolution 101/QD-QP to create an Armored Force Command.|$|E

25|$|The notion for education-based {{workshops}} and displays developed {{out of a}} philosophical view; {{that the world was}} heading towards difficult times and that people needed to learn how to become more self-sufficient so that they would be less reliant on a system unable to provide spiritual and survivalist needs.

The performers rehearsed for two days, an uncommon occurrence for them, sometimes with two or more songs rehearsed concurrently by various combinations of musicians. During the rehearsal sessions on January 12, California governor Ronald Reagan, {{who was at the}} hotel for an after-dinner speech, visited the band and offered his encouragement. One focus of the sessions <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> [...] "Greystone Chapel", a song written by inmate Glen Sherley. Sherley recorded a version of the song, which he passed on to Rev.

2500|$|Smuts, {{taking office}} in June 1898, {{knew nothing of}} the inner motivations of men such as Chamberlain and Milner. [...] Smuts’s view was that the state and nature of public {{administration}} gave rise to various issues of dispute between the uitlanders, the British government, and the Transvaal. [...] Smuts hoped that with good faith on all sides, negotiations could lead to such political reforms as proved necessary, satisfying uitlander opinion, the British government, and Smuts’s own desire for the Transvaal to embrace the new industry in its midst.

2500|$|Based on {{the popular}} {{historical}} fiction of Eva Emery Dye, it has been repeated that [...] "as a child of eight in 1832 at Fort Vancouver, [...] he met three shipwrecked Japanese sailors, including Otokichi". In reality the three shipwrecked Japanese sailors were brought to Ft. Vancouver {{in the spring of}} 1834 , arriving there about 6 weeks after 10-yr-old Ranald MacDonald had departed for Red River - so there never was the fabled meeting of east and west. [...] MacDonald's First-Nations relatives might have had legends that their ancestors had come from across the Pacific, but saying that MacDonald [...] "developed a fascination with Japan" [...] and [...] "theorized that it might be the home of his distant relatives" [...] {{may or may not be}} accurate.

[...] The goal of this course is to better train soldiers to be safer when they're in urban environments and perform breaching and other tactics used in urban combat. This training helped the anti-terrorism group become better at eliminating their targets so there were fewer terrorism threats. They also go through normal marine boot camp like all Marines must go through. [...] Also, they must train with other units they are paired with like Chemical, Biological Incident Response Force. [...] They do this so if need arises they are prepared for whatever circumstances could arise.

2500|$|In 1793, the Duke of York {{was sent}} to Flanders {{in command of the}} British {{contingent}} of an allied force destined for the invasion of France. In June 1794, Wellesley with the 33rd regiment set sail from Cork bound for Ostend as part of an expedition bringing reinforcements for the army in Flanders. They arrived too late and joined the Duke of York as he was pulling back towards the Netherlands. On 15 September 1794, at the Battle of Boxtel, east of Breda, Wellington, in temporary command of his brigade, had his first experience of battle. During General Abercromby’s withdrawal in the face of superior French forces, the 33rd held off enemy cavalry, allowing neighbouring units to retreat safely. During the extremely harsh winter that followed, Wellesley and his regiment formed part of an allied force holding the defence line along the Waal River. The 33rd, {{along with the rest of}} the army, suffered heavy losses from sickness and exposure. Wellesley’s health was also affected by the damp environment. Though the campaign was to end disastrously, with the British army driven out of the United Provinces into Germany, Wellesley <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> several valuable lessons, including the use of steady lines of infantry against advancing columns and of the merits of supporting sea-power. He understood that the failure of the campaign was due in part to the faults of the leaders and the poor organisation at headquarters.
