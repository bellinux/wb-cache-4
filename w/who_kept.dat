5|$|James was a known philanderer <b>who</b> <b>kept</b> many mistresses, {{for which}} Anne often reproached him, once even {{complaining}} to the king, who sent one of James' mistresses to the countryside, where she remained until her death.

A new wave of Ottoman conquest began in 1521, after which a good portion of Croatia was conquered or pillaged.|$|E
