5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst.

At age fourteen he met Symeon the Studite, a renowned monk of the Monastery of Stoudios in Constantinople, who convinced him to give his own life to prayer and asceticism under the elder Symeon's guidance. By the time he <b>was</b> <b>thirty,</b> Symeon the New Theologian became the abbot of the Monastery of St. Mammas, a position he held for twenty-five years. He attracted many monks and clergy with his reputation for sanctity, though his teachings brought him into conflict with church authorities, who would eventually send him into exile.

5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan <b>was</b> <b>thirty</b> {{years old}} {{when he came to the}} throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also disagree about her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E

5|$|Unable to {{take any}} further part in the war as an infantryman, Phillipps would {{normally}} have been repatriated to Australia, but instead engineered a transfer to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) as adjutant of No.2 Squadron.

The official age limit for pilots in the AFC <b>was</b> <b>thirty,</b> but the preferred age was under twenty-three.

Within three days of arriving he crash-landed his Airco DH.5 after it was hit by anti-aircraft fire near Ypres, but he escaped injury; {{by the time he}} completed his attachment in September he was leading combat patrols.|$|E
