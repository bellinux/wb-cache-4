SFRC ribbed <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> are lighter and has higher tensile. The precast ribbed <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is also a sustainable construction component due to the reduction of concrete amount. The aim of the study is to determine load carrying capacity and displacement of steel fibre reinforced concrete 3 -ribbed wall without steel fabric and to evaluate its mode of failure and crack pattern under axial load.

EPS is chosen as the lightweight aggregate because it offers advantages in terms of energy absorbing capacity which suitable for high impact structure like shear wall. Since it is understood that the lightweight concrete will have strength reduction, steel fabric reinforcement is used to strengthen the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> structure. Steel fibre has been also added to this structure to improve the lightweight concrete strength. The compressive strength obtained for EPS-LWC <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> in this study is 20. 87 N/mm 2 and the density is 1900 kg/m 3.

The comparison of the predicted insertion loss to the measured data for typical large acoustical enclosures shows good agreements. It is found that if the critical frequency of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> falls above the frequency region of interest, insertion loss is dominated by the sound transmission loss of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> and averaged sound absorption coefficient inside the enclosure. However, if the critical frequency of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> falls into the frequency region of interest, acoustic power from the sound radiation by the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> must be added to the acoustic power from transmission through the panel...|$|R

In order to save the vast energy consumed by air-conditioning system, the building envelopes in envelope-load dominated buildings should be well designed such that the unwanted heat gain and loss with environment can be minimized. In this paper, a new design of concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> that enhances thermal insulation of buildings by adding a gypsum layer inside concrete is presented. Experiments have been conducted for monitoring the temperature variation in both proposed sandwich <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> and conventional concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> under a heat radiation source.
