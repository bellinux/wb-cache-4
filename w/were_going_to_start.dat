500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point where we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E

500|$|Itchy and Scratchy have {{appeared}} in various products and other media relating to The Simpsons. A video game named The Itchy & Scratchy Game was released for Genesis, Game Gear, Super NES and Game Boy. Another game, Itchy and Scratchy in Miniature Golf Madness, was released for Game Boy. Itchy, Scratchy and Poochie play roles in the [...] "Grand Theft Scratchy" [...] section in The Simpsons Game. Itchy & Scratchy have also appeared in commercials for various products, including a 1999 Butterfinger advert where Bart watches a short called [...] "500 Easy Pieces". They appear {{in the very first}} scene of The Simpsons Movie. The writers of the film knew from the beginning that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> with an Itchy & Scratchy short and the segment was the first scene that was storyboarded by the animators.|$|E
500|$|In June 2004, Bloc Party convened at Deltalab Studios in Copenhagen to make Silent Alarm with Paul Epworth. The {{band had}} already written demo songs to record, but Okereke {{has noted that}} [...] "it is a {{creative}} process {{and you have to}} let yourself be inspired while you're in the studio as well". The Deltalab set-up posed problems, because it included bare mains cables and dated, malfunctioning equipment from the 1960s and 1970s. Bloc Party took three sessions to get acquainted with Epworth's methodology. The producer has called the recording time a [...] "growing process" [...] because Okereke was not wholly comfortable singing in front of people, especially after tonsil problems. Although the band members had preliminary ideas about a track's rhythm, they did not know how songs <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> or end. Okereke often asked Tong to play something on the drums, which inspired him to mould a track by adding guitar chords to the beat.|$|E
500|$|Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman {{developed}} the second season's storyline together. Goldsman {{explained that they}} [...] "mapped" [...] out the season [...] "in {{a way that we}} remained fundamentally faithful to". Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> and end up but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge it to our characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately trying to keep it all quiet", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|E

He made references to [...] "goddamn immigrants" [...] in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that Jews were a disease in Germany and that Hitler was trying to [...] "clean up Europe" [...] when he [...] "fried six million of those guys."

2500|$|Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss' {{contract}} when it {{expired in}} March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that [...] "No one, again, {{no one has}} called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring. As a founding member I find this to be disrespectful to me, and to the fans that have made us {{one of the biggest}} bands in the world." [...] Criss stated in a radio interview in 2004 with Eddie Trunk that Simmons and Stanley <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a new Kiss, and felt that he was getting too old to play the drums for two hours (Criss was almost 59 at this time).|$|E
2500|$|Electronic beats {{were used}} during recording, which {{resulted}} in Thrower changing his thought process {{to that of a}} session player. Thrower thought it was a [...] "refreshing" [...] experience. Lancaster mixed almost all of the tracks, except for [...] "Here We Go" [...] and [...] "Damn Nation", which were mixed by Neal Avron. Miles engineered drums on all of the songs, except for [...] "Here We Go", which was done by Lancaster. The album was mastered by Dick Beetham. In an October 2013 announcement, the band said they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> [...] "sift through all the new material/demos to start deciphering where we're at album wise".

2500|$|The band Jones & Giftet (Jones & the Poison) {{was formed}} with members Joakim [...] "Jocke" [...] Berg, Martin Sköld, Markus Mustonen, Sami Sirviö and Thomas Bergqvist (synthesizers). It {{all started with}} Berg going to London and buying two guitars, one for Sirviö and one for himself. Sirviö and Berg had a band that rehearsed at Bålsta Musikslott which {{consisted}} of three people. Inspired by My Bloody Valentine, Sköld and Berg decided they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a new band. This happened at the school S:t Eskils cafeteria Grönan. Berg and Sköld met up with a very drunk Mustonen outside of the Restaurant Vildsvinet in Eskilstuna. Whilst drunk, he promised to join the band and play the drums. Thomas Bergqvist, a friend of Martin Sköld, was invited {{to come along and}} play the synth. The first gig was played in [...] Lindesberg in Västmanland, and the second at Knegoffs in Eskilstuna.|$|E

I put the point to him fairly and squarely, without circumlocution; we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> an English typewriting office in Florence; what was the ordinary way for people to become possessed of a typewriting machine, without the odious and mercenary preliminary of paying for it?
