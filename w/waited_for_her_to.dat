The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015).

Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's Forum Theatre. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity."

60|$|The {{man made}} no reply but stood, a strong, dark figure, a yard {{or two from}} the well, as though <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> join him.|$|R

60|$|Katharine rose {{at once to}} her feet. They {{all made}} their way into the lounge. Whilst they <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> fetch her cloak, Beverley swung round to his companion.|$|E
60|$|John {{understood}} {{now that}} this was only her way of being glad, so he just patted her shoulder and got her a chair, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> dry her eyes.|$|E
