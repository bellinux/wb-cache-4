Five commercial <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> (340 g kg− 1 protein nominal) {{were used to}} fortify milk to 45 g protein kg− 1. Fermentation was performed with two different starters (ropy and non-ropy). Resulting yogurts were compared with a control yogurt enriched with skim milk powder. The water-holding capacity of the yogurt fortified with skim milk powder was 500 g kg− 1 and ranged from 600 to 638 g kg− 1 when fortified with <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates.</b> Significant rheological differences have been noticed between the yogurts fortified with different <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates,</b> independent of the starter used. Three <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> generated yogurts with a behavior similar to the control. The two others produced yogurt with lower firmness (15 g compared with 17 g), lower Brookfield viscosity (6 Pa s compared with 9 Pa s), lower yield stress (2 Pa compared with 4 Pa), lower complex viscosity (13 Pa s compared with 26 Pa s), and lower apparent viscosity (0. 4 Pa s compared with 1 Pa s) than the control, respectively. The yogurts with the lowest firmness and viscosity were produced with concentrates which contained the highest amount of non-protein nitrogen fraction (160 g kg− 1 versus 126 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen), and the highest amount of denaturation of the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> (262 versus 200 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen) ...|$|R

Sphinogmyelin (SM) is the predominant membrane sphingolipid and can be hydrolyzed to form ceramides and sphingosines which are involved in numerous cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and cell differentiation. Recent research suggests that SMs may {{play an important role}} in the development and/or prevention of chronic disease. Dietary sources of SM include milk, eggs and soybeans, although their exact concentration in food has not been well characterized. 	The present research examines the sphingolipid content of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> (WPC) and isolates (WPI). <b>Whey</b> <b>protein,</b> commonly the byproduct of cheese and dairy manufacturing, is a pure, natural, high quality protein from cow's milk.

We hypothesize that the SM content of the <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> samples will be proportional to their total lipid content. WPC and WPI were extracted, fractionated and analyzed for SM content. A total of five samples were analyzed, three <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> <b>concentrates</b> and two <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> isolates. Ten gram samples of each sample were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and further separated using ion exchange methods. SM content was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and quantified using a standard curve generated using pure SM.

Conversely, WPIs containing 0. 3 % had significantly different SM contents (0. 0015 and 0. 019 %). Statistically significant patterns were not found when comparing lipid content and SM of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> samples. Therefore, the hypothesis that the SM content of <b>whey</b> <b>protein</b> samples is proportional to total lipid content was not supported. The WPCs had relatively similar SM content regardless of fat content.
