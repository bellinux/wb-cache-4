50|$|A. glandulosa fruit {{are also}} {{significant}} food of certain migrant birds in their winter quarters. In particular the red-eyed vireo and the <b>white-necked</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus albicollis) {{have been noted}} to be fond of them, and Swainson's flycatchers (Myiarchus swainsoni) visit the trees very often too. But as it does not relish the fruits very much, the latter species is perhaps more attracted to insects living on the tree.|$|E
50|$|On the contrary, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the nominate group and the phaeopygos group of T. albicollis should be considered separate species, but the voices of the two are similar, and the subspecies crotopezus from the nominate group approach members of the phaeopygos group in both plumage and colour of bill. If the two groups are split, the common name rufous-flanked thrush has been suggested for T. albicollis, with T. phaeopygos retaining the common name <b>white-necked</b> <b>thrush</b> or being renamed grey-flanked thrush.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus albicollis) is a {{songbird}} {{found in}} forest and woodland in South America. The taxonomy is potentially confusing, and it sometimes includes {{the members of}} the T. assimilis group as subspecies, in which case the [...] "combined species" [...] {{is referred to as the}} white-throated thrush (a name limited to T. assimilis when the two are split). On the contrary, it may be split into two species, the rufous-flanked thrush (T. albicollis) and the grey-flanked thrush (T. phaeopygos).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>thrush</b> mainly {{feeds on}} or near the ground on invertebrates. It also takes some fruit and berries. It {{regularly}} follows army ant swarms, but does not attend mixed species flocks. Throughout most of its range, especially in the Amazon, it is a shy species, heard far more than seen, but in Trinidad and parts of south-eastern Brazil it may be less retiring.The nest is a lined cup of twigs placed low (at a height of 1-9 m ft) in a tree or bush. Two to three reddish-blotched green-blue eggs are laid and incubated by the female alone for 12-13 days. Social mongamous, but extra-pair mate are common [...]|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Over {{the last}} two decades, several {{studies have shown that}} the mating systems of various birds are more complex than {{previously}} believed, and paternity tests performed with molecular techniques have proved, for instance, that the commonly observed social monogamy often presents important variations, such as extra-pair paternity. However, data are still largely biased towards temperate species. In our study, at an area of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, we found broods containing at least one extra-pair young (EPY) in the socially monogamous <b>White-necked</b> <b>Thrush</b> Turdus albicollis (Vieillot, 1818). Paternity tests using six heterologous microsatellite loci revealed that four of 11 broods (36. 4 %) presented at least one extra-pair young (EPY). This rate of EPY is within the range found for other studies in the tropics. This is one of the few studies that present detailed paternity analyses of a Neotropical rainforest passerine. Our findings corroborate the early insights that breeding strategies involving cheating can also be widespread among Neotropical socially monogamous songbirds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the present}} study was to report and {{describe}} Isospora albicollis Lainson and Shaw, 1989 parasitizing a <b>white-necked</b> <b>thrush</b> Turdus albicollis Vieillot, 1818 and a pale-breasted thrush Turdus leucomelas Vieillot, 1818 in two different localities: the Itatiaia National Park and Cacaria, in southeastern Brazil. The oocysts identified were ovoidal, 24. 4 × 19. 7 μm, with a smooth, bilayered wall, around 1. 4 μm thick. Oocyst residuum was absent, but a micropyle and a polar granule were present. The sporocysts were ellipsoidal, 15. 4 × 10. 1 μm. The Stieda body was knob-like to rounded and the sub-Stieda body was prominent and wide. Sporocyst residuum was present, usually as a cluster of granules that appear to be membrane-bounded. The sporozoites were vermiform with one posterior refractile body and a centrally located nucleus. Besides recording the new host T. leucomelas, the identification of I. albicollis in the Itatiaia National Park and Cacaria, in southeastern Brazil, provide records of new localities for its parasitism, and reveals the wide distribution and dispersion of this coccidium in Brazil...|$|E
