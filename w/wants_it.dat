The party {{believes that}} regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience <b>wants.</b> <b>It</b> also wants to abolish the annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.|$|E

A waitress, Carolyn, played by Anita Wise, overhears them and George offers the place to her, which she accepts. The waitress invites them and Elaine to her housewarming, {{but it is clear that}} Jerry, George, and Elaine are not enjoying themselves.

5|$|Mr. Burns reveals to Smithers that {{he misses}} his {{cherished}} bear Bobo and desperately <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> back {{but has no}} idea where it is. Another flashback reveals Bobo's history: after Mr. Burns leaves it behind, the bear eventually finds its way to Charles Lindbergh, who tosses the bear into a crowd, where it is caught by Adolf Hitler. In 1945, Hitler blames Bobo for losing World War II and tosses him away. Bobo is seen again in 1957 on board the USS Nautilus headed for the North Pole. Bobo becomes encased in a block of ice until picked up by an ice-gathering expedition in 1993. The bag of ice with Bobo in it {{is sent to the}} Kwik-E-Mart in Springfield. Bart buys the bag of ice, finds Bobo inside and gives it to Maggie to play with.|$|E
5|$|After Amy (a playable character) {{complains}} about being bored, a bird wearing a Chaos Emerald necklace crashes into her in Sonic Adventure. She keeps the bird safe from E-100 Alpha, one of Eggman's robots. Amy later meets Sonic, and invites {{him to an}} amusement park (where they become separated). Alpha reappears, imprisoning Amy and the bird on Eggman's airship the Egg Carrier. Another Eggman robot, E-102 Gamma, orders Amy to give the bird to him; she refuses, asking him why he <b>wants</b> <b>it.</b> He does not know, and changes his mind when she tells him he is missing out on love. E-102 Gamma lets them leave and, touched, Amy becomes his friend before she escapes into the ship's interior. On the deck, Eggman confronts her and grabs the bird's Chaos Emerald. Sonic and Gamma appear, and when Sonic tries to destroy Gamma Amy defends him. Sonic agrees to spare Gamma, and Amy leaves with Tails. She later sees {{a photo of the}} bird and its parents (whom Eggman has also stolen) in its necklace. When Amy looks for them in the jungle, she again finds the Egg Carrier. The bird's parents emerge on the deck; Alpha appears, and injures Amy's bird. Amy destroys Alpha, and waves goodbye to the three departing birds.|$|E

5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler <b>wants</b> <b>it</b> to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
