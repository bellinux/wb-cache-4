5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. The idea behind this new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> how the previous system worked.|$|E

25|$|Since this year's IPL will {{be played}} during the Lok Sabha Elections in the country, re-insurance {{companies}} have asked to double the rates for insurance cover of IPL 7.

25|$|Transponder – In practice, {{the signal}} {{inputs and outputs}} will not be {{electrical}} but optical instead (typically at 1550nm). This means that in effect wavelength converters are needed instead, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what a transponder is. A transponder {{can be made up}} of two transceivers placed after each other: the first transceiver converting the 1550nm optical signal to/from an electrical signal, and the second transceiver converting the electrical signal to/from an optical signal at the required wavelength. Transponders that don't use an intermediate electrical signal (all-optical transponders) are in development.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} sports which are fairly {{dangerous}} and involve threatening activities, especially during competition. There {{is always the}} chance of athletes getting injured while competing or during training <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> the reason why a psychologist would eventually encounter a patient who is a serious athlete and {{is in need of}} their assistance to rehabilitate their PTSD. Psychology as a general occupation has dated back to times of 1878, and around 1897 the first psychologist specialising in sport was established, by the name of Dr. Norman Triplett. Ever since, sport psychologists were helping different athletes, in the mental aspect of their game, {{in order for them to}} reach their optimum potential.|$|E
25|$|Around 30 que {{have survived}} {{to the present}} day. Most {{of them are in}} Sichuan; a few in Henan and Shandong. According to Ann Paludan, this {{distribution}} may be explained by two reasons. First, there may have been more stone que produced in these regions in the first place, due to the ready availability of stone and the tradition of stone-working craft; meanwhile elsewhere wooden que were built, which have not survived. Second, Sichuan has more remote, hard to access areas, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> where many of the Han Dynasty que have managed to survive. The locations around the imperial capitals, where the Eastern Han imperial mausolea were located, saw more intensive level of destruction over the almost 2000 years that have elapsed since that era, and the que constructed there did not have a chance to survive.|$|E
25|$|A related {{group is}} the collineation group, which is defined axiomatically. A collineation is an {{invertible}} (or more generally one-to-one) map which sends collinear points to collinear points. One can define a projective space axiomatically {{in terms of an}} incidence structure (a set of points P, lines L, and an incidence relation I specifying which points lie on which lines) satisfying certain axioms – an automorphism of a projective space thus defined then being an automorphism f of the set of points and an automorphism g of the set of lines, preserving the incidence relation, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> a collineation of a space to itself. Projective linear transforms are collineations (planes in a vector space correspond to lines in the associated projective space, and linear transforms map planes to planes, so projective linear transforms map lines to lines), but in general not all collineations are projective linear transforms – PGL is in general a proper subgroup of the collineation group.|$|E

25|$|During 1965 it {{was decided}} to make Northern Songs a public company to reduce their income tax burden. 1,250,000 shares were traded on the London Stock Exchange, which were worth 17 pence each ($0.28), but were offered at 66 pence ($1.09) each. Although the trade was scoffed at by various {{financial}} institutions, it was expected that the application lists would not remain open for more than 60 seconds, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what happened, as the lists were oversubscribed. After the offer was closed, Lennon and McCartney owned 15% each, worth £195,200 ($320,000), NEMS a 7.5% interest, and James and Silver (who served as Northern Songs' chairmen), controlling 37.5%, with Harrison and Starr sharing 1.6%. The remaining shares were owned by various financial institutions. At the same time, Lennon and McCartney renewed their previous three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973. Harrison also signed with the company in 1965, for a period of three years. To protect his interests, James took out a life insurance policy of £500,000 on Lennon and McCartney. By the summer of 1966, 88 songs by Lennon and McCartney had been recorded and released, amounting to 2,900 versions by different artists.|$|E

Schaffner added: [...] "True, the critics had been unfair, even vicious. But one could only hope George would rise above them, {{and produce a}} work good enough to fake them all out. <b>Which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> {{what he would do}} a year later with Thirty-Three and a Third."

Phillies pitchers trust Ruiz {{and his ability to}} call games, and this ability's improvement has coincided with his increased proficiency in English. Cole Hamels attributes Ruiz's prowess in calling games to astute preparation, commenting, [...] Ruiz realizes the importance of his role with the Phillies, opining, [...] "It's the catcher's job to bring energy and happiness to the game." [...] Ruiz has a good throwing arm that has improved over the years; {{over the course of his}} career he has thrown out 29% of attempted base stealers, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> the average percentage of baserunners thrown out by catchers.|$|E
500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director did a good job with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like you have seen it before, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story.

500|$|Palpatine's wardrobe, {{tailored}} by {{costume designer}} Trisha Biggar, {{played an important}} part {{in the development of the}} character throughout the films. In Attack of the Clones, explained McDiarmid, [...] "The costumes ... have got much more edge to them, I think, than the mere senator had [...] So we see the trappings of power." [...] In the next episode, McDiarmid remarked, [...] "To wear the costumes as the character I play is wonderfully empowering."

But Porter also said he had mixed feelings about Pam's decision to work for Michael and about the Charles Miner character, who he said might be too humorless and uncomfortable for the show. Travis Fickett of IGN felt it was disappointing and slow-paced compared to last week's episode [...] "New Boss": [...] "Things slow down a bit as we sort of repeat the awkwardness between Michael and new regional manager Charles Miner.

500|$|The video follows {{students}} at a dystopian-based correctional facility who rebel and take over the establishment, intertwined with shots of the band performing outside the prison in a cage, providing a [...] "soundtrack to the chaos."

There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regiment, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place." [...] The band's main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle's input—which [...] "ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways"—was regarded by the band as [...] "completely wacked out and twisted, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>exactly</b> what we love." ...|$|E
