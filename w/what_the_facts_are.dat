Indirect strategies, on the other hand, shift the point of conflict, alter perceptions of what is central, or undermine the opposing counsels’ case without direct confrontation, often through deception, surprise or misdirection of the opponent—though never of the jury.|$|E

40|$|Ethical reductionism is a {{doctrine}} in metaethics, {{the area of}} ethics in which we ask not <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> concerning our moral obligations, or concerning what things in life are worth pursuing, but, among other things, questions about the nature (or even the very existence) of such facts. One such question is whether moral facts are, to put it roughly, identical to facts of another kind. Reductionism in ethics is the view that they are. That is, reductionists hold that moral facts, or moral properties, are identical to facts or properties that can be expressed using nonmoral vocabulary. Moral reductionism (i) demystifies moral properties – it tells us what they are. It promises further advantages in (ii) explaining how we can come to know moral facts (see epistemology, moral), (iii) explaining why moral facts necessarily depend upon nonmoral facts (see supervenience, moral), and (iv) rebutting charges of the explanatory idleness of moral facts (see explanations, moral). Critics complain, however, that explaining the moral in other terms leaves out what is essential to and important about it: its evaluative or normative nature (see normativity). Two simple examples of reductionist views are the following: the property o...|$|E

Cooley, New York UniversityWhen economic disasters occur {{it is common}} to look to the managers of the economy and question the decisions they made and the incentives that drove their decisions. In the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 compensation was singled out {{as one of the most}} important and deeply flawed elements of the incentive system that induced firms to accumulate enormous amounts of risk on their balance sheets. In Clementi, Cooley, Richardson, and Walter (2009) we describe many of the flawed practices in financial firms. But, executive compensation more broadly has long been a sensitive issue and financial crises have a tendency to focus increased attention on it. In the past two decades there has been much discussion of executive compensation, many public examples of lavish pay, but no real consensus on the extent of the problem if indeed there is one. In part, this is because there is a lack of clarity about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are.</b> In this lecture I describe recent research on executive compensation in the United States in the period 1993 – 2006 looking at both the cross-sectional and time series variation.

40|$|A Conversation Analysis (CA) {{approach}} {{is used to}} analyse the interactional practices of question-answer frameworks used in the courtroom case of ‘The Murder Trial’ whereby cameras were allowed in the High Court in Edinburgh to capture a trial in its entirety. Talk in the courtroom comes under a sub-heading of institutionalised talk, whereby courtroom “interaction is merely a neutral medium through which attorneys, witnesses, judges, and jurors determine <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> and how the law applies” (Heritage & Clayman, 2010, p. 173). This linguistic and sequential pattern of interaction showcases the court’s own dynamic structures and rules that bring about turn-taking constraints that are embedded within the talk to construct individualised goals of guilt or innocence. This paper investigates the defence lawyer’s cross-examination questioning techniques which are addressed to the witness by looking at transitions in speakership between turn-taking constraints to see how agendas are designed, and in turn project a constraining answer from the witness in the institutionalised order of question-answer phenomena, (Atkinson & Drew, 1979; Drew, 2002). For example, the witness is allowed little or no flexibility in giving their evidence; instead they are inhibited and guided by institutionalised frameworks, (Atkinson & Drew, 1979; Danet & Bogoch, 1980; Drew, 1992; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Matoesian, 1993). Heritage & Clayman, (2010), suggest that “talk alone does not make verdicts of guilt or innocence determinative”, (p. 185), yet demonstrates how talk needs to instead be invoked and analysed to see how such language practices shape the decisions of what is talked about and how it serves to shape the conversational goal of each interlocutor...|$|E
40|$|When the law {{is against}} you, lawyers learn, you argue the facts; when the facts are against you, you argue the law. When each party has an arguable case, in other words, <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> and what {{the law is}} are interdependent questions. Linking the facts {{presented}} to the court to past resolutions of similar disputes, a successful judicial opinion constructs a rationale that differentiates the particular exercise of judicial authority from different results reached in arguably similar cases and from the arbitrary application of superior power. Legal distinctions attempted in the opinion in order to differentiate its holding from cases relied on in the losing argument are often denominated, by the losing party, distinctions of style rather than substance. This characterization is not surprising, since distinctions of style are differences produced by subtle variations {{in the construction of}} essentially similar objects—variations that define the work of particular masters of a given craft. The use of the word style by the losing party as an antonym for substance, however, represents a charge that the words used by the court do not adequately distinguish either the facts or the law relied upon by that party. Such a charge can be demonstrated conclusively, in the sense that lawyers as well as litigants must accept it as valid, only when distinctions used in the opinion involve the court in logical inconsistencies. So long as the court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning is consistent, in other words, the relevant question can be only whether the particular proposition on which the judge relies to justify the distinction is, in the circumstances, a persuasive one...|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional {{semantics}} ’ denotes {{a family}} of semantic theories rooted in intensional semantics, held together by shared general ideas, yet divided by deep divergences in semantic aims and philosophical aspiration. 2 d-theorists agree that our sentences ’ truth-values vary with <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are,</b> {{as well as with}} what the sentences mean. To model this twofold dependence of truth on fact and meaning, 2 d-semantics assign our expressions inten-sions of more than one kind. The resulting formal framework, common to all 2 d-sematics, distinguishes one dimension of actual worlds and primary intensions from a second dimension of counterfactual worlds and secondary intensions. (Hence two-dimensionalism.) These formal similarities often ob-scure the deep conceptual rifts between different interpretations of the 2 d-framework. Kaplan interprets it to capture context-dependence, Stalnaker understands it to model meta-semantic facts, and Chalmers construes it to display the epistemic roots of meaning. 1. Intensional Semantics Intensional semantics is anchored in five ideas. First idea: meaning is rep-resentation. The (literal) meaning of a sentence can be equated with how the sentence represents things as being. Second idea: representational content equals truth-conditions. How a sentence represents things as being is encap-sulated in its truth-conditions. How ‘Pavarotti is famous ’ represents things as being can be gauged from the situations the sentence is true in, i. e. that accord with how the sentence represents things as being. Third idea: truth-conditions are truth-value-distributions over possible worlds. Truth-conditi-ons can be understood as assignments of truth-values across possible worlds. We can model the truth-conditions of ‘Pavarotti is famous ’ by as-signing the sentence the truth-value true in all possible worlds that accord with it, and the truth-value false in all that don’t. Here a possible world is taken to be a comprehensive counterfactual alternative to the way our actual world is. A possible world hence encapsulates a complete specification of all facts, and the space of possible worlds comprises a world for each possi-ble counterfactual variation of our own. Some possible worlds, like those similar to ours save for the fact that Pavarotti isn’t famous (and whateve...|$|E
40|$|Experts” {{appear in}} the modern American {{courtroom}} on the jury {{as well as in}} the witness box, posing a dilemma for the legal system by offering a potentially valuable resource and an uncontrolled source of influence. Courts give ambiguous guidance to jurors on how they should handle their expertise in the deliberation room. On the one hand, jurors are told that they should “decide <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> from the evidence presented here in court. ” By direct implication, then, jurors should not use outside information to evaluate the evidence. Jurors are also told, however, that they should “consider all of the evidence in the light of reason, common sense, and experience. ” And indeed, all decision makers, including jurors, are unavoidably influenced by their own backgrounds and experiences as they evaluate evidence and reach decisions. In this Article we examine the actual and desirable behavior during deliberations of jurors with specialized expertise. We draw on three sources to assess how often citizens with specialized knowledge serve as jurors, how they behave when they do, and how legal professionals view the appropriateness of the contributions juror-experts may make. Our sources include: (1) a survey of 167 experienced trial attorneys who reported on their recent trial experience with juror “experts”; (2) the actual deliberations of jurors in fifty civil trials from the Arizona Jury Project, which revealed how real jurors use their expertise in the jury room; and (3) a survey of 128 judges and attorneys who evaluated examples of “expert” juror behavior. Some scholars suggest that jurors with specialized expertise should be excused for cause. In light of our findings, we conclude that such drastic intervention is unwarranted and would inappropriately undermine the increasing heterogeneity on the jury that the elimination of occupational exemptions has worked to promote. We instead advocate a tempered response to the growing presence of juror expertise in the jury room...|$|E
