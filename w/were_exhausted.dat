5|$|In 2000, the Quebec Superior Court denied an {{application}} by Alliance Quebec that attempted {{to force the}} DGEQ to give access to all 5 million ballots, ruling that the only authority that could do so expired in 1996. The referendum ballots were incinerated in 2008 after appeals <b>were</b> <b>exhausted.</b> In May 2005, former PQ Cabinet minister Richard Le Hir said that the PQ coordinated the ballot rejections, which PQ officials denied.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{the twenty}} one {{predetermined}} hurricane names <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> after Hurricane Wilma, the Greek alphabet was {{used and the}} storm was designated Alpha once it reached tropical storm status. The name Alpha had been used before in the Atlantic for a subtropical storm, but 2005 was the first season to have a tropical storm Alpha.|$|E
5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} because they <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> from two straight days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and {{caught up with}} them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E
50|$|City walls enter play {{once the}} first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted.</b> Whenever a feature is scored, walls {{are added to}} the board. The first player to score after the first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted</b> places the city gate next to any tile, and {{thereafter}} all players must place a wall segment such that it is adjacent to a tile and to other wall segments (or the city gate). Wall segments prevent tiles to be placed beyond the wall, and also serve to complete features. After the second pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted,</b> each player places two wall segments. In a two-player game, two wall segments are placed instead of one after the first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted,</b> and four wall segments are placed instead of two after the second pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted.</b>|$|R

5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had swollen bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases.

5|$|Although Chinese forces {{captured}} Seoul {{by the end}} of the battle, the Chinese {{invasion of}} South Korea galvanized the United Nations' support for South Korea, while the idea of evacuation was soon abandoned by the United Nations Command. At the same time, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> after months of nonstop fighting since the start of the Chinese intervention, thereby allowing the United Nations forces to regain the initiative in Korea.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German {{manpower}} advantage {{had been}} spent and their supplies and troops <b>were</b> <b>exhausted.</b> The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to the Second Battle of the Marne, after which victory he was promoted to Marshal of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{also had}} a notorious {{reputation}} for air pollution and the worst excesses of industry. By {{the time of the}} 1920s however, coal seams <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> and the iron industry in Coatbridge was in rapid decline. After the Great Depression the Gartsherrie ironwork was the last remaining iron works in the town. One publication has commented that in modern-day Coatbridge 'coal, iron and steel have all been consigned to the heritage scrap heap'.|$|E
5|$|New editions were readied as {{supplies}} of previously published editions <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> {{even though some}} editions provided little change from the previous, as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand. In the next decade, three editions followed closely on: the 3rd (1888), 4th (1891), and 5th (1894). Editions 6 through 11 were published from 1899 to 1922. The 6th edition was published in a record 7,600 copies, although subsequent editions were much lower. During this time, {{the size of the}} volume grew, and edition 12 swelled to 1243 pages, an increase of 25% over the previous edition.|$|E

5|$|The 1980s saw {{additional}} renovations. The auditor's {{office and}} the mayor’s office were both renovated, though work on the mayor's office halted when funds <b>were</b> <b>exhausted.</b> The city expanded {{the office of the}} city's attorney, and in 1982 the Portland Building was finished across the street. This allowed the city to move many city offices into a single location. Work was also completed on the exterior, while a new roof was finished. In 1985, the building began a conversion from steam heating.|$|E
5|$|The Nauruan economy {{peaked in}} the early 1980s, as it was {{dependent}} almost entirely on the phosphate deposits that originate from the droppings of sea birds. There are few other resources, and most necessities are imported. Small-scale mining is still conducted by RONPhos, {{formerly known as the}} Nauru Phosphate Corporation. The government places a percentage of RONPhos's earnings into the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust. The Trust manages long-term investments, which were intended to support the citizens once the phosphate reserves <b>were</b> <b>exhausted.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} officially {{began when}} a lone Israeli S-199 bombed Egyptian positions in Isdud at 18:00 on June 2. Five light planes—two Fairchild 24s, two Rapides and one Bonanza—also made bombing runs between 20:25 and 21:30. The bombardment {{did not make}} an impression on the readying Israeli soldiers, and {{in light of the}} noise created by the Egyptian anti-aircraft guns, the Israelis considered that the plane was lucky to have survived the run. In addition, the troops <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> not having had proper sleep in the four days preceding the operation. At 22:00, the Israeli forces started moving against the Egyptian positions.|$|E

5|$|The terrain {{complicated}} battle tactics {{for both}} sides, but the Russians and the Austrians, having {{arrived in the}} area first, were able to overcome many of its difficulties by strengthening a causeway between two small ponds. They had also devised a solution to Frederick's deadly modus operandi, the oblique order. Although Frederick's troops initially gained {{the upper hand in}} the battle, the sheer number of Allied troops gave the Russians and Austrians an advantage. By afternoon, when the combatants <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> fresh Austrian troops thrown into the fray secured the Allied victory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a German force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the German commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the German units, which <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August most of the city was liberated, with only a few small strongpoints remaining, and on 28August German troops issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 German troops were captured. In both harbours, German engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Chinese and North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>exhausted</b> {{by the war}} and were {{prepared}} to end it by late 1952, Stalin insisted that they continue fighting, and the Armistice was approved only in July 1953, after Stalin's death. North Korean leader Kim Il Sung created a highly centralized, totalitarian dictatorship – which continues to date – according himself unlimited power and generating a formidable cult of personality. In the South, the American-backed strongman Syngman Rhee ran a significantly less brutal but deeply corrupt and authoritarian regime. After Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea fell within a year under a period of military rule that lasted until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1759, peace {{negotiations}} at The Hague came to nothing. The series of Franco-Austrian losses were reversed until, in 1762, the Empress Elizabeth of Russia died. Her successor Peter III greatly admired Frederick, {{and at once}} withdrew Russia's support from the French coalition. Prussia began a drive to expel the Austrians from Saxony, and the French from Hesse-Kassel. Though she was only partially successful as her own forces <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> the conflict had essentially descended into a costly stalemate, with Maria Theresa no longer believing that she could retake Silesia. The peace treaties of Hubertusburg and Paris exacted harsh terms from France, as {{she was forced to}} relinquish most of her American colonies. For Austria, though, the result was the status quo ante bellum.|$|E
5|$|Nauru is a {{phosphate}} rock island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy strip mining operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, , are not economically viable for extraction. Nauru boasted the highest per-capita income enjoyed by any sovereign {{state in the}} world during the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the phosphate reserves <b>were</b> <b>exhausted,</b> and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value. To earn income, Nauru briefly became a tax haven and illegal money laundering centre. From 2001 to 2008, and again from 2012, it accepted aid from the Australian Government in exchange for hosting the Nauru Regional Processing Centre. As a result of heavy dependence on Australia, many sources have identified Nauru as a client state of Australia.|$|E
