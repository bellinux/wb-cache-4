500|$|In 2007, Chuck Lorre, {{the creator}} of Two and a Half Men, {{contacted}} Carol Mendelsohn, the show runner of , about a crossover. The first reactions to this were that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> idea. CSI writer and executive producer Naren Shankar commented that when Mendelsohn first {{told him about the}} idea he replied: [...] "What a nut". However, that same year, the idea resurfaced, when Lorre and Mendelsohn met at the World Television Festival in Banff. Upon hearing this, the cast of both shows were surprised and not interested, but they eventually jumped aboard. In an interview with The New York Post, before the idea was fully worked out, Mendelsohn described the possible crossover as [...] "a great challenge".|$|E
500|$|In September 1999, Buffon faced heavy {{criticism}} and severe disciplinary sanctions for bearing the fascist slogan [...] "Boia chi molla" [...] ("who gives up is a scoundrel") handwritten on a T-shirt under his goalkeeping jersey, which {{he proceeded to}} wear and show during media interviews after a match. Buffon publicly apologised, stating that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> and naïve gesture, because he was completely ignorant of the slogan's neo-fascist connotations, stating that he had first encountered the slogan written on a boarding school desk, and was unaware of its far right-wing association and, in particular, its use with the neo-fascists in Reggio Calabria during the Reggio revolt in the early 1970s. He declared that he merely intended to use the slogan to spur on his teammates and the fans, as Parma had previously encountered some disappointing results.|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began when}} the industry newsletter [...] "The Jack Myers Report" [...] harshly criticized ABC for selling the doll, and other news outlets reported the snafu. [...] Bob Tedeschi of The New York Times stated, [...] "In the charge toward e-commerce revenues, ABC learned a useful lesson last week: Don't try to sell cuddly rag dolls depicting homicidal rapists". Angela Shapiro, president of ABC, said, [...] "I was insensitive and take total responsibility for it. I should have been sensitive {{to the history of}} the character and I wasn't". Another ABC executive stated, [...] "We didn't exercise proper sensitivity to the history of the character of Todd. [...] We have re-evaluated and decided not to sell the doll". [...] A doll of Todd's daughter, Starr, remained in ABC stores. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times commented, [...] "I suppose ABC didn't have much of a choice but to pull the product--but I have to wonder about the people who voiced those protests." [...] He added, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> SOCK DOLL based on a SOAP OPERA CHARACTER. If you're offended by that, how do you get through the day without succumbing to fits of hysterical outrage every five minutes?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After this ruling, {{there were}} serious {{questions}} raised {{as to why}} Mr. Haradinaj was ever indicted in the first place. Indeed, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, Lord Madonald of River Glaven QC, said yesterday: [...] "This prosecution <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> attempt to equate resistance with aggression. It was an embarrassment to the international community." [...] The governments of both Albania and Kosovo have demanded a public inquiry into {{the behavior of the}} Chief Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte over her conduct to bring this indictment forward.|$|E

Following the scare in Boston, the Philadelphia Police Department recovered three of the 18 devices. Joe Grace, spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor John F.

She also stated that her decision to wear a brooch with the words 'rocking the boat' {{on the same day}} as the resignation was a [...] "stupid thing to do". Speaking to the Manchester Evening News she said of the brooch [...] "It was a brooch my husband had given me. I'd had four weeks of intense media pressure, the like of which I have never known, not just on me but on my husband, my dad, my family. At that point I'd had enough. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>stupid</b> thing to do but I think it was just trying to put a brave face on—not going out cowed on the basis of expenses claims that genuinely are not true." ...|$|E
