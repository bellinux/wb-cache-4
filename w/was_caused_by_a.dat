5|$|The Hatfield rail {{crash was}} a railway {{accident}} on 17 October 2000, at Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK. It <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> metal fatigue-induced derailment, killing four people and injuring more than 70.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his death}} (which {{according}} to persistent but unfounded legend <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported {{by only a}} few musicians including Ferruccio Busoni, Egon Petri and Kaikhosru Sorabji. From the late 1960s onwards, led by Raymond Lewenthal and Ronald Smith, many pianists have recorded his music and brought {{it back into the}} repertoire.|$|E
5000|$|Hypergammaglobulinemia is {{characterized}} by increased levels of immunoglobulins in the blood serum. Five different hypergammaglobulinemias <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> excess of immunoglobulin M (IgM), and some types <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> deficiency in the other major types of immunoglobulins.|$|R
5000|$|In the IS-LM model (investment {{and saving}} {{equilibrium}} liquidity preference and money supply equilibrium model), deflation <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{shift in the}} supply and demand curve for goods and services. This in turn can <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> increase in supply, a fall in demand, or both.|$|R
25|$|The dbtL {{mutation}} {{causes the}} period of PER and TIM oscillations, as well as animal behavioral activity, to lengthen to about 27 hours. This extended rhythm <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> decreased rate of phosphorylation of PER due to lower DBT kinase activity levels. This mutation <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> substitution in the protein sequence (Met-80→Ile mutation). The dbtS mutation causes a PER/TIM oscillation period of 18–20 hours. There is no current evidence for the mechanism affected by the mutation, but it <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> substitution in the protein sequence (Pro-47→ Ser mutation).|$|R
5|$|Keyser Creek is {{one source}} of {{flooding}} in the borough of Taylor. It is also the only recent flooding source in the borough. In 1971, the creek overflowed after a rainstorm, damaging several yards and lots near Oak Street and First Street. The flooding <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> faulty culvert, which was later replaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May 1962, a PBY Catalina {{flying boat}} (registration CF-IHA) crashed during landing at Nuuk Airport. The {{accident}} <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> mechanical malfunction {{in the nose}} wheel doors preventing them from closing during landing on water, resulting in the aircraft sinking. The accident killed 15 of the 21 people on board.|$|E
5|$|On 23 February 1987, a Douglas DC-9 from Scandinavian Airlines {{landing at}} Værnes {{en route from}} Bodø Airport was written off after a hard landing on the runway. This <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> high sink rate caused by the pilot {{interrupting}} the landing checklist and forgetting to arm the spoilers.

The accident <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> failure to implement a speed restriction on a section of track under maintenance.|$|E
5|$|A gas {{explosion}} {{in a residential}} area of Rosario, the third-largest city in Argentina, occurred on August 6, 2013. It <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> large gas leak; a nearby building collapsed, and others were {{at high risk of}} structural failure. Twenty-two people died, and sixty were injured. Several organizations helped secure the area, search for survivors and aid people who lost their homes. Shortly after the explosion, the time needed for reconstruction was estimated at six months.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this discovery, the {{condition}} became known as trisomy21. Even before the discovery of its cause, the presence of the syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed. Medical texts had assumed it <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified. Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth.|$|E
50|$|FOP <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>an</b> {{autosomal}} dominant allele on chromosome 2q23-24. The allele has variable expressivity, but complete penetrance.

A similar but less catastrophic disease is fibrous dysplasia, which <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> post-zygotic mutation.|$|R

Cancellara was one of the favourites to win the renewed Tour of Flanders but played no part in the final due to a crash in the feed zone. It <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> discarded water bottle. He suffered a four-part fracture of the right collarbone which ruined his spring campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 an {{outbreak}} of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs. More than 265 cases of encephalitis, of which 105 were fatal, were recorded. A new paramyxovirus was discovered in a victim's brain; it was named Nipah virus, after the village where he had lived. The infection <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> virus from fruit bats, after their colony had been disrupted by deforestation. The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings.|$|E

A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is then told {{that he will be}} given the power to avenge his love and protect the world.|$|E

50|$|Cases {{need to be}} {{differentiated}} from Far East scarlet-like fever, {{an infectious}} disease first reported in the 1950s from Russia. Because of its similar clinical presentation to scarlet fever, it was initially thought to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Streptococcus.

50|$|Ehlers-Danlos {{syndrome}} - Six {{different types}} of this disorder, which lead to deformities in connective tissue, are known. Some types can be lethal, leading to the rupture of arteries.

5|$|In a dance club, a {{young man}} is taken by a young woman, Marty (Kate Twa), for casual sex. The man dies afterwards, and Marty leaves the room as a man (Peter Stebbings). FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are called to the scene; Mulder {{believes}} that the man's death <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> fatal dose of pheromones. There is also ambiguity in similar murders as to {{the sex of the}} killer. Evidence from the crime scene leads the duo to an Amish-like community in Steveston, Massachusetts, which Mulder calls the Kindred.|$|E
5|$|In late 1995, Jackson {{was rushed}} to a {{hospital}} after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance (which was subsequently cancelled); a non-related writer claims that the incident <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> stress-related panic attack, while medics cited irregular beats, gastro-intestinal inflammation, dehydration, and kidney and liver irregularities. In none of these hospitalizations, including this one, did medics find drugs in Jackson's system. The BBC reported that during his 2005 trial, the singer again suffered from stress-related illnesses and severe weight loss.|$|E
5|$|On March 8, 2013, the {{engineering}} firm NORR, {{commissioned by the}} Ontario Provincial Police, released {{the results of their}} forensic engineering investigation to the Elliot Lake Inquiry. The investigation found that the collapse <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> two-stage failure of the welding on a connection, due to extensive corrosion. The corrosion was caused by improper waterproofing and the placement of a parking lot on the roof, which allowed water, contaminated with road salt (which accelerated the corrosion) to corrode the structure.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{ruled out}} radiation {{as the cause}} of the illness. Renan Ramirez of the Peruvian Nuclear Energy Institute stated that the medical conditions could have been caused by sulfur, arsenic or other toxins that may have melted in the extreme heat produced by the meteorite strike.

Later on 18 September, a Peruvian vulcanologist stated that the impact <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> chondrite meteorite arrival.|$|E

The accident investigation concluded that the derailment <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> faulty set of points (number 2B) on the Down Main running line, controlled from Lambrigg ground frame. The scheduled inspection on 18 February 2007 had not taken place and the faults had gone undetected.|$|E
