It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it just isn't true.|$|E

25|$|Now I {{remember}} that, on one occasion, at a disputation {{held with}} certain Jews, who were reckoned wise men, I quoted these prophecies; to <b>which</b> <b>my</b> Jewish opponent replied, that these predictions bore {{reference to the}} whole people, regarded as one individual, and as being {{in a state of}} dispersion and suffering, in order that many proselytes might be gained, on account of the dispersion of the Jews among numerous heathen nations.|$|E
25|$|Dispositions {{are also}} {{importantly}} public and hence observable. If I prefer brie to Camembert but keep this fact secret— never showing my preference, scrupulously giving no evidence from <b>which</b> <b>my</b> preference may be observed or deduced — then the preference remains strictly private. It may be aptly called a preference, {{but it is}} not a disposition in Bourdieu's sense and arguably not in the everyday sense either. A disposition performs, enacts a preference; however trivial, even when disputing the relative merits of cheeses, a disposition is a public declaration of where one stands, what one's allegiances are.|$|E
25|$|Along the African coast {{you will}} hear that dirge-like strain in all their songs, as at work or {{paddling}} their canoes to and from shore, they keep time to the music. On the southern plantations {{you will hear}} it also, and in the negro melodies every where, plaintive and melodious, sad and earnest. It seems like the dirge of national degradation, the wail of a race, stricken and crushed, familiar with tyranny, submission and unrequited labor… And here I cannot help noticing the similarity existing between the working chorus of the sailors and the dirge-like negro melody, to <b>which</b> <b>my</b> attention was specially directed by an incident I witnessed or rather heard.|$|E

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in <b>which</b> <b>my</b> left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
25|$|I {{have been}} a Catholic and an infidel; I {{have been a}} Roman priest and a hypocrite; I have been a profligate under a cowl. I am that Father Achilli, who as early as 1826, was {{deprived}} of my faculty to lecture, for an offence <b>which</b> <b>my</b> superiors {{did their best to}} conceal; and who in 1827 had already earned the reputation of a scandalous friar. I am that Achilli, who in the diocese of Viterbo in February, 1831, robbed of her honour a young women of eighteen; who in September 1833, was found guilty of a second such crime, {{in the case of a}} person of twenty-eight; and who perpetrated a third in July, 1834, in the case of another aged twenty-four. I am he, who afterwards was found guilty of sins, similar or worse, in other towns of the neighbourhood. I am that son of St. Dominic who is known to have repeated the offence at Capua, in 1834 or 1835; and at Naples again, in 1840, in the case of a child of fiteen. I am he who chose the sacristy of the church for one of these crimes, and Good Friday for another. Look on me, ye mothers of England, a confessor against Popery, for ye 'ne'er may look upon my like again.' I am that veritable priest, who, after all this, began to speak against, not only the Catholic faith, but the moral law, and perverted others by my teaching. I am the Cavaliere Achilli, who then went to Corfu, made the wife of a tailor faithless to her husband, and lived publicly and travelled about with the wife of a chorus-singer. I am that Professor of the Protestant College at Malta, who with two others was dismissed from my post for offences which the authorities cannot get themselves to describe. And now attend to me, such as I am, and you shall see what you shall see about the barbarity and profligacy of the Inquisitors of Rome.|$|E

500|$|As {{development}} of Hodj 'n' Podj progressed, the team [...] "began {{to suspect that}} it was going to appeal to a very different gaming audience", according to Meretzky. They found that an unexpected number of female players, families and non-gamers reacted with praise toward the game, compared to Meretzky's past projects. In a post-release letter to Computer Gaming World, Meretzky wrote, [...] "or the first time, I have designed a game <b>which</b> <b>my</b> 4-year-old daughter and my 70-year-old mother both enjoy."

A number of songs were recorded that did not feature on the final release, as the band considered them [...] "awful". However, the sessions were [...] "the first time [...] actually played around properly in the studio", which resulted in [...] "extreme" [...] and [...] "quite nasty" [...] guitar sounds, <b>which</b> <b>My</b> Bloody Valentine would later become associated with.|$|E
500|$|In January 1910, Maeda {{took part}} in a wrestling tournament in Mexico City. During the semifinals, Maeda drew with Hjalmar Lundin. This is a {{different}} result than Lundin recalled in his 1937 memoirs. Said Lundin, [...] "Having been accustomed to handling the big Greco-Roman wrestlers with ease, the Jap thought he could do likewise with me, but in the first encounter I got the better of him, after <b>which</b> <b>my</b> confidence returned. I had no trouble then in winning the match. It was a surprise to the crowd and a set-back for Koma.

[...] "t this point we're not sure when the record will come out and in what form.

500|$|Whitehead did {{not begin}} {{his career as a}} philosopher. [...] In fact, he never had any formal {{training}} in philosophy beyond his undergraduate education. [...] Early in his life he showed great interest in and respect for philosophy and metaphysics, but it is evident that he considered himself a rank amateur. [...] In one letter to his friend and former student Bertrand Russell, after discussing whether science aimed to be explanatory or merely descriptive, he wrote: [...] "This further question lands us in the ocean of metaphysic, onto <b>which</b> <b>my</b> profound ignorance of that science forbids me to enter." [...] Ironically, in later life Whitehead would become one of the 20th century's foremost metaphysicians.|$|E

[...] He writes, [...] "My life's goal is to bring glory to Jesus. My life is not mostly dedicated to the Lord, it is 100% committed to Jesus Christ and His will. God has given me the ability to succeed in the game of baseball. But baseball is not the end; baseball is the means by <b>which</b> <b>my</b> wife, Dee Dee, and I glorify God. Baseball is simply my platform to elevate Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the weeks}} passed, Heywood calmly {{occupied}} himself by resuming his {{studies of the}} Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: [...] "I receive with gratitude my Sovereign's mercy, for <b>which</b> <b>my</b> future life will be faithfully devoted to his service." [...] According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition {{was accompanied by a}} [...] "flood of tears". William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel, was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793.|$|E
