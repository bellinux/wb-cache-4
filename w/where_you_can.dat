5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood.

Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasoning}} is increased activity leads to increased learning, {{which leads to}} lower costs, {{which can lead to}} lower prices, which can lead to increased market share, which can lead to increased profitability and market dominance. According to BCG, the most effective business strategy was one of striving for market dominance in this way. This was particularly true when a firm had an early leadership in market share. It was claimed that if you cannot get enough market share to be competitive, you should get out of that business and concentrate your resources <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take advantage of experience effects and gain dominant market share. The BCG strategists developed product portfolio techniques like the BCG Matrix (in part) to manage this strategy.|$|E
25|$|Although Warner had {{intended}} to give the film a 5.1 stereo remastering, {{they were unable to}} do so due to several factors. The main factor was the fact that Ball's vocals in her songs often had to be pieced together line by line {{in order to get a}} more pitch-perfect performance (this method is a lot more obvious on the soundtrack CD, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> often hear a difference in fidelity in each individual line as well as the occasional line that sounds like two Lucys singing.) This and the varying conditions of the original master copies caused Warner Bros. to simply restore the original release's mono soundtrack and remaster it in Dolby Digital 1.0 mono and use it for the DVD's audio track.|$|E
