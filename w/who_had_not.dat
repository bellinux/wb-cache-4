5|$|As a {{postscript}} to the battle, Alten's KGL, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> {{had time}} to join the southern front, returned to Albuera and drove out what French force remained in the village. After six or seven hours of bitter conflict, the battle {{had come to an}} end.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E

He returned in December 2007 to continue helping Ferrari with their development programme at Jerez circuit. He focused on testing electronics and tyres for the 2008 Formula One season.|$|E

The last two, three, or four contestants <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> received their photos are brought forward for special critiques by the host before the final photo(s) is/are revealed. The contestants <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> received a photo are thus eliminated from the competition.|$|R

50|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{initiation}} is to mark the transition from childhood to adulthood. It is also to teach young Serers how to be good, brave and honourable citizens. In Serer society, a Serer man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> undergone the Ndut iniation rite is not deemed to be man. It is also taboo for a Serer woman to marry a Serer man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been circumcised. In a religious and hygienic point of view, an uncircumcised penis is deemed uncleanly and impure. Likewise, in old Serer culture, a Serer woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>not</b> undergone the njam was not deemed {{to be a real}} woman. Though prejudice against Serer women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> undergone the njam is less prevalent nowadays due to modernity, prejudice against Serer men <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> undergone circumcision still prevails in Serer culture.|$|R

5|$|Within days of Operation Berlin, the British {{returned}} to a heroes' welcome in England. A list of 59 decorations was quickly published for the 2,000 men who had returned and an investiture ceremony for the division was held at Buckingham Palace in December. Decorations for the 6000 <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> returned were not published until September 1945 and numbered only 25.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in the basement, and in the corridor of the house. Some guards <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

60|$|No! By little {{children}}, St. John means here {{children in}} age,--of course CHRISTIAN {{children and young}} people, for he was writing only to Christians. He speaks to those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been christened, and brought up, more or less, as christened children should be. But, no doubt, when he says little children, he means also all Christian people, whether they be young or old, whose souls are still young, and weak, and unlearned. All, however old they may be, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been confirmed--I do not merely mean confirmed by the bishop, but confirmed by God's grace,--all those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet come to a full knowledge of their own sins,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet been converted, and turned to God with their whole hearts and wills, <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet made their full choice between God and sin,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> yet fought for themselves the battle which no man or angel can fight for them--I mean the battle between their selfishness and their duty--the battle between their love of pleasure and their fear of sin--the battle, in short, between the devil and his temptations to darkness and shame, and God and His promises of light, and strength, and glory,--all <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> been converted to God, to them St. John speaks as little children--people who are not yet strong enough to stand alone, and do their duty on God's side against sin, the world, and the devil.

5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E
5|$|After the Armistice with Germany {{ended the}} {{fighting}} in November 1918, {{it was decided to}} have the 1918 class complete their studies. Loper therefore remained at West Point as a student officer until 11 June 1919, when he again graduated, and was assigned to the US Army Corps of Engineers, as was normal for highly placed graduates. At this time, officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> served overseas were sent to Europe to tour the battlefields, and Loper visited battlefields in France, Belgium and Italy, as well as the Army of Occupation in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Among whites, gender nonconformity {{appeared}} {{to be important in}} the development of homosexuality among masculine homosexual women, but not among homosexual women who were not masculine, while adolescent homosexual involvement was important for non-masculine homosexual women but not masculine homosexual women. Bisexual women {{appeared to}} be more influenced by involvement in homosexual genital activities in childhood than exclusively homosexual women, but unlike exclusively homosexual women, their homosexual preference did not appear related to inability to experience heterosexual arousal in childhood. Childhood gender nonconformity appeared more significant for exclusively homosexual women than for bisexual women, and more significant for women who had been in psychotherapy than for women <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E

5|$|As growth {{continued}} The Churchill Machine Tool Co's {{share capital}} was increased to £70,000, and in 1911 the four directors, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> drawn a salary since its inception, were voted £25 each as remuneration. By 1913 the businesses had attained {{such a position}} with in-house manufacturing of grinding machinery that Charles Churchill was able to ignore a threat to withdraw from him, {{on the grounds of}} conflict of interest, the agency agreement with US company Brown & Sharpe which had been set up in 1872 before his bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the island's {{population}} {{consisted of}} about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. However, {{less than a month}} into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|Back in London Emmeline {{was visited}} by Sylvia, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> seen {{her mother in}} years. Their {{politics}} were by now very different, and Sylvia was living, unmarried, with an Italian anarchist. Sylvia described a moment of familial affection when they met, followed by a sad distance between them. Emmeline's adopted daughter Mary, however, remembered the meeting differently. According to her version, Emmeline set her teacup down and walked silently out of the room, leaving Sylvia in tears. Christabel, meanwhile, had become a convert to Adventism and devoted {{much of her time}} to the church. The British press sometimes made light of the varied paths followed by the once indivisible family.|$|E

Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck.

He finished first in fan voting among NL outfielders, and second among all NL players, with 3,835,840 votes, behind only Chase Utley of the Phillies (3,889,602). He also finished first in player voting. Braun {{was the first}} Brewers outfielder voted to start an All Star game. He was one of seven first-time starters in the game, and–along with Kosuke Fukudome and Josh Hamilton–one of only three <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> reached the major leagues until 2007 or 2008.|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics for those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as}} a relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E

There is often a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Louis Stanislas was not {{infatuated}} with his wife, he boasted that the two enjoyed vigorous conjugal relations– but such declarations were held in low esteem by courtiers at Versailles. He also proclaimed his wife to be pregnant merely to spite Louis Auguste and his wife Marie Antoinette, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> yet consummated their marriage. The Dauphin and Louis Stanislas did not enjoy a harmonious relationship and often quarrelled, as did their wives. Louis Stanislas did impregnate his wife in 1774, having conquered his aversion. However, the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. A second pregnancy in 1781 also miscarried, and the marriage remained childless.|$|E
