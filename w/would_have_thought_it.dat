25|$|Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> is a {{historical}} romance. Writing during the nineteenth century, Ruiz de Burton drew upon the classical tradition and European influence. However, her use of realism and naturalism distinguishes this novel from other historical romances at the time.|$|E
25|$|Conventions of domesticity in {{the nineteenth}} century {{reinforced}} the idea that women should remain at home to look after the family. Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> does not follow the typical romance of domesticity because it introduces women from the domestic sphere into political and public spheres. The novel is situated during a time of modernization in the United States during which the home was transformed. The novel also parodies mid-nineteenth-century family life.|$|E
25|$|María Ruiz de Burton's Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> (1872) was {{the first}} novel to be written in English by a Mexican living in the United States. After a long period in which Ruiz de Burton's work was almost {{completely}} unknown, the novel was rediscovered by critics interested {{in the history of}} Chicano literature, and republished to acclaim in 1995. Yet Ruiz de Burton's life was not particularly typical of the Mexican-American experience, as she married a prominent US officer, Captain Henry S. Burton, {{in the aftermath of the}} Mexican–American War. The novel reflects her ambiguous position between the Californio elite and the Anglo-Saxon majority of the United States.|$|E

25|$|One theory {{provided}} by Herodotus is that Leonidas sent away {{the remainder of}} his men because he cared about their safety. The King <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wise to preserve those Greek troops for future battles against the Persians, but he knew that the Spartans could never abandon their post on the battlefield. The soldiers who stayed behind were to protect their escape against the Persian cavalry. Herodotus himself believed that Leonidas gave the order because he perceived the allies to be disheartened and unwilling to encounter the danger to which his own mind was made up. He therefore chose to dismiss all troops except the Thebans, Thespians and helots and save the glory for the Spartans.|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} September, with Leopold's recovery, {{the family}} moved back to central London, to lodgings in Thrift Street (later 20 Frith Street), Soho. These lodgings were located {{conveniently}} close to several concert rooms, and to the residences of both J.C Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. Bach, a son of Johann Sebastian Bach, soon became a family friend; Nannerl later recalled Bach and the eight-year-old Wolfgang playing a sonata together, taking turns to play a few bars individually, and that [...] "anyone not watching <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was played by one person alone". There is no record that the Mozarts met Abel, but Wolfgang knew his symphonies, perhaps {{through the medium of}} the annual Bach-Abel concert series, and was much influenced by them.|$|E

Faust {{had not expected}} men without children to watch it, but said, [...] "The fact that they did {{and that they were}} open-minded and cool enough and secure in their masculinity enough to embrace it and love it and go online and talk about how much they love it—I'm kind of proud." [...] Of her surprise to the unexpected fandom, Faust said, [...] "From the messages I've received, these episodes have lifted spirits, brought parents and kids together, changed perspectives and inspired the most unlikely of people in the most unlikely of places. Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> from a show about candy colored ponies?" ...|$|E

And the f------ off-spinners don't turn.' I think an {{additional}} reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then. There was a Somerset committee member, who liked and admired him, and would greet him with, 'Morning, McCool'. That committee member was seeking to be courteous. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> pompous to say 'Mr McCool', and impertinent to say 'Colin'. But it infuriated Colin. He thought it a reflection on his status. He would have preferred something like 'Hi, Col, you old bastard.' The worlds were too far apart." ...|$|E

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish. It was not a great moment really – and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} sound, Lee {{described}} [...] "What You Want" [...] as [...] "very danceable" [...] {{and her own}} vocals as [...] "fun and snappy and it gives a cool dynamic [...] ". Lee stated {{that the process of}} recording the song was fun for the band as they had excess time. She said that initially the song was conceived while the band was just recording demo, but as time passed it progressed and grew into something more. She wrote a chorus for [...] "What You Want" [...] and played it on the piano. Lee revealed that she was initially embarrassed when she came up with the lyrics and the melody of the song as she thought the members of her band would think she was Janet Jackson due to the usage of a hook. During an interview with M Music & Musicians Lee revealed that she wouldn't have recorded the song if it had been brought to her before the recording of Evanescence as she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "stupid".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} make any claims as to the {{political}} ideals that Mrs. Burton held {{one would have to}} draw parallels from her novels to the political and social turmoil during her lifetime. [...] Readers of Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> [...] are able to draw some of her cultural politics from the book. [...] The satirical style of Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> demonstrates her unhappiness with the current institutions of the American lifestyle through a Mexican perspective. [...] Religion and morality are two abstractions she criticizes in this book. [...] She parodies the Protestant's belief that they are the official religion of the United States.|$|E

2500|$|After its publication, Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> {{remained}} relatively unnoticed for {{over one hundred}} years in American literary studies, demonstrating Ruiz de Burton's exclusion from American literary history and more broadly the marginal importance that Mexican-Americans were considered to have in American history.

2500|$|María [...] Amparo Ruiz de Burton (July 3, 1832 [...] August 12, 1895) was {{the first}} female Mexican-American author to write in English.

2500|$|As well as critiquing religion, {{she also}} evaluates {{other aspects of}} American culture. [...] Her {{commentary}} is aimed at disentangling the Anglo-American contradictions in their society {{in view of the}} Mexican American. [...] "Her use of satire and parody unmasks the rhetoric of Manifest Destiny and displays the hypocrisy among New Englanders who espouse piety and condemn the South's alliance with slavery, yet demonstrate the opposite through their actions". [...] Here in Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> she battles against the Anglo-American culture to illustrate the injustices and violations committed on their part against her own heritage.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{publication}} in 1872, Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> remained relatively unnoticed for {{over one hundred}} years in American literary studies, demonstrating Ruiz de Burton's exclusion from American literary history and more broadly the marginal importance that Mexican-Americans had in American history. One {{of the main reasons}} that Ruiz de Burton's works were excluded from popular American literature is because of their depiction of American culture and morals as hypocritical. In addition, her interpretation of the loss of Mexico's claim over Northern California demonstrates her discontent with American ideals of the time. After her marriage to an American colonel, her writing widened to accommodate the perspective of being both a [...] "colonizer, and the colonized". Caught between her newfound position in the Californian elite and her background as a Californian native, her novel was not welcomed by American literary studies nor Chicana literary studies.|$|E
2500|$|Who <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It?</b> was {{the first}} novel to be written in English by a Mexican living in the United States. [...] The book was {{published}} in 1872 by J.B. Lippincott in Philadelphia [...] without the author's name on the title page, but was registered at the Library of Congress under the names of H.S. Burton and Mrs. Henry S. Burton. The book details the struggles of a Mexican-American girl born in Indian captivity, Lola, in an American society obsessed with class, religion, race and gender. [...] "The novel scrutinizes the pettiness and racism of a Northern Abolitionist family and discourses on issues of democracy, liberalism, women's suffrage, imperialism, political opportunism, and religious hypocrisy." [...] Ruiz shows “the fall of ‘republican motherhood,’ that is of ‘moral authority’ of a Yankee matron… [...] the fall of romantic conception of politics and the unmasking of liberal/democratic ideals” (76). Ruiz wants to dismantle perceptions of idealized democracy and justice in the U.S. and prove it to be corrupt and only just {{for the rich and}} powerful.|$|E
