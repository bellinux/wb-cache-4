25|$|Cathay was the country's first {{air-conditioned}} cinema i.e. Cathay Cinema and {{the first}} skyscraper, the tallest in Southeast Asia during that time. It {{was the first time}} patrons could <b>watch</b> <b>movies</b> air-conditioned and sitting in a comfortable armchair. It was also used as a landmark by pilots as a final approach before landing. Three years later, it showed its last show and was converted into a Red Cross casualty station. After the end of war in 1945, Cathay reopened and it was Singapore's first cinema to show American and British pictures as its first screening after closure. It signed a joint venture with another company to distribute mobile films to villages and estates in Malaysia. The group installed a new air-conditioning plant in 1948 and they started to acquire many cinemas in Singapore and Malaysia.|$|E

25|$|Since {{at least}} 1908, Windsor Terrace {{has had its}} own movie theater since the Marathon Theatre opened at present-day 188 Prospect Park W in 1908. The 500-seat Marathon Theatre had a Wurlitzer organ {{installed}} in 1927, shortly before its 1928 demolition. In August of that year, the 1,516-seat, Art Deco Sanders Theatre was opened {{on the site of}} the former Marathon Theatre, where it operated for half a century before its closure in 1976. The building stood vacant for twenty years after that, and investors bought the building in 1993 in hopes of reopening the theatre. The Pavilion Theatre, a 3-screen movie theater within the defunct Sanders Theatre building, opened in 1996 to positive reception from the surrounding communities, which had experienced a cultural decline in prior years. The theater, which expanded to 9 screens in October 2004, suffered from complaints about broken toilets, poorly maintained seats, and sticky floors, as well as a rumor of bedbug-infested upholstery and malfunctions in the theater's heating system. In October 2016, the building was closed in preparation for conversion to a 7-screen, 650-seat theatre. Operated by Nitehawk Cinemas, the refurbished Pavilion Theatre, where patrons would be able to dine and <b>watch</b> <b>movies</b> simultaneously, would be Nitehawk's second movie theater within Brooklyn. As part of the one-year-long, $10 million renovations, the theater would remain largely unchanged except for the addition of a new marquee and an enlargement of the theater's windows. The original plans for the building were to build a 24-condominium building next to the theater, and for the theater's floor space to be shrunk.|$|E

The original design for Marge's police uniform had Marge's hair standing up (as it normally is) with the hat on top. Director Mark Kirkland found that it made for awkward staging in scenes, so they altered the design to have her hair pulled down. David Mirkin later stated that if the design had been used, he would have asked for it to be changed because they were trying to depict Marge as a serious cop.|$|E

Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating whatever he wanted. Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white. Also, Duncan provided the voice for Kingpin in [...] He spoke on the fan's loyalty to the source material by saying [...] "they <b>watch</b> <b>movies</b> to say, 'Hey, that's not like the comic book.'

The questionnaire is used to collect the data of students’ habit of <b>watching</b> <b>movies</b> while the test is used to collect the data of students’ discourse competence and speaking skill. The techniques which are used in analyzing the data are Simple Correlation and Multiple Regression Correlation.
