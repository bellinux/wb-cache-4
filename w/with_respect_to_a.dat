5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration, in United States trademark law, {{is a federal}} trademark registration of the same trademark to two or more unrelated parties, with each party having a registration limited to a distinct geographic area. Such a registration is achieved by filing a {{concurrent use}} application (or by converting an existing application to a concurrent use application) and then prevailing in a concurrent use proceeding before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ("TTAB"), which is a judicial body within the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). A concurrent use application may be filed <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> trademark which is already registered or otherwise in use by another party, but may {{be allowed to go}} forward based on the assertion that the existing use can co-exist with the new registration without causing consumer confusion.|$|E

The proof {{is based on a}} criterion for cofiniteness <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ideal of dimension one. Namely for such ideals it suffices that the two first Ext-modules in the definition for cofiniteness are finitely generated. This criterion is also used to prove very simply that all local cohomology modules of a finitely generated module <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ideal of dimension one in an arbitrary noetherian ring are cofinite <b>with</b> <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> the ideal...|$|R
