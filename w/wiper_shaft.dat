50|$|The loom {{is powered}} by a leather steam-belt which drives the driving shaft. Here there is a {{flywheel}} to smooth the motion and a crank mechanism to drive the battens (swords) and a toothed wheel. This engages a second shaft known as the tappet shaft or <b>wiper</b> <b>shaft</b> whose job is to lower the treadles and throw the shuttle. This turns half the speed of the driving shaft, so its toothed wheel is twice the size.|$|E
5000|$|In most applications, such as telephony, it is {{desirable}} {{to be able to}} return the wipers to a [...] "home" [...] position; this is at the beginning of rotation, {{at one end of the}} array of fixed contacts. Some switches have a cam attached to the <b>wiper</b> <b>shaft.</b> This cam operates a set of contacts when the wiper is at home position, which is at the beginning of the span of rotation. Other circuit designs used one level (pole) of the contacts to home the wipers, so the separate homing contacts were not needed.|$|E

5000|$|These swords {{are often}} mistaken for radio antennas. The entire system may include {{upper and lower}} cutter assemblies, a non-electrically {{conductive}} abrasive strip wire scoring device along {{the center of the}} divided windscreen and windshield wiper protector frames to keep wires from hanging up on <b>wiper</b> motor <b>shafts.</b> The WSPS is designed to channel a wire or cable into the cable cutter to score and weaken it as it travels into the cutter assembly and [...] "cut" [...] a wire before it can entangle the rotor system. The U.S. Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker, AL, claims that in a single wire strike 90% survivability is achieved by using WSPS. The more wires encountered at a given time the less likely WSPS will help the aircraft survive the encounter.|$|R
40|$|A {{measurement}} system for simultaneously measuring torque and angular flexure in a pressure suit joint is described. One {{end of a}} joint under test is held rigid. A torque transducer is pivotably supported on the other movable end of a joint. A potentiometer {{is attached to the}} transducer by an arm. The <b>wiper</b> <b>shaft</b> of the potentiometer is gripped by a reference arm that rotates the <b>wiper</b> <b>shaft</b> the same angle as the flexure of joint. A signal is generated by the potentiometer which is representative of the joint flexure. A compensation circuit converts the output of the transducer to a signal representative of joint torque...|$|E
2500|$|In 1949 {{the first}} {{delivered}} 2CV type A was 375 cc, 9hp, with a [...] top speed, only one tail light and windscreen <b>wiper</b> with speed <b>shaft</b> drive; the <b>wiper</b> speed {{was dependent on}} the driving speed. The car was heavily criticised by the motoring press and became the butt of French comedians for a short while. [...] One American motoring journalist quipped, [...] "Does it come with a can opener?" [...] The British Autocar correspondent wrote that the 2CV [...] "is {{the work of a}} designer who has kissed the lash of austerity with almost masochistic fervour".|$|R
