5|$|Four days later, the Dukes {{were blown}} out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders {{led the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> game with a sprained ankle.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Taylor's success passing the ball, the Hokies {{also had a}} successful running offense. Running back Ryan Williams, who was limited {{for much of the}} season because of injury, had 473rushingyards. Fellow running back Darren Evans, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> 2008 season because of injury, gained 817yards and 11touchdowns. Sophomore running back David Wilson gained 616yards. Combined with Taylor's rushing total, Virginia Tech gained 2,543yards and 30touchdowns on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} Crusaders, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> playoffs {{for the first time}} since 2001. This broke a 13 year old streak of {{consecutive}} playoff appearances. The Crusaders had a record of 9 wins and 6 losses. Despite the poor record the Crusaders (46) had more points than the Stormers (45), but owing to the playoff structure missed the playoffs. The Crusaders fare-welled Crusaders and All Black legends Richie McCaw and Dan Carter at the seasons end.|$|E

Johnny was {{a replacement for}} Waltman <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> event due to undisclosed reasons. Shelley began the bout alone, until Johnny, who was in attendance along with several of Candido's family members, jumped the railing to join Shelley as his tag team partner by taking a tag from Shelley. A bit later, Douglas kicked Candido in the crotch and pinned him with a roll-up pin, thus eliminating Shelley and Candido from the contest.|$|E
5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in British Columbia, where Brashear testified {{that he had no}} memory of the incident. McSorley testified that he tried to hit Brashear in the {{shoulder}} to start a fight with him, but missed, resulting in the head shot. McSorley was found guilty but avoided a jail sentence. He was required to complete 18 months of probation, in which he was not allowed to play in a game against Brashear. Brashear returned to play prior {{to the end of the}} season. McSorley, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> remaining 23 games of the regular season, had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction. However, he ultimately never played in another NHL game during his career.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1930, Wilfred Rhodes {{announced}} {{that he intended to}} retire from first-class cricket {{at the end of the}} season. Several spin bowlers were considered as his replacement; Hirst, who watched them all bowl in the nets, considered Verity the most impressive. Verity made his first-class debut on 21 May 1930 in an early-season non-Championship match against Sussex. Rhodes, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> match, spent the game watching Verity and seemed convinced afterwards that his successor had been found. Bowling in two innings, Verity took three wickets for 96 in 46.1overs; in the process, he won praise from the press, particularly for preventing the batsmen from scoring. Rhodes returned for the next match; Verity appeared only once more in May, taking eight wickets in the match against Leicestershire, and once in June. In his fourth game, he took nine for 60 in the second innings against Glamorgan and 12 wickets in the match. Rain had damaged the pitch, making it difficult to bat against spinners. After this, Verity played regularly alongside Rhodes, and, helped by a succession of rain-affected pitches, took a total of 64wickets in 12games at an average of 12.42, figures which placed him top of the national bowling averages. His best performance came against Hampshire when he took 13 wickets for 83 runs, including seven for 26 in the first innings.|$|E

5|$|The German team {{started the}} second half in a more {{positive}} mood with Jancker forcing a save from Schmeichel in the first minute of the restart. Basler was proving to be Bayern's most dangerous player, first firing a 30-yard shot towards goal and then setting up a header for Markus Babbel, <b>who</b> <b>missed</b> <b>the</b> ball entirely. United put together an attack when, after a healthy period of possession, Giggs sent in a cross towards Jesper Blomqvist who could only knock the ball over the bar after a desperate stretch. Another chance for Basler prompted Alex Ferguson to bring on striker Teddy Sheringham. Ottmar Hitzfeld responded with a substitution of his own, bringing on Mehmet Scholl, who immediately set up Stefan Effenberg for a long-range shot which went narrowly wide. Schmeichel kept his side in the game when tipping another Effenberg shot over the bar after 75 minutes. Scholl then almost scored from a delicate 20-yard chip after a run from Basler, but the ball bounced back off the post and {{into the arms of}} a relieved Schmeichel. With the game seemingly drifting away from the English side, Ferguson introduced striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær with 10 minutes remaining. The substitute immediately forced Kahn into a diving save with a header; it was the closest United had come to scoring all game. A minute later, Bayern missed a chance to secure the trophy when an overhead kick from Jancker came off the crossbar. As the game crept into the last five minutes, United's two substitutes forced Kahn into more saves, firstly through a Sheringham volley and then from another Solskjær header.|$|E
