The ability to drive a substantial distance from the power wires allows trackless vehicles to avoid obstacles, although it also means a possibility that the vehicle may steer or skid far enough that the trolley pole can no longer reach the <b>wire,</b> <b>stranding</b> the vehicle. Trackless trolleys also are able to avoid collisions by maneuver, while trams can only change speed.|$|E

Hybrid {{composite cable}} contains three layers: carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) core, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) distributional layer and steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands.</b> All layers of hybrid composite cable take up tension stresses, acting in the cable during exploitation.

The dependence of external pressure per unit of the surface area of the GFRP (due to the pressure of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands)</b> of hybrid composite cable on the axial force and angle of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> twisting was estimated by the engineering method of calculations. Tangential and radial stresses for GFRP and CFRP components of hybrid composite cable were obtained.

5000|$|Litz wire: To reduce {{skin effect}} losses, some coils are wound {{with a special}} type of radio {{frequency}} wire called litz wire. Instead of a single solid conductor, litz wire consists {{of a number of}} smaller <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> that carry the current. Unlike ordinary <b>stranded</b> <b>wire,</b> the <b>strands</b> are insulated from each other, to prevent skin effect from forcing the current to the surface, and are twisted or braided together. The twist pattern ensures that each <b>wire</b> <b>strand</b> spends the same amount of its length {{on the outside of the}} wire bundle, so skin effect distributes the current equally between the strands, resulting in a larger cross-sectional conduction area than an equivalent single wire.|$|R

50|$|At high frequencies, current travels {{near the}} surface of the wire because of the skin effect, {{resulting}} in increased power loss in the <b>wire.</b> <b>Stranded</b> <b>wire</b> might seem to reduce this effect, since the total surface area of the strands is greater than the surface area of the equivalent solid <b>wire,</b> but ordinary <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> does not reduce the skin effect because all the strands are short-circuited together and behave as a single conductor. A <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> will have higher resistance than a solid wire of the same diameter because the cross-section of the <b>stranded</b> <b>wire</b> is not all copper; there are unavoidable gaps between the strands (this is the circle packing problem for circles within a circle).

Hybrid composite cable contains three layers: carbon fiber composite cable (CFCC) core, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) and steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands.</b> CFCC core and steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> take up tension stresses, acting in the cable during the exploitation. The functions of GFRP are distribution of transversal pressure of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> at the carbon fiber core, and taking up of tension stresses. Volume fractions {{of steel and}} carbon are determined basing on the assumption, that in an emergency, when the strain of carbon fiber exceeds the ultimate value and these fibers are disrupted, <b>strands</b> of steel <b>wire</b> must be able to take up tension stresses, acting in the cable.

5000|$|Assembly of a screw {{connection}} requires some care in workmanship to ensure proper removal of insulation, containment of all <b>wire</b> <b>strands,</b> and the adequate tightening of the screw. If the wire diameter is small {{in relation to}} the size of the screw, the wire may be cut through by the over-tightening of the screw. This is less likely to occur when a wire is clamped between two plates by the action of a screw. Since <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> may not be contained by the screw head in a basic screw terminal, <b>stranded</b> <b>wires</b> may be crimped into a ferrule to prevent the bridging of terminals; this partly offsets the economy of a [...] "bare" [...] wire termination.|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} composite cables {{with large}} specific strength {{and made of}} base of materials using carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced plastics (GFRP) and Vectran, are widely used in constructional industry. However, {{the use of a}} steel component enables the small elongation of the cable to be moderately increased, the brittleness decreased and the scope of application of high strength composite cables expanded respectively. Cable made of steel in combination with other materials such as CFRP, GFRP and Vec-tran, was studied and reported in this paper. Volumetric fraction of steel was within the limits of 0. 1 to 0. 7. The inter-dependent relationship of external pressure per unit surface area of the distributed layer (due to the pressure of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands)</b> of hybrid composite cable on the axial force and angle of steel <b>wire</b> <b>strands</b> twisting was es-timated by engineering method of calculations.

Relationship between materials and their content in hybrid composite cables with the steel component was considered. Hybrid composite cables with the steel component were considered as materials of several groups of cables in a prestressed saddle-shaped cable roof.
