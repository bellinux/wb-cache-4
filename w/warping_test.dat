40|$|The moisture-induced warping of three-layered {{cross-laminated}} {{solid wood}} panels made of Norway spruce was studied. The panels {{were exposed to}} different climate conditions at 65 % and 100 % relative humidity at the two panel faces. The results showed increasing cup deformation with an increasing relative thickness of the outer layers. The annual growth ring orientation {{was found to have}} a significant influence on the magnitude of the cup deformation. Measurements and numerical simulations of the moisture distribution within the panel were made in order to provide data for numerical simulations of the warping. A distinctive moisture profile with a conspicuous influence of the adhesive bond lines was found. The coefficient of diffusion of the adhesive bond lines was determined from the measurements and simulations. The mechanical material model used for the warping simulations takes into account elastic strain, moisture-induced swelling, and mechano-sorptive strain. The simulations showed good agreement with the <b>warping</b> <b>test</b> results. The most important material parameters for the cup deformation, which were identified in a parametric study of a panel with vertically oriented annual rings, are the moduli of elasticity and the swelling coefficients in the longitudinal and radial direction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of Geosphere, a physical- and link-layer design for access point-based MIMO wireless networks that consistently improves network throughput. To send multiple streams of data in a MIMO system, prior designs rely on a technique called zero-forcing, a way of "nulling" the interference between data streams by mathematically inverting the wireless channel matrix. In general, zero-forcing is highly effective, significantly improving throughput. But in certain physical situations, the MIMO channel matrix can become "poorly conditioned," harming performance. With these situations in mind, Geosphere uses sphere decoding, a more computationally demanding technique that can achieve higher throughput in such channels. To overcome the sphere decoder's computational complexity when sending dense wireless constellations at a high rate, Geosphere introduces search and pruning techniques that incorporate novel geometric reasoning about the wireless constellation. These techniques reduce computational complexity of 256 -QAM systems by almost one order of magnitude, bringing computational demands in line with current 16 - and 64 -QAM systems already realized in ASIC. Geosphere thus makes the sphere decoder practical {{for the first time}} in a 4 x 4 MIMO, 256 -QAM system.

In general, linear detection methods can be highly effective when the MIMO channel is well-conditioned.

Via our <b>WARP</b> <b>testbed</b> implementation we gather indoor channel traces in order to evaluate the performance gains of sphere detection against zero-forcing and MMSE in an actual indoor environment. We show that Geosphere can nearly linearly scale performance with the number of user antennas; in 4 × 4 multi-user MIMO for 256 -QAM modulation at 30 dB SNR there is a 1. 7 × gain over MMSE and 2. 4 × over zeroforcing and a 14 % and 22 % respective gain in 2 × 2 systems.

40|$|A cross-layer scheme, namely ALOHA With Collision Resolution (ALOHA-CR), is {{proposed}} for high throughput wireless communications in a cellular scenario. Transmission {{occurs in a}} time-slotted ALOHA-type fashion with a caveat: simultaneous transmissions of two users can be successful. The wireless channel {{is assumed to be}} flat fading and constant over the duration of one time slot. A user i with a non-empty queue transmits a packet with some probability p in the beginning of each time slot, after waiting for a random time interval τi. If more than two users transmit in the same slot, the collision cannot be resolved, the packets are discarded and the users are asked to retransmit at a later time. If only one user transmits, the transmitted packet is recovered with some probability, depending {{on the state of the}} channel. If two users transmit, the collision can be separated and the packets recovered by first oversampling the collision signal and then exploiting independent information about the two users that is contained in the signal polyphase components. The properties of the user delays τi’s are determined so that the probability of user separation is maximized. The ALOHA-CR throughput is derived under the infinite backlog assumption, i. e., the network users always have data in their queues, and also under the assumption of finite backlog. In the infinite backlog assumption, the optimal contention probability is calculated, which maximizes the system throughput. In the finite backlog assumption, the region of contention probability is determined based on the packet arrival rate. Queuing delay of network users are also derived. The performance of ALOHA-CR is demonstrated on a <b>WARP</b> <b>testbed</b> containing five software defined radio nodes.

To maintain security, (I) We propose JIMS, a jamming interference mitigation scheme, using which, transceivers can identify subcarriers that are relatively unaffected by jamming and utilize them for communications.

40|$|Full-duplex is {{the ability}} of a node to {{transmit}} and receive simultaneously in the same band. Ideal wireless full-duplex communication can double the spectral efficiency compared to the traditional half-duplex communication. In this dissertation, we study the challenges in realizing full-duplex communication. We tackle the challenges from two different perspectives: node and network. Node perspective: Simultaneous transmission and reception results in a large self- interference due to the proximity of transmit and receive antennas at the full-duplex node. To establish the feasibility of wireless full-duplex, we develop a wideband real-time physical layer and evaluate its performance on the <b>WARP</b> <b>testbed.</b> Self-interference reduction in our proposed physical layer is achieved through passive suppression and active cancellation. Based on the constraints of the physical layer, we propose a MAC layer protocol which is designed specifically to discover and enhance opportunities to communicate in the full-duplex mode. Experimental evaluation of our physical layer design, as well as several other full-duplex designs proposed in literature, reveal that active cancellation does not push self-interference all the way upto the thermal noise floor. In this dissertation, we explore the bottlenecks limiting active cancellation in full-duplex systems. We show that the amount of active cancellation is limited by transmitter side noise, particularly by the phase-noise in the local oscillator at the transmitter of the full- duplex node. Thus, unlike conventional half-duplex systems where receiver thermal noise is a limiting factor, full-duplex systems are limited by transmitter side noise. As a key by-product of our analysis, we propose a signal model for a wideband MIMO full-duplex system. We use our proposed signal model to study the performance limits of a system where the start of transmission and the start of reception at a full-duplex node are not synchronized. Interestingly, we discover that the bit-error-rate of the communication mode where the start of transmission precedes the start of reception is better than the mode where start of transmission follows reception of a packet at the full-duplex node. Network perspective: In order to extract gains in capacity from full-duplex operation in a multi-user network, we propose to use full-duplex capable nodes to si- multaneously operate uplink and downlink in a network. Such operation results in a new type of interference in the network – internode interference, i. e., the uplink transmission from each mobile user starts interfering with the downlink receptions at all the other mobile users. We show a physical layer coding strategy that aligns interference over time and extracts gains in degrees-of-freedom of the network. Finally, we recognize that larger gains from full-duplex operation are possible by leveraging the fact that the strength of the internode interference channel is often different from the uplink/downlink channel. By analysing the uplink/downlink capacity of a network composed of one base-station and two mobile users, we show that full-duplex not only out-performs half-duplex, but also recovers some of the degrees-of-freedom lost due to lack/delay of channel state information of the network...|$|R

Experimental results indicate that the MFCC feature warping-ICA achieves a reduction in equal error rate about (48. 22 %, 44. 66 %, and 50. 07 %) over using MFCC feature <b>warping</b> when the <b>test</b> speech signals are corrupted with random sessions of street, car, and home noises at - 10 dB SNR...|$|R
40|$|In today's OFDMA networks, the {{transmission}} power is typically fixed {{and the same}} for all the sub-carriers that compose a channel. The sub-carriers though, experience different degrees of fading and thus, the received power is different for different sub-carriers; while some frequencies experience deep fades, others are relatively unaffected. In this paper, we make a case for redistributing the power across the sub-carriers (subject to a fixed power budget constraint) to better cope with this frequency selectivity. Specifically, we design a joint power and rate adaptation scheme (called JPRA for short) wherein power redistribution is combined with sub-carrier level rate adaptation to yield significant throughput benefits. We further consider three variants of JPRA: (a) JPRA-Basic where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across all the sub-carriers (b) JPRA-Intermediate where, the power is redistributed across sub-carriers so as to support a maximum common rate across a 'subset' of sub-carriers such that the aggregate rate is maximized. (c) JPRA-Adaptive where, the goal is to redistribute power such that {{the transmission}} time of a packet is minimized. While the first two variants decrease transceiver complexity and are simpler, the third is geared towards achieving the maximum throughput possible. We implement all three variants of JPRA on our <b>WARP</b> radio <b>testbed.</b> Our extensive experiments demonstrate that JPRA can provide a 35 percent improvement in total network throughput in testbed experiments compared to FARA, a scheme where only sub-carrier level rate adaptation is used. We also perform simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of JPRA in larger scale networks...|$|R
40|$|Warped discs {{have been}} found on (sub-) parsec scale in some nearby Seyfert nuclei, {{identified}} by their maser emission. Using dust radiative transfer simulations we explore their observational signatures in the infrared {{in order to find}} out whether they can partly replace the molecular torus. Strong variations of the brightness distributions are found, depending on the orientation of the warp with respect to the line of sight. Whereas images at short wavelengths typically show a disc-like and a point source component, the warp itself only becomes visible at far-infrared wavelengths. A similar variety is visible in the shapes of the spectral energy distributions. Especially for close to edge-on views, the models show silicate feature strengths ranging from deep absorption to strong emission for variations of the lines of sight towards the <b>warp.</b> To <b>test</b> the applicability of our model, we use the case of the Circinus galaxy, where infrared interferometry has revealed a highly elongated emission component matching a warped maser disc in orientation and size. Our model is for the first time able to present a physical explanation for the observed dust morphology as coming from the AGN heated dust. As opposed to available torus models, a warped disc morphology produces a variety of silicate feature shapes for grazing lines of sight, close to an edge-on view. This could be an attractive alternative to a claimed change of the dust composition for the case of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068, which harbours a warped maser disc as well.

40|$|Most textile mills use sizes {{based on}} {{synthetic}} agents. In practice {{these products are}} not or only partly biodegradable. Therefore they should not run into municipal treatment plants. Nevertheless the market share of these sizes has been increasing continuously {{during the last few}} years. The main reason is: synthetic sizes meet best the requirements of modern weaving technology, while starch based biogradable sizes don't do this satisfactory. Therefore the aim of the research project is to develop size agents based on modified starch which are high-efficient and well biogradable and/or to modifiy synthetic sizes to improve their biogradability and elimination rate in purification processes. These new products will be tested at sizing and desizing processes under practical conditions in weaving and finishing mills. Furthermore the disposability of the resulting effluent in municipal waste water treatment respectively its degradability in aerobic biological purification processes will be examined. The new products will also be tested for their recovery in the ultrafiltration processes as well as for biodegradability in anaerobic processes. The project is being realizes by the ITV Denkendorf together with industrial partners, such as leading manufactorers of size agents and weaving and finishing mills. The Kolb and Schuele AG, Kirchheim/Teck, performed broken end analysis on their normally sized warps. The results can b e a standard of comparison for forthcoming tests of new products. The standard warps showed good performance in weaving. Due to being oversized a compared <b>test</b> <b>warp</b> did not perform as well. Another <b>test</b> <b>warp</b> was sized with a product of a project partner and was woven and desized under practical conditions in the mill. At the beginning of the project the ITV Denkendorf did adhesive power measurements of three types of cotton fibre of Kolb and Schuele AG to find out the best suitable fibres for this testing method. In cooperation with the ITV the weaving and sizing departments were analyzed to get a good base for the tests of the new sizing agents. (orig.)

40|$|ABSTRACT: As {{the use of}} {{woven fabric}} {{composites}} increases, understanding their elastic behavior is essential. For this study, an experimental approach was undertaken to determine the elastic properties of a woven fabric composite, {{with a focus on}} determining stiffness coupling terms that are often neglected in analytical and FEA models. Specimens were fabricated with a 5 -harness satin-weave carbon– epoxy composite and were subjected to three loading conditions: tension, bending, and torsion. The approach taken to calculate the stiffness (or compliance) matrix terms is presented, along with symmetry properties that provide some relationships between these terms. The results indicate that the minor coupling terms are difficult to quantify due to the small strains that need to be measured. The results indicate that the minor coupling terms are very sensitive to fiber misalignment. Careful fiber alignment along the longitudinal (<b>warp)</b> direction of <b>test</b> coupons gives coupling terms corresponding to that direction which are much less sensitive to the fiber misalignment. The major in-plane and out-of-plane compliance terms were also measured by the tests conducted.
