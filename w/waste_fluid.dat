The extraction and recovery of polluting and precious metals from <b>waste</b> <b>fluids</b> has recently gained increasing importance. It should be noted that, besides to its main use in jewellery and investment, applications of gold are rapily and widely expanding so that the gold recovery from <b>waste</b> <b>fluids</b> or <b>waste</b> scraps is becoming important. On the other hand, the risk potential of copper in the environment gains in significance due to application and special properties of copper with respect to toxicity and complexing ability with humic substances. 4 Studies on metal extraction suggest that surfactant based metodologies could be effective in the removal of these ions from <b>waste</b> <b>fluids...</b>|$|R

It is distributed through the south-east of Australia, from southern Queensland to South Australia, as well as Tasmania.

As they feed on tree sap they expel small droplets of clear <b>waste</b> <b>fluid.</b> When numbers are high, this can form a constant stream.|$|E

5000|$|According to the USGS {{only a small}} {{fraction}} of roughly 30,000 <b>waste</b> <b>fluid</b> disposal wells for oil and gas operations in the United States have induced earthquakes that are large enough to be of concern to the public. [...] Although the magnitudes of these quakes has been small, the USGS says that there is no guarantee that larger quakes will not occur. In addition, the frequency of the quakes has been increasing. In 2009, there were 50 earthquakes greater than magnitude 3.0 in the area spanning Alabama and Montana, and there were 87 quakes in 2010. In 2011 there were 134 earthquakes in the same area, a sixfold increase over 20th century levels. There are also concerns that quakes may damage underground gas, oil, and water lines and wells that were not designed to withstand earthquakes.|$|E

50|$|The current {{design of}} the ECO Funnel {{utilizes}} a latching lid with gasket, and two internal tubes. One larger and longer tube extends into the container {{from the base of}} the funnel into the liquid waste to restrict the surface area of the contents and inhibit fume emission. The other tube is designed to sit above the liquid level as a means to warn against overfilling. When the ECO Funnel is secured to a container, this second shorter and smaller tube provide the only ventilation. When the volume of liquid inside the container reaches the smaller tube opening, it will obstruct the air flow through the smaller tube, the <b>waste</b> <b>fluid</b> backs up into the funnel to signal the user that the container is at capacity. Detaching the ECO Funnel allows the remaining liquid to flow into the container and be safely sealed inside. So long as the ECO Funnel's contents do not exceed the maximum volume indicated, the liquid will drain into the container without overflowing.|$|E

The microbiology of MWF is of interest for two contrasting reasons namely: (1) they represent attractive nutrient sources for microorganisms, which lead to bio-deterioration, reducing metal working performance and potentially leading to invasion of human pathogens; (2) in contrast, the same biodegradation activities of potential microbial colonizers can be harnessed and exploited for biotreatment of <b>waste</b> <b>fluids.</b> These contrasting microbiological issues are discussed and details provided.

40|$|<b>Waste</b> {{engineering}} <b>fluids,</b> such as coolants {{and cutting}} fluids, {{are difficult to}} treat because they have variable physical natures, are particularly toxic and {{have a very high}} Chemical Oxygen Demand. The complex and unknown chemical content of the many different products available is also problematic. Current technologies, such as nanofiltration or chemical treatment, are quite effective at reducing the COD of the <b>waste</b> metalworking <b>fluids</b> before disposal. These technologies remove free or emulsified oil and high molecular weight components, but they have their limitations. In addition, the more stringent legislation on waste disposal and effluent discharge induces an economical stress on engineering industries. It can be anticipated that future legislations will introduce eco-toxicology measurements into industrial effluent discharge consents. A modular on-site treatment plant to treat semi-synthetic metalworking fluids was developed in this thesis. The approach was to combine different technologies and to inter-optimise their performances. The technologies used were membrane filtration, bioremediation and chemical treatment. The use of activated carbon was also studied. Membrane filtration included the study of ultrafiltration and nanofiltration. For the bioremediation process, a bio-consortia was developed and tested over 8 months. A final design of the whole process is given. The proposed treatment plant transforms the <b>waste</b> metalworking <b>fluid</b> into two products: very low chemical oxygen demand aqueous phase at 30 mg/l COD and a recovered oil showing a calorific value of 42 kJ/kg which could be a possible commodity.
