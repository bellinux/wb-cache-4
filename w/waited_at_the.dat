25|$|Preparations {{to perform}} a final assault on the fort began on 20 October; siege ladders were distributed, and {{officers}} were told where they would strike the fort. Finally, on 22 October, Peter decided to perform the assault. At one o'clock in the morning, a fire {{broke out in the}} fort. Local hunters and men from the Preobrazhensky Regiment, among others, <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ready in landing boats, two miles away from the fort. At half-past two, mortar shots were fired, which was the signal to commence the attack.|$|E
25|$|Among Andrea Dorias {{passengers}} were Hollywood actress Ruth Roman and her three-year-old son, Richard. In the 1950 film Three Secrets, Roman had portrayed a distraught mother waiting to learn {{whether or not}} her child had survived a plane crash. She and her son were separated from each other during the collision and evacuation. Rescued, Roman had to wait to learn her child's fate {{which resulted in a}} media frenzy for photos as she <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pier in New York City for her child's safe arrival aboard one of the rescue ships. Actress Betsy Drake, wife of movie star Cary Grant, also escaped from the sinking liner, as did Philadelphia mayor Richardson Dilworth and songwriter Mike Stoller (of the team Leiber and Stoller).|$|E
25|$|Duel Live {{made use}} of the {{original}} outdoor queue line, often with other actors roaming the wooded area.

Guests <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> door instead of walking straight in, before being greeted by either a maid or a butler (the performers alternated during the 2009 version, but in 2008 only the butler featured) and given a brief talk about what was inside and why the guns were switched off. The TV screens in the Drawing Room were covered with cloth and muted, and the original spooky music turned up; the room being similar {{to what it was}} in the original Haunted House. During the 2008 event, the maid jumped out at guests as they entered the Drawing Room.|$|E

25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E
25|$|The Spartan {{government}} was initially unconcerned with the Athenians' presence at Pylos, assuming {{that they would}} soon depart. Once it became clear, however, that Demosthenes and his men intended to hold the site, the king Agis, {{who was at the}} head of an army ravaging Attica, turned for home, cutting his invasion short after only 15 days in Athenian territory. Once he reached home, Spartan forces immediately moved towards Pylos, the fleet at Corcyra was ordered to sail there immediately, and a summons was sent out calling allied states around the Peloponnese to send troops. The Spartan fleet managed to slip past the Athenian fleet at Zacynthus, but Demosthenes anticipated its arrival and dispatched two of his triremes to inform the Athenian fleet of Pylos' plight; that fleet set out for Pylos as soon as it received the news. Pylos, meanwhile, had been reinforced by the arrival of a privateer with a cargo of arms, which were distributed to the sailors, and by a Messenian pinnace, which brought 40 more hoplites to defend the peninsula. (Donald Kagan has asserted that these apparently fortuitous arrivals must have been the result of planning by Demosthenes.) To meet the imminent Spartan attack, Demosthenes divided his force, placing most of his men {{at the point where the}} promontory touched the mainland, while he with 60 hoplites and a few archers <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> point facing out to sea where the Athenian wall was weakest. When the Spartan fleet arrived, the Spartans prepared to blockade the entrance to the harbour by placing hoplites on the island of Sphacteria, which was in the middle of the entrance, and planned to place ships in the gaps on either side of that island when the Athenian fleet arrived.|$|E

As soon as Blue Ghost 39 and 28 crossed the Song Meiu Giang, Kulland and Rosebeary's aircraft were met by an immediate curtain of North Vietnamese fire from every direction, hurled against them with an intensity that defied belief. Rosebeary in his Cobra Blue Ghost 28 responded with rockets and 40mm fire but both helicopters were struck multiple times.|$|E

500|$|During {{the heavy}} fighting, {{portions}} of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura's {{and one from}} Watanabe's battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of [...] "Fighter One", a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company's advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. [...] When no reinforcements joined them, both companies {{went back to their}} original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Most of the rest of Watanabe's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night.|$|E
500|$|At 7:00 a.m., {{approximately}} [...] from Franklin, the Commodore Perry {{came under}} fire from the Confederate forces along the river and atop the bluffs. As the Perry {{was too close to}} bring her large-bore guns to bear, Commander Flusser ordered his sailors to shelter themselves as best they could while the ship tried to steam past the enemy. Unfortunately, due to the narrowness of the bend, the Commodore Perry ran aground; Lt. Ruffin and his men were so close to the grounded riverboat, they later claimed to have heard the Perrys officers cursing her enlisted sailors. [...] Freeing herself, the Perry rounded the bend and maneuvered to provide suppressive fire to allow the Hunchback and Whitehead to follow; the combined shelling of all three ships forced Lt. Ruffin and his detachment to withdraw from the banks of the river. [...] However, all three ships' progress was soon halted by a barricade in the river. While the barricade was removable with Commander Flusser's available manpower, he could not attempt to do so due to the [...] "terrible fire to which [...] were exposed." [...] While continuing to assault the Confederacy with their [...] "IX-inch grape and shell" [...] guns, [...] "32-pounder" [...] guns, field gun, and muskets, the three ships <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> barricade hoping to hear the gunfire of General Dix's infantry forces.|$|E
2500|$|Most of Dickens's major novels {{were first}} written in monthly or weekly {{instalments}} in journals such as Master Humphrey's Clock and Household Words, later reprinted in book form.

When The Old Curiosity Shop was being serialised, American fans <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> docks in New York, shouting out to the crew of an incoming ship, [...] "Is little Nell dead?" [...] Part of Dickens's great talent was to incorporate this episodic writing style but still {{end up with a}} coherent novel at the end.|$|E

Television replays confirmed those statements. The Guardian newspaper quoted another eyewitness as saying [...] "If not for the spectators and security staff curbing him, he would have broken the head of that guy.

2500|$|On May 15, 1944, Mahaffey was {{appointed}} Governor of the Panama Canal. He {{was promoted to}} Major General in June 1944. Although canal traffic plunged in 1942 to levels not seen since 1918, the invasion of France and collapse of Nazi Germany shifted {{hundreds of thousands of}} troops to the Pacific theater. During this period, Mehaffey oversaw operation of the canal while record amounts of traffic moved through it. At one point in 1945, more than 100 ships <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern entrance to the canal. During his tenure, Mehaffey also conducted the Isthmian Canal Studies in 1947. Better known as the [...] "Mahaffey Report", the studies wproposed getting rid of the canal locks and constructing a sea-level canal at a cost of $3.5 billion. No action was taken on the report, but Mahaffey received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his work as governor.|$|E
2500|$|In Roman bridal processions, a {{young boy}} carried Ceres' torch to light the way; [...] "the most auspicious wood for wedding torches came from the spina alba, the may tree, which bore many fruits and hence symbolised fertility". The adult males of the wedding party <b>waited</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> groom's house. A wedding {{sacrifice}} was offered to Tellus on the bride's behalf; a sow {{is the most likely}} victim. Varro describes the sacrifice of a pig as [...] "a worthy mark of weddings" [...] because [...] "our women, and especially nurses" [...] call the female genitalia porcus (pig). Spaeth (1996) believes Ceres may have been included in the sacrificial dedication, because she is closely identified with Tellus and, as Ceres legifera (law-bearer), she [...] "bears the laws" [...] of marriage. In the most solemn form of marriage, confarreatio, the bride and groom shared a cake made of far, the ancient wheat-type particularly associated with Ceres.|$|E
