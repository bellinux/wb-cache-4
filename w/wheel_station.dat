50|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the weight of}} the 17-pounder and ammunition an extra <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25 mph.|$|E
50|$|The Mbombe hull meets STANAG 4569 Level 4, {{which means}} the vehicle can {{withstand}} a 10 kg TNT blast under its hull or any <b>wheel</b> <b>station.</b> As standard, the Mbombe can protect its crew against Rocket-propelled grenades, while additional modules protect against IEDs, up to 50 kg TNT at 5 metres.|$|E

50|$|On November 16, 2006, WWVA, WOVK, WVKF, WKWK, WEGW and WBBD were {{announced}} for sale {{as part of}} Clear Channel's divestiture of almost 450 small and middle-market radio properties in the U.S. The Clear Channel <b>Wheeling</b> <b>stations</b> were initially slated {{to be sold to}} Florida-based GoodRadio.TV LLC in May 2007, but the deal soon collapsed prior to FCC approval.|$|R
50|$|H-drives {{do not use}} axles {{but rather}} {{individual}} wheel stations, usually carried on a punt chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis.

50|$|The Tank Museum, England. One of the 11 Porsche-suspension variants, it was {{captured}} by British troops in April 1945 near Sennelager, Germany where it was being used for trials. The third <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> {{on the left side}} is missing. Zimmerit was applied to approximately 2 meters high on the superstructure and the Balkenkreuz was painted in the mid section. An earlier 18 tooth sprocket ring is found on this vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Both {{scientists}} and science fiction writers {{have thought about}} {{the concept of a}} rotating wheel space station {{since the beginning of the}} 20th century. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky wrote about using rotation to create an artificial gravity in space in 1903. Herman Potočnik introduced a spinning <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> with a 30-meter diameter in his Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums (The Problem of Space Travel). He even suggested it be placed in a geostationary orbit.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is of the}} {{torsion bar}} type with either side consisting of five dual road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front, the idler at the rear and two track-return rollers. The first and last road <b>wheel</b> <b>stations</b> are provided with a hydraulic shock-absorber. The 4K 4FA has no NBC system, night vision equipment or amphibious capability.|$|R
5000|$|This unique {{modification}} of the VCR/TT is a 4x4 variant produced for Argentina. The VCR/TT [...] "Hydrojet" [...] 4x4 amphibious variant replaces the center <b>wheel</b> <b>stations</b> with powerful waterjets, doubling the water speed over the standard 6X6 VCR-TT which relies on its wheels for water propulsion. The waterjets are placed in the center wheel position to protect them against obstacles in the water.|$|R
50|$|Final drives {{are mounted}} {{in the front and}} the idler {{sprockets}} with track tensioners are mounted at the rear. The running gear has six road <b>wheel</b> <b>stations</b> per side, which guide a lightweight steel or segmented rubber band-type track. The road wheels are mounted on a suspension system comprising swing arms with conventional torsion bars and damper systems, this set-up is proven to be reliable and cost-efficient.|$|R
50|$|H-drives {{do not use}} axles {{but rather}} {{individual}} wheel stations, carried on a punt or backbone chassis. A single differential splits the drive into separate left and right drive shafts, which each run fore and aft inside the bottom corners of the chassis. At each <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> a bevel box drives the half shaft out to the wheel. Unlike a typical transfer box for permanent four-wheel drive, there is no differential action front-to-back.|$|E
50|$|The {{suspension}} system {{was based on}} longitudinal torsion bars for primary springing and featured fully independent suspension at all four wheels using double wishbones. Each <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> was also fitted with a rubber cone and cup system to buffer extreme upward suspension travel with energy control exercised by double-acting telescopic hydraulic dampers. This system gave an exceptional cross-country performance. Front and rear axles were constructed into a cradle sub-assembly, which could be rapidly exchanged in the field.|$|E
5000|$|The 1926 built {{railway station}} was {{destroyed}} in World War II. In the fifties a new station, designed by prof. Waclaw Tomaszewski, was built.

50|$|Saracen used {{an almost}} {{identical}} chassis and drivetrain to Saladin, although {{the engine was}} relocated from the rear {{to the front of}} the vehicle. The transmission used a 5-speed Wilson preselector gearbox with a fluid flywheel. Reverse gear was provided within the transfer box, allowing all five gears in either direction. The centre bevel boxes were included within the transfer box housing and had a slight overdrive to the drive shafts fore and aft. Each <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> used double wishbones and torsion bars for suspension with four (three on the centre stations) shock absorbers. Steering was applied to the centre wheels and a lever arrangement moved the front wheels by a proportionately larger amount.|$|E
50|$|The gun chosen was the QF 20 pounder (84 mm), {{already in}} use in the Centurion tank, with the autoloader. The mount was fixed in {{elevation}} and had only a limited traverse. Most aiming relied on steering the entire tank on its tracks. Elevation used an unusual system, a hydraulic suspension system, with independent height control of each <b>wheel</b> <b>station,</b> which allowed the tank chassis to be tilted back and forth. This system had already been demonstrated in the Swedish S-tank. The chassis components were based on those of the Comet tank, although with only four road wheels rather than the Comets five. The prototype was completed and tested on the firing ranges of Kirkcudbright Training Area.|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the parameter estimation of suspension components and the vertical motions of wheeled vehicles from experimental data. The estimation problems considered were for suspension dampers, a single <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> and a full vehicle. Using conventional methods (gradient-based (GB), Downhill Simplex (DS)) and stochastic methods (Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE)), three major problems were encountered. These were concerned with the ability and consistency of finding the global optimum solution, time consumption in the estimation process, and the difficulties in setting the algorithm's control parameters. To overcome these problems, a new technique named the discrete variable Hybrid Differential Evolution (dvHDE) method is presented. The new dvHDE method employs an integer-encoding technique and treats all parameters involved in the same unified way as discrete variables, and embeds two mechanisms {{that can be used to}} deal with convergence difficulties and reduce the time consumed in the optimisation process. The dvHDE algorithm has been validated against the conventional GB, DS and DE techniques and was shown to be more efficient and effective in all but the simplest cases. Its robustness was demonstrated by its application to a number of vehicle related problems of increasing complexity. These include case studies involving parameter estimation using experimental data from tests on automotive dampers, a single <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> and a full vehicle. The investigation has shown that the proposed dvHDE method, when compared to the other methods, was the best for finding the global optimum solutions in a short time. It is recommended for nonlinear vehicle suspension models and other similar systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

50|$|In 1971, the Soviet Armed Forces began {{investigating}} {{the possibility of}} an updated BTR-60PB redesigned to make the vehicle more compatible with the BMP-1 in terms of tactical training. This resulted {{in the development of a}} BTR-60PB prototype essentially converted into a wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, designated Obiekt 50 or GAZ-50. Despite retaining the original BTR-60PB chassis, the GAZ-50 incorporated several elements of the BMPs design, including similar seating arrangements in the passenger compartment. The revised internal layout reduced the number of passengers to nine. New hatches were also provided for debarking in the lower hull, between the second and third <b>wheel</b> <b>stations.</b> Other modifications included a slightly thicker hull, increased power-to-weight ratio, and additional firing ports. Another feature retained from the BTR-60 was the twin-engine arrangement, although in the GAZ-50 torque produced by the right engine powered the first and third <b>wheel</b> <b>stations,</b> while the left engine powered the second and fourth. This alteration was to allow the vehicle to continue moving even if one engine failed. The prototype was armed with a turret resembling that of the BMP-1, incorporating the same 73mm 2A28 Grom low-pressure smoothbore cannon.|$|R
50|$|The {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} consists of five single rubber-tyred road wheels with the drive sprocket {{at the front}} and the fifth roadwheel acting as the idler. There are three track-return rollers. The first and last road <b>wheel</b> <b>stations</b> have hydraulic shock-absorbers. The steel tracks can be fitted with rubber pads if required. Stowage containers are provided along {{each side of the}} upper part of the hull. Standard equipment includes a loudspeaker and a cable reel with 400 m of cable.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} {{a class of}} passive interconnected suspensions, defined mathematically {{in terms of their}} mechanical admittance matrices, with the purpose of providing greater freedom to specify independently bounce, pitch, roll, and warp dynamics than conventional (passive) suspension arrangements. Two alternative realization schemes are described that are capable of implementing this class (under ideal assumptions). The first scheme incorporates an interconnected multilever arrangement consisting of four separate hydraulic circuits, which transforms the separate <b>wheel</b> <b>station</b> displacements to bounce, pitch, roll, and warp motions. Four separate mechanical admittances are connected across the transformed terminals of the multilever. The second scheme is kinematically equivalent to the first but the multilever part consists of four modular subsystems to achieve the same kinematic transformation. The purpose of the class is to allow a high degree of independence between the modes of vehicle motion, e. g. low warp stiffness independent of front and rear anti-roll stiffness. Practical issues that might be involved in implementing the realization schemes are discussed, as well as generalizations to two- and six-wheeled vehicles.

40|$|Six Sigma is a {{philosophy}} based on setting attainable short-term goals while striving for long-term objectives. Six sigma {{is a highly}} disciplined approach used to reduce the process variations {{to the extent that}} the level of defects are drastically reduced to less than 3. 4 per million process, product or service opportunities (DPMO). Six Sigma, in many organizations, simply means a measure of quality that strives for near perfection. Six Sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects (driving towards six standard deviations between the mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process; from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service. The Six Sigma method allows us to draw comparisons to other similar or dissimilar products, services, and processes. In this manner, we can see how far ahead or behind we are. Six Sigma helps us to establish our course and gauge our pace in the race for total customer satisfaction. The work is carried out at Tulja Engineering Aurangabad, a Medium scale manufacturing unit. The project aims to reduce tool changing time at grinding <b>wheel</b> <b>station.</b> This problem was rectified to a great extent using Metrics, why? Why?
