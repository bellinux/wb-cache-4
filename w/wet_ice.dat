6000|$|I {{think there}} can be nothing else in life quite like the unnerving {{realisation}} that rumour and scandal are afoot about one. Abruptly one's confidence in the solidity of the universe disappears. One walks silenced through a world that one feels {{to be full of}} inaudible accusations. One cannot challenge the assault, get it out into the open, separate truth and falsehood. It slinks from you, turns aside its face. Old acquaintances suddenly evaded me, made extraordinary excuses; men who had presumed on the verge of my world and pestered me with an intrusive enterprise, now took the bold step of flat repudiation. I became doubtful about the return of a nod, retracted all those tentacles of easy civility that I had hitherto spread to the world. I still grow warm with amazed indignation when I recall that Edward Crampton, meeting me full {{on the steps of the}} Climax Club, cut me dead. [...] "By God!" [...] I cried, and came near catching him by the throat and wringing out of him what of all good deeds and bad, could hearten him, a younger man than I and empty beyond comparison, to dare to play the judge to me. And then I had an open slight from Mrs. Millingham, whom I had counted on as one counts upon the sunrise. I had not expected things of that sort; they were disconcerting beyond measure; it was as if the world were giving way beneath my feet, as though something failed in the essential confidence of life, as though a hand of <b>wet</b> <b>ice</b> had touched my heart. Similar things were happening to Isabel. Yet we went on working, visiting, meeting, trying to ignore this gathering of implacable forces against us.|$|E
6000|$|Under the red cliff of Forked Donkia {{the valley}} becomes very broad, bare, and gravelly, with a {{confusion}} of moraines, and turns more northwards. At the angle, the present terminal moraine rises like a mountain (I assumed {{it to be}} about 800 feet high),* [This is the largest and longest terminal moraine backed by an existing glacier that I examined with care: I doubt its being so high as the moraine of the Allalein glacier below the Mat-maark sea in the Sachs valley (Valais, Switzerland); but {{it is impossible to}} compare such objects from memory: the Donkia one was much the most uniform in height.] and crosses the valley from N.N.E. to S.S.W. From the summit, which rises above the level of the glacier, and from which I assume its present retirement, a most striking scene opened. The ice filling an immense basin, several miles broad and long, formed a low dome,* [This convexity of the ice is particularly alluded to by Forbes ("Travels in the Alps," [...] p.386), as the [...] "renflement" [...] of Rendu and [...] "surface bombee" [...] of Agassiz, and is attributed to the effects of hydrostatic pressure tending to press the lower layers of ice upwards to the surface. My own impression at the time was, that the convexity of the surface of the Donkia glacier was due to a subjacent mountain spur running south from Donkia itself. I know, however, far too little of the topography of this glacier to advance such a conjecture with any confidence. In this case, as in all similar ones, broad expanses being covered to an enormous depth with ice, the surface of the latter must in some degree be modified by the ridges and valleys it conceals. The typical [...] "surface bombee," [...] which is conspicuous in the Himalaya glaciers, I was wont (in my ignorance of the mechanical laws of glaciers) to attribute to the more rapid melting of the edges of the glacier by the radiated heat of its lateral moraines and of the flanks of the valley that it occupies.] with Forked Donkia on the west, and a serried range of rusty-red scarped mountains, 20,000 feet high on the north and east, separating large tributary glaciers. Other still loftier tops of Donkia appeared behind these, upwards of 22,000 feet high, but I could not recognise the true summit (23,176 feet). The surface was very rugged, and so deeply honey-combed that the foot often sank from six to eight inches in crisp <b>wet</b> <b>ice.</b> I proceeded a mile on it, with much more difficulty than on any Swiss glacier: this was owing to the elevation, and the corrosion of the surface into pits and pools of water; the crevasses being but few and distant. I saw no dirt-bands on looking down upon it from a point I attained under the red cliff of Forked Donkia, at an elevation of 18,307 feet by barometer, and 18,597 by boiling-point. The weather was very cold, the thermometer fell from 41 degrees to 34 degrees, and it snowed heavily after 3 p.m.|$|E

Here we quantitatively demonstrate that QLLs, when completely <b>wetting</b> <b>ices,</b> have a thickness of 9 +/- 3 nm and an approximately 200 times lower characteristic velocity than bulk water, whereas QLLs, when partially <b>wetting</b> <b>ices,</b> have a velocity that is 20 times lower than the bulk.

In most cases, good efficiency is achieved at room temperature but when possible degradation is taken into account it is probably best to incubate DNA on <b>wet</b> <b>ice.</b> Optimal incubation time depends on the length and concentration of DNA.

40|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} {{to better understand the}} phenomena involved during operation of an aircraft's thermal ice protection system under running <b>wet</b> <b>icing</b> conditions. In such situations, supercooled water striking a thermally ice-protected surface does not fully evaporate but runs aft to a location where it freezes. The effects of altitude, in terms of air pressure and density, on the processes involved were of particular interest. Initial study results showed that the altitude effects on heat energy transfer were accurately modeled using existing methods, but water mass transport was not. Based upon those results, a new method to account for altitude effects on thermal ice protection system operation was proposed. The method employs a two-step process where heat energy and mass transport are sequentially matched, linked by matched surface temperatures. While not providing exact matching of heat and mass transport to reference conditions, the method produces a better simulation than other methods. Moreover, it does not rely on the application of empirical correction factors, but instead relies on the straightforward application of the primary physics involved.

40|$|Abstract Background To {{determine}} {{the time and}} temperature stability of whole blood lactate using experimental conditions applicable to the out-of-hospital environment. Findings We performed a prospective, clinical laboratory-based study at an academic hospital. Whole blood lactate was obtained by venipuncture from five post-prandial, resting subjects. Blood was stored in lithium heparinized vacutainers in three temperature conditions: 1) room temperature (20 Â°C), 2) wrapped in a portable, instant ice pack (0 Â°C), or 3) <b>wet</b> <b>ice</b> (0 Â°C). Lactate concentrations (mmol/L) were measured at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after sampling, and compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Mean baseline lactate among resting subjects (N = 5) was 1. 24 mmol/L (95 %CI: 0. 49, 1. 98 mmol/L). After 30 minutes, lactate concentration increased, on average, by 0. 08 mmol/L (95 %CI: 0. 02, 0. 13 mmol/L), 0. 18 mmol/L (95 %CI: 0. 07, 0. 28 mmol/L), and 0. 36 mmol/L (95 %CI: 0. 24, 0. 47 mmol/L) when stored in <b>wet</b> <b>ice,</b> ice pack, and room temperature, respectively. The increase in lactate was similar in samples wrapped in portable ice pack or stored in <b>wet</b> <b>ice</b> at all time points (p > 0. 05), and met criteria for equivalence at 30 minutes. However, lactate measurements from whole blood stored at room temperature were significantly greater, on average, than <b>wet</b> <b>ice</b> or portable ice pack within five and ten minutes, respectively (p < 0. 05). Conclusions Whole blood lactate measurements using samples stored in a portable ice pack are similar to <b>wet</b> <b>ice</b> for up to 30 minutes.

50|$|Twin lead {{can have}} {{significantly}} lower signal loss than miniature flexible coaxial cable at shortwave and VHF radio frequencies; for example, type RG-58 coaxial cable loses 6.6 dB per 100 m at 30 MHz, while 300 ohm twin-lead loses only 0.55 dB. However, twin-lead is {{more vulnerable to}} interference. Proximity to metal objects will inject signals into twin-lead that would be blocked out by coaxial cable. Twin lead therefore requires careful installation around rain gutters, and standoffs from metal support masts. Twin-lead is also susceptible to significant degradation when <b>wet</b> or <b>ice</b> covered, whereas coax is less or not affected in these conditions. For these reasons, coax has largely replaced twin-lead in most uses, except where maximum signal is required.|$|R
40|$|Ice {{accretion}} for in-flight {{icing conditions}} often yields complicated shapes which can significantly affect {{the performance of}} an aircraft. This has been a primary motivation for numerous studies to understand the physics of ice formation on aircraft and develop prediction methodologies. During icing experiments, many of the complex shapes found in later stages of ice accretion have been observed to their origins in ice roughnesses which form early in the ice accretion process. The present work focuses on the formation of roughnesses due to the inherent interfacial instabilities of a <b>wetted</b> <b>ice</b> surface. Solutions are found using a multiple scales model for the stagnation region near {{the leading edge of}} a wing. In the computations for both unswept and swept wing icing, the roughness sizes are found to be about {{the same size as the}} air boundary layer thickness. These roughnesses qualitatively agree with the typical geometries and properties of the roughnesses seen in unswept and swept wing icing experiments. Using the multiple scales model for the stagnation region as a guide, a preliminary simplified engineering linear stability analysis is developed for glaze icing. The roughness diameters predicted using this model generally agree with the typical characteristics of the ice roughnesses seen in experiments providing that the airfoil surface temperature is sufficiently close to freezing. Smooth zones devoid of roughnesses, which have a sharp demarcation between the smooth and rough regions, can be present near the stagnation line. However, the solutions of the linear stability model are found to be overly sensitive to the temperature of the airfoil, which suggests the need for further modeling to incorporate the transient changes in the airfoil skin temperature and ice thickness during the ice accretion process...|$|R
