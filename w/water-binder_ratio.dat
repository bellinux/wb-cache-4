40|$|Abstract. The {{penetration}} {{resistance to}} chloride ions of concrete {{is one of}} the important factors affecting the durability of concrete structures. The penetration resistance to chloride ions of concrete is measured with the increasing substitution amount of silica fume in this paper. For the low <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 28, 0. 30 and 0. 32, compared with the reference concrete, with the increase of age, the penetration resistance to chloride ions of concrete can be enhanced with the increasing substitution amount of silica fume, but the increased range is smaller. The penetration resistance of chloride ions of concrete is not necessarily improved by gradually decreasing the <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio.</b> Considering the substitution amount of silica fume, <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> and concrete age, the best mix proportions are that the substitution amount of silica fume is 9 % or 12 % when the <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0. 28 and the substitution amount of silica fume is 12 % when the <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> is 0. 30...|$|E

The {{hydration}} {{degree of}} binders and cement is investigated {{by measuring the}} adiabatic-temperature rise of concrete at low <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> with different fly-ash content. The results denote that, with a constant <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio,</b> both of the hydration degree of binders and that of cement decrease with the increasing fly-ash content in the early stage. In a later stage, however, the hydration degree of cement increases with the increasing fly-ash content and the hydration degree of binders peaks when the fly-ash content is 35 %. Fly ash {{is one of the}} mineral admixture of which high-performance concrete is made up.

40|$|Dredged marine soils (DMS) are the {{sediment}} and debris removed in the dredging process. Large amount of DMS is {{generated from the}} dredging operations yearly, especially from the maintenance of existing shipping channels {{and the development of}} various coastal infrastructures. In practice, DMS are generally disposed of at designated offshore dump sites. Inadvertently, these discarded DMS would in time be deposited back near shore due to tidal dynamics, necessitating dredging works again. Considering that DMS are essentially soils with poor engineering properties, particularly low shear strength, there could be potential for the materials’ reuse as acceptable or good geomaterials if the original conditions can be improved. Pre-treatment for enhancement of the soil’s strength, such as solidification, is a feasible option. In the present study, the solidification of 3 DMS samples was examined with the admixing of cement and/or bottom ash, where cement acts as a binder while the bottom ash functions a filler material to lend structure to the weak soil. The strength improvement of the solidified DMS was monitored with the unconfined compression tests. The key factors that influence strength development in solidified soils were investigated, i. e. curing period, <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> and binder-filler mix ratio. The curing period was prefixed at 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days, while the <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> examined were 1, 3 and 5. The test results indicated that strength increased with curing time and higher <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio.</b> The optimal binder-filler mix ratio determined was 75 % cement to 25 % bottom ash. The bottom ash was found to contribute to strength gain too, albeit in a minor way compared to the highly reactive cement. For the generalized strength development plots, the unconfined compressive strength of a particular day (q) was divided with the strength on day 28 (q 28). The resulting q/q 28 vs. curing period plots were linear with varying gradients dependent on the <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio,</b> though it was apparent that the gradient of the plot decreased with increased <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio.</b> In summary, solidification with cement-bottom ash is expedient in improving the original low strength of the DMS, and the generalized strength development model is useful for modeling, design and prediction on sit...|$|E

The DuraCrete model in most cases underestimates chloride ingress, especially for the concrete with pozzolanic additives, due to its oversimplified mathematic expression in dealing with the age factor for chloride diffusion coefficient. The results suggest that care must be taken when using empiric models for service life prediction, because the actual chloride ingress in concrete with silica fume and fly ash after 10 years field exposure has in some cases already exceeded the 100 years prediction made by the DuraCrete model...|$|R

40|$|Moisture is decisive for a {{large number}} of binding and {{transport}} processes in high performance concrete affecting the durability, shrinkage and performance in various envi-ronments. An experimental study on the moisture transport properties of 20 concrete mixes was made during seven years, with type of binder, additives and <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> as parameters. An upside-down glass cup method was used to obtain the steady-state flow through concrete discs. The moisture diffusion coefficient decreases with a lower <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio,</b> increasing amount of silica fume, espe-cially when combined with fly ash and it continues to decrease also after four years for w/B lower than 0. 40. The moisture diffusion coefficient is much less moisture dependent for HPC than for normal concrete, which means that steady-state moisture profiles through HPC structures will be almost linear. Long-term moisture profiles in sub-merged HPC will be affected by self-desiccation {{for a very long time}} because of the extremely small moisture flow...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{durability}} of fly ash concrete, a series of experimental studies are carried out, where durability improving admixture is used to reduce drying shrinkage and improve freezing-thawing resistance. The effects of durability improving admixture, air content, <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio,</b> and fly ash replacement ratio {{on the performance of}} fly ash concrete are discussed in this paper. The results show that by using durability improving admixture in nonair-entraining fly ash concrete, the compressive strength of fly ash concrete can be improved by 10 %– 20 %, and the drying shrinkage is reduced by 60 %. Carbonation resistance of concrete is roughly proportional to water-cement ratio regardless of <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratio</b> and fly ash replacement ratio. For the specimens cured in air for 2 weeks, the freezing-thawing resistance is improved. In addition, by making use of durability improving admixture, it is easier to control the air content and make fly ash concrete into nonair-entraining one. The quality of fly ash concrete is thereby optimized...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the results from the}} measurement of reinforcement corrosion in slabs after over 13 years’ exposure in the marine environment, using a newly developed rapid nondestructive technique. In the beginning of 1990 ’s over 40 reinforced concrete slabs with different types of binder and <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratios</b> were exposed in a real marine environment at Swedish west coast. In the past years a rapid technique for non-destructive measurement of corrosion was developed at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden. The technique is based on the classic galvanostatic pulse technique with the time-dependent behaviour of polarisation taken into account and the mathematical modelling for estimation of current distribution. The technique was implemented into a handheld instrument for easy use in the field. This instrument was used to measure the corrosion conditions of the steel bars embedded in the concrete slabs exposed in the field site. Based on the results from the nondestructive measurement, the actual corrosion of steel bars in five concrete slabs was visually examined. The results from the visual examination show that the newly developed rapid technique is a useful tool with reasonably good accuracy for assessment of corrosion of steel in concrete. It has been found that the corrosion rate measurement is the most reliable parameter, while the half-cell potential and resistivity can only be used as complementary parameters in the assessment of corrosion status...|$|R
30|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that cracks provide {{easy access to}} ingress of chlorides in concrete and hence, the initiation of corrosion of steel in cracked concrete occurs at early stage. However, wide variety of results {{on the effect of}} crack widths on corrosion of steel in concrete are reported in many studies. Apart from crack width, the crack depths, cracking frequency and healing of cracks also influence the corrosion of steel in concrete. This paper presents a comprehensive review and summarised the results on the effect of cracking on corrosion of steel in concrete. The effect of crack widths on the diffusion of chlorides ions and carbon-dioxide is also discussed in this paper. Among all available results, a correlation between the corrosion current and the crack widths up to 0.3  mm can be established, however, no distinct trends are observed beyond that crack width. Conflicting results on the effect of crack widths on chloride ion diffusion are also reported. The longitudinal crack causes more severe corrosion of steel in concrete than transverse cracks of same width. Cracked concrete containing supplementary cementitious materials exhibited superior corrosion resistance than cracked ordinary Portland cement concrete of same width of transverse as well as longitudinal cracks. The same is also true in the case of lower <b>water–binder</b> <b>ratios</b> of cracked concrete. The increase in crack depth increased the chloride diffusion; however, the corrosion test shows an opposite trend. Conflicting results on the effect of crack frequency on corrosion of steel are also reported.|$|R
40|$|Most {{reinforced}} concrete structures suffer durability problems during their service. The major durability {{problem is the}} corrosion of reinforcing steel which results in cracking and spalling of concrete. Nowadays, mineral admixtures, such as silica fume and metakaolin are used to enhance the corrosion resistance of {{reinforced concrete}} structures. In this research work, accelerated corrosion tests were carried out on reinforced concrete specimens made with plain, silica fume and metakaolin blended cements. The mineral admixtures were incorporated in the mixtures as a partial replacement by weight. The replacement percentages were 10 %, 15 %, and 25 % of cement content by weight. Three types of cement {{were used in the}} program which were type I, type II, and type V Portland cement as classified by ASTM C 150. Cement content of 350 and 450  kg/m 3 were used in concrete mixes with 0. 40 and 0. 50 <b>water-binder</b> <b>ratios</b> (w/cm). The curing mediums of specimens were potable water and seawater medium. Also, the effect of applied voltage on the accelerated test was studied. The current intensity, visible cracking time, and critical time up to 2  mm crack width were recorded during testing. The weight loss of the steel was also determined after testing. The observed superior resistance performance of silica fume and metakaolin blended cement concrete as compared to plain cement concrete in terms of cracking time, critical time, weight loss, and corrosion intendancy factor was monitored. Also, concrete mixes made with type I Portland cement have a good corrosion resistance compared with that of type II and type V Portland cement concrete mixes both cured in potable water and sea water medium...|$|R
