Album producer Max Norman stated in 2007 that due to a limited budget, he had Osbourne perform an entire show in the afternoon (of which day he wasnt clear) with no audience. That performance was recorded in the event that the actual live performance that night was not of suitable quality for release. [...] "At least <b>weve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> choice and well have more material to draw from", he said.

I know youre getting tired of hearing me say that. But I appreciate the ovation. I appreciate the American fans voting me on the All-Century Team. Im just a small part of a big deal tonight.Gray: With the overwhelming evidence in that report, why not make that step...Rose: No. This is too much of a festive night to worry about that because I dont know what evidence youre talking about. I mean, show it to me...Gray: Well, the Dowd Report says- but we dont want to debate that, Pete.Rose: Well, why not? Why do we want to believe everything he says?Gray: You signed a paper acknowledging the ban. Why did you sign it if you didnt agree with it?Rose: It also says I can apply for reinstatement after one year, if you remember correctly. In the press conference, as a matter of fact, my statement was [...] "I cant wait for my little girl to be a year old so I can apply for reinstatement". At my press conference. So you forgot to add that clause that was in there.Gray: Well, you have reapplied. ... Youve applied for reinstatement in 1997. Have you heard back from Commissioner Selig?Rose: No, and that kind of surprises me. Its only been two years, though, and hes got a lot of things on his mind. But I hope to some day.Gray: Pete, its been 10 years since youve been allowed on the field. Obviously, the approach that you have taken has not worked. Why not, at this point, take a different approach?Rose: Well, when you say it hadnt worked, what do you exactly mean?Gray: Youre not allowed in baseball. Youre not allowed to earn a living in the game you love. And youre not allowed to be in the Hall of Fame.Rose: Well, I took that approach and that was to apply for reinstatement. I hope Bud Selig considers that and gives me an opportunity. I wont need a third chance. All I need is a second chance.Gray: Pete, those who will hear this tonight will say you have been your own worst enemy and continue to be. How do you respond to that?Rose: In what way are you talking about?Gray: By not acknowledging what seems to be overwhelming evidence.Rose: Yeah, Im surprised youre bombarding me like this. I mean Im doing an interview with you on a great night, a great occasion, a great ovation. Everybody seems to be in a good mood. And youre bringing up something that happened 10 years ago.Gray: Im bringing it up because I think people would like to see ... Pete, weve got to go, <b>weve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> game.Rose: This is a prosecutors brief, not an interview, and Im very surprised at you. I am, really.Gray: Some would be surprised that you didnt take the opportunity.|$|E

40|$|In 1967, Warner Bros. {{released}} the film Cool Hand Luke {{and out of}} this film came {{one of the most}} famous quotes in the history of motion pictures: ?What <b>we?ve</b> <b>got</b> here is <b>a</b> failure to communicate. ? That same year marked the beginning of a slow decline in mainline Christian denominations in America, such as the United Methodist Church, despite the overall growth of Christianity. The purpose of this thesis is to present, explore, and evaluate one possible reason for this decline. Throughout American history, there is an interesting phenomenon in which the acceptance of Christian drama in America largely depended upon primary mass communication media being visual or image-centric. Therefore, this thesis hypothesizes that the decline of mainline Christian denominations can be attributed to a breakdown in communication between the church and American society as a whole; evidence of this communication breakdown can be found by simultaneously analyzing the history of advances in communication media, societal shifts along the left-brain/right-brain spectrum, and Christian drama. Due to the vastness of all that is ?Christian drama,? the scope of this thesis is primarily limited to surveying the development of Christian drama in America. However, this thesis also examines the rise, evolution, and decline of the Corpus Christi York Cycle in medieval England so as to lay the groundwork for understanding the development of Christian drama in America. The decline of this immensely popular form of medieval Christian drama is one of the clearest examples of the Protestant Reformation?s effects in generating suspicions of and antagonism towards Catholicism. This suspicion would later influence the beliefs of sixteenth century Puritans and affect the creation of ?American? values. The relationship between the church and theater would remain deeply antagonistic until well into the late nineteenth century. This animosity would eventually subside before the arrival of the twentieth century, particularly following the invention of film, which provided a new medium for Christian drama. The invention and diffusion of television is arguably the single greatest causative factor in the decline of mainline Christian denominations...|$|R
