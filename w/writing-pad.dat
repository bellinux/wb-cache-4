60|$|Mary Brander {{was seated}} with a <b>writing-pad</b> {{on her knee}} at the window unoccupied by the vase and its support. She put the <b>writing-pad</b> and a book, evidently a large diary, down on the floor.|$|E

40|$|Photograph of four clergymen {{dressed in}} white robes seated in front of eleven {{graduates}} dressed in caps and gowns holding diplomas. "Dom Clougherty, Chancellor of the Catholic University of Peking writes, Feb. 1932 : I am sending under separate cover a photo of our first graduates as you requested. Of the eleven graduates ten were Catholics and of this number two are priests, Father Li and Chu. The gowns are a slight modification of the scholars' dress of the Chou dynasty (1122 - 256 B. C.), while the caps are after the fashion of the head-wear of the mandarins of the same period. The mortar-boards were used as portable <b>writing-pads</b> held between the knees. " Separate caption reads "The student on the extreme right is Paul Yeh Teh Lu, one of Monsignor Ford's boys (captain of the University football team). Seated (left to right) Dr. Liu Fu, Director of Studies; Honorable Ch'en Yuan, President; Dom Francis Clougherty, Chancellor; V. Rev. Dr. G. Barry O'Toole, Rector. ...|$|R
60|$|Shortly {{after the}} opening of the Friday-morning sitting the Composer {{requested}} that the whole slate be ruled with staves for writing music. Throughout the preceding Wednesday and Thursday attempts at the writing of music had been of constant occurrence; they had come on slates, on <b>writing-pads,</b> and on the leaves of closed books. These bits of musical notation had been very fragmentary and obscure; often they had consisted of less than half a dozen notes placed upon staves consisting of but three or four lines, instead of five. The most successful of these earlier efforts had been produced on a double school-slate, with a wooden, list-bound frame: two measures on a treble staff had been sprinkled with vague indications of musical script. No attempts had yet been made to bring even the best of these various writings to order and intelligibility. We were soon to learn that a scrap of music set down within three or four minutes was to require as many hours for revision, emendation, elucidation--for editing, in brief. It is but fair, however, to state that some of this time was taken up by the registering of irrelevant messages from other quarters and by digressions toward the Composer's own private concerns.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen {{anything}} like this," [...] Isobel said softly. I looked up from the <b>writing-pad</b> on my knee, and she met my glance with a smile of contrition.|$|E
60|$|A thought seemed {{suddenly}} to strike him. Burrowing into his bunk and disrupting {{it in his}} eagerness, he secured a <b>writing-pad</b> and pencil, and sitting down at the table, began to write with swiftness and certitude.|$|E
60|$|No sooner {{were they}} settled than a fumbling sound {{began in the}} middle of the table, and the pencil was twice lifted and dropped. Following this the leaves of the <b>writing-pad</b> rustled as though being thumbed by boyish hands.|$|E
60|$|Hilary {{rose and}} brought him paper and a pencil. In bending, he saw that Mr. Stone's eyes were dim with moisture. This sight {{affected}} him {{so that he was}} glad to turn away and fetch a book to form a <b>writing-pad.</b>|$|E
60|$|Payne {{put away}} his pistol and they entered Dick's room. Nothing {{seemed to have}} been touched, until Jake placed the lamp on a writing-table where Dick {{sometimes}} worked at night. The drawers beneath it were locked, but Payne indicated a greasy finger-print on the <b>writing-pad.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He found Bartol {{seated at}} a big table with a <b>writing-pad</b> before him and four or five open volumes {{disposed}} about as if for reference. He, too, looked old and worn and rather grim, but he greeted his guest politely. [...] "Good-morning. Have you seen your mother this morning?" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{uncle was}} in such a savage humor I knew it would be useless for me to attempt to reason with him. So getting a sponge and some water, I began to clean up the muss on the desk. I had hardly cleaned the <b>writing-pad</b> when my uncle stopped me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I tell you," [...] said Lapham, jabbing {{the point}} of his {{penknife}} into the <b>writing-pad</b> on the desk before him, [...] "when I hear women complaining nowadays that their lives are stunted and empty, I want to tell 'em about my MOTHER'S life. I could paint it out for 'em." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} been a {{fortnight}} later that I divined the secret of the <b>writing-pad.</b> My wretch (it leaked out) wrote letters for a paper in the West, and had filled a part of one of them with descriptions of myself. I pointed out to him that he had no right to do so without asking my permission.|$|E
6000|$|When he had bound {{the bundle}} in stout wrapping-paper he {{contemplated}} it with satisfaction. Then {{he went over}} to his desk and took from a small inner compartment his savings for some months, which amounted to several dollars. This sum he had been keeping for the Fourth of July, but he thrust it into his pocket with hardly a regret. Then he pulled a <b>writing-pad</b> over to him, sat down and wrote: ...|$|E
60|$|A lamp with {{a broken}} mantle flickered above Graham's head and the stove crackled, but the outer office, the door of which was open, was dark, and the {{building}} was strangely quiet. No sound rose from the narrow street below, which ran like a still backwater among the tall warehouses. Foster, putting his hand in his pocket as if to feel for matches, touched the small Browning pistol he had brought. He was not afraid of Graham, but somebody might come in. At length the man sealed two envelopes and put them beside his <b>writing-pad.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, besides (although I never {{suspected}} it), he was already seeking consolation with another of the muses, and pleasing himself {{with the notion that}} he would repay me for my sincerity, cement our friendship, and (at one and the same blow) restore my estimation of his talents. Several times already, when I had been speaking of myself, he had pulled out a <b>writing-pad</b> and scribbled a brief note; and now, when we entered the studio, I saw it in his hand again, and the pencil go to his mouth, as he cast a comprehensive glance round the uncomfortable building.|$|E
60|$|What a {{happiness}} {{it would}} be, I thought, {{in spite of}} discomfort and pain and danger, if this vision would continue! It {{was not to be}} expected; nevertheless it did not vanish, and on the second day I set myself to try and save it from the oblivion which would presently cover it again. Propped up with pillows I began with pencil and <b>writing-pad</b> to put it down in some sort of order, and went on with it at intervals during the whole six weeks of my confinement, and in this way produced the first rough draft of the book.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh!" [...] I {{could hear}} the quick intake of his breath. Whilst I was {{stroking}} the now quiescent cat, the Doctor went {{to the table and}} tore off a piece of blotting-paper from the <b>writing-pad</b> and came back. He laid the paper on his palm and, with a simple [...] "pardon me!" [...] to Miss Trelawny, placed the cat's paw on it and pressed it down with his other hand. The haughty cat seemed to resent somewhat the familiarity, and tried to draw its foot away. This was plainly what the Doctor wanted, for in the act the cat opened the sheaths of its claws and and made several reefs in the soft paper. Then Miss Trelawny took her pet away. She returned in a couple of minutes; as she came in she said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Her yawn {{must have}} been the image of a yawn. Instead of letting her mouth droop, {{dropping}} all her clothes in a bunch as though they depended on one string, and stretching her limbs to the utmost end of her berth, she merely changed her dress for a dressing-gown, with innumerable frills, and wrapping her feet in a rug, sat down with a <b>writing-pad</b> on her knee. Already this cramped little cabin was the dressing room of a lady of quality. There were bottles containing liquids; there were trays, boxes, brushes, pins. Evidently not an inch of her person lacked its proper instrument. The scent which had intoxicated Rachel pervaded the air. Thus established, Mrs. Dalloway began to write. A pen in her hands became a thing one caressed paper with, and she might have been stroking and tickling a kitten as she wrote: ...|$|E
60|$|Eleanor, Dowager Lady Greymarten, had {{for more}} than half a century been the ruling spirit at Torywood. The affairs of the county had not sufficed for her untiring {{activities}} of mind and body; in the wider field of national and Imperial service she had worked and schemed and fought with an energy and a far-sightedness that came probably from the blend of caution and bold restlessness in her Scottish blood. For many educated minds the arena of politics and public life is a weariness of dust and disgust, to others it is a fascinating study, to be watched from the comfortable seat of a spectator. To her it was a home. In her town house or down at Torywood, with her <b>writing-pad</b> on her knee and the telephone at her elbow, or in personal counsel with some trusted colleague or persuasive argument with a halting adherent or half-convinced opponent, she had laboured on behalf of the poor and the ill-equipped, had fought for her idea of the Right, and above all, for the safety and sanity of her Fatherland. Spadework when necessary and leadership when called for, came alike within the scope of her activities, and not least of her achievements, though perhaps she hardly realised it, was the force of her example, a lone, indomitable fighter calling to the half-caring and the half-discouraged, to the laggard and the slow-moving.|$|E
60|$|Ever {{since his}} visit to Rome in 1875 he had let his heavy {{mustache}} grow long till it dropped below {{the corners of his}} beard, which was now almost white; his face had lost the ruddy hue so characteristic of him. I fancy he was then ailing with premonitions of the disorder which a few years later proved mortal, but he still bore himself with sufficient vigor, and he walked the distance between his house and mine, though once when I missed his visit the family reported that after he came in he sat a long time with scarcely a word, as if too weary to talk. That winter, I went into Boston to live, and I saw him only at infrequent intervals, when I could go out to Elmwood. At such times I found him sitting in the room which was formerly the drawing-room, but which had been joined with his study by taking away the partitions beside the heavy mass of the old colonial chimney. He told me that when he was a newborn babe, the nurse had carried him round this chimney, for luck, and now in front of the same hearth, the white old man stretched himself in an easy-chair, with his <b>writing-pad</b> on his knees and his books on the table at his elbow, and was willing to be entreated not to rise. I remember the sun used to come in at the eastern windows full pour, and bathe the air in its warmth.|$|E
6000|$|He left St. Petersburg to {{represent}} the Morning Post in Paris, and returned to London in 1908, where the agreeable life of a man of letters with a brilliant reputation awaited him. He had a lodging in Mortimer Street and lived exceedingly simply. It was his custom to pass the morning in a dressing-gown writing. His <b>writing-pad</b> was usually propped up with a book to make it slant and he wrote slowly in a very clear hand, rarely erasing a word or making a correction. His air {{and the movement of}} his hand gave one the impression that he was drawing and not writing. He almost always lunched at a Lyons bread-shop, partly because it was economical and partly because, as he said, he got exactly the sort of luncheon he liked. He cared nothing for money. He had to earn his living, but he was content as long as he had enough money to supply his needs. When a friend once suggested a profitable field for his writings, he dismissed the idea by saying that he was not interested in the public for which it was proposed that he should write. He loved his art, and, by refusing to adopt a style that might have appealed to wider circles, he made himself a place in our literature which, in the opinion of many, will be lasting. Almost every day he played cards, either in the late afternoon or in the evening, at the Cocoa Tree Club. The sight of the wealth of others did not excite his envy. I remember his coming home from a ball and relating that he had sat at supper next a millionairess, whose doctor had prescribed a diet of milk-puddings. “I had a hearty supper,” he said gleefully, “and for all her millions she was unable to eat anything.” ...|$|E
50|$|The Department of Design's {{approach}} to design practice grew from {{a concern for}} ethical and environmentalist design. This developed alongside research by John Wood, and others, which informs their research into metadesign. TERU, the Technology Education Research Unit, {{has been instrumental in}} understanding how design & technology works in schools, how to encourage learners towards creative interventions that improve the made world, and how to help teachers to support that process. The Writing Purposefully in Art and Design Network (<b>Writing-PAD)</b> has its main Centre at Goldsmiths. The Network now spans some 70 institutions across the art and design sector with 6 national and 2 International Writing PAD Centres.|$|E
40|$|In {{disciplines}} {{with long}} histories in higher education, academic literacies, including writing practices, are less contested than in newer academic {{fields such as}} art and design. The relatively recent incorporation of such fields and schools into the university sector has required these fields to create academic writing practices consistent with existing academic models or to justify their distinctive disciplinary practices. Recently, for example, {{much has been written}} about the distinctiveness of practice-based, reflective and creative written genres, such as the exegesis and the studio or practice based thesis, as the distinctive voice of art and design. However, such models have yet to gain broad acceptance in the higher education sector, where scientific (e. g. empirical research report) and humanities (e. g. essayist tradition) practices are far more familiar and of overarching significance. Similarly to the sciences and humanities, the field of art and design in fact names a broad grouping of communities of practice, e. g. graphic design, fine arts, fashion design, with a range of expectations regarding practice and writing. Whatever disciplinary consensus is reached regarding legitimate writing practices in art and design, it is important not to obscure these differences and make the same mistake that has hampered clarity in writing instruction for mainstream academic fields, a problem that is at the core of the academic literacies program for change and enlightenment. The Writing Purposefully in Art and Design Network (<b>Writing-PAD)</b> aims to support and disseminate the range of genres associated with writing in art and design. In the second part of this article, an account of the purposes, practices and scope of the <b>Writing-PAD</b> network demonstrates the characteristics of and consensus on forms of academic writing in art and design. Together with our introductory review we hope to promote discussion about the necessary balance of consensus and dissensus that art and design fields require to remain vibrant...|$|E
40|$|This article {{outlines}} my 128 -word essay project which, {{in common}} with current initiatives such as <b>Writing-PAD,</b> aimed to connect visual arts students ’ writing with their practice. The students were on a Foundation Art and Design course at Coventry University in the United Kingdom, which is a one-year, pre-degree diagnostic ‘preparatory experience ’ (Coventry University, 2010). A control group from the same cohort was given a conventional 1000 -word essay (asking the same questions as the 128 -word version). Both groups of {{students were asked to}} do a creative presentation of their own work after the essay. Although the 128 -word essay writers did discernibly (but only marginally) better presentations than their 1000 -word counterparts, their presentations were not as relatively innovative as were most of their 128 -word essays. It might thus be unwise to credit the 128 -word essay as an agent of innovation. It might also be unwise to make assumptions about visual arts students ’ attitudes to writing. For example, 62. 5 % (20 out of 32) of a group of Coventry University 2011 - 12 Graphic Design final-year undergraduates thought that they should be ‘encouraged to write’, although 20 % of that 62. 5 % (4 out of 20) admitted that they found writing ‘deadly boring’, suggesting that this subgroup saw some usefulness in writing – as perhaps career-based, perhaps intellectually stimulating...|$|E
40|$|This <b>Writing-PAD</b> {{discussion}} forum and workshop event {{is designed to}} stimulate collaborative conversations and exchanges, {{in and around the}} archive, with a view to developing a clear set of concepts and approaches, abstracts and ideas, contributing towards a guest edited issue in the Journal of Writing in Creative Practice. A call for issue will be formulated as part of this event, based on the ideas generated out of the forum. As a way to stimulate re-writings of the archive, the forum will provide an opportunity for you to bring your own archival experiences to the table for discussion. We invite you to join us if you are keen to explore different approaches and styles of writing that resonate with the ‘archival’ as a concept and as a practice. This collaborative event will shape and form the directives of the guest-edited issue. Resources on the topic of the archive and workshop activities will be provided. Themes for exploration: Writing with and through the archive, expanding the field of the archive as a creative concept, experimental uses of the archive in art and design making, material engagements with the past and formations for the future, geographic site as archival resource, fictions of the archive and storytelling, digital platforms, coding and de-coding materiality, creative systems of classification, co-creation in the archive, design innovations through the use of company archives, exploring relationships between copyright, intellectual property and appropriation, archival interplays between materials and things, the public archive versus the domestic archive, the studio as archive, making histories and futures through creative practice, identifying archival inheritances in art and design, working with art education archives, teaching archival interventions within the context of art, design and architecture, and fostering inter/multi/trans-disciplinary encounters in the archive...|$|E
