The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who {{had returned from}} military service. Dworsky recalled: [...] "About half of us were 18-year old kids, and half were veterans.

500|$|Fincher hired {{visual effects}} {{supervisor}} Kevin Tod Haug, {{who worked for}} him on The Game, to create visual effects for Fight Club. Haug assigned the visual effects artists and experts to different facilities that each addressed different types of visual effects: CG modeling, animation, compositing, and scanning. Haug explained, [...] "We selected the best people for each aspect of the effects work, then coordinated their efforts. In this way, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> play to a facility's weakness." [...] Fincher visualized the Narrator's perspective through a [...] "mind's eye" [...] view and structured a myopic framework for the film audiences.

We have developed a method that includes three steps: Freeze-separation, vacuum distillation and physical water extraction.

We were able to bring our used acetone up to 99 % purity, so <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay for discarding used acetone and we have purchased only a minimal volume of new acetone...|$|R

It was a fancy of Lumley to drill us thus, and we fell in with his humour, most of us counting it a piece of fun, to break off from what we chanced to be doing at the moment the order was given, and trying who should be first to reach the spot where he stood.

At the time, Alberta Solicitor-General Heather Forsyth said [...] "We anticipate an Amber Alert {{will only be}} issued once a year in Alberta. We hope <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use it, but {{if a child is}} abducted Amber Alert is another tool police can use to find them and help them bring the child home safely." [...] The Alberta government committed to spending more than CA$1 million to expanding the province's emergency warning system so that it could be used effectively for Amber Alerts. [...] Other Canadian provinces soon adopted the system, and by May 2004, Saskatchewan was the only province that had not established an Amber Alert system.

5000|$|May <b>We</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Have</b> <b>To</b> Say Goodbye, {{released}} by the Tara Music label, is a collaboration between Davey, the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra {{and a number of}} famous artists.

It is presented along with a range of music from Davey's suite, featuring traditional soloists, singers, choir, pipe band, and orchestra, together with percussion. This release also includes previously unrecorded pieces from The Pilgrim, along with (among others): [...] "Fill to me the Parting Glass" [...] (from the film score of Waking Ned), and [...] "Music of the Spheres", a magical piece from the Royal Shakespeare Company production of Pericles.|$|E
5000|$|After {{giving a}} large gift to an {{important}} Mexica named Temictzin, Cuacuauhtzin married that man's daughter, Azcalxóchitzin, in the year 12-Flint (1440). Because Azcalxóchitzin was so young, Cuacuauhtzin did not immediately consummate their marriage. After their marriage, Nezahualcoyotl, tlatoani of Texcoco, {{fell in love with}} Azcalxóchitzin and sent Cuacuauhtzin to the war against Tlaxcala. At Nezahualcoyotl's command, Cuacuauhtzin was ordered into the midst of the most dangerous fighting, so that he would be killed and Nezahualcoyotl could marry Azcalxóchitzin. Cuacuauhtzin found out this plot before he left for war and composed {{what is known as the}} [...] "Song of Sadness" [...] or [...] "Sad Song." [...] Addressed to a gathering of close friends, the poem deals with the betrayal of his lord and friend, Nezahualcoyotl, and the certainty of death: [...] "Where would we go/that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> die?" [...] He makes apostrophe to Nezahualcoyotl by means of an epithet, Yoyontzin or [...] "Panting One".|$|E

[...] He added that [...] "It’s nice to see a focus on Moe for once, but the tale itself fails to really ignite. Though not a poor episode, it’s pretty flat after the opening." [...] In 2009, writers for IGN listed a line by Moe from this episode among their top eight favorite Moe quotes. The line was [...] "Yeah, hey, I've got a gift. As a child, I was bitten by the acting bug. Then it burrowed under my skin and laid eggs in my heart. Now those eggs are hatching and I... the feeling is indescribable." [...] Homer responds to this by saying [...] "I know what you mean. Our dog had that." [...] The IGN writers commented that [...] "We've never heard anyone describe their life's passion as a parasitic infestation, and we hope <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to.</b> The cherry {{on top of this}} little nugget of Moe goodness is Homer's nonchalant reaction.

We can learn about that time and about why Jesus died on the cross during a season called Lent. Lent is the forty day period leading up to Easter. Why did Jesus have to die? God cares that we show love for him and for all his children. When we {{do things that are}} hurtful to others or that hurt our relationship with God, we become separated from God.
