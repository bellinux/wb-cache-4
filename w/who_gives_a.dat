In 1998, Berry received {{praise for}} her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> politician (Warren Beatty) a new lease on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed {{the first black woman to}} be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for it to come through. Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron does not even know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

25|$|The Time Machine {{can be read}} as a {{symbolic}} novel. There are several symbols, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire. The time machine itself can also be viewed as a symbol. The Sphinx appeared {{on the cover of the}} first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers. The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of Oedipus <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> riddle that he must first solve before he can pass. The white flowers can symbolize Weena's devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine. They are the only proof that the Time Traveller's story is true. Fire symbolizes civilization, as the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire.|$|E

Poirot interviews the park keeper who remembers the incident of the kidnap. He then investigates the address where the ransom money was sent to and finds it is a cheap hotel where letters are often left for non-residents. His third visit is to the wife of the man Hoggin met at his club <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> very similar story to that told by Lady Hoggin as to the method of kidnap and ransom demand. His last visit is back to Sir Joseph to report on progress where he observes that Sir Joseph's relationship with his blond secretary is not exactly on a professional level.|$|E

As Hammerstein received new material from Steinbeck, he and Rodgers began to map out the musical, conceiving scenes and deciding where songs should be placed. On January 1, 1954, following the completion of Steinbeck's novel, Hammerstein began to write dialogue and lyrics. Sweet Thursday was published in early 1954 to mixed reviews. Steinbeck later commented, [...] "Some of the critics are so concerned for my literary position that they can't read a book of mine without worrying where it will fit in my place in history. <b>Who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> damn?"

500|$|When Jackson {{bought a}} pet {{chimpanzee}} named Bubbles, the media {{viewed it as}} evidence of Jackson's increasing detachment from reality. It was also reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of Joseph Merrick, the [...] "Elephant Man"; Jackson stated that the story was [...] "a complete lie." [...] These stories inspired the nickname [...] "Wacko Jacko", which Jackson acquired the following year, and would come to despise. Another frequent response from the media was about Jackson's plastic surgery. Jackson's manager said of the media's criticism towards the topic, [...] "So many terrible things have been written. Okay, so he had his nose fixed, and the cleft — big deal. I got news for you, my nose has broke five times. It's been fixed twice. <b>Who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> shit? Who cares?

500|$|Ice-T {{referred}} to the album's final track, [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a protest song, stating that the song is [...] " [...] {{in the first person}} as a character who is fed up with police brutality." [...] The song was written in 1990, and had been performed live several times, including at Lollapalooza, before it had been recorded in a studio. The album version mentions then-Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates and the black motorist Rodney King, whose beating by LAPD officers was recorded on videotape. In The Ice Opinion: <b>Who</b> <b>Gives</b> <b>a</b> Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that the song [...] " [...] a warning, not a threat—to authority that says, 'Yo, police: We're human beings.

The lyrics go on to describe a scenario in which members of Body Count [...] "crash" [...] a Klan meeting to [...] "get buck wild with the white freaks". Ice-T makes humorous reference to [...] " [...] in love with Tipper Gore's two 12-year-old nieces", and ponders the possibility of the Grand Wizard coming after him [...] "when his grandson's named little Ice-T." [...] In The Ice Opinion: <b>Who</b> <b>Gives</b> <b>a</b> Fuck?, Ice-T wrote that [...] "'KKK Bitch' was ironic because the sentiments were true. We'd play Ku Klux Klan areas in the South and the girls would always come backstage and tell us how their brothers and fathers didn't like black folks. [...] We knew that 'KKK Bitch' would totally piss off the Ku Klux Klan. There's humor in the song, but it fucks with them. It's on a punk tip." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Wilmore, making it his first and only writing {{contribution}} to the series. Wilmore had previously guest starred in the series as Mr. Brown, the diversity instructor <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> presentation to the office in the first season episode [...] "Diversity Day". The episode was originally {{going to be about}} [...] "weight loss" [...] and be one of the very first episodes of the second season aired. However, after [...] "The Dundies" [...] and [...] "The Fire", series creator and developer Greg Daniels decided to hold the episode off and combine it with elements of [...] "The Client". When [...] "Performance Review" [...] was being formulated, Wilmore had [...] "four different ideas that were scrunched together to make an episode". One of the ideas was on a card that said [...] "Thursday Friday". After inquiring about the meaning, Wilmore loved the idea and noted that it [...] "would be great" [...] in the episode and a [...] "real funny thing to pull on Dwight". Originally, the episode contained a subplot wherein Pam attempts to get a new chair approved by Michael. The scenes, in fact, were shot, but were never aired.|$|E
500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! <b>Who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it." [...] Finn suggested lyrics for the song after viewing a documentary on the first Russian nuclear test; in the film, an aged Soviet physicist says of watching the explosion, [...] "There was a loud boom, and then the bomb began fiercely kicking at the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed up with someone <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> shit." ...|$|E
500|$|This Dragon Quest, {{similar to}} Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest VII, has a class system. Once the party gets to Alltrades Abbey, {{they have the}} option of {{becoming}} one of several starter classes. Each class has eight levels, which are gained by winning a specific number of battles (unlike character levels, which are gained by earning experience points), and advancing in level teaches a character new spells and / or skills, which are retained across class changes. Once a character has mastered a specific set of two or three starter classes, they can change into a hybrid class which builds on their themes; for example, mastering Warrior and Martial Artist unlocks the Gladiator Class, which learns powerful physical attacks, and mastering certain hybrid classes unlocks the Hero class. Some of the classes give special bonuses beyond their stats and abilities such as the Merchant <b>who</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> small bonus to the party's income after every battle, or the Sage who receives a discount to MP costs. To master a class, the character must fight a set number of battles as that class. Once certain hybrid classes are mastered, a stat relating to that class will permanently go up. There are two secret classes as well, Dragon (Hackasaurus) and Liquid Metal Slime, which are unlockable through consumable books. Dragon Quest VI was the first game in the series to include [...] (special attacks and other techniques which are not spells and usually do not cost MP) for human party members. These special techniques were added to the remakes of III, IV and V later on.|$|E
