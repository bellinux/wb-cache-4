The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on.

40|$|This essay {{contributes}} to {{the debate about the}} alleged spillover effects associated with Wal-Mart's growth. Combining county-level data on <b>Wal-Mart</b> entry <b>and</b> location from 1985 through 1998 with individual-level data on leisure activities, we estimate a positive relationship between <b>Wal-Mart</b> penetration <b>and</b> participation in activities involving inputs that can be bought at Wal-Mart. The relationship between <b>Wal-Mart</b> penetration <b>and</b> activities that do not involve inputs that can be bought at Wal-Mart is negative in most cases but may be positive or zero for "cultural" activities such as attending classical music concerts and visiting art galleries. The evidence is consistent with the thesis that deeper Wal-Mart penetration expands consumption possibilities.
