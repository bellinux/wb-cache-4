40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the effectiveness of euthanasia gases administered to 2 age groups of piglets: neonates (less than 3 days, n= 160, BW 2. 61 ± 0. 81 kg) and weaned (16 to 24 days, n= 160, BW 4. 62 ± 0. 76 kg). Two different gases were explored in this study: 100 % CO 2 and a 50 : 50 CO 2 :Argon (CA) gas mixture. Each gas was administered at 3 flow rates: 35 %, 50 % and Prefill + 20 %, chamber volume exchange rate per minute. Latencies, durations and occurrence of behavior and physiologic changes were observed using direct observationand video. Neonate piglets were euthanized as quickly as or faster than weaned piglets for all gases and flow rates. For the neonate relative to the <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet,</b> average loss of posture over all gas treatments was 99 vs. 142 (seconds) and last movement was 360 vs. 392 (seconds). Neonates also displayed fewer incidences and shorter durations of behavioral indicators of distress and sensation relative to the weaned piglets. Thus concerns for gas euthanasia, when applied appropriately, are not greater for the neonate relative to the <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet.</b> Additionally, procedures developed to euthanize weaned piglets will likely be successful when applied for the neonate, but not viceversa...|$|E

Therefore, an in vitro experiment has been conducted to study the effect of Ascophyllum nodosum (A. nodosum) on the piglet gut flora (E. con. lactobacilli, streptococci, total anaerobic count) and their metabolism. In vitro investigations, simulating in vivo conditions, revealed a statistically significant (P< 0. 05) depressive effect of seaweed on piglet small intestinal and hindgut flora, especially on E. coli.

40|$|Plenary {{invited paper}} Abstract: The first weeks after weaning are a {{critical}} stage for piglets characterized by {{high incidence of}} diarrhoea and low weight gain. These problems were counteracted {{with the use of}} antibiotic growth promoters that may as a side-effect induce the selection of antibiotic-resistant genes in animal and human pathogens. For this reason, the European Union decided to completely ban the antibiotics used as growth promoters as of January 2006. As a consequence of this decision, alternative strategies to modulate the piglet gastrointestinal environment have been the object of many studies. The use of non-pharmaceutical dietary supplements, such as organic acids, prebiotics, probiotics, and essential oils has been shown to improve piglet post-weaning health and growth performances but results are sometimes controversial. Moreover, the role of molecules that can influence gastrointestinal and immune development in the newly <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet</b> has been investigated. The proper choice and use of a non-pharmacological dietary supplement might improve piglet productivity {{but it has to be}} considered that dietary supplements usually increase the feed price, which means that the gains in productivity should exceed the increased costs...|$|E

Sows, raised in individual pens, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 experimental diets containing different standardized ileal digestibility (SID) val:lys ratios of 0. 80 or 0. 85. Corn-soybean-wheat-based diets were formulated to achieve the dietary treatments (0. 86 % or 0. 87 % SID lysine, and 0. 69 % or 0. 74 % SID valine). All diets were formulated to have 3, 450 kcal metabolizable energy/kg. The experiment lasted 24 d. At the end of the experiment, body weight loss, backfat loss, average daily feed intake, and days to return to estrus were not affected by the different dietary val:lys ratios. Furthermore, no difference was observed in number of piglets <b>weaned,</b> <b>piglet</b> survival rate, weaning litter weight, litter weight gain, piglet weaning body weight, piglet gain, or piglet daily gain between the two dietary treatments.

40|$|Organic {{acids and}} their salts {{appear to be}} {{potential}} alternatives to prophylactic in-feed antibiotics and growth promoters {{in order to improve}} the performance of <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> fattening pigs and reproductive sows, although their growth-promoting effects are generally less than that of antibiotics. Based on an analysis of published data, the growth-promoting effect of formates, fumarates and citrates did not differ in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> In fattening pigs, formates were the most effective followed by fumarates, whereas propionates did not improve growth performance. These acids improve the feed:gain ratio of both <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> and fattening pigs. In <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets,</b> the growth-promoting effects of dietary organic acids appear to depend greatly on their influence on feed intake. In sows, organic acids may have anti-agalactia properties. Successful application of organic acids in the diets for pigs requires an understanding of their modes of action. It is generally considered that dietary organic acids or their salts lower gastric pH, resulting in increased activity of proteolytic enzymes and gastric retention time, and thus improve protein digestion. Reduced gastric pH and increased time have been difficult to demonstrate, whereas improved apparent ileal digestibilities of protein and amino acids have been observed with growing pigs, but not in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> Organic acids may influence mucosal morphology, as well as stimulate pancreatic secretions, and they also serve as substrates in intermediary metabolism. These may further contribute to improved digestion, absorption and retention of many dietary nutrients. Organic acid supplementation reduces buffering capacity, which is expected to slow down the proliferation and/or colonization of undersirable microbes, e. g. Eschericia coli, in the gastro-ileal region. However, reduced scouring has been observed in only a few studies. As performance responses to dietary organic acids in pigs often varies, more specific studies are necessary to elucidate an expla- nation. vo...|$|R

The main aim {{of this research was}} to investigate techniques to better manage the vulnerable animal in the critical post-weaning period in order to improve feed initiation and intake. Leeds University Feeding Behaviour System was tested and validated for recording the feeding behaviour of piglets housed in groups. Creep feed experience did not improve feeding behaviour post-weaning. Lack of experience of solid feed was not detrimental to the piglets. Outdoor-reared. piglets showed reduced feeding initiation and behaviour compared to indoor-reared piglets when weaned into an indoor facility. questioning the welfare implications of this common management technique. Grouping of piglets, at weaning, from different backgrounds did not conclude any effects of social facilitation between the piglets. However, keeping pig 1 ets with their siblings led to better feeding initiation and improved growth performance. The feeding behaviour of three crossbreeds of pig was different. Hampshire and Pietrain breeds initiated feeding sooner than Large White piglets. The three-breed crosses had different feeding patterns, with Hampshire piglets recorded as the crossbreed with the highest feeding behaviour in the first week post-weaning. When provided with a choice, piglets rejected ZnO supplemented food in favour of an unsupplemented food. Even in the presence of Post-Weaning Colibacillosis there was no indication of selection to meet a requirement. In addition, there was no indication of selection to meet a lysine requirement by weaned piglets. When offered a choice between high and low lysine foods, the piglets' fed entirely at random. Random behaviour was also found from analysis of Short Term Feeding Behaviour, concluding the unsuitability of log-normal analysis for these animals.

To provide a theoretical basis for choosing more suitable xylanase in feed production, we selected bacterial xylanase (BX), labeled enzyme A, and trichoderma xylanase (TX), labeled enzyme B, and studied the enzymology properties and application effects on growth performance and gut flora in weaned piglets. The results showed that the activity levels of both appear parabolic along with increasing pH or temperature, but the amplitude of enzyme activity changing curves and the pH/temperature of optimal activity level are different, where enzyme A has the optimal activity level at 50 °C with a pH value of 5. 0. The optimal activity level of enzyme B was achieved at 70 °C with a pH around 6. 0. Enzyme B suffered very little activity loss with moisture level at 16 % and temperature from 80 °C to 90 °C. Enzyme A suffered a big drop in activity level when processed with high temperature from around 80 °C to 90 °C, and it was even completely inactivated at 90 °C. Enzyme A has very low activity level after being processed in acid environment, but enzyme B has minor changes in activity level with respect to changes in acid level, indicating significantly different enzymatic properties between the two different sources of xylanases. In feeding experiment, the control group, was fed the basal diet, and the BX group and TX group were fed basal diets supplemented with 0. 01 % bacterial and fungal xylanases, respectively. The results showed that ADG of the BX group and TX group increased by 3. 25 % (P >  0. 05) and 8. 22 % (P    0. 05), respectively compared with the control group; TX group had significantly higher (P    0. 05) between BX group and TX group in terms of lactic acid bacteria E.  coli level.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine optimal lysine requirement of lactating Mong Cai sows and their piglets. An experiment was conducted using 30 Mong Cai sows in a factorial randomized design with 5 dietary total lysine levels (0. 60, 0. 70, 0. 85, 1. 0 and 1. 15 %) for one-week pre-partum and 5 dietary total lysine levels (0. 60, 0. 75, 0. 90, 1. 05 and 1. 2 %) for lactation diets. Mong Cai sows were about 1 to 2 years old and had an initial body weight of 120 kg (sd = 2. 5) after farrowing. Sows were restrictively fed 1. 7 kg feed during gestation and were fed ad libitum during lactation. Diets of sows contained about 12 % CP during pregnancy and about 14 % CP for the lactation period. DE concentration of the diets ranged between 12. 5 - 13. 0 MJ of DE. Water was supplied at up to 8 liters per sow per day in a basin. Studied traits were related to both sows and their progeny. Sows were weighed at 107 days of gestation, after farrowing and at weaning. Sow back-fat depth was measured at 110 days of gestation, after farrowing, at 21 days of lactation and at weaning. Number of piglets born, at 24 h after birth, at 21 days of age and at weaning were recorded. Piglets were weighte at birth, at 21 days and at weaning. Supplying lysine one week pre-partum had no effect on the number of piglets born nor litter weight at birth (p = 0. 776 and p = 0. 224). A positive effect of increasing dietary lysine level during lactation from 0. 60 to 1. 20 % was observed with regard to less sow weight loss, and increased piglet weight at 21 days and at weaning. The level of lysine that resulted in the lowest sow backfat loss and the highest <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet</b> weight was 1. 05 %; this may be the optimum level of lysine for the diet of lactating Mong Cai sows. At this lysine level, the number of weaned piglets was also highest...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effects of bamboo vinegar powder on growth performance, {{diarrhea}} situation and mRNA expression levels of cytokines i. e., interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), interleukin- 22 (IL- 22), and interleukin- 25 (IL- 25) in immune organs of weaned piglets, and to accumulate theoretical data for the application of bamboo vinegar powder in <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet</b> production. Forty-five crossbred (Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire, all male) weaned piglets with similar body weight (6. 74  ±  0. 17  kg) at 31 days of age were randomly assigned to 5 treatments with 3 replicates per treatment and 3 piglets in each replicate. The five treatments were as follows: CON (a basal diet), ANT (the basal diet +  0. 12 % antibiotics), BV 1 (the basal diet +  0. 1 % bamboo vinegar powder), BV 5 (the basal diet +  0. 5 % bamboo vinegar powder), BV 10 (the basal diet +  1. 0 % bamboo vinegar powder). This experiment lasted 35 days. The growth performance and diarrhea situation were recorded. The relative mRNA expression levels of IL- 10, IL- 22 and IL- 25 in liver, spleen, duodenum and mesenteric lymph nodes were detected by real-time PCR. Feed: gain of BV 5 was significantly lower than that of CON (P <  0. 05). In comparison with CON, diarrhea rate and diarrhea index of BV 1 and BV 5 all tended to decrease (P <  0. 1). Compared with CON, mRNA expression level of IL- 10 in liver of ANT tended to be lower (P <  0. 1) and these of BV 1, BV 5 and BV 10 were significantly reduced (P <  0. 05). The mRNA expression levels of IL- 10 in duodenum of ANT, BV 1, BV 5 and BV 10 were all lower than those of CON, of which BV 10 had significantly decreased IL- 10 mRNA expression in duodenum (P <  0. 05). The mRNA expression levels of IL- 22 in duodenum of ANT, BV 1, BV 5 and BV 10 all tended to be inhibited compared with CON (P <  0. 1). With the increase of bamboo vinegar powder dosage, mRNA expression levels of IL- 25 in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of BV 1, BV 5 and BV 10 tended to be up-regulated. Overall, bamboo vinegar powder could improve growth performance, and regulate mRNA expression levels of IL- 10, IL- 22 and IL- 25 in immune organs of weaned piglets.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of four different feeds on <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet</b> performance, a total of 824 piglets were allotted to four different dietary treatment groups (NS, NP, OS, and OP). Feed effects on average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency (FE), health (incidence of diarrhea and respiratory problems), body condition score (BCS) and mortality were determined. It was hypothesized that overall the piglets on New Feeds would perform better than piglets fed Old Feeds. The experimental groups consisted of a total 88 litters that were supplied with creep feed according to their dietary treatment group. After weaning (day 21), piglets were allotted to 44 pens with a maximum mixing of two litters per pen and taking the dietary treatment group pre-weaning into account. Climate was controlled by a computer-linked fan system that required manual setting. Compared to OS feed, the NS feed has been adjusted {{to form a new}} concept with less antibiotics, less crude protein (CP) with a better digestibility, more fermentable carbohydrates (FC), additional organic acids (OA) and improved taste. This resulted in significantly healthier piglets when fed NS feed (lower incidence of both respiratory signs and diarrhea) and NP feed thereafter (lower diarrhea scores than piglets on Old feeds). Compared to the OP feeds, the concept of the NP feed consisted of the same NS factors but with additional increased energy value and higher levels of lysine and other amino acids. This resulted in a significantly better FE for NP dietary treatment groups (P< 0. 011 and P< 0. 001). Although only significant for the trial period d 14 - 20 (P< 0. 001), over the entire trial period, the ADFI of New feeds was higher compared to the Old feeds. The ADG was higher for the Old feed trial groups than for the New feed trial groups. Overall, OP feeds had the highest mean BCS and within the New feed trial groups, mean BCS for piglets on NS feed was highest. Taking the entire trial period into account, mortality rates were highest in the NS trial group and lowest in NP and OS trial groups. Results may have been influenced by the air temperature in nursery house that was an average 5 °C higher than optimal temperatures related to age of the piglets. Feeding the total concepts of New Safety (NS) and New Performance (NP) diets to piglets age 14 - 68 days resulted in an overall better piglet performance and health than feeding Old Safety (OS) and Old Performance (OP) feeds...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the impact of}} {{probiotic}} Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 on the intestinal microbiota and the resulting effects on performance and health status of piglets and sows was investigated. A method to detect the probiotic Enterococcus within total intestinal enterococci was developed. 20 sows and their litters {{were divided into two}} trial groups and kept separately. Piglets were weaned at 28 th day of life. Control group received standard diet while probiotic group was fed the same diet supplemented with 1, 6 x 106, 1, 7 and 2 x 105 cells of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 per kg feed for sows, suckling and weaned piglets, respectively. Performance of sows was measured in litter size, piglet losses, <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet,</b> weight loss during lactation and average daily feed intake (ADFI). In piglets ADFI and average daily gain (ADG) was determined and gain to feed ratio (G:F) was calculated. Incidence and severity of diarrhea was documented in weaned piglets. Fecal samples of sows were collected 10 days ante partum and 14 days post partum. Feces of piglets was obtained on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 56 and 70, respectively. On days 14, 28, 35 56 five piglets of each group were sacrificed and digesta samples were collected from stomach, jejunum, ileum and colon. A method to enumerate specific cell counts of probiotic bacteria in comparison to total enterococci counts in digesta and feces was developed using colony hybridization technique. Fecal samples were screened for potential pathogenic E. coli using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The influence on bacterial composition in piglet feces was investigated by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Amounts of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), lactic acid (LA) and ammonia in digesta as well as colony forming units (CFU) of total anaerobes, lactic acid bacteria, coliforms and enterococci were measured. Only few differences could be observed between the trial groups after addition of E. faecium NCIMB 10415 to pig diets. No influence was detectable on performance parameters of piglets and sows. Diarrhea was significantly reduced in the probiotic group after weaning (p&# 8804; 0, 05). Ammonia contents were reduced in jejunal digesta in the probiotic group (p&# 8804; 0, 1) while SCFA and LA concentrations as well as bacterial CFU showed no differences between the trial groups. Probiotic E. faecium NCIMB 10415 could be detected in all gut sections and feces of probiotic fed piglets. Direct transmission of the probiotic enterococcus from sows to piglets could be demonstrated while specific cell counts in suckling piglets without any feed supplementation already reached similar levels compared to cell counts in digesta and feces of weaned piglets fed probiotic- supplemented diets. Therefore the amount of ingested probiotic appearently did not affect the level of intestinal cell counts of the probiotic as expected. Incidence of potential pathogenic E. coli in feces appeared to be reduced in the probiotic group. Soerensen´s similarity coefficient showed significant higher similarity in bacterial composition of piglet feces within the probiotic group on day 14 and 56 compared to the control group as determined by DGGE. With regard to the number of parameters investigated during this trial the addition of probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 induced only few measureable effects on probiotic fed pigs. Nevertheless the intestinal microbiota was affected by this treatment while positive effects on health and performance remained inconsistent...|$|E
40|$|In this {{investigation}} the validation {{and application of}} a molecular biological proof {{of a total of}} nine virulence factors of E. coli, which are pathogen for pigs, is shown. The genes for StaP (est-Ib), Stb (est-II), LT (elt-Ia), Stx 2 e (stx 2 e), F 4 (fae), F 5 (fan), F 6 (fas), F 18 ab (fedA) and F 41 (fimf 41 a) were qualitatively demonstrated using a multiplex PCR assay (MPCR) and subsequent hybridization with internal oligonucleotide probes for both, E. coli isolates and DNA which was extracted from piglet intestinal mucosa. This method was applied to the examination of intestinal specimens from a diarrhoeic piglet, and to faecal samples from healthy piglets and sows from the instituteýs stables, as well as intestinal specimens from piglets after using B. cereus var. toyoi as a probiotic feed additive in comparison with a control group. In spite of the complicated working procedure and the involving sources of error, the applied method for simultaneous extraction of DNA and RNA from mucosa was successful in obtaining a diagnostically adequate amount of nucleic acids from gram negative bacteria with the required quality for PCR. Initially, the MPCR was validated using DNA from E. coli isolates and was then adopted to the examination of mucosal DNA extracts {{in the course of the}} study. It was a useful and sensitive method for the genetical detection of selected virulence factors of pathogenic E. coli, especially when using isolates. But the necessary intensive and time-consuming optimization seemed disadvantageous. In the mucosal DNA extracts, the detection of fae was not clearly successful. It was possible to optimise a specific PCR for fae in a short period of time, whereas using mucosal specimens sporadically led to the formation of unspecific products. Eight of the nine internal oligonucleotide probes proved to be specific and sensitive for hybridization of mucosal DNA extracts. The fae probe however only delivered specific signals for isolate-DNA subsequent to MPCR. Specimens from the intestinal mucosa of a diarrhoeic piglet were examined by MPCR, seven days post weaning. The results indicated a contamination with ETEC and STEC strains. Of the faecal samples collected from piglets and sows at our test facilities, a high percentage had positive MPCR results for E. coli virulence factors. The samples from the weaned piglets showed a high proportion of fedA positive isolates. Two isolates additionally carried the genes for stx 2 e and est-II. On the one hand, these might be able to initiate both, the post weaning diarrhea and the edema disease, and on the other hand could be associated to the diarrhoeic <b>weaned</b> <b>piglet</b> in terms of a reservoir for pathogens. Twenty percent of the isolates showed a fae positive reaction in MPCR. The most frequently detected enterotoxin gene was est-II, often associated with fae. In a feeding trial piglets received B. cereus var. toyoi as a probiotic feed additive. Compared to a control group, these supplemented piglets had less samples with a positive MPCR results for E. coli virulence factors, especially on day 21 and 28 of life. In all age groups there was a tendency towards a decreased appearance of elt-Ia positive E. coli in the supplemented group. At the age of 32 days the number of pathogenicity factors seemed to have increased in the supplemented group compared to the controls. However, none of these animals showed signs of diarrhea. In context to results of other studies, which indicate a significant stimulation of the cellular and humoral immune system in correlation with B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation, this phenomenon could be immunulogically interpreted as a specific antigen-induced stimulation of the hostýs immune system. Moreover, considering other investigations it is also possible that the invasion of the intestinal mucosa with E. coli is inhibited by an increased density of the paracellular barrier thus suppressing any clinical signs. In spite of the frequently described reduction of E. coli in the intestine of piglets supplemented with probiotics, no significant reduction of E. coli pathogenicity factors could be observed in {{this investigation}}. <br /...|$|E

Faecal inocula collected from unweaned (5 kg body weight (BW)) and <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> (15 kg BW) were introduced in airtight 100 -mL bottles containing 0. 5 g of substrate (basal or mix) in pre-warmed buffered medium. The organic matter cumulative volume (OMCV) was measured for 48 h, and a mono-phasic model was fitted to the data. The concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and ammonia (NH 3) was determined after fermentation. Incubation of substrate mix with the different inocula gave a significant higher OMCV compared to substrate basal, except for the inoculum from piglets of the CONAB group. In addition, substrate mix gave a higher Rmax and a lower Tmax compared to substrate basal. With the exception of inoculum obtained from chicory root supplemented animals (CHR) no substrate effects were observed in fermentation end-products (VFA and NH 3). However, the proportions of acetic acid were significantly higher and those of butyric acid lower when inocula were incubated with substrate mix. Inocula from weaned pigs tended to show higher proportions of propionic acid when incubated with substrate mix, whilst inocula from unweaned piglets showed the opposite. The differences in fermentation kinetics between substrates after incubation with inocula from <b>weaned</b> and unweaned <b>piglets</b> in combination with an altered composition in VFA, points to a modified faecal microflora following weaning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur study {{addresses}} {{the first two}} weeks of the <b>weaning</b> period of <b>piglets</b> during which stressful physiological and environmental conditions experienced by the animals can promote the proliferation of pathogens in the digestive tract. The aim of the study was to identify new feeding strategies that result in boosting the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota of piglets and improve growth performance, reducing the negative impact of weaning. In order to identify a new synbiotic combination, 12 new putative probiotic strains of Bifidobacterium spp. and three non-digestible oligosaccharides [NDO] were screened in newly <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets.</b> The ability to increase the level of autochthonous bifidobacteria and improve growth performance were assessed. Bifidobacteria strains with a similar ability to develop in the hindgut showed a different effect on piglet performance depending on the dose in which they were provided. Our data support the idea that the presence of fructo-oligosaccharides would stimulate the occurrence of bifidobacteria in the caecum. It was shown that dietary intake of nitrate can generate salivary nitrite, which in turn is acidified in the stomach and could have antimicrobial activity against swallowed pathogens. The efficacy of the resulting synbiotic formula was improved by adding nitrate as antimicrobial. To enhance probiotic survival during gastric transit, a novel technology of microencapsulation was developed and applied to bacteria. The final synbiotic, containing the strain RA 18 of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis [1011 cfu/day], the prebiotic Actilight® [4 % of the diet], and nitrate [150 mg KNO 3 /kg feed/day] was tested in organic <b>weaned</b> <b>piglets</b> reared under field conditions.

Average daily gain and feed conversion efficiency were found to be higher in group H than in group N, and showed significant differences between group H and group P (P 0 < 0. 05). Furthermore, groups H and P had a lower diarrhea index than the other three groups (P 0 < 0. 05).
