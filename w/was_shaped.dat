5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and {{quarrying}} was an important economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux quartzite, Milbank granite, sand, gravel, limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces a very limited amount of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could be reconciled with a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E

One <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a dinosaur (used by Kai-Lan, Rintoo, Tolee, and Hoho), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> {{like a duck}} (used by the Hula Ducks), one <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a rabbit (used by Ye-Ye and Mr. Fluffy), and the last is a smaller, old-fashioned ship (used by the Ants).|$|R
50|$|The {{wings of}} a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft are static planes extending {{either side of the}} aircraft. When the aircraft travels forwards, air flows over the wings which <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> to create lift. This <b>shape</b> <b>is</b> called an airfoil and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a bird's wing.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the Fusō-class battleships <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> both by the ongoing {{international}} naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters. The IJN's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905, {{the last year of}} the Russo-Japanese War, which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of Tsushima.|$|E
5|$|A {{funeral was}} held on March 11, at the Montreal Forum, the arena where the Canadiens played. Fans were allowed to file past the casket, laid at center ice, and 50,000 people paid their respects. A {{rotating}} guard of honour of four Canadiens stood around the casket which was covered in flowers including a large wreath from Aurèle Joliat that <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> like the number 7, Morenz's number, and a note from Morenz's three children. The entire service was broadcast on the radio, and after its conclusion he was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's writing <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by {{his work}} as a {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E

For instance, top-down relabeling tree transducers <b>are</b> <b>shape</b> preserving top-down tree transducers. We {{show that}} a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving {{if and only if}} it is equivalent to a top-down relabeling tree transducer. We also prove that it is decidable if a top-down tree transducer <b>is</b> <b>shape</b> preserving...|$|R

25|$|Routing <b>is</b> a <b>shaping</b> process used {{to produce}} {{finished}} edges and shapes. Some materials that prove difficult to shape with other processes, such as fiber-glass, Kevlar, and graphite, can <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> and finished neatly via various routing techniques. Apart from finished edges and shaping, cutaways, holes, and contours can also <b>be</b> <b>shaped</b> using routers.|$|R
5|$|From 1830 to 1833, {{geologist}} Charles Lyell {{published his}} multi-volume work Principles of Geology, which, building on Hutton's ideas, advocated a uniformitarian {{alternative to the}} catastrophic theory of geology. Lyell claimed that, rather than being the products of cataclysmic (and possibly supernatural) events, the geologic features of the Earth are better explained {{as the result of}} the same gradual geologic forces observable in the present day—but acting over immensely long periods of time. Although Lyell opposed evolutionary ideas (even questioning the consensus that the fossil record demonstrates a true progression), his concept that the Earth <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by forces working gradually over an extended period, and the immense age of the Earth assumed by his theories, would strongly influence future evolutionary thinkers such as Charles Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth obstructed sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon obstructed sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the horizontal surface and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
50|$|The term goblet {{refers to}} the cell's goblet-like shape. The apical portion <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a cup, as it is {{distended}} by abundant mucus laden granules; its basal portion lacks these granules and <b>is</b> <b>shaped</b> like a stem.|$|R
25|$|The {{formations}} in the Devils Garden were created, {{and continue}} to <b>be</b> <b>shaped,</b> by various weathering and erosional processes.

5|$|Since 2000, Bono's campaigning has {{included}} Jubilee 2000 with Geldof, Muhammad Ali, {{and others to}} promote the cancellation of third-world debt during the Great Jubilee. In January 2002, Bono co-founded the multinational NGO DATA, {{with the aim of}} improving the social, political, and financial state of Africa. He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV/AIDS relief into June 2002 by making high-profile visits to Africa. Product Red, a for-profit licensed brand seeking {{to raise money for the}} Global Fund, was co-founded by Bono in 2006. The ONE Campaign, originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History, <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by his efforts and vision.|$|E
5|$|South Slavic legends about Kraljević Marko or Krali Marko are {{primarily}} based on myths {{much older than}} the historical Marko Mrnjavčević. He differs in legend from the folk poems; in some areas he was imagined as a giant who walked stepping on hilltops, his head touching the clouds. He {{was said to have}} helped God shape the earth, and created the river gorge in Demir Kapija ("Iron Gate") with a stroke of his sabre. This drained the sea covering the regions of Bitola, Mariovo and Tikveš in Macedonia, making them habitable. After the earth <b>was</b> <b>shaped,</b> Marko arrogantly showed off his strength. God took it away by leaving a bag as heavy as the earth on a road; when Marko tried to lift it, he lost his strength and became an ordinary man.|$|E
5|$|Story and {{characters}} were a primary concern for Gilbert and Winnick. The pair based the game's cast on friends, family members, acquaintances, and stereotypes. For example, Winnick's girlfriend Ray was {{the inspiration for}} Razor, while Dave and Wendy were based, respectively, on Gilbert and a fellow Lucasfilm employee named Wendy. According to Winnick, the Edison family <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> after characters from EC Comics and Warren Publishing magazines. The sentient meteor that brainwashes Dr. Fred {{was inspired by a}} segment from the 1982 anthology film Creepshow. A man-eating plant, similar to that of Little Shop of Horrors, was included as well. The developers sought {{to strike a balance between}} tension and humor with the game's story.|$|E
50|$|The {{bacteria}} also {{exhibit a}} dimorphism. The bacteria on the stalks <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> like rods, but {{those in the}} region of the ciliated oral apparatus of the microzooids <b>are</b> <b>shaped</b> like small spheres (coccoid). Intermediate forms are also found in between.|$|R

5|$|The creek flows {{generally}} south-southwest {{through a}} narrow coastal watershed at the southern extreme end of the arid Los Angeles Basin in a fairly straight course. Owing to the submersion of Southern California in the Pacific Ocean as recently as 10million years ago, the creek flows over marine sedimentary rock that dates from the late Eocene to the Pliocene. The present-day form of the watershed, with its broad sediment-filled valleys and deeply eroded side canyons, <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by a climate change during the previous Ice Age that produced Aliso Canyon, the creek's final gorge.|$|E
5|$|The {{perception}} {{of communism in}} the US <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by the Cold War, which began after World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because of the close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E

5|$|Under the Plantagenets, England was transformed, {{although}} {{this was only}} partly intentional. The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta. These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support. The king was no longer just {{the most powerful man}} in the nation, holding the prerogative of judgement, feudal tribute and warfare. He now had defined duties to the realm, underpinned by a sophisticated justice system. A distinct national identity <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by conflict with the French, Scots, Welsh and Irish, and the establishment of English as the primary language.|$|E
5|$|Pottery {{produced}} locally in East Africa <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> by hand, unglazed, {{and assumed}} to be open fired, {{but it has been}} proposed that the absence of evidence for kilns {{may be the result of}} mistaking their remnants for metal furnaces. However, the absence of glazed and wheeled pottery illustrates that the inhabitants of the Swahili Coast did not adapt these technologies as a result of Indian Ocean trade, but were primarily the recipients of finished products in exchange for other local produce. Conversely, fifteen different potters' marks have been found at Gedi on pottery found on or near the surface of the site dating to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which has been used to suggest the site may have had a communal kiln at that time. The pots inscribed with the potters marks show the variation of different types and styles of ceramics over time, which were influenced by local production, as well as, the adaption of foreign design elements. Prior to the diversification of local styles and types, early ceramics at Gedi were more uniform and contained similarities with ceramics found at other coastal sites. Despite the increase of imported ceramics in the fifteenth century, local varieties continued to be present in later levels of the sites occupation.|$|E
5|$|Rocket bombs, {{aerodynamic}} {{wings and}} explosive payloads: The first known rockets fitted with aerodynamic wings {{are described as}} the 'flying crows with magic fire' in the oldest strata of the Huolongjing (early-to-mid 14th century), compiled by Jiao Yu and Liu Bowen during the early Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The body of the rocket <b>was</b> <b>shaped</b> like a bird (specifically a crow), packed with gunpowder, and made of bamboo laths forming a long basketwork frame that was reinforced with glued paper. A decorative head and tail were attached {{to the front and}} back ends, while the wings were nailed to the sides. Under each wing were two slanting rockets to propel the weapon; a main fuse was lit that ignited a fourfold fuse connected to each rocket and running through a drilled hole {{in the back of the}} bird. The book then claims that the rocket, after being launched high into the air and aimed at encampments or enemy boats, automatically produced an explosion upon impact that could be seen from considerably long distances.|$|E
