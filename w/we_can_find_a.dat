The new extending basis vectors span a subspace K of V and V is the internal direct sum of Q and K.

25|$|This form {{suggests}} that if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> function ψ whose gradient is given by P, then the integral A is given by the difference of ψ at the endpoints of the interval of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary {{can be related to}} the study of the level surfaces of ψ. In order to find such a function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of Lagrangian optics and Hamiltonian optics.|$|E

In a letter to community services commissioner Donald M. Gordon, Drynan wrote: [...] "I am sure that the statue has artistic merit and needs to be preserved.

500|$|The Anglo–Nepalese War (1814–1816), {{sometimes}} called the Gorkha War, was fought between Nepal and the British East India Company {{as a result of}} border tensions, trade dispute, and ambitious expansionism of both the belligerent parties. While the immediate reason for the war was the border dispute in the terai region, the hostility between the two parties had been brewing {{for more than a decade}} since the failure of Knox's mission. This war was the most important event during the mukhtiyari of Bhimsen Thapa since it affected every aspect of the later course of Nepalese history. Considering the many successes that the Nepalese army had seen during the expansion campaign of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa was one of the main proponents of the war with the British, which was against the better advice of the likes of Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa, who actually did the fighting and knew about the hardships of war. Bhimsen's attitude before the war is summarized in the following letter to King Girvan, where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> hint of superstition on Nepalese invincibility: ...|$|E

2500|$|One can {{interpret}} {{the positions of}} the numbers in a sequence as x-coordinates of points in the Euclidean plane, and the numbers themselves as y-coordinates; conversely, for any point set in the plane, the y-coordinates of the points, ordered by their x-coordinates, forms a sequence of numbers (unless two of the points have equal x-coordinates). [...] With this translation between sequences and point sets, the Erdős–Szekeres theorem can be interpreted as stating that in any set of at least rs'r's+2 points <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> polygonal path of either r1 positive-slope edges or s1 negative-slope edges. In particular (taking r=s), in any set of at least n points <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>find</b> <b>a</b> polygonal path of at least ⌊√(n-1)⌋ edges with same-sign slopes.
