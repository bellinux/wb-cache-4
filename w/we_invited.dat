25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that <b>we</b> <b>invited</b> the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell us that he didn't really mean that.|$|E

"Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so <b>we</b> <b>invited</b> him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to the way he did with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ere long my old schoolfellow made me sundry confessions, {{which showed}} that Laura's surmises were correct. About his {{domestic}} affairs he did not treat much; the little boy {{was said to be}} a very fine little boy; the ladies had taken entire possession of him. [...] "I can't stand Mrs. Mackenzie any longer, I own," [...] says Clive; [...] "but how resist a wife at such a moment? Rosa was sure she would die, unless her mother came to her, and of course <b>we</b> <b>invited</b> Mrs. Mack. This time she is all smiles and politeness with the Colonel: the last quarrel is laid upon me, and in so far I am easy, as the old folks get on pretty well together." [...] To me, considering these things, it was clear that Mr. Clive Newcome was but a very secondary personage indeed in his father's new fine house which he inhabited, and in which the poor Colonel had hoped they were to live such a happy family.|$|E
6000|$|While I {{was still}} at Court, busied with secular affairs, I [...] often thought of the leisure which I hoped one day to enjoy [...] in a solitary place, {{far away from the}} crowd, with which the [...] liberality of Prince Louis, whom I then served, had {{provided}} [...] me. This place is situated in that part of Germany which [...] lies between the Neckar and the Maine,[34] and is nowadays [...] called the Odenwald by those who live in and about it. And [...] here having built, according to my capacity and resources, [...] not only houses and permanent dwellings, but also a basilica [...] fitted for the performance of divine service and of no mean [...] style of construction, I began to think to what saint or [...] martyr I could best dedicate it. A good deal of time had [...] passed while my thoughts fluctuated about this matter, when [...] it happened that a certain deacon of the Roman Church, named [...] Deusdona, arrived at the Court for the purpose of seeking [...] the favour of the King in some affairs in which he was [...] interested. He remained some time; and then, having [...] transacted his business, he was about to return to Rome, [...] when one day, moved by courtesy to a stranger, <b>we</b> <b>invited</b> [...] him to a modest refection; and while talking of many things [...] at table, mention was made of the translation of the body of [...] the blessed Sebastian,[35] and of the neglected tombs of [...] the martyrs, of which there is such a prodigious number at [...] Rome; and the conversation having turned towards the [...] dedication of our new basilica, I began to inquire how it [...] might be possible for me to obtain some of the true relics [...] of the saints which rest at Rome. He at first hesitated, and [...] declared {{that he did not know}} how that could be done. But [...] observing that I was both anxious and curious about the [...] subject, he promised to give me an answer some other day.|$|E
6000|$|For do we {{give the}} glory of our {{scientific}} discoveries to God, in any real, honest, and practical sense? There may be some official and perfunctory talk of God's blessing on our endeavours; {{but there seems to}} be no real belief in us that God, the inspiration of God, is the very fount and root of the endeavours themselves; that He teaches us these great discoveries; that He gives us wisdom to get this wondrous wealth; that He works in us to will and to do of his good pleasure. True, we keep up something of the form and tradition of the old talk about such things; we join in prayer to God to bless our great Exhibition, but we do not believe--we do not believe, my friends-- that it was God who taught us to conceive, build, and arrange that Great Exhibition; and our notion of God's blessing it, seems to be God's absence from it; a hope and trust that God will leave it and us alone, and not [...] "visit" [...] it or us in it, or [...] "interfere" [...] by any [...] "special providences," [...] by storms, or lightning, or sickness, or panic, or conspiracy; a sort of dim feeling that we could manage it all perfectly well without God, but that as He exists, and has some power over natural phenomena, which is not very exactly defined, we must notice His existence over and above our work, lest He should become angry and [...] "visit" [...] us [...] . And this in spite of words which were spoken by one whose office it was to speak them, as the representative of the highest and most sacred personage in these realms; words which deserve to be written in letters of gold on the high places of this city; in which he spoke of this Exhibition as an [...] "approach to a more complete fulfilment of the great and sacred mission which man has to perform in the world;" [...] when he told the English people that [...] "man's reason being created in the image of God, he has to discover the laws by which Almighty God governs His creations, and by making these laws the standard of his action, to conquer nature to his use, himself a divine instrument;" [...] when he spoke of [...] "thankfulness to Almighty God for what he has already GIVEN," [...] as the first feeling which that Exhibition ought to excite in us; and as the second, [...] "the deep conviction that those blessings can only be realised in proportion to"--not, as some would have it, the rivalry and selfish competition--but [...] "in proportion to the HELP which we are prepared to render to each other; and, therefore, by peace, love, and ready assistance, not only between individuals, but between all nations of the earth." [...] We read those great words; but in the hearts of how few, alas! to judge from our modern creed on such matters, must the really important and distinctive points of them find an echo! To how few does this whole Exhibition seem to have been anything but a matter of personal gain or curiosity, for national aggrandisement, insular self-glorification, and selfish--I had almost said, treacherous--rivalry with the very foreigners whom <b>we</b> <b>invited</b> as our guests? ...|$|E
