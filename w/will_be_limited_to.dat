5|$|On {{this section}} of the line, there is Communications-based train control (CBTC) {{equipment}} on the southbound express track between Fourth Avenue and Church Avenue, as part of the automation of the New York City Subway. The total cost is $99.6 million, with $15 million coming from the 2005–2009 capital budget (phase one) and $84.6 million from the 2010–2014 capital budget (phase two). The installation is a joint venture between Siemens and Thales Group, and is used to test the track's new signaling on R143s and R160s that are already equipped with CBTC. The estimated completion date was scheduled for March 2015; the installation is expected to be permanent. If Culver Line express service is implemented in 2017 as it was proposed, the express service would not initially use CBTC, and testing of CBTC on the express track <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> off-peak hours. The local tracks in this section would also get CBTC as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program.|$|E

25|$|Most 32-bit PCI cards will {{function}} {{properly in}} 64-bit PCI-X slots, but the bus clock rate <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the clock {{frequency of the}} slowest card, an inherent limitation of PCI's shared bus topology.

To get around this limitation, many motherboards have multiple PCI/PCI-X buses, with one bus intended for use with high-speed PCI-X peripherals, and the other bus intended for general-purpose peripherals.|$|E

Lignocellulosic biomass consists of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose. Indeed, complexicity of the lignocellulosic biomass structure causes a pretreatment to be applied prior to cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis into fermentable sugars. Pretreatment technologies can be physical (mechanical comminution, pyrolysis), physico-chemical (steam explosion, ammonia fiber explosion, CO 2 explosion), chemical (ozonolysis, acid hydrolysis, alkaline hydrolysis, oxidative delignification, organosolvent process) and biological ones...|$|R

500|$|Another {{significant}} snowfall hit the Raleigh area in January 2000 {{when more}} than [...] of snow fell. [...] There was also a heavy snowfall totaling [...] that hit the Wilmington area on December 22-23, 1989. This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast, {{as far south as}} Savannah, GA, with little to no snow measured west of I-95. [...] Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina. These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level, usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states. If the storms track sufficiently far to the east, snow <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> {{the eastern part of the}} state (as with the December 22-23, 1989 storm). If the cyclones travel close to the coast, warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean, bringing a rain/snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont, foothills and mountains, as with the January 22, 1987 storm. If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina, the rain/snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{linkages between}} environmental wealth and illegal trade in diamonds, timber, and wildlife, {{and the internal}} conflicts, corruption, and flow of profits to external locations that can leave resource-rich countries with a poor return.

In these processes, the results include environmental degradation and the erosion or denial of social justice and human rights. Approaches to amelioration, prosecution, and protection of populations and species are outlined, but the authors acknowledge that there are no ?one-size-fits-all? solutions. Under current global economic conditions, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>limits</b> <b>to</b> the impact of democratic development in resource-producer nations unless Western production practices and exploitative patterns of consumption are addressed...|$|R
