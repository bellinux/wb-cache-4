The major concern of this work refers to one peculiar aspect that recently is gaining the attention of designers and construction companies: the role of <b>infill</b> <b>panels.</b> There is now an increasing consensus on how these non-structural elements should be carefully designed, both, to increase their thermo-insulating capacity and to adapt their earthquake performance to the most recent standards. It is well known that <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> are the main source of heat dispersion in buildings, Moreover, in recent seismic events, we have witnessed several dramatic collapses of <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> that overturned outside of buildings. The need arose almost spontaneously: to conceive a new type of <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> that could solve these two critical issues. The solution was found in an innovative constructive system for <b>infill</b> <b>panels,</b> in which the traditional hollow-core masonry blocks are connected, rather than with the traditional mortar layers, through joints made from recycled plastic. These joints are constituted of a planar surface with a number of protruding “teeth” on both sides that fit into the holes of the blocks. The constructive system has the advantage of a rapid assemblage, which reduces the construction times, and allows the insertion of insulating panels that reduce the thermal conductivity to very low levels. From the anti-seismic standpoint, the teeth are designed to allow for a certain displacement to occur at the joint level, thus reducing the in-plane stiffness of the <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> and, as a consequence, its damage; at the same time, they realize an interlocking mechanism that prevents the out-of-plane collapse...|$|R

40|$|A new {{building}} {{system based on}} Semi-Interlocking Masonry (SIM) is being developed at the Centre for Infrastructure Performance and Reliability, University of Newcastle, Australia, to improve the seismic behaviour of framed structures with masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels.</b> SIM panels are built with dry­stacked masonry units capable of relative sliding in-plane of a panel but locked against relative out-of­plane movement. Panels are designed to dissipate earthquake energy through sliding friction between bricks during seismic vibration. SIM's in-plane stiffness is lower compared with traditional masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels.</b> This helps to reduce potential damage due to earthquake.

This paper presents preliminary finite element results of {{an investigation into the}} composite behaviour of a square steel frame with a precast concrete <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> subject to lateral loading.

Experimental pullout tests on individual Frame-to-Panel-Connections, FPC 4, allowed the load deflection characteristics to be established. This made it possible to model the experimental non-linear behaviour of the connection by multi-linear tensile and compression springs in the finite element model. The results from the finite element model of the infilled frame structure with FPC 4 connections compares well with the experimentally obtained values for initial lateral stiffness, yielding level and ultimate strength.

The structure had 3 main storeys {{and an additional}} storey to simulate the footing to plinth level. In plan the structure was symmetric with 2 bays in each direction. In order to optimize the information obtained from the tests, tests were planned in three different stages.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} a combined experimental and analytical research project that investigated the loss of transverse (out-of-plane) strength for un reinforced masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> {{as a result of}} in -plane cracking. Large-scale test panels were constructed and subjected to repeated and reversed horizontal forces applied parallel with their plane to a lateral drift equal to twice that at initial cracking. Then, they were subjected to monotonically increasing transverse pressures with an air bag until their ultimate strengths were developed. Selected test panels were then repaired and retested. Test specimens consisted of either clay-unit or concrete masonry infills placed in a single-bay, single-story reinforced concrete frame. Parameters of the experimental sequence were the masonry-unit type, the mortar type, and the height-to-thickness ratio of the <b>infill</b> <b>panel.</b> An analytical model was developed to predict the out-of-plane behavior and strength of masonry panels with and without previous in -plane damage. The analytical model was based on an arching action theory. Analytical model parameters included the masonry compressive strength, the infill slenderness ratio, and the extent of in -plane damage. Based on the analytical model and on the supporting experimental results, recommendations were developed for practical seismic evaluation and rehabilitation of cracked unreinforced masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> loaded normal to their plane.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{experimental and}} FE results of {{investigations into the}} structural behaviour of a connection between steel frames and precast concrete <b>infill</b> <b>panels,</b> forming a recently developed lateral load resisting system. The discrete connections, being structural bolts on the column and beam {{in every corner of}} the steel frame and confining the precast concrete <b>infill</b> <b>panel</b> within the steel frame, have a large influence on the global structural behaviour. They are loaded in compressive force and designed for ‘bolt failure’ by shearing of the bolt through the nut. Mechanisms that influence the connection behaviour include indentation of steel plates under compression produced by bolts, bolt deformation and flange bending. These mechanisms act in series. Experimental tests were performed on components of the steel-concrete connection to establish the stiffness and failure load of the several mechanisms. A FE model was developed for the component ‘flange bending’ of the connection, taking non-linear material properties and geometrical non-linearity into account. A comparison between the experiments and FE model shows that the FE model enables to simulate the connection component behaviour. The validated FE model was used to carry out a parametrical study.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the research project {{was to determine the}} transverse (out-of-plane) seismic strength of unreinforced masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> that have been cracked with in-plane lateral forces. The goal of the research was to develop a simple method that practicing engineers could use for evaluating strength of <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> that have been damaged in earthquakes. In addition, the feasibility of using a low-cost repair or rehabilitation technique for improving transverse strength was examined. A total of 22 tests were run on eight large-scale masonry <b>infill</b> <b>panels</b> that were constructed in a single bay, single story reinforced concrete frame. Test panels were first subjected to in-plane load reversals to create a pre-existing cracked, damaged state for the subsequent out-of-plane tests which were done with an air bag. Following this test sequence, selected damaged panels were repaired and retested. Previous in-plane cracking was found to reduce out-of-plane strength by as much as a factor of two. However, transverse strength of a cracked masonry infill was found to be appreciable because of arching action. A simple equation was developed for out-of-plane strength based on the masonry compressive strength, the hit ratio, the amount of in-plane damage and the stiffness of the bounding frame. An evaluation procedure was developed based on this procedure. National Science Foundation Grants BCS 90 - 16875 and BCS 90 - 1650...|$|R
