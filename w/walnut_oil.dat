500|$|The frescoes on {{the ceiling}} of the Sistine Chapel had a number of {{interventions}} prior to the restoration process which was started in 1980. Initial problems with the ceiling appear to have been caused by water penetrating through the floor above. In about 1547 Paolo Giovio wrote that the ceiling was being damaged by saltpetre and cracks. The effect of saltpetre is to leave a white efflorescence. [...] Gianluigi Colalucci, Head Restorer at the Laboratory for the Restoration of Paintings for Papal Monuments, Museums and Galleries, states in his essay Michelangelo's colours rediscovered, that the early conservators treated this cosmetically by an application of linseed or <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> which had the effect of making the crystalline deposit more transparent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{nuts are}} rich in oil, and are widely eaten both fresh and in cookery. <b>Walnut</b> <b>oil</b> is {{expensive}} and consequently is used sparingly; most often in salad dressings.

2500|$|Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei {{yield the}} throne {{to him in}} 550, ending Eastern Wei and {{establishing}} Northern Qi. As Emperor Wenxuan, he remembered Zu Ting's talent and recalled him to serve in his administration, putting him in charge of drafting edicts. [...] However, he eventually again removed Zu from office for embezzlement. [...] Whenever he saw Zu, he often referred to him as [...] "the thief," [...] for which Zu bore a grudge. It was probably during Emperor Wenxuan's reign when Zu first befriended Emperor Wenxuan's younger brother Gao Zhan, the Prince of Changguang, as one of Zu's talents was making <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> for paintings, and he once offered <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> to Gao Zhan. [...] When he did so, he commented, [...] "According to fortunetelling principles, Your Royal Highness' bone structure shows great honor. [...] I have once dreamed that you rode a dragon to heaven." [...] Gao Zhan responded, [...] "If that happened, I will make you, my brother, rich and powerful." ...|$|E

2500|$|The cuisine of {{southern}} France, corresponding roughly {{to the extent}} of Occitania, had far more in common with Italian and Spanish cooking than with northern French cuisine. Ingredients that distinguished southern cooking included sugar, <b>walnut</b> <b>oil,</b> chickpeas, pomegranates and lemons, all of which were grown locally. While pomegranate seeds were occasionally used to decorate dishes in France and England, flavoring dishes with pomegranate juice was a practice unique to the Occitan areas. [...] The use of butter and lard was rare, salted meat for frying was common, and the preferred methods of cooking tended to be dry roasting, frying, or baking. For the latter, a trapa, a portable oven that was filled with food and buried in hot ashes, was often used.|$|E
2500|$|Dishes still common today, like escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, and aillade (aioli), a garlic sauce (still made in Toulouse with <b>walnut</b> <b>oil),</b> were {{well-established}} in the Late Middle Ages. Evidence {{of influence}} from Muslim Spain {{can be found}} in recipes for matafeam, a Christian version of the originally Hispano-Jewish Shabbat stew adafina, but with pork rather than lamb. [...] And, Raymonia (Occitan; Ital: Romania) is based on the Arabic Rummaniya, a chicken bruet with pomegranate juice, ground almonds, and sugar. [...] Only one recipe collection is positively identified as being from southern France. [...] The Modus viaticorum preparandorum et salsarum is a collection of 51 recipes. It was written ca. 1380-90 in Latin with occasional words in Occitan. [...] The Modus contains a Salsa de cerpol (Wild thyme sauce) and a Cofiment anguille (Confit of eel), which appear nowhere else but in Occitania.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition (total oil content, fatty acids, triacylglycerols (TAGs) and polar compounds) of six walnuts (Juglans regia L.) cultivars (Lauzeronne, Franquette, Hartley, Local pt, Local gd and Parisienne) collected from Mateur (north of Tunisia) was evaluated. The major fatty acids {{found in the}} <b>walnut</b> <b>oils</b> are linoleic acid (60. 42 - 65. 77 %), oleic acid (13. 21 - 19. 94 %) and linolenic acid (7. 61 - 13 %). The TAG species were mainly composed of trilinolein (LLL), dilinoleoyl-linolenoyl-glycerol, dilinoleoyl-oleoyl-glycerol and palmitoyl-dilinoleoyl-glycerol classes. The results revealed that Local pt variety has {{the highest level of}} oil (62. 56 %), linoleic acid (65. 77 %) and LLL (33. 48 %). Significant differences among oil samples were observed, therefore showing a great variability in the oil composition among cultivars.

40|$|The {{development}} of local forest products is hampered by insufficient knowledge about their potential and inadequate assessments of {{their impact on}} the national economy. Furthermore, lack of knowledge on the availability of agroforestry tree products (AFTPs) in their biotope prevents effective planning for sustainable management of non-timber forests products (NTFPs) to contribute to poverty reduction. A survey conducted in the Mbam-Inoubou region in central Cameroon shows the significant agroforestry potential of African walnut, Tetracarpidium conophorum, a vine considered as an important associated species in cacao agroforests. The survey results indicate that this vine is fairly abundant in agroforests and commonly planted and used, and could therefore be included in the processing chain to improve household incomes at local, national and even regional levels. The surveys conducted for the study show that sales of products from this liana species can earn creditable incomes. Given this finding, an effort should be made by the different players concerned to improve the distribution of these products by supplying as much information as possible. Doing so would ensure the promotion of African <b>walnuts,</b> <b>oil</b> extract and other new products by bringing them into the national and international marketing system.

5000|$|<b>Walnut</b> <b>oil</b> is edible and is {{generally}} used less than other oils in food preparation, often {{due to high}} pricing. It is light-coloured and delicate in flavour and scent, with a nutty quality. [...] Although chefs sometimes use <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> for pan frying, most avoid <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> for high temperature cooking because heating tends to reduce the oil's flavour and produce a slight bitterness. <b>Walnut</b> <b>oil</b> is preferred in cold dishes such as salad dressings.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> commercially available: cold pressed and refined. Cold pressed <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> is {{typically}} more expensive due to the loss of a higher percentage of the oil. Refined <b>walnut</b> <b>oil</b> is expeller pressed and saturated with solvent to extract the highest percentage of oil available in the nut meat. The solvents are subsequently eliminated by heating the mixture to around 400 F. Both methods produce food grade culinary oils. <b>Walnut</b> <b>oil,</b> like all nut, seed and vegetable oils will undergo rancidification accelerated by heat, light, and oxygen.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern for}} consumed fat by western populations {{has raised the}} question of the level and the quality of fat intake, especially the composition of fatty acids (FA) and their impact on human health. As a consequence, consumers and nutritionists have requested updated publications on FA composition of food containing fat. In the present study, fourteen different kinds of edible oils (rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, argan, groundnut, grape seed, sesame, sunflower, walnut and organic walnut, avocado, wheat germ, and two combined oils) were analysed for FA determination using a BPX- 70 60 m highly polar GC column. Oils were classified according to the classification of Dubois et al. (2007, 2008). Monounsaturated FA (MUFA) group oils, including rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, and avocado oils, contained mainly oleic acid (OA). Groundnut and argan oils, also rich in MUFA, showed in addition high linoleic acid (LA) contents. In the polyunsaturated (PUFA) group, grape seed oil presented the highest LA content while sunflower, sesame, and wheat germ oils showed noticeable MUFA amounts in addition to high PUFA contents. <b>Walnut</b> <b>oils,</b> also rich in LA, showed the highest linolenic acid (ALA) content. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of each oil was calculated. Trans-FA (TFA) was also detected and quantified. Results were compared with the data published during the past decade, and the slight discrepancies were attributed to differences in origin and variety of seed-cultivars, and in seed and oil processes...|$|R

50|$|In the Balkans, it {{is a cold}} soup (or {{a liquid}} salad), popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, <b>walnut,</b> dill, {{vegetable}} <b>oil,</b> and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add bread. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with lettuce or carrots.|$|R
50|$|In the {{inflammatory}} response, {{two other}} groups of dietary essential fatty acids form cascades that parallel and compete with the arachidonic acid cascade. EPA (20:5 &omega;-3) provides the most important competing cascade. It is ingested from oily fish, and algae oil or derived from dietary alpha-linolenic acid found in, for instance, <b>walnuts,</b> hemp <b>oil</b> and flax oil. DGLA (20:3 &omega;-6) provides a third, less prominent cascade. It derives from dietary GLA (18:3 &omega;-6) found in, e.g. borage oil. These two parallel cascades soften the inflammatory promoting effects of certain eicosanoids made from AA. Low dietary intake of these less inflammatory promoting essential fatty acids, especially the ω-3s, is correlated {{with a variety of}} inflammation-related diseases.|$|R

40|$|Abstract There {{are many}} synergies between {{a diet that}} is healthy for the heart {{and one that is}} healthy for the planet, but there may also be tensions. We {{examined}} the Barilla Cen-ter for Food and Nutrition’s double pyramid to describe the carbon, water, and ecological footprints of the components of a cardio-protective diet. Overall, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains all tend to have low carbon and water footprints, while nuts and olive oil have relatively higher water footprints and fish have a high ecological footprint. In order to increase the sustainability of a cardio-protective diet, consumers can choose nuts (e. g., <b>walnuts)</b> and <b>oils</b> (e. g., sunflower) with lower water footprints and sustainably produced fish. Howev-er, in order to increase consumption of these foods, parallel efforts should be implemented targeting consumer knowledge and incentives to make these foods more affordable...|$|R
