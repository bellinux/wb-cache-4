5|$|Both Britain and France claimed {{victory in}} the battle: Britain by virtue of {{capturing}} or sinking seven French ships without losing any of her own and remaining {{in control of the}} battle site; France because the vital convoy had passed through the Atlantic unharmed and arrived in France without significant loss. The two fleets were showered by their respective nations with both praise and criticism – the latter particularly directed at those captains not felt to have contributed significantly to the fighting. The British fleet in Spithead <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> a Royal visit by King George III and the entire royal household.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, the talkies were a global phenomenon. In the United States, they helped secure Hollywood's {{position}} {{as one of}} the world's most powerful cultural/commercial centers of influence (see Cinema of the United States). In Europe (and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere), the new development <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> suspicion by many filmmakers and critics, who worried that a focus on dialogue would subvert the unique aesthetic virtues of soundless cinema. In Japan, where the popular film tradition integrated silent movie and live vocal performance, talking pictures were slow to take root. In India, sound was the transformative element that led to the rapid expansion of the nation's film industry.|$|E
5|$|Disney {{had been}} a heavy smoker since World WarI. He did not use {{cigarettes}} with filters, and had smoked a pipe as a young man. In November 1966, {{he was diagnosed with}} lung cancer and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> cobalt therapy. On November 30 he felt unwell and was taken to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer. Disney's remains were cremated two days later, and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E

5|$|Harrison {{developed}} {{what was}} thought to be influenza (then referred to as grippe) in February 1901. He <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> steam vapor inhalation and oxygen, but his condition worsened. He died from pneumonia at his home in Indianapolis on Wednesday, March 13, 1901, at the age of 67. Harrison's remains are interred in Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery, next to the remains of his first wife, Caroline. After her death in 1948, Mary Dimmick Harrison, his second wife, was buried beside him.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012 Clinton {{was hospitalized}} {{for a few}} days for {{treatment}} of a blood clot in her right transverse venous sinus. Her doctors had discovered the clot during a follow-up examination for a concussion she had sustained when she fainted and fell nearly three weeks earlier, as a result of severe dehydration from a viral intestinal ailment acquired during a trip to Europe. The clot, which caused no immediate neurological injury, <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> anticoagulant medication and her doctors have said she has made a full recovery.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the Tydings–Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now {{regarded as one of}} the most powerful men in the Senate and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> new-found deference by his colleagues.|$|E
5|$|Lacks <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> radium {{tube inserts}} as an {{inpatient}} and discharged {{a few days}} later with instructions to return for X-ray treatments as a follow-up. During her treatments, two samples were taken from Lacks's cervix without her permission or knowledge; one sample was of healthy tissue and the other was cancerous. These samples were given to George Otto Gey, a physician and cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. The cells from the cancerous sample eventually became known as the HeLa immortal cell line, a commonly used cell line in contemporary biomedical research.|$|E
5|$|The Centre's main feature, {{the bronze}} {{coloured}} dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> copper oxide. It {{was designed to}} withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions.|$|E

5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to {{taxidermist}} Sergio Vigilato {{to preserve}} the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic, although a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions and never interposed {{with her own}} views in public. She remained silent {{on the topic of}} his suspected extra-marital relationships—including a liaison with her daughters' governess. In turn, she <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> unfailing respect and her position at Court and home was always secure. Of the four children Teresa Cristina bore him, two boys died in infancy and a daughter of typhoid fever at the early age of 24.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of his stronghold in Kediri, Trunajaya managed to escape to the {{mountains}} of eastern Java. VOC and the king's forces chased Trunajaya, who, isolated and deprived of food, surrendered to the VOC {{at the end of}} 1679. Initially, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> respect as a captive of the VOC commander. However, during a ceremonial visit to the royal residence in Payak, East Java, on 2 January 1680, he was personally stabbed by Amangkurat, and the king's courtiers finished him off. The king defended this killing of a VOC prisoner by saying that Trunajaya had tried to kill him. The VOC was not convinced by this explanation, but it chose not to call the king into account. A romanticised account of Trunajaya's death appears in the 18th-century Central Javanese babads.|$|E
50|$|Cold {{agglutinin}} disease <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> {{avoidance of}} cold exposure.

5|$|After {{the return}} of Alsace to French rule in 1918, the new {{director}} of the Musée des beaux-arts and the Musée des arts décoratifs, Hans Haug (1890–1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again. Strasbourg suffered during World War II, and on 11August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs. After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken {{under the supervision of}} the architects Robert Danis (1879–1949) and Bertrand Monnet (1910–1989), but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because of the destruction inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> welding torches, and poor handling of these caused the fire.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{travelled}} from Baghdad to Constantinople between 3 May and 17 August 1863, {{accompanied by}} a large group including family members and followers. During the trip, he <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> respect in the towns he visited, and when he reached Constantinople, he {{was treated as a}} government guest. Why the Ottoman authorities did not permit his extradition to Persia, but instead invited him to come to Constantinople, is unclear. The reason may have been political because Bahá'u'lláh was viewed as a person of influence. After three and a half months in Constantinople, he was ordered to depart for Adrianople. The reason for this further move is also unclear. It may have been due to pressure from the Persian ambassador, combined with Bahá'u'lláh's refusal to work with the Ottoman authorities.|$|E
5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 students a year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
50|$|Victor Meyer {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} determining the types of alcohol i.e. (primary, secondary or tertiary). In this method the sample alcohol <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> PI3 to get the iodoalkane which <b>is</b> again <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> AgNO2 to get the nitroalkane. The nitroalkane <b>is</b> then <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> nitrous acid which is obtained by NaNO2 and HCl. The resulting solution <b>is</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> KOH and the colour is observed. The red, blue and no colour indicates the primary, secondary and tertiary alcohol respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Prognosis and {{treatment}} {{depends on the}} specific type of lymphoma {{as well as the}} stage and grade. Treatment includes radiation and chemotherapy.

Bacterial infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antibacterials (often called antibiotics) whereas fungal and viral infections <b>are</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> antifungals and antivirals respectively.

5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Jenner {{developed}} Parkinson's {{disease and}} therefore retired from IBM. With money that Jessie had inherited, the couple moved to Bexley in 1953, where they began attending Bexley Gospel Hall. Towards {{the end of}} his life, Jenner developed dementia and his narcolepsy worsened. For six months, he was confined to a bed and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> amphetamine. He was then diagnosed with colorectal cancer and spent a subsequent ten days at Calvary Hospital, Kogarah, New South Wales, where he died at 11:45pm on 8 May 1977 at the age of 73. Because he had befriended so many police officers towards {{the end of his}} life, his body was given a police escort to the burial, which took place at Woronora Lawn Cemetery. His wife died two years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1344, Baligh, whose {{supporters}} and kinsmen served as Ahmad's well-spring of support, defected to the sultan's army. The local defectors informed besieging Mamluks of a vulnerability in al-Karak's defenses. With this intelligence, on 4 July, the Mamluks, {{under the command of}} Emir Sanjar al-Jawli, entered the fortress and captured an-Nasir Ahmad, who had been wounded and <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> respect by his captors. Still suspicious of his Egyptian captors, he refused to eat meals provided by them, only agreeing to eat food handled by his al-Karak partisans. He was sent to Cairo, where as-Salih Isma'il secretly ordered to have him decapitated by a mercenary on 16 July. An-Nasir Ahmad's head was brought to the Cairo Citadel where it was displayed.
