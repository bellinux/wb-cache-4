5|$|The {{story was}} {{told in the}} form of a letter from a wife and mother to her husband. The writer, Hester Hyman, had written the letter to explain <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> decided to {{sacrifice}} her life for the cause of democracy. While the text of the letter was shown in captions, the pictures first illustrated events described in the early part of the letter, and then showed the circumstances of her death at the hands of a squad of judges led by Judge Dredd.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with her pace at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary reason}} Wood gave for {{changing}} her findings was her {{realization that the}} microscopic slides of the popliteal vein and the photographs of muscle tissue in the surrounding area provided evidence of trauma which could explain the thrombus formation.

25|$|Gay {{rights advocates}} criticized her for waiting {{until after the}} 2004 {{election}} to voice her disapproval of the Bush administration's positions on gay rights. During another appearance by Cheney on May 19, 2006, on the Late Show with David Letterman, Letterman brought {{up some of the}} issues raised by the gay community. He asked Cheney <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> waited two years after the 2004 election to speak publicly about gay marriage and rights, and asked whether she had any input with the Bush administration regarding gay issues. Cheney responded that she did not, and that it had not been her job to do so.|$|E
25|$|While at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz {{represented}} Pfizer in {{a lawsuit}} brought {{by a group of}} public hospitals and community health centers who accused the drug manufacturer of overcharging. The Supreme Court eventually threw the case out. Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law was <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired thirty days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won on a second appeal using the same argument.|$|E
25|$|Cinderella, {{returning}} from {{the last night of}} the festival, describes how the Prince had spread pitch on the stairs to prevent her from escaping. Caught between wanting to escape and wanting to stay, she eventually resolves to let the Prince decide, leaving him one of her slippers as a clue to her identity ("On the Steps of the Palace"). The Baker's Wife frantically tries to convince her to give up her other shoe, offering her the sixth magic bean in exchange for it. Cinderella throws the bean aside, but trades shoes with the Baker's Wife and flees, while unbeknownst to anyone a second beanstalk starts to grow. The Baker arrives with another cow; they now have all four items. The Prince's Steward grabs the slipper from the Baker's Wife, and they are fighting over it when a great crash is heard and Jack's mother runs in to report that a Giant seeking revenge from Jack for stealing his magic harp has fallen from the first beanstalk when Jack chopped it and is dead in her backyard. The Prince, more concerned with finding Cinderella, waves her off and departs with one of the slippers, giving the other to the Baker and his wife. Jack, to the relief of his mother, returns with the magic harp. The Witch discovers that the new cow is not pure white; it is covered with flour. However, the Witch is able to bring Milky White back to life and instructs the Baker and his Wife to feed the items to her. Jack tries to milk her, but no milk comes. The Baker's Wife admits that the hair is Rapunzel's, and the Witch furiously explains that the magic will not work because the Witch has already touched Rapunzel's hair, which is also <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> asked the Baker and his Wife to get the objects for her: she's not allowed to touch any of the objects. The Mysterious Man tells the Baker to feed the hair-like corn silk to the cow. Now Milky White gives milk which is the potion. The Witch reveals that the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father. The Witch drinks the potion, and suddenly the Mysterious Man falls dead, his reparation complete, the curse is broken, and the Witch is transformed into a beautiful young woman, reversing the effects of the curse of ugliness by which she was punished by her mother, because the Baker's father stole the beans from her, regaining her youth and beauty.|$|E

500|$|Although Wollstonecraft {{appears as}} only a tourist in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, during her travels she was {{actually}} conducting delicate business negotiations on behalf of Imlay. For almost two hundred years, it was unclear <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> travelled to Scandinavia, but in the 1980s historian Per Nyström uncovered documents in local Swedish and Norwegian archives that {{shed light on the}} purpose of her trip. He revealed that Wollstonecraft was searching for a ship and cargo that had been stolen from Imlay. Imlay had authorized her to conduct his business dealings, referring to her in legal documents as [...] "Mrs. Mary Imlay, my best friend and wife", although the two were not married.|$|E
500|$|Minnie began {{painting}} in late 1999 or 2000, {{when she was}} almost 80. When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not begun earlier (painting and batik works had been created at Utopia for over 20years), her daughter Barbara Weir reported Minnie's answer as being that [...] "no-one had asked her". By the 2000s, she was reported as living at Alparra, the largest of Utopia's communities, or at Urultja (also Irrultja, again in the Sandover region). Sprightly and outgoing, even in her eighties she could outrun younger women chasing goannas for bushfood, and she continued to create art works until two days before her death on 18 March 2006. She was outlived by all her sisters except Maggie Pwerle, mother of artists Gloria and Kathleen Petyarre (or Pitjara).|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{appeared}} {{in a number of}} plays with a summer stock company in Ivoryton, Connecticut, and she proved to be a hit. During the summer of 1931, Philip Barry asked her to appear in his new play, The Animal Kingdom, alongside Leslie Howard. They began rehearsals in November, Hepburn feeling sure the role would make her a star, but Howard disliked the actress and again she was fired. When she asked Barry <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been let go, he responded, [...] "Well, to be brutally frank, you weren't very good." [...] This unsettled the self-assured Hepburn, but she continued to look for work. She took a small role in an upcoming play, but as rehearsals began she was asked to read for the lead in the Greek fable The Warrior's Husband.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{producers}} of House, Stacy was brought into the show to give viewers some insight into House. The writers chose to start off Stacy's story arc [...] "very subtly", but to end it with a [...] "big blowout". Shore explained that he wanted Ward for the part {{because it was the}} first person the writing staff of House came up with, adding that she acts in a [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "convincing way". Initially, Ward was not interested in portraying the character, because, after the cancellation of Once and Again, she wanted to spend more time with her kids, which is <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also turned down earlier roles on [...] and Desperate Housewives. However, she changed her mind when she saw tapes of the show, because as she watched she realized that House [...] "would be fun to be a part of".|$|E
500|$|Hepburn stayed active {{throughout}} the 1970s, focusing on roles described by Andrew Britton as [...] "either a devouring mother or a batty old lady living [...] ". First she traveled to Spain to film {{a version of}} Euripides' The Trojan Women (1971) alongside Vanessa Redgrave. When asked <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> taken the role, she responded {{that she wanted to}} broaden her range and try everything while she still had time. The movie was poorly received, but the Kansas City Film Critics Circle named Hepburn's performance the best from an actress that year. In 1971 she signed on to star in an adaptation of Graham Greene's Travels with My Aunt, but was unhappy with early versions of the script and took to rewriting it herself. The studio disliked her changes, so Hepburn abandoned the project and was replaced with Maggie Smith. Her next film, an adaptation of Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance (1973) directed by Tony Richardson, had a small release and received generally unfavorable reviews.|$|E

Frank Rich of The New York Times referred to Streep as the [...] "one wonder" [...] of the production, but questioned <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> devoted so much energy to it. By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured {{on the cover of}} Newsweek magazine with the headline [...] "A Star for the 80s", with Jack Kroll commenting, [...] "There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior". Streep denounced the fervent media coverage of her at this time as [...] "excessive hype".|$|E

However, Selena did not want to end their friendship; she felt Saldívar was essential to the success of her clothing line in Mexico. Selena also wanted to keep Saldívar close because she had bank records, statements, and financial records necessary for tax purposes.|$|E

Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast.
