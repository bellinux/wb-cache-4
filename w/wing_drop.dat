5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} <b>wing</b> <b>drop,</b> often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a <b>wing</b> <b>drop,</b> which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all regimes are well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a reinforced plastic skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E
2500|$|Extensive stall [...] {{and spin}} testing {{was carried out}} at Wizard Lake on 28 December 1982. Straight-ahead and turning power off stalls {{resulted}} in a stable mush condition. Power-on stalls from 30 degrees nose up resulted in a +15 degree nose up stable mush, with no <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> tendency.

60|$|The sudden {{appearance}} overhead of this hawk {{produces an}} effect wonderful to witness. I have frequently seen all {{the inhabitants of}} a marsh struck with panic, acting as if demented, and suddenly grown careless to all other dangers; and on such occasions I have looked up confident of seeing the sharp-winged death, suspended above them in the sky. All birds that happen {{to be on the}} <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> down as if shot into the reeds or water; ducks away from the margin stretch out their necks horizontally and drag their bodies, as if wounded, into closer cover; not one bird is found bold enough to rise up and wheel about the marauder--a usual proceeding in the case of other hawks; while, at every sudden stoop the falcon makes, threatening to dash down on his prey, a low cry of terror rises from the birds beneath; a sound expressive of an emotion so contagious that it quickly runs like a murmur all over the marsh, as if a gust of wind had swept moaning through, the rushes. As long as the falcon hangs overhead, always at a height of about forty yards, threatening at intervals to dash down, this murmuring sound, made up of many hundreds of individual cries, is heard swelling and dying away, and occasionally, when he drops lower than usual, rising to a sharp scream of terror.|$|E

50|$|Other {{experimental}} aircraft {{included the}} Russian Bereznyak-Isayev BI-1 that flew in 1942 while the Northrop XP-79 was originally planned with rocket engines but switched to jet engines {{for its first}} and only flight in 1945. A rocket assisted P-51D Mustang was developed by North American Aviation that could attain 515 mph. The engine ran on fumaric acid and aniline which was stored in two 75 gallon under <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> tanks. The plane was tested in flight in April 1945. The rocket engine could run for about a minute.|$|E
50|$|Wingtip stall is {{unlikely}} to occur symmetrically, especially if the aircraft is maneuvering. As an aircraft turns, the wing tip {{on the inside of}} the turn is moving more slowly and is most likely to stall. As an aircraft rolls, the descending wing tip is at higher angle of attack and is most likely to stall. When one wing tip stalls it leads to <b>wing</b> <b>drop,</b> a rapid rolling motion. Also, roll control may be reduced if the airflow over the ailerons is disrupted by the stall, reducing their effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|Nicknamed “Fliegendes Ei” - “Flying Egg” the Mü5 Wastl was {{not very}} {{successful}} with a longest flight time of only 15s before the aircraft crashed due to the starboard <b>wing</b> <b>dropping</b> and contacting the ground, which had been a persistent problem in all flight attempts before the final hop.|$|R
25|$|It was snowing and the {{airfield}} at Croydon {{was covered in}} dark snow clouds when at 11:40 the Spencer Airways Dakota attempted to depart bound for Salisbury in Rhodesia.

As the aircraft reached the perimeter track of {{the airfield}}, the aircraft levelled and then swung to the right. The aircraft bounced on the ground and crashed head-on into a parked CSA Douglas C-47; both aircraft caught fire, and were subsequently destroyed.

5000|$|Three {{different}} types of data [...] "massaging" [...] are identified in the DOT&E report: moving failures from one category to another, less important one; ignoring repetitive failures, thus inflating numbers of failure-free hours; and improper scoring of reliability. Maintenance problems were determined to be so severe that the F-35 is only able to fly twice a week. To {{address the issue of}} <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> and buffet maneuvering, the required control law modifications will reduce the maneuverability of the F-35, [...] "only exacerbating the plane’s performance problems in this area". The F-35C's <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> problem is [...] "worse than other variants". Testing to investigate the impact of buffet and transonic roll-off (TRO or [...] "wing drop") on the helmet-mounted display and offensive and defensive maneuvering found that [...] "buffet affected display symbology, and would have the greatest impact in scenarios where a pilot was maneuvering to defeat a missile shot". Buffeting also degrades the gyroscopes in the inertial platforms which are essential for flight control, navigation, and weapons aiming. DOT&E explained that this was an ongoing issue: [...] "In heavy buffet conditions, which occur between 20 and 26 degrees angle of attack, faults occurred in the inertial measurement units (IMUs) in the aircraft that degraded the flight control system (two of three flight control channels become disabled), requiring a flight abort".|$|E
5000|$|Today, spin {{training}} {{is not required}} for private pilot certification; added to this, most training type aircraft are placarded [...] "intentional spins prohibited". Some model Cessna 172's are certified for spinning, although they {{can be difficult to}} actually get into a spin. Generally, though, spin {{training is}} undertaken in an [...] "Unusual attitude recovery course" [...] or as a part of an aerobatics endorsement (though not all countries actually require training for aerobatics). However, understanding and being able to recover from spins is certainly a skill that a fixed-wing pilot could learn for safety. It is routinely given as part of the training in sailplanes, since gliders often operate slowly enough to be in turning, near-stall conditions. Because of this, in the U.S. demonstration of spin entry and recovery is still expected of glider instructor certification. Also, before their initial certifications both airplane and glider instructors need a logbook endorsement of proficiency in spin training which, under Federal Aviation Regulations 61.183(i), may be given by another instructor. [...] In Canada, spins are a mandatory exercise to get the private and commercial pilot licenses; Canadian recreational pilot permit candidates (1 level below private pilot license) must do a stall and <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> (the very beginning of the entry to a spin) and must recover from a stall and <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> as part of training.|$|E
50|$|For safety, all certificated, {{single-engine}} fixed-wing aircraft, including certificated gliders, {{must meet}} specified criteria regarding stall and spin behavior. Complying designs typically have a wing with greater {{angle of attack}} at the wing root than at the wing tip, so that the wing root stalls first, reducing {{the severity of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> at the stall and possibly also allowing the ailerons to remain somewhat effective until the stall migrates outward toward the wing tip. One method of tailoring such stall behavior is known as washout. Some designers of recreational aircraft seek to develop an aircraft that is characteristically incapable of spinning, even in an uncoordinated stall.|$|E
2500|$|The danger {{first came}} to light in a near-crash during a 1962 test flight when de Havilland pilots Peter Bugge and Ron Clear were testing the Trident's {{stalling}} characteristics by pitching its nose progressively higher, thus reducing its airspeed. The Trident entered a deep stall after a critical angle of attack was reached. Eventually, it entered a flat spin, {{and appeared to be}} about to crash, but a <b>wing</b> <b>dropped</b> during the stall, and when corrected with rudder the other <b>wing</b> <b>dropped.</b> The aircraft continued rolling left and right until the nose pitched down and the crew were able to recover to normal flight. The incident resulted in the Trident being fitted with an automatic stall warning system known as a [...] "stick shaker", and a stall recovery system known as a [...] "stick pusher" [...] which automatically pitched the aircraft down to build up speed if the crew failed to respond to the warning.|$|R
5|$|The tufted tit-tyrant uses three {{different}} hunting strategies to catch its prey.

Exposed birds exhibited ataxia, <b>wing</b> <b>drop,</b> opisthotonos, immobility, hyperactivity, fluid-filled crops and intestines, and discolored livers. In a reproductive toxicity study with bobwhite quail, the NOAEC = 120 mg a.i./kg diet and the LOAEC = 240 mg a.i./kg diet. Eggshell thinning and decreased adult weight were observed at 240 mg a.i./kg diet.|$|E
50|$|After {{aborting}} the approach, Hultgreen selected full afterburner on {{the remaining}} engine, causing an even greater asymmetry. This, combined with a high angle of attack, caused an unrecoverable approach turn stall and rapid <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> to the left. The radar intercept officer (RIO) in the rear seat, Lieutenant Matthew Klemish, initiated ejection for himself and Hultgreen {{as soon as it}} was apparent that the aircraft was becoming uncontrollable. First in the automated ejection sequence, the RIO survived. However, by the time Hultgreen's seat fired 0.4 seconds later, the plane had exceeded 90 degrees of roll, and she was ejected downward into the water. She was killed instantly. The entire event unfolded in less than 20 seconds.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s the gliding {{movement}} in the UK did not receive the support from the government that was forthcoming in other European states. Fred Slingsby designed the Type 12 Gull to be relatively inexpensive and easy to fly {{in the hands of}} the inexperienced pilots in the UK. Slingsby had had a bad experience with the Type 9 King Kite entering incipient spins at low airspeed which was ascribed to the use of a NACA 4312 aerofoil section at the wing-tips, so he designed the Gull with a modified RAF 34 profile at the tips. The cause of the <b>wing</b> <b>drop</b> problem on the King Kite was later found to be inaccurate manufacture, but the Gull retained the modified RAF 34 section.|$|E

50|$|When {{breeding}} the scissor-tailed kite feeds {{mainly on}} skinks and other lizards, {{as well as}} small snakes, rodents and arthropods.

5000|$|With {{the full}} flight {{envelope}} now opened to {{an altitude of}} 50,000 ft, speeds of Mach 1.6/700 KCAS and loads of 9 g, test pilots also say improvements to the flight control system have rendered the transonic roll-off (TRO) issue tactically irrelevant.
