25|$|Many housing {{initiatives}} involve {{homeless people}} {{in the process of}} building and maintaining affordable shared housing. This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, which is located in downtown San Diego, CA. This community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters a sense of ownership as well as involvement {{in all parts of the}} decision-making process.|$|E

500|$|A {{second problem}} is the {{difficulty}} of comparisons across cultures. [...] "Comparisons across countries are currently hampered by differences in activity classification and nomenclature." [...] In-depth surveys {{may be the only}} way to get necessary information desired, but they make it difficult to perform cross-cultural comparisons. The lack of adequate universal terminology in discussing unpaid work is an example. [...] "Despite increasing recognition that domestic labor is work, existing vocabularies do not easily convey the new appreciations. People still tend to talk about <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> as if they were separate spheres. 'Working mothers' are usually assumed to be in the paid labor force, despite feminist assertions that 'every mother is a working mother.' There are no readily accepted terms to express different work activities or job titles. Housewife, home manager, homemaker are all problematic and none of them conveys the sense of a women who juggles both domestic labor and paid employment." ...|$|E
500|$|The double {{burden is}} usually {{view as a}} primary problem for single women or married women. However, it is often less {{recognized}} that men can and often do {{go through the same}} trials and hard times as a parent trying to balance work and the family. Within the book The Canadian Family in Crisis, Conway addresses this issue with an argument from Eichler. Eichler says, [...] "Social science fails to understand men" [...] by tending [...] "to downplay or ignore a potential conflict between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> for men." [...] Married men can avoid the full impact of the double burden, but single fathers are totally incapable of avoiding the double burden of family and work. Though single fathers face the same number of problems that single mothers face, they have two advantages that play in their favor. Men usually have a higher income and have a shorter time of being single than women. However, until they are remarried or have a woman to help them out around the house, men still must deal with the sexual and emotional frustration as a woman does. They must deal with the balancing of work, childcare, and domestic responsibilities. Single fathers are usually doubtful about their ability be a parent, and they are challenged psychologically. [...] "The problems faced by the working single father are more than merely the logistical problems shared by all working parents. He has to change the way he feels about himself as man." [...] A man being a single parent and feelings the effects of the double burden can and will interfere with his career just as it does with a single mother that has a career. A study showed that five percent of single fathers were fired form their jobs due to the double burden and another eight percent quit because the double burden became too much of a burden for them to balance both work and the family. With that being said, single fathers feel the same, if not more, of the effect of the double burden as women do.|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{study on}} spirituality and {{performance}} in organizations, the increase in corporate meditation programs can also be linked to a complex paradigm shift in the structure and system of organizations. The changes in management include a shift from an economic focus to a balance of profits, quality of life, spirituality and social responsibility concerns. For the past 300 years, the mechanical paradigm shaped the economy where the main corporate objectives were to satisfy shareholders by increasing competition and exploitation. The new emerging business paradigm is called the [...] "Spiritual Movement" [...] and moves away from a materialistic to a more spiritual orientation. In this new paradigm, a company's competitive advantage resides in how much it invests in its human capital and the qualities of its employees. The shift in business paradigm's {{can be explained by}} the fact that the business world is more competitive, globalized and fast-pace than ever. The boundaries between <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>home</b> are blurred, where work has become central to people's lives and employees can be connected to their work whenever. The increase in the importance of work has led to an increase in stress and burnout. The workplace is a place where employees spend most of their lives, develop friendships, create value and make meaningful contributions to society. This means that they are looking for satisfaction beyond work. According to a report on emerging cultures, the shift in paradigm can also be explained by American demographics. [...] "The American adult population is divided into three groups, each with a different set of values and view of the world." [...] The [...] "Cultural Creatives," [...] whom constitute 24% of US adults are the newest and increasingly growing worldview. [...] "Their values align with ecological sustainability, globalism, women's issues, social conscience, self-actualization and spirituality". They reflect a major change that has been growing in American culture.|$|E

In the afternoon we walked back together also; and when I was tired and my back ached--just as if some one had cut a piece out of it, I felt--he would put his arm round me, for he always knew, and oh, how strong and restful it was to lean against, so that one walked as in an easy-chair.|$|E
