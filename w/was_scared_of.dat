25|$|Jackson {{was said}} to have used propofol, as well as {{alprazolam}} (an antianxiety agent), and sertraline (an antidepressant). Other drugs named in connection with him included omeprazole, hydrocodone, paroxetine, carisoprodol, and hydromorphone. After his death, police found several drugs in his home, which included propofol. Some of these drugs had labels made out to Jackson under pseudonyms, while others were unlabeled. A 2004 police document prepared for the 2005 People v. Jackson child abuse trial alleged that Jackson was taking up to 40 alprazolam pills a night. Alprazolam was not found in his bloodstream at his time of death. Dr. A.J. Farshchian, Michael Jackson's friend and confidante, has claimed that Jackson <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> drugs.|$|E
25|$|Juan de Oñate {{intended}} on colonizing New Mexico {{starting from}} 1595. (He formally held the area by April 1598.) The Acoma warrior Zutacapan {{heard of this}} plan and warned the mesa and organized a defense. However, a pueblo elder Chumpo dissuaded war partly to prevent deaths and partly based on Zutancalpo's (Zutacapan's son) mentioning of the widespread belief that the Spaniards were immortal. Thus, when Oñate visited on October 27, 1598, Acoma met him peacefully with no resistance to Oñate's demand of surrender and obedience reported. Oñate demonstrated his military power by firing a gun salute. Zutacapan offered to meet Oñate formally in the religious kiva, which is traditionally used as the place to make sacred oaths and pledges. However, Oñate <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> death and in suspicious ignorance of Acoma customs refused to enter via ladder from the roof into the dark kiva chambers. Purguapo was another Acoma man out of four chosen for Spaniard negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Vargas {{claimed that}} this would be the last fight of his career {{regardless}} of the result. He warned Mayorga that he would not tolerate any insults from him like the ones he hurled at Oscar De La Hoya in their press conferences. Vargas stayed true to his promise when at the first official press conference for the fight, Mayorga said some offensive things towards Vargas and attempted to slap him. Vargas immediately jumped up from his seat and retaliated with punches and a brawl broke out between the two fighters' camps, though order was quickly restored. Vargas also recalled the time when Mayorga said Vargas <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> him when he had defeated Javier Castillejo, then was stripped of his WBC light middleweight title rather than face Mayorga, who then defeated Michele Piccirillo for the vacant title. Ultimately the contestants faced off, and Mayorga defeated Vargas by majority decision on November 23, 2007. The scores were 113-113, 114-112, and 115-111. Crucially, Vargas was knocked down in the 1st round and again in the 11th round. Post-fight Ricardo Mayorga apologized to Vargas and the two forgave each other. Vargas officially declared his retirement soon after.|$|E

500|$|When Bogdanovich was to direct, he {{intended}} to cast Cybill Shepherd, his then girlfriend, {{in the role of}} Carol. As soon as Peckinpah came on to direct, he wanted to cast Stella Stevens with whom he had worked on The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970), with Angie Dickinson and Dyan Cannon as possible alternatives. Foster suggested Ali MacGraw, a much in-demand actress after the commercial success of Love Story (1970). She was married to Robert Evans, who wanted her to avoid being typecast in preppy roles, and set up a meeting for her with Foster, McQueen, and Peckinpah about the film. According to Foster, she <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> McQueen and Peckinpah because they had reputations as [...] "wild, two-fisted, beer guzzlers". McQueen and MacGraw experienced a strong instant attraction.

The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> it.

500|$|In the episode, Homer {{builds a}} scary clown-shaped bed for Bart. The scene was {{inspired}} by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because {{the length of the}} final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, [...] "Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!" [...] after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered [...] "coarse", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.|$|E

During a yoga session, Naomi and Brennan flirted heavily and eventually shared a kiss. Naomi tried to take the relationship slowly as she <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> being hurt. Naomi and Brennan later declared themselves an official couple, despite Naomi's insecurities. When Naomi saw Brennan exchange glances with his ex-girlfriend Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), she became anxious about her relationship and questioned Brennan as to who he wanted to be with – her or Paige.

Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

500|$|Newell was {{the person}} to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was {{probably}} over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas {{and told him that}} if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of Sports Illustrated (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills.

500|$|On 5 March 2009, Winehouse {{was arrested}} and charged with common assault {{following}} a claim by Sharene Flash that Winehouse hit her in the eye at the September 2008 Prince's Trust charity ball. Winehouse's spokesperson announced the cancellation of the singer's US Coachella Festival appearance in light of the new legal issue, and Winehouse appeared in court on 17 March to enter her plea of not guilty. On 23 July, her trial began with prosecutor Lyall Thompson charging that Winehouse acted with [...] "deliberate and unjustifiable violence" [...] while appearing to be under the influence of alcohol or another substance. She testified that she did not punch Flash, but tried to push her away because she <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> her; she cited her worry that Flash would sell her story to a tabloid, Flash's height advantage, and Flash's [...] "rude" [...] behaviour. On 24 July, District Judge Timothy Workman ruled that Winehouse was not guilty, citing the facts that all but two of the witnesses were intoxicated at the time of the incident and that medical evidence did not show [...] "the sort of injury that often occurs when there is a forceful punch to the eye." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{next film}} roles, in 1998, were Kissing a Fool, Six Days, Seven Nights, and Apt Pupil. In Kissing a Fool, a romantic comedy, Schwimmer played Max, a dapper, smart-mouthed ladies' man. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Fans of the sitcom Friends may be {{surprised}} by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool. [...] Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions: He does just fine. As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool, he oozes the command and self-satisfaction of a young, successful man". The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. In Six Days, Seven Nights, he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche's character. In Apt Pupil, adapted from a novella {{of the same name}} by Stephen King, he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> the part", Schwimmer said, [...] "but I {{wanted to be part of}} the movie". At the time, he noted it was a [...] "little frustrating" [...] that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends.

500|$|The entire {{episode was}} shot in Cardiff, in November 2004. The weather changed {{frequently}} during filming, and the cast began to fall ill; Eccleston had a cold. The production team selected several streets that looked similar. Most of the streets were {{in the community of}} Grangetown. The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets; only a few satellite dishes were taken down. The church is St Paul's Church, also in Grangetown. The set of the Tyler's flat was redressed for the time period. For the 1980s style, members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the '80s; for example, peach dresses and [...] "big hair" [...] were incorporated, but these elements were not meant to be distracting. Camille Coduri, who played Jackie, wore a wig for this episode. Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too [...] "bouncy". Piper <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> holding the baby. Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode, but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant, an [...] "artificial baby" [...] was used as a placeholder in some scenes.|$|E
500|$|Capper, {{described}} as [...] "a gentle and easily influenced girl," [...] had been babysitting for Jean Powell {{since she was}} ten years old. In 1990 she had spent time {{in the care of}} the local authority after her mother, Elizabeth Capper, and her stepfather separated, after which Suzanne and her older sister Michelle stayed with their stepfather. Around this time Capper began to truant from Moston Brook High School, and her attendance during the final two years of schooling was {{described as}} [...] "erratic." [...] Capper increasingly spent her time at Powell's house. Powell lived at 97 Langworthy Road, Moston, a small Victorian terraced house, where she also dealt drugs and was involved with the handling of stolen motor vehicles. Michelle Capper had briefly lived with Powell, but moved out in August 1992 because she did not like the [...] "evil new friends" [...] Powell was associating with, particularly Bernadette McNeilly, who had recently moved in three doors away at number 91. McNeilly, who had three children, subsequently moved in with Powell and her three children, where the two shared a bed in the downstairs dining room because the bedrooms were [...] "full of children." [...] Capper continued to stay regularly even though Powell and McNeilly frequently bullied her. Her sister said: [...] "It was not that she <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> them, it's just that she would do anything for them. She pampered their every whim." ...|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>of</b> being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that I thought were wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E
