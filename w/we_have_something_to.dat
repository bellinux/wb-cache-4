[...] "Restore the country without a people to the people without a country. (Hear, hear.) For <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give {{as well as to}} get. We can sweep away the blackmailer—be he Pasha or Bedouin—we can make the wilderness blossom as the rose, and build up {{in the heart of the}} world a civilisation that may be a mediator and interpreter between the East and the West." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Australian Commander, Major General [...] Eastick ... {{mounted the}} rostrum and after {{accepting}} {{the sword of}} surrender from Suga was about to dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. 'Hold on, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> show you.' Carrying the radio and generator Len [...] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, 'Well, {{what do you think}} about it Suga?' Now I know the full meaning of the saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death".|$|E
2500|$|In {{a debate}} at the Article Club in November 1901 Zangwill was still misreading the situation: [...] "Palestine has {{but a small}} {{population}} of Arabs and fellahin and wandering, lawless, blackmailing Bedouin tribes." [...] Then, in the dramatic voice of the Wandering Jew, [...] "restore the country without a people to the people without a country. (Hear, hear.) For <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> give {{as well as to}} get. We can sweep away the blackmailer—be he Pasha or Bedouin—we can make the wilderness blossom as the rose, and build up {{in the heart of the}} world a civilisation that may be a mediator and interpreter between the East and the West." ...|$|E
60|$|However {{that may}} be, when the lovely {{moonlight}} tempted {{us into the}} garden, there was an end <b>to</b> our jokes. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> talk about which still dwells disagreeably on my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you so {{sure that}} we hadn't?" [...] Lucille asked bitterly. [...] "You see what it says. The man killed {{him because of his}} {{political}} apostasy. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with that at least." ...|$|R
60|$|Colman. They {{understand}} me well enough when I give {{my mind to}} it. But {{it is harder to}} preach now {{than it was in the}} monastery. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> offer then; absolution here, and heaven after.|$|R
2500|$|Catharine Bond Hill, {{president}} of Vassar College argued that, [...] "many {{of us in}} higher education dislike popular college rankings such as the annual academic beauty pageant from US News & World Report. But expecting them to go away is naive, and attempting to undermine them is unwise since students and families could perceive that as petulant and paternalistic. Worse, it could seem as if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide." [...] Rather than not sending in the reputation survey, she argued, it would be of value to focus on, [...] "a third-party non-profit or foundation", sending them [...] "the same data that we already submit to US News and other rating organizations." [...] On this point, she argues, [...] "a one-size ranking does not fit all, because students and families care about different things [...] What if a school doesn't use the SAT in making admissions decisions and therefore doesn't collect or report these data? In a new system, that school couldn't be ranked if a student chose a positive weight for the SATs. Students would know that the school doesn't value that piece of information. They could then run the rankings with other information (maybe class rank and other indicators of academic achievement), excluding the SAT, and see what those rankings look like. Alternatively, they could decide they actually do care about the average SATs {{of the student body}} and decide to look at other schools. Fair enough." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One can't {{hide the}} truth. It will come out," [...] he said, and then raised his voice. [...] "That's a man <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do for. The rapid will {{have him in}} a minute, boys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If we {{were once}} out, {{there would not}} be much chance of our being detected, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> put over our uniforms; but, of course, they would betray us to the first man we met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if we don't we {{must run}} her ashore {{before it gets}} too dark, and wait till it is morning. We shall be all right if we keep quite cool and use our senses. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat I shouldn't mind a bit, except that mother will be getting anxious about us. It's a regular adventure, and <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> talk about for a long time. Look out, Bill, we must push her further off--she's getting aground!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} out, looking round {{at the old}} things," [...] he said, with an effort of apology. [...] "This sort of weather is apt to make fools of us. It gets into our heads, and before we know we feel as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with the season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, papa; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> read you, {{something quite}} fresh. A {{piece of paper}} {{was found on the}} table this morning--(dropt, we suppose, by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> tell you. We {{have entered}} the cave where you said no man might set a foot, and have seen him who sits within, the true god." [...] (Here Bastin tried to interrupt, but was {{suppressed}} by Bickley.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or expect {{too much}} from you? You feel you have borne a good deal, Charley? Well, Forster was right in one respect. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to each other, and {{it may take a}} little time. There is a big fir he has just chopped yonder." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{mention of}} Skipping Rabbit {{reminds us that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> more <b>to</b> say about her.|$|R
5000|$|In 1948, {{he began}} his lifelong {{relationship}} with Juanita, who met him while she {{was working as a}} journalist and went to interview him in jail. Together, they began engaging in war tax resistance. “When we became tax resisters in 1948,” they wrote, “it included not filing, not answering notices to supply information and making sure <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> refuse.” ...|$|R
60|$|The cheerful firelight {{dispersed}} in {{some measure}} Lady Constantine's anxieties. 'If <b>we</b> only <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat!' she said.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If so,' Mr. Hayes answered, 'that's well; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go upon. The more of them, the better. There is {{safety in}} numbers--for the honest folk. I never knew three rogues hold long together, {{especially}} when threatened with a criminal prosecution. Their confederacy breaks down before {{the chance of}} punishment. Each tries to screen himself by betraying the others.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} tell this gentleman the whole business," [...] broke in Turnbull. Then {{turning to the}} {{stranger}} he said firmly, [...] "I am sorry, sir, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do that must be done. And I may as well tell you {{at the beginning and}} to avoid waste of time or language, that we cannot admit any interference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} {{something}} about these works at Torres Vedras," [...] Captain Manley said, [...] "a mere rumor; still I believe {{there must be}} something in it. Wellington has only some twenty-five thousand British troops, and as many Portuguese, while Massena has over a hundred thousand veterans at his command. Our game would be hopeless unless <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> fall back on. No; I have every faith in our general. But there goes the bugle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hardly lives anywhere. He {{goes and}} comes at present {{as he is}} wanted by the cause. It is quite on the cards that we should find that the police have nabbed him. But I hope not. I think not. When I have seen you made comfortable, and when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat and drink, I shall know where to seek him. While I am doing so, you had better lie down." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2010, Jordison officially {{revealed}} to Kerrang magazine that Murderdolls had officially reunited {{with him and}} Wednesday working with producer Chris [...] "Zeuss" [...] Harris. Jordison said about the reunion, [...] "It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... Fuck formula! Fuck the norm!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{would be}} a capital plan, sir. Well, I am glad <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> look for besides the French fleet, which may be a hundred miles away.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hulton, [...] "you see the {{importance}} of this. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go upon; a stranger was in the factory." [...] Then he got up {{with a look of}} keen relief in his worn face. [...] "I thank you and your partner; you have given me hope. Some day all who knew my boy will believe what you believe. Now I have something to say to Percival, and then he must help me home to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|Next, {{about a month}} after, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> {{report of}} Loudon from Silesia, or rather of the Enemies he meets there; for {{it is not a}} victorious thing. But it means a {{starting}} of the Campaign by an Austrian invasion of Silesia; long before sieging time, while all these Montalembert-Soltikof pleadings and counter-pleadings hang dubious at Petersburg, and Loudon's [...] "Silesian Army" [...] is still only in a nascent or theoretic state, and only Loudon himself is in a practical one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our poor father, {{who gets}} {{more and more}} nervous every day, has entreated us to promise him {{that we will not}} go out until after the fifth of October, and to allay his fears we have given him the desired pledge. On the other hand, he has promised us that after the fifth--that is, in less than a week--we shall be as free as air to come or go as we please, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> look forward to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold you tongue, Larry, for a little, {{and keep}} your cheerin' till you have done fightin', for it's my opinion <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do in that way ere long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} all right," [...] said Harris, with cheery confidence. [...] "We shall be in at Todtmoos before ten, don't you worry. And at Todtmoos <b>we</b> will <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat." ...|$|R
5000|$|Delays in {{production}} pushed back the premiere date until October, and CBS came under criticism for {{choosing not to}} provide advance copies of the pilot to critics, leaving Rogow to comment after the cancelation:"There was a perception <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> hide, but <b>we</b> just didn't <b>have</b> the pilot ready," [...] he said. [...] "Forgive me, people in publicity, but how about trying the truth? Why not send the critics two other episodes <b>we</b> <b>had</b> finished and tell them the pilot was still being worked on? At least <b>we</b> would <b>have</b> been reviewed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! hush! my dear young lady," [...] Mr. Farmer said, {{holding up}} his hand in dismay, [...] "you must not say such things; they are libelous in the extreme. Whatever suspicions you may have--and I own that at present things look awkward--you must not mention those suspicions until you obtain some {{evidence}} in their support. The disappearance of the child at this moment may be a mere coincidence--a singular one, if you like--and we shall, of course, examine the matter to the utmost and sift it to the bottom, but nothing must be said until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Britain has {{her hands}} pretty full, at present, {{what with the}} big war in the Transvaal, and the little one here, and another in China. It {{is a good thing}} we thrashed the Afridis, two years ago. If we had not, you may be sure that there would be an even more {{formidable}} rising on our northern frontier than that we quelled. News travels marvellously fast, in India; the Afridis always seem to {{know what is going on}} elsewhere, and I am pretty sure that they would be up, all over the country, if they had not had to give up the greater portion of their rifles, and had not more than enough to do to rebuild their houses. So <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be thankful for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Surely, classic {{sculpture}} remains, as {{a witness}} of the primaeval paradise; a witness that man and woman were created at first healthy, and strong, and fair, and innocent; just as classic literature remains for a witness that the heathen of old were taught of God; that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> learn of them, summed up in that now obsolete word [...] "virtue"--true and wholesome manhood, which {{we are likely to}} forget, and are forgetting daily, under the enervating shadow of popular superstitions. {287} And till we have learnt that, may Greek books still form the basis of our liberal education, and may Greek statues, or even English attempts to copy them, fill public halls and private houses. This generation may not understand their divine and eternal significance; but a future generation, doubt it not, will spell it out right well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{perhaps they}} call it luncheon," [...] said Rollo. [...] "But I'd rather stay on deck. <b>We</b> might <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat here. Don't you think <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> it on this table?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... {{should be}} given andante, and not con strepito: {{but this is a}} faute bien legere in the midst of such {{unrivalled}} excellence, and only mentioned here that <b>we</b> may <b>have</b> <b>SOMETHING</b> <b>to</b> criticise.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} last night that <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> say to each other. I dare say {{that you may have}} thought that it was about Margaret and yourself. Isn't that so?" ...|$|R
