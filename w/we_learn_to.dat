[...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> read that page." [...] Yard's standards also insisted upon [...] "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. [...] Often referring to parks as [...] "American masterpieces", he sought {{to protect them from}} economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. [...] In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of [...] "wilderness" [...] conditions in America's national parks.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of the English version of the anime stated that Naruto {{was the most difficult}} character to cast, adding that Maile Flanagan [...] "has Naruto down, from the mischievous side, that precocious twelve-year-old <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> love, to the serious side". Flanagan avoided listening to Junko Takeuchi's performance as {{she did not want to}} imitate it, stating she wanted to develop her own voice for the character. Her performance has been praised as showing Naruto's brashness and later growth in confidence. [...] In a 2014 interview, Flanagan claimed she had never heard of Naruto before her audition. She looked the show up after being chosen and felt the release of the English dub would be popular. She is recognized more for her work voicing Naruto than from other roles she has done in her career, although some fans did not expect that Naruto would be voiced by a woman.|$|E
500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is {{what it feels like to}} believe that religion." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns our love for one another cold. Peace will come when <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> see past the illusion of differences and come to know that we are one …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to see beyond the self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to ethnomusicologist David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With our love we could save the world", universal love.|$|E

2500|$|Pickler's {{mother was}} {{repeatedly}} charged with writing bad checks and {{was convicted in}} 1988 for passing a forged prescription for Valium at the Albemarle Wal-Mart, where she worked. Pickler's parents split up the day after her second birthday; a year later, in July 1989, her mother vanished. During periods when her father, Bo, was incarcerated, she would live with her grandparents outside Albemarle, [...] northeast of Charlotte. In 1992, Pickler's mother returned to Albemarle, but rarely made contact with her. But in March 1995, with Bo Pickler in prison for armed robbery, her mother was granted custody. Pickler was in the fourth grade. In a February 2006 interview with The Observer, Pickler said: [...] "She got custody of me for two years... During that time, she was physically and mentally abusive of me." [...] In a 1997 court filing, Pickler's grandparents said {{that her mother had}} moved to Union County with her and treated her harshly. The court restored custody to the grandparents. Her mother vanished again, and Pickler has not heard from her since. Her father, whom she describes as an alcoholic and drug addict, served a three-year-nine-month prison sentence at Florida State Prison for aggravated assault and battery stemming from a 2003 stabbing incident. [...] He was released on May 6, 2006, a week after her elimination from Idol. In an April 2006 interview with NBC Pickler said, [...] "One thing that's so important in life is <b>we</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> forgive others. I ask the Lord every day to forgive me for my sins and for things that I've done wrong. And who am I to not forgive someone for what they've done?" ..."God tells us to love everyone." ...|$|E

Batmanglij and Marling also wrote the screenplay for Sound of My Voice and went to Los Angeles in 2009 to produce a film. Due to the economy, they could not make the film that year. They were then inspired by the concept of Buy Nothing Day, an international day of protest against consumerism, and decided to experience a Buy Nothing summer. They spent two months in 2009 with proponents of freeganism, which is a practice of eating [...] "discarded food {{in their pursuit of}} a moneyless existence". Marling said, [...] "We wanted to have some adventure, and we didn't have any money. <b>We</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> hop trains, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> sleep on rooftops, <b>we</b> <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> claim the space that feels so private. We joined this anarchist collective." [...] The pair drew from their experiences as well as thriller films like All The President's Men, The Bourne Identity and Michael Clayton to craft The East, which they wrote before they began filming Sound of My Voice for a 2011 release.|$|R
