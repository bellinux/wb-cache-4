The cash can only be redeemed for food. This gives refugees more freedom to decide <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> eat and is also good for the local economy.|$|E
25|$|Because of its {{controversial}} nature, {{different countries}} vary {{in the discussion}} of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression {{is at the heart of}} any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{explanations}} {{as to why}} Judas betrayed Jesus. In the earliest account, in the Gospel of Mark, {{when he goes to}} the chief priests to betray Jesus, he is offered money as a reward, {{but it is not clear}} that money is his motivation. In the Gospel of Matthew account, on the other hand, he asks <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> pay him for handing Jesus over. In the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John, the devil enters into Judas, causing him to offer to betray Jesus. The Gospel of John account has Judas complaining that money has been spent on expensive perfumes to anoint Jesus which could have been spent on the poor, but adds that he was the keeper of the apostles' purse and used to steal from it.|$|E

Before {{initiating}} sexual activities, partners may discuss <b>what</b> activities <b>they</b> <b>will</b> {{and will not}} engage in, and <b>what</b> precautions <b>they</b> <b>will</b> take. This can reduce the chance of risky decisions being made [...] "in the heat of passion".|$|R

25|$|Among {{the guests}} at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's husband), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastassya Filippovna's approval, {{plays the role of}} cynical buffoon. With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> live on, produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E

500|$|Although the museum's {{motto is}} [...] "Art too bad to be ignored", MOBA holds {{rigorous}} standards as to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> accept. According to Marie Jackson, [...] "Nine {{out of ten}} pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards." [...] As stated {{in the introduction to}} The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should [...] " [...] in a compelling image", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an [...] "Oh my God" [...] quality.|$|E

Christian, who happens to be working there, comes out and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate Thanksgiving with Christian's co-workers.

500|$|Biden {{spoke of}} the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional {{committees}} including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia, which he feels he played a role in ending. Biden stated earlier in his campaign that [...] " [...] truly believe the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> do to restore America's leadership in the world." [...] At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination, but when Barack Obama's campaign began to surge with the candidate's emphasis on change, Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action. He stated during a November 2007 debate, [...] "This [...] is not about experience. It's not about change. It's about action. Who among us is going to be able to, on Day 1, step in and end the war?" ...|$|E

After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism Einstein was writing about a single world government; it was at this time that he wrote, [...] "I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell you <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> use in the Fourth— sticks and stones." [...] In a 1949 Monthly Review article entitled [...] "Why Socialism?" [...] Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the [...] "predatory phase of human development" [...] With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.|$|E
