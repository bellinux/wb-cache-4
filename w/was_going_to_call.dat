25|$|The Ronnie Johns Half Hour {{was created}} after representatives from Channel 10 saw a {{performance}} of The Third Degree's stage show, and were impressed by the cast and characters. They offered the group the chance to film a pilot. Originally, the cast <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> the show The 3rd Degree, after {{the name of their}} performance group. Channel 10, however, liked the idea of Ronnie Johns being the host, so they asked if the show could be renamed after him. In response, The 3rd Degree came up with a title that they felt was ridiculously long, The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television). The network shortened it to The Ronnie Johns Half Hour. Despite this, the writers, cast and prop designers try to sneak in The 3rd Degree's logo as much as possible in sketches. For example, football jerseys will have The 3rd Degree as their sponsor.|$|E

In April 1949, Hubbard wrote to several {{professional}} organizations to offer his research. None were interested, so he turned to his editor John W. Campbell, who was more receptive due to a long-standing fascination with fringe psychologies and psychic powers ("psionics") that [...] "permeated both his fiction and non-fiction".|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin said, [...] "What {{attracted}} me to [...] {{had nothing}} to do with Facebook. The invention itself is as modern as it gets, but the story is as old as storytelling; the themes of friendship, loyalty, jealousy, class and power. [...] I got a 14-page book proposal that Ben Mezrich had written for his publisher for a book he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> The Accidental Billionaires. The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes. It was the fastest I said yes to anything. But Ben hadn't written the book yet, and I assumed that Sony was going to want me to wait for Ben to write the book, and I would start a year from now. They wanted me to start right away. Ben and I were kind of doing our research at the same time, sort of along parallel lines." ...|$|E

6000|$|Did {{this mean}} that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>call</b> again {{in a day or}} two? I am afraid I spoke flippantly. I said: [...] "Oh, father, another lady fascinated by the popular preacher?" ...|$|E
