[...] The DFN Foundation states [...] "we are totally committed to the restoration of this building to its unique status as the cradle of so much of Conan Doyle’s genius. Our restoration plans encompass all of the original buildings, including the stable block. The features which made Undershaw special, specifically the stained glass windows and our proposal to faithfully re-create Conan-Doyle’s study is very exciting and will be enjoyed by our children and visitors. [...] We very much hope the local community and Conan Doyle enthusiasts from around the world <b>will</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> in visiting Undershaw and use some of the facilities which will be created." [...] The DFN Foundation was established in 2014 by David Forbes-Nixon, and aims to support the areas of education, healthcare and conservation. [...] The Foundation's revised plans for the house's conversion have been supported by the Undershaw Preservation Trust.|$|E
