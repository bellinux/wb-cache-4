5|$|On April 11, 2013, Greinke {{fractured}} {{his left}} collarbone in a brawl with Carlos Quentin of the San Diego Padres after Quentin {{was hit by}} an inside pitch and charged the mound. He {{was placed on the}} disabled list and it was revealed that he would require surgery, which was performed on April 13. It was estimated that he would miss eight <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> However, he returned to action on May 10 when he pitched in a rehab game for the Class-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. He returned to the Dodgers on May 15.|$|E

5|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} Nigel Worthington's second start to a season {{as manager of}} York City, having taken charge in March 2013. Worthington {{resigned}} in October 2014 with York one place above the relegation zone. He was replaced by Russ Wilcox, who had led Scunthorpe United to promotion from League Two last season before being sacked with them struggling in League One. York secured safety from relegation with more than two <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> remaining, and finished in 18th place in the 2014–15 League Two table.|$|E
5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that he was at a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|After another bright start, Oxford led {{the table}} {{several times in}} the first half of the 2013–14 season. On 25 January 2014, with the club faltering though still in the {{play-off}} places, Wilder resigned as manager to take up the reins at relegation-threatened Northampton. Mickey Lewis subsequently became the caretaker manager for a second time for the club. On 22 March 2014, Gary Waddock was appointed the head coach of the club after a lengthy interview process, leaving his job as Head of Coaching at MK Dons. Under Lewis and Waddock, Oxford slipped out of the play-off places in the final few <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> finishing a disappointing eighth in the table, nine points off the last playoff place.|$|E

5|$|After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted to the fourth wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman. Mitchell mainly contributed on special teams for the Eagles throughout the 2002 season. In the first fifteen <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> Mitchell caught {{a total of six}} passes for 53yards as a backup. Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35yards.|$|E
5|$|Although Mold {{appeared}} for the North {{against the}} Australians, who toured again in 1896, {{he did not}} play any Tests or other representative cricket that year and his wicket total fell to 150 at 18.12; after this season, his bowling began to decline in effectiveness. Suffering frequently from injury in 1897, Mold failed to reach 100 wickets in the season for the first time. His 90 wickets in 1898 were taken at an average over 20, the only time his bowling average was so high, and he missed three <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> owing to injury. After improving his record to 115 wickets at 18.68 during 1899, he was awarded a benefit match by Lancashire during 1900 which raised £2,050, a record total {{at the time and}} worth around £173,000 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Bonneau {{came off}} the bench in {{the start of his}} {{freshman}} season for the SUNY Orange Colts, but he eventually was the team's leading scorer with 16.5 points and 1.9 steals per game, also averaging 3.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. He had to sit out his sophomore season due to academic reasons. As a junior, he broke his wrist in training to miss the first six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Bonneau recognized that sitting out was of benefit to both his academic habits and his game. In 19 games with the Colts he averaged 30.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.6 steals per game. After his second season at SUNY Orange, Bonneau drew interest by NCAA Division I colleges Providence and St. John's, but {{he was not able to}} enroll due to academic reasons.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{spent the}} entire 2003 {{campaign}} with the Indians. Despite being placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring and missing the final six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> with a lower back injury, he led the team in stolen bases, with 17. On August 30, while on the DL with a back injury, he was ticketed for speeding in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. After being stopped, he refused the ticket and sped away. He {{pleaded not guilty to}} speeding and fleeing charges on September 12, but was sentenced to a three-day jail term. The ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Ohio in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was traded}} to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already {{registered}} 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in the last six <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league's pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{performances}} in the County Championship helped Somerset remain challengers for the competition until the last few <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> but the batting-friendly pitch at their home ground, the County Ground, Taunton, meant that the county finished with too many draws to claim their first Championship title. Consistency was also key for Somerset's success in one-day cricket, where they remained unbeaten in the group stage of the Friends Provident Trophy, but were eliminated in the first knock-out round, and finished runners-up by {{one point in the}} NatWest Pro40. In the Twenty20 Cup, Somerset finished as losing finalists. This meant that they qualified for the Champions League Twenty20, where they progressed into the second group stage of the competition. They failed to win any matches in that phase of the competition, resulting in their elimination.|$|E

5|$|Hunt {{scored a}} try {{in each of}} the first two games of the season. In Round 6, he was knocked {{unconscious}} by a high tackle from a St George Illawarra Dragons player, Shaun Timmins. The following week, still suffering from the effects of concussion, he missed his first NRL game since his debut. Hunt returned a week later and scored a try {{in each of the}} next three games. However, he only scored three more tries in the remaining sixteen <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b> Hunt {{was a part of the}} junior Australian representative team at the end of the 2005 season, but was not considered for the game against Papua New Guinea for personal reasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} full season with Lewes, Wormull was used {{in a number of}} {{different}} positions, but in 2007–08, he usually played in central midfield, and felt that the continuity helped his performance. He scored the winning goal against Sutton United in the third qualifying round of the FA Cup, and made an assist for one goal and was involved in the second in the fourth qualifying round, to take the club through to the first round proper for the second year running. Wormull contributed five goals from midfield towards his club winning the Conference South title, though an injured ankle meant he missed the last few <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2011, Barea {{made his}} debut for the Timberwolves, {{recording}} 14 points, 2 assists and 2 rebounds in a 100–104 {{loss to the}} Oklahoma City Thunder. However, Barea's season was hampered with ankle and thigh injuries as he managed just 41 of 66 games for the Timberwolves in 2011–12. Despite this, on March 23, 2012, Barea scored his first career triple-double, recording 25 points, 10 rebounds and 14 assists in a 149–140 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. During the last <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> and with injuries to starters Ricky Rubio, Kevin Love and Luke Ridnour, Barea became the starting point guard, averaging 15.8 points and 9.4 assists during the last 9 games.

5|$|Selänne {{returned}} to the Ducks in 2008–09 and signed a two-year contract. He missed several <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season</b> due to a quad muscle injury suffered when he was cut by his own skate following a hit by Denis Grebeshkov of the Edmonton Oilers, but appeared in 65 games and scored 54 points. He played his 1,100th game during the season, became the sixth European player to score 1,200 career points and appeared in his 100th career playoff game. Selänne reached additional milestones in 2009–10, as he became the 18th player in NHL history to score 600 goals, accomplishing the feat on March 21, 2010, against the Colorado Avalanche and upon scoring his 602nd goal on April 2 against the Vancouver Canucks, surpassing his childhood idol, Jari Kurri.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{started the}} 2012–13 {{season in the}} 2012 FA Community Shield against Manchester City at Villa Park, where he scored the opening goal, as Chelsea lost 3–2.

Torres scored his first goal {{of the season in}} Chelsea's next match on 22 August 2012, a 4–2 home win against Reading, scoring the third goal to give his side the lead. He also scored against Newcastle United, Arsenal and Norwich City as Chelsea topped the table in the early <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>season,</b> comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
