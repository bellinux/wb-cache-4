Five kinds of roller worked and two kinds of ion nitrided specimens were used in this test.

The fatigue test result shows that <b>roller</b> <b>working</b> is more effective on improving the fatigue strength of the material than ion nitriding. On the other hand, the ion nitriding can much greatly increase the surface hardness than the <b>roller</b> <b>working.</b> In the case of <b>roller</b> <b>working,</b> the fatigue properties are improved by the three main factors which are compressive residual stress, work hardening and fiberized micro-structure...|$|R

By using the appropriate velocity model it is possible to produce separately a migrated gather for P-waves and one for S-waves. In addition, migration gathers can be observed in the aperture angle domain. I show the results on SWD synthetic and real data. The information that can be recovered about both compressional and shear properties of the subsurface, especially during the drilling process, can be crucial to predict overpressured zones and to reduce the ambiguity between variations in pore pressure and variations in lithology...|$|E

40|$|Metal {{spinning}} is a {{sheet forming}} process to produce axisymmetric products, but its commercial operation still {{depends on a}} dedicated mandrel which determines {{the shape of the}} product, and skilled craftsmen to control the working tool. In Flexible Asymmetric Spinning (FAS) the mandrel is replaced with three numerically controlled internal rollers, thereby removing the setup time and cost associated with producing the dedicated mandrel. However, if FAS could also be automated, the setup time and cost could be reduced further. This thesis focuses on three elements which need to be in place for the automation of FAS: the automation of the internal rollers; compensation for springback; and toolpath design to prevent failure. Typically, automation requires a process model. To automate the internal rollers, a process model which predicts the effect of the internal roller position on the workpiece shape would be required – but as FAS is a novel process, no such models exist. To compensate for springback, a model of workpiece shape is required. To prevent failure, a model of the two modes of failure – wrinkling and tearing – is needed. For offline automation, these should be accurate models – but accurate models of both workpiece shape and failure are too slow to make this feasible. For online automation, fast, approximate models can be used – measurements of the product can be fed back in order to compensate for the model errors. However, a literature review showed that no models exist for workpiece shape or failure which are both fast enough for online use, and detailed enough to give information on how tool actions should be changed. This is why FAS has not yet been automated. In previous work, the internal rollers were positioned through trial-and-error and only a straightwalled cup was successfully produced. In this work, a laser line scanner is installed to measure the workpiece shape online, and one of the internal rollers is positioned {{at the point where the}} workpiece just begins to diverge from the target shape. This prevents overlap with the target shape, and allows a greater range of products to be made. Springback is typically prevented in conventional spinning by pressing the material hard against the mandrel. This is not possible in FAS due to the force limits on the internal tools. However, in FAS it is possible to move the <b>working</b> <b>roller</b> inside the target shape to compensate for springback. The laser line scanner is used to measure springback and calibrate a simple elastic cantilever model of springback online. By using this model to calculate how far to move the tool inside the target shape, springback errors are reduced by 75 %. Two approaches to toolpath design to avoid failure are investigated: Firstly, a finite horizon control system – where failure is checked for only for a short time into the future – is tentatively demonstrated using a slow but accurate finite element (FE) model, but this is too slow for industrial use. However, with a faster, linear-elastic model, the control system is too conservative and fails to produce the final product. Secondly, an empirical approach is investigated: a series of trials are carried out with a parameterised toolpath. The result is a tentative set of rules for toolpath design which may provide the basis for a future control system. Overall, this thesis makes steps towards the automation of internal rollers, compensation of springback, and design of toolpaths to prevent failure in FAS. With further work to extend the control system developed here to automate all three internal rollers and to verify the robustness of the springback compensation system, any conventional spinning machine could potentially be replaced by an FAS machine – with the toolpath of the <b>working</b> <b>roller</b> designed manually, as it currently is in conventional spinning. Yet the tentative sets of rules on toolpath design also open the door to a potential automatic toolpath generation system, and further work should begin by testing the robustness of these rules with changes in material and geometry. Then, with some likely extensions, they could be embedded into a working control system to fully automate FAS...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} the <b>working</b> <b>rollers</b> used for rolling rails is {{determined}} by the chemical and structural compositions of the material of the rollers and the production technology. It is necessary to cast rollers with significantly improved utility properties, i. e., mainly a high wear resistance and optimal mechanical and structural properties. It is, therefore, necessary to find and ensure the optimal relationships between the matrix structure and the resulting values of the mechanical properties of the rollers in order to maximize their life time. The requirements introduced here cannot be ensured without a knowledge of the kinetics of the solidification. Therefore, numerical and experimental investigations of the temperature field of the solidifying roller were conducted. The kinetics of the solidification has a measurable and non-negligible influence on the chemical and structural heterogeneity of the investigated type of ductile cast-iron. Linking to the results of the model of the temperature field of the cast rollers, an original methodology was developed for the measurement of chemical micro-heterogeneity. The structure of this cast-iron is created by a large amount of the transition form of graphite and a small amount of globular graphite, and also the lamellar graphite and cementite, whereas the structure of the metal matrix is perlitic. The volume amounts of the structural components were determined using a quantitative metallographic analysis, according to which the places for the analysis of the element composition using X-ray energy-dispersive spectral micro-analysis were selected. The chemical and structural heterogeneity of the cast roller is, therefore, a significant function of the method of melting, modification and inoculation and the successive procedures of risering, casting and crystallization after cooling.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the <b>working</b> <b>rollers</b> used for rolling rails of {{different}} profiles {{is determined by the}} chemical and structural composition of the material of the rollers and the production technology The requirements for the quality cannot be ensured without a perfect knowledge of the course of the solidification, the cooling and the heat treatment of the cast rollers as well as the kinetics of the temperature field of the casting and the mould. The solidification and cooling of the ductile-cast-iron roller in metal and non-metal moulds is a very complicated problem of heat and mass transfer with the phase and structural changes described by the Fourier equation. An original application of ANSYS simulated the forming of the temperature field of the entire system, comprising the casting, the mold and the ambient. The simulation of the release of the latent heats of the phase or structural changes is carried out by introducing the thermodynamic enthalpy function. In the experimental investigation of the temperature field, an original methodology for the measurement of the distribution of temperatures and heat flows in the roller-mould system had been developed and verified in operation. In the design of the original procedure, {{there were a number of}} problems connected with the large size of the roller and the mould, the uneven dimensional changes of the solidifying roller and the mould, the installation and the insulation of the thermocouples, the wiring of the thermocouple system, etc. The findings regarding the kinetics of the temperature field of the roller and the mould, obtained from experimental research, were used to determine the boundary conditions and for the verification of the numerical simulation program. The calculation of the temperature field focused on an analysis of the effect of the mould separator on the course of the solidification of the roller. The results of the mathematical modelling indicate that the distribution of the temperatures and the solidification in the vertical direction is significantly uneven – and this has an effect on the internal {{quality of the}} casting.

Initially, biomonitoring was conducted by estimating urinary thioether to detect the extent of xenobiotic exposure, and genotoxicity was evaluated by assessing DNA damage and micronucleus frequency in buccal epithelial cells in female bidi rollers occupationally exposed to bidi tobacco dust. Student's t-test {{was used to test}} the significance between the means. Results showed a significant increase in urinary thioether level in during-shift urine samples as compared to pre-shift samples, which indicated exposure of bidi rollers to xenobiotic compounds. A significant increase in DNA damage was observed in the <b>rollers</b> <b>working</b> in confined environment as compared to those who worked in open and mixed kind of working conditions. Keeping in view the adverse effects of tobacco inhalation on the genotoxic effects in bidi rollers as an occupational hazard and in order to minimize the hazardous effects, it is recommended that masks should be worn by the bidi rollers during work to minimize inhalation of tobacco dust. Gloves should be worn particularly if there are bruises etc. in the palm. To minimize the absorption through eyes, covered glasses should be worn. The entire process of bidi rolling may be done preferably under well ventilated conditions. Due care to be taken to sit in the direction facing the direction of wind to avoid inhalation of blown away tobacco dust...|$|R
