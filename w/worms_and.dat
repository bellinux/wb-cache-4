5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor. It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> other small invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and shrimps.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs are {{generally}} regarded {{members of the}} Lophotrochozoa, a group defined by having trochophore larvae and, {{in the case of}} living Lophophorata, a feeding structure called a lophophore. The other members of the Lophotrochozoa are the annelid <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> seven marine phyla. The diagram on the right summarizes a phylogeny presented in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular buccal cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray {{prefers to}} pick prey {{from the surface}} of the substrate, as opposed to digging for them. Caridean shrimp are by far the most important food source. It also consumes polychaete <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> amphipods, and rarely penaeid prawns, molluscs, and small bony fishes. Compared to smaller rays, larger rays have a more varied diet that incorporates a greater proportion of polychaete worms.|$|E
5|$|The whiskery shark is {{an active}} and highly {{specialized}} predator, feeding almost exclusively on octopuses. Other cephalopods, bony fishes, small rock lobsters, spoon <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> seagrass have also been found amongst its stomach contents. A known parasite of this species is the tapeworm Calliobothrium pritchardae.|$|E

5|$|This species forages almost {{exclusively}} from the ground, where it alternates between remaining still and watching attentively and actively searching {{for it by}} rummaging through deep leaf litter. It eats {{a wide range of}} invertebrates, including ants, beetles, butterflies, caterpillars, cockroaches, grasshoppers, woodlice, and <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally small vertebrates. Despite the long-tailed ground roller's poor flying abilities, it has been seen catching butterflies in midair.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae and fungi. Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> {{to a lesser}} extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters of one or two young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E

50|$|The cat {{spots the}} <b>worm</b> <b>and</b> chases him. The cat puts his finger down a hole, but the worm bites it. As the cat tries {{to blow out}} the worm with a pump, Foghorn once again {{interrupts}} him and pushes him around. As Foghorn tries to blow out the worm, the cat grabs the <b>worm</b> <b>and</b> begins to fish. The worm is about to do his part by force, when Foghorn {{comes out of the}} pond, takes the <b>worm</b> <b>and</b> yet again scolds and pushes the cat around.|$|R
5|$|Bottom-dwelling and sedentary, the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} feeds {{mainly on}} polychaete <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> crustaceans. As in all numbfishes, it {{can produce a}} moderate electric shock to defend itself against predators. This species gives live birth, with the unborn young sustained to term by yolk; the litter size ranges from one to eight. The Tasmanian numbfish is a common bycatch of trawl fisheries. However, its population {{does not appear to}} be threatened by human activity and it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod shells {{occasionally}} show {{evidence of}} damage by predators, and sometimes of subsequent repair. Fish and crustaceans {{seem to find}} brachiopod flesh distasteful. The fossil record shows that drilling predators like gastropods attacked molluscs and echinoids 10 to 20 times more often than they did brachiopods, suggesting that such predators attacked brachiopods by mistake or when other prey was scarce. In waters where food is scarce, the snail Capulus ungaricus steals food from bivalves, snails, tube <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist of invertebrate animals who named and described over 4,000 species, {{specializing in the}} study of arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), and myriapods (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), but also publishing on molluscs, marine <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> insects. By 1941 he had described at least 2,000 species, and by 1957 had described a total of 4,225 new species, 742 new genera, 28 new families, and 12 orders. Chamberlin's taxonomic publications continued to appear until at least 1966.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> mice. Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile <b>worms),</b> <b>and</b> gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. They tend to gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
5|$|In evolution, luciferins {{generally}} vary little: one in particular, coelenterazine, is {{the light}} emitting pigment for nine ancient phyla (groups of very different organisms), including polycystine radiolaria, Cercozoa (Phaeodaria), protozoa, comb jellies, cnidaria including jellyfish and corals, crustaceans, molluscs, arrow <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> vertebrates (ray-finned fish). Not all these organisms synthesize coelenterazine: {{some of them}} obtain it through their diet. Conversely, luciferase enzymes vary widely and tend to be different in each species. Overall, bioluminescence has arisen over forty times in evolutionary history.|$|E

5|$|In the wild, the diets of Campbell's dwarf hamsters vary {{across the}} {{population}} range. A total of 51 {{different species of}} plants were identified to be consumed by the Transbaikalia population, the most common being Stipa capillata and species of Allium. However, in Tuva, only 10 species of plant were identified to be consumed by the population, the most common being Potentilla. Campbell's dwarf hamster is a natural predator of burrowing <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> grubs.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the onefin {{electric}} ray can defend itself with a strong electric shock produced {{from a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs beside its head. It feeds mainly on polychaete <b>worms,</b> <b>and</b> likely gives birth to live young. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. It is often caught incidentally by bottom trawl fisheries off South Africa, and may also be impacted by pollution from coastal development.|$|E
5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of <b>worms</b> <b>and</b> handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm teams can form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1930 at the Monte Carlo Country Club Bill Tilden and Charles Kingsley {{started off}} {{the season with}} the Monegasque doubles title victory over <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> Brame Hillyard. The same month at the New Courts of Cannes <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> George Lyttleton-Rogers lost to Tilden and Kingsley again. The next week at Gallia L.T.C. <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> Joan Ridley had {{a shot at the}} mixed title but were stopped again by Tilden and Aussem. Then in February at the Carlton L.T.C. of Cannes doubles contest Paul Barrelet de Ricou <b>and</b> <b>Worm</b> met <b>and</b> lost to the two members of the Four Musketeers Jacques Brugnon and Henri Cochet. In the quarterfinals of the mixed draw in an {{encounter}} between Satterthwaite-Worm and Aussem-Tilden, chair umpire A. Wallis Myers became so upset of Tilden's attitude towards him after he overruled a service that he left the court. Official organizers' efforts to find another remained unsuccessful as the match continued without chair or line umpire. In the end Tilden's team closed the match with a score of 1-6, 6-0, 6-3. In March in their second Menton title defense attempt Kehrling <b>and</b> <b>Worm</b> lost in the semis to Tamino Abe and Aeschlimann when the title-holders were already serving for the match. [...] Hughes <b>and</b> Ryan prevented <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> Satterthwaite in the mixed to claim their first Menton crown. In Beaulieu <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> his recurring mixed partner Satterthwaite was unable to defend their title and ceded it to Pat Hughes and Violet Owen. In the South of France Championships the doubles were decided between Irishman Rogers <b>and</b> <b>Worm</b> <b>and</b> their opponents Tilden-Coen with the American visitors leaving with the title. In June he found a good partner in Tilden and became German Champions after winning the doubles at the Pfings-Turnier of the Rot-Weiss Club in Berlin.|$|R
