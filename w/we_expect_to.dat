25|$|Kirkpatrick has {{developed}} this approach further {{in connection with}} computer, or video games. In his Aesthetic Theory and the Video Game {{he argues that the}} aesthetic appeal of games does not lie where <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find it – in sumptuous on-screen imagery – but in the physical sensations of gameplay. Because most video game analysis is informed by conventional media theory it tends to interpret games in terms of their ‘content’, or message, viewing the game as a sign system. This overlooks {{the most important part of}} the experience of gameplay and the fact that we can often enjoy a game without ever thinking about what it, or the activity of playing it, ‘means’. In his second book on games, Computer Games and the Social Imaginary, Kirkpatrick presents a history of digital games that links their rise to the spread of neo-liberalism, a version of capitalism that fosters and relies upon a playful disposition on the part of its subjects.|$|E

2500|$|Ordinary atomic {{matter as}} we know it is really a mixed phase, {{droplets}} of nuclear matter (nuclei) surrounded by vacuum, which exists at the low-temperature phase boundary between vacuum and nuclear matter, at μ=310MeV and T close to zero. If we increase the quark density (i.e. increase μ) keeping the temperature low, we move into a phase of more and more compressed nuclear matter. Following this path corresponds to burrowing more and more deeply into a neutron star. Eventually, at an unknown critical value of μ, there is a transition to quark matter.

The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens.

Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back [...] "is very welcome". He comments, [...] "Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it!
