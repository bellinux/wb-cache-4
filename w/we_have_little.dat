It is probable that the Celts subsequently assisted Nicomedes against Antiochus but no particulars are recorded, either of the war or the peace that terminated it. It appears, however, that Nicomedes {{was left in the}} undisturbed possession of Bithynia, which he continued to govern from this time till his death and which rose to a high degree of power and prosperity during his long and peaceful reign.|$|E
25|$|In {{the strictest}} sense, English folk music has existed since {{the arrival of}} the Anglo-Saxon people in Britain after 400 CE. The Venerable Bede's story of the {{cattleman}} and later ecclesiastical musician Cædmon indicates that in the early medieval period it was normal at feasts to pass around the harp and sing 'vain and idle songs'. Since this type of music was rarely notated, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of its form or content. Some later tunes, like those used for Morris dance, may have their origins in this period, but it is impossible to be certain of these relationships. We know from a reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman, that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least by the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material we have is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Paulina Palmer {{asserts that}} Waters, in Tipping the Velvet {{and her two}} {{following}} novels also set in the Victorian era—Affinity and Fingersmith—is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed: [...] "Women engaging in same-sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of their literary interests." [...] Waters, however, acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal: [...] "My purpose {{was not to be}} authentic, but to imagine a history that we can’t really recover." [...] Short bursts of lesbian-themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes. Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s, during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity. These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed. Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians, but that it is a reflection of what she knows: [...] "Lesbianism {{is at the top of}} the agenda for my books because it's at the top of the agenda for my life. It would be bizarre not to write about it." [...] In 2009, as she reflected on her reasons for writing Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith, Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer.|$|E
2500|$|Wood carving {{has been}} {{extremely}} widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures. [...] Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long {{in most parts of}} the world, so that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> idea how the totem pole tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions.|$|E
