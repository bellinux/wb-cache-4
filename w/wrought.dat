5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon <b>wrought</b> iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created <b>wrought</b> iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into <b>wrought</b> iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are <b>wrought</b> iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining hearth and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining hearth from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E

5|$|Co-fusion steel process: Although British {{scientist}} and historian Joseph Needham speculates {{that it could}} have existed beforehand, the first clear written evidence of the fusion of <b>wrought</b> iron and cast iron to make steel comes from the 6th century AD in regards to the Daoist swordsmith Qiwu Huaiwen, who was put in charge of the arsenal of Northern Wei general Gao Huan from 543 to 550 AD. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) Newly Reorganized Pharmacopoeia of 659 also described this process of mixing and heating <b>wrought</b> iron and cast iron together, stating that the steel product was used to make sickles and Chinese sabers. In regards to the latter text, Su Song (1020–1101) made a similar description and noted the steel's use for making swords.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{severity}} of damage <b>wrought</b> by Typhoon Roy, the name was retired following its usage and replaced with Ryan. Since little damage {{took place in the}} Philippines, the name Asiang was not retired and was later used for another cyclone.|$|E
5|$|During {{his student}} days, Gaudí {{attended}} craft workshops, {{such as those}} taught by Eudald Puntí, Llorenç Matamala and Joan Oñós, where he learned the basic aspects of techniques relating to architecture, including sculpture, carpentry, <b>wrought</b> ironwork, stained glass, ceramics, plaster modelling, etc. He also absorbed new technological developments, integrating into his technique the use of iron and reinforced concrete in construction. Gaudí took a broad view of architecture as a multifunctional design, in which every single detail in an arrangement has to be harmoniously made and well-proportioned. This knowledge allowed him to design architectural projects, including {{all the elements of}} his works, from furnishings to illumination to <b>wrought</b> ironwork.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from {{pig iron}} to <b>wrought</b> iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced <b>wrought</b> iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into <b>wrought</b> iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron {{was one of}} the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace <b>wrought</b> iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of <b>wrought</b> iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Opposite the {{internal}} doors, {{in the south}} wall, there is a plain pointed priest's door with cut stone voussoirs, by Seddon, with <b>wrought</b> iron hinges.|$|E
5|$|Pliny gives {{a special}} place to iron, {{distinguishing}} the hardness of steel from {{what is now called}} <b>wrought</b> iron, a softer grade. He is scathing about the use of iron in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Puddling process: The {{puddling}} process was known the ancient Chinese during the Han Dynasty by the 1st century AD. The improvement of steelmaking processes improved {{the overall quality}} of steel by repeated forging, folding, and stacking of <b>wrought</b> iron from pig iron to make swords.|$|E
5|$|The {{equivalent}} {{strengths of}} the different armor plates was as follows: 15in (381mm) of <b>wrought</b> iron was equivalent to 12in (305mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75in (197mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75in (146mm) of Krupp armor.|$|E
5|$|The two storey {{building}} has a slate roof. To the south east {{a stone wall}} contains <b>wrought</b> iron gates in an arched gateway.|$|E
5|$|After 1872, steel {{started to}} be {{introduced}} as a material for construction. Compared to iron, steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way {{with the use of}} steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. Redoutable nonetheless had <b>wrought</b> iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or <b>wrought</b> iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Gaudí's {{increasing}} fame, in 1902 the painter Joan Llimona chose Gaudí's features to represent Saint Philip Neri in the paintings for the aisle of the Sant Felip Neri church in Barcelona. Together with Joan Santaló, son of his friend the physician Pere Santaló, he unsuccessfully founded a <b>wrought</b> iron manufacturing company the same year.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the damage}} <b>wrought</b> by Dot on Kauai, {{the island was}} {{declared}} a major disaster area. Stepping in for governor William F. Quinn, Hawaiian secretary Edward E. Johnston {{declared a state of}} emergency for Hawaii and allocated funds towards the repairing of roads and public property. The United States Weather Bureau awarded the SS Sonoma a public service award on October7, 1959 for serving as reconnaissance for Hurricane Dot throughout its existence.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{severity}} of damage <b>wrought</b> by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Ivy following its usage {{and replaced it with}} Irene. Ivy was retired along with earlier Cyclone Heta; the two were the only named storms to form within the basin that season.|$|E
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays <b>wrought</b> havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory. The rebellion {{was one of the}} major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation. On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{work was}} {{influenced}} by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. He considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, <b>wrought</b> ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques {{in the treatment of}} materials, such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} Beecher's legacy, Applegate {{states that}} His reputation has been eclipsed {{by his own}} success. Mainstream Christianity is so deeply infused with the rhetoric of Christ's love that most Americans can imagine nothing else, and have no appreciation or memory of the revolution <b>wrought</b> by Beecher and his peers.|$|E
5|$|Once {{widespread}} in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, {{at the end}} of the Vietnam War. The combat <b>wrought</b> havoc on the ecosystems of the region through use of napalm, extensive defoliation from Agent Orange, aerial bombing, use of landmines, and overhunting by local poachers.|$|E
5|$|Phidias, who {{had been}} in charge of all {{building}} projects, was first accused of embezzling gold meant for the statue of Athena and then of impiety, because, when he <b>wrought</b> the battle of the Amazons on the shield of Athena, he carved out a figure that suggested himself as a bald old man, and also inserted a very fine likeness of Pericles fighting with an Amazon.|$|E
5|$|Steel (with smaller {{carbon content}} than pig iron {{but more than}} <b>wrought</b> iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity by using a bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300BC and AD500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|The Corridor {{is one of}} the world's {{earliest}} retail arcades, {{designed by}} architect Henry Goodridge and built in 1825, with a glass roof. The High Street end has a Doric colonnade. Each end has marble columns. A musicians gallery, with a <b>wrought</b> iron balustrade and gilt lions heads and garlands, is in the centre of the arcade. Cleveland Bridge was built in 1826 by William Hazledine with Henry Goodridge as the architect.|$|E
5|$|The San Esteban {{findings}} {{included three}} broken anchors and a <b>wrought</b> iron swivel gun {{that was also}} broken and unusable. The broken objects may have been kept so they could later be repaired, or may have just been used for ballast. There were four anchors in working condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor.

5|$|The {{production}} of iron or steel {{is a process}} consisting of two main stages. In the first stage pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Alternatively, it may be directly reduced. In the second stage, pig iron is converted to <b>wrought</b> iron, steel, or cast iron.|$|E
5|$|These {{operations}} require {{from all}} of us – officers and men – exceptional efforts, sustained day and night, despite a moral tension tested to its limits by the sight of the devastation <b>wrought</b> by a pitiless invader. However severe the trial may be, you will come through it gallantly.|$|E
5|$|Vava'u {{suffered}} a tremendous decrease in agricultural exports due to Waka, dropping 86.5% {{from the previous}} year. Despite substantial agricultural losses, the sector ended up expanding roughly 2% {{by the end of}} 2002 and the overall economy grew by 2.9%. Owing to the severity of damage <b>wrought</b> by the cyclone, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Waka following its using.|$|E
5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian right of entry in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present <b>wrought</b> iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present <b>wrought</b> iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{flooding}} from Otto {{was responsible}} for substantial increases in damage to the road network across Sint Maartin initially <b>wrought</b> by Earl, amounting to NAƒ1.5million ($838,000USD). On the French {{side of the island}} nation, torrents and associated floods in Saint Martin were accountable for similar property infrastructural damage; monetary losses there totaled €800,000 ($1.12million USD).|$|E
