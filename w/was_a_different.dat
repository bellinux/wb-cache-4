5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} {{on the field}} in their first season, going 8–4, their financial status <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E

5|$|Authorities {{were still}} not in {{agreement}} and some {{argued that the}} black color morph <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species from the mostly white morph. This proposal was discounted by a 2001 study of the mitochondrial DNA of both. A 2009 study analyzed the differences in morphology, including color, meristic variation, spine, dermal denticles (tooth-like scales) and teeth of different populations. Two distinct species emerged: the smaller M. alfredi found in the Indo-Pacific and tropical east Atlantic, and the larger M. birostris found throughout tropical, subtropical and warm temperate oceans. The former is more coastal while the latter is more ocean-going and migratory. A 2010 study on mantas around Japan confirmed the morphological and genetic differences between M. birostris and M. alfredi.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, the {{astronomer}} Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially {{believed to be}} a comet. Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object, noting that the slow, uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet, suggesting it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> type of object. This was lost from sight for several months, but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This object came to be named Ceres, and was the first asteroid to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In Legacy of the Void, it is {{revealed}} that before Fenix's defeat at Antioch in StarCraft, his personality was cloned and inserted into an experimental mechanical body of ancient Purifiers.

As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> person—which Mulder denounces as a lie.

5|$|Not {{a regular}} speaker in the House, Watts Morgan busied himself with work on various committees, dealing mainly with gas, electricity, river pollution, the Home Office and the Police Council. Despite {{his work on}} private bills and his {{friendly}} relationship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was never considered for office. In the 1922 election, Watts Morgan was forced to contest his seat {{for the first time}} when he was challenged by Frederick William Heale. Watts Morgan {{made it clear that he}} would defend the interests of ex-servicemen and those injured in industry; he opposed the temperance demand for the local veto. It was a close result for a Rhondda election; Heale lost by just over 3,000votes. The 1923 election <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> affair, with Watts Morgan defeating Conservative candidate Alfred John Orchard by nearly 13,000votes.|$|E
5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television.

He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E

5|$|When the state's {{highway system}} was first signed in 1919, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> M-14 {{that ran the}} length of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. This was later {{replaced}} by a pair of different US Highways in the 1920s and 1930s. Another M-14 was designated that lasted until the 1940s. The current highway dates back to 1956 when it was designated along a series of roads that previously carried US12. During the 1960s and 1970s, M-14 was moved to the freeway alignment it currently uses; sections of the former route are still maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as unsigned highways.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of Pluto in 1930, most astronomers considered the Solar System to have nine planets, along with thousands of significantly smaller bodies (asteroids and comets). For almost 50years Pluto {{was thought to be}} larger than Mercury, but with {{the discovery}} in 1978 of Pluto's moon Charon, it became possible to measure Pluto's mass accurately and to determine that it was much smaller than initial estimates. It was roughly one-twentieth the mass of Mercury, which made Pluto by far the smallest planet. Although it was still more than ten times as massive as the largest object in the asteroid belt, Ceres, it had one-fifth the mass of Earth's Moon. Furthermore, having some unusual characteristics, such as large orbital eccentricity and a high orbital inclination, it became evident that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> kind of body from any of the other planets.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{spent much}} of the 1934 season troubled by sore throats and back {{problems}} which restricted his appearances for Gloucestershire. His form for his county was good and in all first-class matches, he scored 2,366 runs (average 76.32), although he took fewer wickets at a higher average than the previous season. Awarded a benefit match, which raised just over £2,600, Hammond was idolised by the press and public for his achievements. In Tests, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> story; according to Wisden, he failed badly. England lost the Ashes, 2–1, in a series overshadowed at times by the Bodyline controversy. Hammond played in all five Tests against Australia but his top score was 43; he scored 162 runs at an average of 20.25, and took five wickets at an average of 72.80. Although the press and selectors supported him, there were some suggestions he should be left out of the side, and Hammond felt under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E
5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E
5|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} Jarre's first foreign tour. In 1981 the British Embassy gave Radio Beijing copies of Oxygène and Équinoxe, {{which became the}} first pieces of foreign music to be played on Chinese {{national}} radio in decades. The republic invited Jarre {{to become the first}} western musician to play there, with Les Concerts en Chine. The performances were scheduled to run from 18 October to 5 November 1981. The first, in Beijing, was initially attended mostly by officials, but before the concert began technicians realised that not enough power was available to supply the stage and auditorium. Chinese officials solved the problem by temporarily cutting power to the surrounding districts. The stadium was almost full when the concert began, but as Beijing's buses stopped running at about 10 o'clock, about half the audience left before it finished. To boost the audience attendance for the second night, Jarre and his production team purchased some of the concert tickets and gave them to children on the streets (Jarre originally wanted the concerts to be free, but the Chinese authorities decided to charge between £0.20 and £0.50 per ticket). The event was notable for its lack of audience involvement; the Chinese were apparently unmoved by both the music and the light show, and applause was muted. The second venue, in Shanghai, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> matter. Jarre actively encouraged audience participation by stepping into the crowd, which became much more exuberant than that in Beijing. Recordings of the concerts, which featured one of Jarre's signature electronic instruments, the laser harp, were released as a double-disc LP in 1982.|$|E
