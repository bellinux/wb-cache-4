5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, celadon was a prized import in East Africa, which was {{initially}} {{obtained from the}} Ming Dynasty in exchange for ivory. However, knowledge of direct exchange with the Chinese is restricted to a single account of a Chinese fleet harbored off of Malindi and Mombasa between 1417 and 1419. The number of imports from China and elsewhere continued to increase throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, represented by {{a large number of}} black on yellow Islamic <b>wares</b> and celadon. Also during the fourteenth century, local <b>wares</b> began to diversify with Gedi's expanding economy. During {{the beginning and end of}} the fifteenth century, respectively, blue and white porcelain began to gradually replace celadon and monochrome Islamic <b>wares</b> completely replaced black on yellow types. During the same century, local <b>wares</b> began to change with the reduction in the number of incised ornamental patterns and a shift to long necked-pots, compared to earlier short-necked variants. In the following century, blue and white porcelain and monochrome Islamic <b>wares</b> became the dominant imports; a trend that began to emerge in the previous century and would continue until Gedi's decline in the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Bangui’s artisans’ {{market has}} {{traditional}} <b>wares</b> representing the art products from {{different regions of}} the country. Handicrafts include woven mats and baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a xylophone, is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and human figures. The crafts center in Bangui provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony <b>wares.</b>|$|E
5|$|Carved {{designs in}} lacquerware and designs glazed onto {{porcelain}} <b>wares</b> displayed intricate scenes similar in complexity {{to those in}} painting. These items {{could be found in}} the homes of the wealthy, alongside embroidered silks and <b>wares</b> in jade, ivory, and cloisonné. The houses of the rich were also furnished with rosewood furniture and feathery latticework. The writing materials in a scholar's private study, including elaborately carved brush holders made of stone or wood, were designed and arranged ritually to give an aesthetic appeal.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the Aldermaston Pottery was {{established}} {{on the main}} street by studio potters Alan Caiger-Smith and Geoffrey Eastop. The pottery was renowned for tin-glazed and porcelain <b>wares,</b> which used scrap wood from the Village Farm woodyard to fire the kiln.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their <b>wares</b> on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To {{keep up with the}} times, some of the peddlers put up their <b>wares</b> to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as old photographs, badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pottery}} found in 9th century pueblos was sized for {{individuals}} or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast–sized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey <b>wares</b> after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that {{was easier to}} hold on to than regular grey <b>wares,</b> which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated <b>wares</b> were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment.|$|E
5|$|Pot <b>wares</b> {{in varying}} designs in post-firing {{painting}} technique in ochre colour, generally of grey ware and few in red-ware were also found. The Chalcolithic pottery unearthed {{at the site}} are of black and red ware pots and pans.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{ceramics}} {{industry was}} upheld by private businesses {{as well as}} local government agencies. Ceramics were used in domestic <b>wares</b> and utensils as well as construction materials for roof tiles and bricks.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ocosito ceramic {{tradition}} {{continued in}} use, the Late Preclassic ceramics in Takalik Abaj were {{strongly related to}} the Miraflores Ceramic Sphere that included Escuintla, the Valley of Guatemala and western El Salvador. This ceramic tradition consists of fine red <b>wares</b> that are particularly associated with Kaminaljuyu and are found throughout the southeastern Guatemalan highlands and the adjacent Pacific slope.|$|E
5|$|As a lobbyist, Romney {{frequently}} competed {{on behalf}} of the aluminum industry against the copper industry, and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly. He also represented the Aluminum <b>Wares</b> Association. In the early 1930s, he helped get aluminum windows installed in the U.S. Department of Commerce Building, at the time the largest office building in the world.|$|E
5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon <b>wares,</b> which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain <b>wares</b> made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|Colt's {{manufacturing}} methods {{were at the}} forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the first to use the assembly line efficiently. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his <b>wares</b> made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.|$|E
5|$|Common bronze items {{included}} domestic <b>wares</b> like oil lamps, incense burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron goods were {{often used for}} construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, adze, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, scratch awls, and nails. Iron was also used to make swords, halberds, arrowheads and scale armor for the military.|$|E
5|$|Dunster {{had become}} a centre for woollen and {{clothing}} production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and {{a particular kind of}} kersey or broadcloth became known as 'Dunsters'. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. By the 15th century the importance of the town was declining particularly due to the silting up of the harbour. The Luttrell's wanted to maintain the importance as a market and in 1609 George Luttrell, of the Luttrell family constructed the market to shelter traders and their <b>wares</b> from the rain and provide more security for their <b>wares.</b> The exact date of construction is debated and a variety of dates are given in different sources, however 1609 is considered the most likely.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad's {{commercial}} {{markets are}} divided into four sectors: central business districts, sub-central business centres, neighbourhood business centres and local business centres. Many traditional and historic bazaars are located throughout the city, Laad Bazaar being the prominent among all is popular for selling a variety of traditional and cultural antique <b>wares,</b> along with gems and pearls.|$|E
5|$|Reckitt and Sons {{was already}} a {{successful}} firm when Ferens joined it in 1868. It produced household <b>wares</b> such as starch, washing blue and black lead. It had been acquired by Isaac Reckitt, a Quaker, in 1840 and was now run by his sons, also Quakers, George (18251900), Francis (18271917) and James (18331924).|$|E
5|$|Several U.S. food {{manufacturers}} publicly {{stated that}} they did not use the product in their <b>wares,</b> including ConAgra Foods Inc., Sara Lee Corporation and Kraft Foods Inc. Many meat retailers {{stated that they}} either did not use the product, or would cease using it.|$|E
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade <b>wares,</b> and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the Feeble, a farmer who had previously assisted her {{in the management of}} Melkorkustead. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named Lambi.|$|E
5|$|Ceramic {{that were}} {{imported}} to Gedi represent either {{direct or indirect}} trade with China, South Asia, and the Islamic world. Islamic pottery found at Gedi was wheel spun, glazed, and kiln fired, which includes sgraffiato, Yemeni black on yellow ceramics, and figured <b>wares</b> frequently depicting floral designs on blue and white panels. Sgraffiato is red-bodied earthenware with yellow or green glaze that was common in modern-day Iraq from the ninth to the sixteenth century. A type of polychrome stoneware from the sixteenth century characterized by grey, green, and brown glazes may {{have been made in}} Persia or India as an attempted imitation of Chinese porcelain. Another type of partially grey glazed bowls with circular decorations on their interior is believed to come from Indochina since the disappearance of the style coincides with the Thai conquest of the region in AD 1467. Various types of Chinese pottery also appear at Gedi, including celadon and blue and white porcelain, which were found in large enough volumes to assume that {{a significant portion of the}} population had access to higher quality <b>wares,</b> while sherds were also found inlayed in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|Han luxury items {{furnished}} {{the homes}} of wealthy merchants, officials, nobles, and royalty. Such goods were often highly decorated by skilled artisans. These include red-and-black lacquerwares in various shapes and sizes, bronze items such as raised-relief decorated mirrors, oil lamps {{in the shape of}} human figures, and gilded bronzewares, glazed ceramic <b>wares</b> with various incised designs, and ornaments and jewelry made of jade, opal, amber, quartz, gold, and silver.|$|E
5|$|L. L. Berger {{declared}} bankruptcy in 1991, closing {{all of its}} stores. Later that same year, three more anchor stores {{were added to the}} mall: Lechmere, Loehmann's, and Lord & Taylor. The Sample closed in 1991, and was soon replaced with Linens & <b>Wares,</b> a household goods-based retailer; also, {{by the end of the}} year, Filene's Basement would open in the former L. L. Berger space. Both Filene's Basement and Loehmann's would close within three years.|$|E
5|$|Merchants and peasant farmers paid {{property}} and poll taxes in coin cash and land taxes with {{a portion of}} their crop yield. Peasants obtained coinage by working as hired laborers for rich landowners, in businesses like breweries or by selling agricultural goods and homemade <b>wares</b> at urban markets. The Han government may have found collecting taxes in coin the easiest method because the transportation of taxed goods would have been unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Red <b>wares</b> were {{imported}} from southeastern Utah until , when the Chacoans switched to orange ware products originating from northeastern Arizona, near Kayenta. After 1000, almost no pottery {{was fired in}} the canyon, but was instead produced in outlying communities with access to {{a steady supply of}} firewood for their kilns. During the period from 1030 to 1100, significantly more pottery was imported to the canyon than before. The extensive Puebloan trade network that dispersed stoneware products throughout the region suggests that, although evidence of large-scale production is lacking, proficient local artisans supplied distant communities as well as their own.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese of the Tang period {{employed}} complex chemical formulas for {{an array}} of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain <b>wares,</b> a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.|$|E
5|$|The Office of Arts and Crafts, {{subordinate}} to the Minister Steward, produced weapons, bronze mirrors, vessel <b>wares,</b> and other goods. The Office of Manufactures, also {{subordinate to}} the Minister Steward, made the cheaper weapons, utensils, and armor. Textiles and clothing worn by the emperor and royal family {{were made in the}} Weaving House of the West and Weaving House of the East; the latter was abolished in 28 BC, and the Weaving House of the West was renamed the Weaving House.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} Kampoeng Rawa emerged in 2004, {{when a group}} of farmers and {{fishermen}} from the Rawa Pening area received a billion rupiah grant from the Artha Prima Credit Union. They decided to establish a tourist attraction through which they could sell their <b>wares</b> (later extended to include arts and crafts) while raising awareness of and protecting the Rawa Pening ecosystem. In preparation for the 2013 Visit Jateng campaign, in 2011 they began planning a complex which would include culinary tourism and water activities. Artha Prima trained some locals as wait staff, cashiers, and security guards.|$|E
5|$|The major {{agricultural}} products are strawberries, citrus, dates, olives, flowers, and various vegetables. Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of <b>wares</b> are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, wicker furniture, and cotton clothing. The upscale Gaza Mall opened in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the bookseller and apothecary, the scholarly gentry class did not engage in trade professions, since scholars and government officials viewed the merchant class as lowly and contemptible. Sympathetic to the plight of farming peasants who had lost their land, a court edict of 94 CE stipulated that farming peasants who had been reduced to selling <b>wares</b> as street peddlers were not to be taxed as registered merchants, since the latter were heavily taxed by the state. Registered merchants, the majority being small urban shopkeepers, were obligated to pay commercial taxes in addition to the poll tax.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art dealers and even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain <b>wares</b> from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small <b>wares.</b> Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery Ward, which {{acquired}} the Lechmere chain in 1994, closed {{the last of}} the Lechmere stores nationwide in 1998, as part of a corporate restructuring. After its closure, half of the former Lechmere was then converted to a home store for JCPenney, while the other half sat vacant until DSW Shoe Warehouse replaced it in 1999. Linens 'n <b>Wares,</b> which closed {{at some point in the}} late 1990s, was converted to a home store for Kaufmann's in 1999 as well. One year later, a Galyan's Trading Company store was added onto the mall as well, with this store being renamed Dick's Sporting Goods in 2004 following the acquisition of the Galyan's chain.|$|E
5|$|Most {{conventions}} {{will feature}} {{some kind of}} an art show, in which artists' work is displayed, often for direct purchase or auction during the convention. There will often be a Dealers Den where art and comic book distributors and other merchants can sell their <b>wares</b> for a fee, and an Artists' Alley where individual artists are given space for no fee or a token fee, usually on the condition that they only sell their own work. Artists may also trade art between each other using sketchbooks. Erotic art is typically allowed if kept separate from other pieces, and only shown to adult attendees; a few conventions are rated strictly PG-13. Individual transactions are relatively small (usually around US$10–$50 for sketches or badges, $10–$200 for auction pieces), but the total can approach US$100,000 at the largest events (excluding professional dealers).|$|E
5|$|Rural {{families}} that sold a large agricultural surplus {{to the market}} not only could afford to buy more charcoal, tea, oil, and wine, but they could also amass enough funds to establish secondary means of production for generating more wealth. Besides necessary agricultural foodstuffs, farming families could often produce wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods they sold through brokers. Farmers in Suzhou often specialized in raising bombyx mori to produce silk <b>wares,</b> while in Fujian, Sichuan, and Guangdong farmers often grew sugarcane. In order to ensure the prosperity of rural areas, technical applications for public works projects and improved agricultural techniques were essential. The vast irrigation system of China had to be furnished with multitudes of wheelwrights mass-producing standardized waterwheels and square-pallet chain pumps that could lift water from lower planes to higher irrigation planes.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} <b>wares.</b> A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man to control it, two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E
5|$|The Persian traveller, Nasir-i-Khusron, {{wrote of}} the exotic and {{beautiful}} <b>wares</b> in the Fustat markets: iridescent pottery, crystal, and many fruits and flowers, even during the winter months. From 975 to 1075, Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics, {{and one of the}} wealthiest cities in the world. One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US$150,000 per day, to the administration of Caliph Mo'ezz. Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artefacts {{from as far away as}} Spain, China, and Vietnam. Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard, with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} the main market place, immediately south of the tollhouse, housed fishmongers, butchers, ironmongers and woolsellers. This {{section of the}} market also housed the murage loft after 1294, where tolls to fund the building of Norwich's city walls were collected. The southern section of the main market place, north of St Peter Mancroft, housed a bread market {{and a number of}} stalls associated with Norwich's significant cloth and leather industries. A broad space between the main marketplace and the Nethererowe was kept clear for the use of country smallholders, who would set up temporary booths and tents to sell their <b>wares.</b>|$|E
