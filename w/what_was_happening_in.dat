5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, German Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, {{unaware of}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> Germany, had been {{building}} up {{the strength of his}} forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Straits of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.|$|E
5|$|As {{soon as the}} two armies {{were drawn}} up, a clamour arose from the German ranks, loudly {{demanding}} that Chnodomar and his entourage of chiefs should dismount and lead {{the main body of}} German foot warriors from the front. Chnodomar and the chiefs immediately complied. In so doing, Chnodomar forfeited any strategic control of the battle, as, trapped in the centre of the action, he would {{have no way of knowing}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> other sectors. Julian, on the other hand, maintained a detached position throughout (with his escort) and so was able to respond to events all over the field, such as the initial rout of his cavalry. It is unclear exactly where Julian was stationed but it was likely in the gap between the two Roman lines.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the siege}} did not {{blockade}} the harbor, the city remained {{open for the}} Royal Navy, under Vice Admiral Samuel Graves, to bring in supplies from Nova Scotia and other places. Colonial forces could do little to stop these shipments due to the naval supremacy of the British fleet. Nevertheless, American privateers were able to harass supply ships, and food prices rose quickly. Soon the shortages meant the British forces were on short rations. Generally, the American forces were able to gather information about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the city from people escaping the privations of Boston, but General Gage had no effective intelligence of rebel activities.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions {{as a way to}} express her feelings for her people, her country, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} realise the mistake was General Dembiński, the {{commanding}} officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, {{the commanding officer}} of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Late on Monday 4November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates {{left for}} the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby's party, ignorant of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> London, paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes's arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the Wright brothers and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00pm that evening they reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour {{to meet him at}} the edge of the town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them to continue with the plan.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the sex scenes, she asked if she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
25|$|After 17 July 1941, German {{authorities}} ceased {{using the}} forest glade in Palmiry {{as a place}} of mass executions.

It is argued that this expansion of forest research will bring it in potential competition with allied sciences but, {{in the world of}} tomorrow, this integrative nature will actually be the strength of forest science...|$|R

25|$|In February 1936, Hitler sent Pius a {{telegram}} congratulating the Pope {{on the anniversary}} of his coronation, but he responded with criticisms of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> Germany, so much so that Neurath, the foreign secretary, wanted to suppress it, but Pius insisted it be forwarded.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{humanitarian}} efforts, Romero began to be noticed internationally. In February 1980, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Louvain. On his visit to Europe to receive this honor, he met Pope John Paul II and expressed his concern at <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> his country. Romero argued that it was problematic to support the Salvadoran government because it legitimized terror and assassinations.|$|E
25|$|Nitiwul won the 2016 Parliamentary {{elections}} for his constituency by defeating the National Democratic Congress candidate Dr Joseph Mamboah Rockson.

On March 30, Coffey went to the FBI's St. Paul field office to file a report, including information about the couple's new Hudson sedan parked in the garage behind the apartments. The building was placed under surveillance by two agents, Rufus Coulter and Rusty Nalls, that night, but they saw nothing unusual, mainly due to the blinds being drawn.|$|E

Unlike in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the past, Game promised the new date given would be permanent.|$|E
25|$|By 1873 the Colonial Office in London came to {{perceive}} Ord as incompetent. He was soon replaced by Sir Andrew Clarke and Clarke {{was ordered to}} get a complete picture of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the Malay states and recommend how to streamline British administration in Malaya. The reason was that London was increasingly aware that the Straits Settlements were increasingly dependent on {{the economy of the}} Malay states, including Perak. After Clarke's arrival in Singapore, many British traders including Read became close to the governor. Through Read, Clarke learned of Raja Abdullah's problem and willingness to accept a British representative in his court if the British assisted the once apparent heir.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania IV, Ax and Smash {{defeated}} Strike Force (Rick Martel and Tito Santana) to {{win their}} first WWF World Tag Team Championship. Ax struck Martel {{in the back of}} the neck with Fuji's cane while he had Smash in a Boston crab (Fuji had dropped the cane into the ring while taking a beating from Santana who carried on oblivious to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>happening</b> <b>in</b> the ring). Martel was knocked out and Smash covered him for the pin while Ax hid outside with the cane. As champions, they defeated a number of the top teams of the WWF, which at the time had a very talent-rich and hotly contested tag division, most notably the British Bulldogs and Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart).|$|E
