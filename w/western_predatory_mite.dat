40|$|A {{microinjection}} {{technique has}} resulted in stable transformation of the <b>western</b> <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> Metaseiulus occidentalis. Early preblastoderm eggs within gravid females were microinjected. The needle was inserted through the cuticle of gravid females into the egg, or the tissue immediately surrounding the egg. This maternal injection method resulted in relatively high levels of survival and transformation. Transformation was achieved {{without the aid of}} any transposase-producing helper plasmid. The predatory mite was transformed with a plasmid containing the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) regulated by the Drosophila hsp 70 heat-shock promoter. Putatively transformed lines were isolated based on beta-galactosidase activity in first-generation larvae. Transformation was confirmed in the sixth generation by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a region spanning the Drosophila/E. coli sequences. Amplification of a nested region, also spanning the interspecific boundary, provided further evidence for stable transformation. Maternal microinjection may be adaptable to other beneficial arthropods, particularly other phytoseiid mites. Genetic transformation of M. occidentalis may improve its efficiency as a biological control agent as well as provide a method for investigating details of its physiology and ecology...|$|E

Eight rooting media were prepared, including a range of degradabilities as measured with the Oxygen Uptake Rate method (OUR). The OUR range was created by mixing peat products, coir dust, bark, perlite, compost and wood fiber. Each treatment was split: half with and half without a commercially used mulch to create a drier top layer. Kalanchoës were grown on these rooting media. After one week soil-dwelling <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> (Hypoaspis miles) were added. Adults of the pest Duponchelia fovealis were released during a number of weeks. Both populations were counted.

40|$|The <b>predatory</b> <b>mite,</b> Phytoseiulus persimilis is an {{important}} biological control agent of herbivorous spider mites. This species is also intensively {{used in the study}} of tritrophic effects of plant volatiles in interactions involving plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. Recently, a novel pathogenic bacterium, Acaricomes phytoseiuli, has been isolated from adult P. persimilis females. This pathogen causes a characteristic disease syndrome with dramatic changes in longevity, fecundity, and behavior. Healthy P. persimilis use spider mite-induced volatiles to locate prey patches. Infection with A. phytoseiuli strongly reduces the attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles.

40|$|Predators {{are usually}} larger than their prey, but because size changes during ontogeny, {{predator}} and prey roles may be reversed.

Earlier, we showed that juvenile <b>predatory</b> <b>mites,</b> Iphiseius degenerans, recognize adults of another <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> species that attacked and killed conspecifics of the juveniles. Upon becoming adult, these former juveniles showed an increase in attacks on juveniles of their enemy. Here, we tested whether adult females of I. degenerans show a similar response after witnessing attack on conspecific juveniles {{in the presence of}} suitable alternative food (i. e. pollen). We used three <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> species involved in reciprocal intraguild predation. We found mixed results: the rate of attack on juveniles of one species of predator, Neoseiulus cucumeris, did increase after witnessing the killing of conspecific juveniles, but the rate of attack on juveniles of another species, Amblyseius swirskii, did not increase after such an experience. Furthermore, we found no conclusive evidence for species-specific antipredator responses. It is unlikely that cues of previous predation events affected the behaviour of adult <b>predatory</b> <b>mites,</b> because the trials were conducted on new experimental arenas free of predation cues.

40|$|Predators {{can affect}} prey {{dispersal}} lethally by direct consumption or non-lethally by making prey hesitate to disperse.

In these systems, specialist <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> that penetrate protective webs produced by spider mites quickly suppress the spider mites, whereas generalist predators that cannot penetrate the webs were ineffective. By using a connected patch system, we revealed that a generalist ant, Pristomyrmex punctatus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), effectively prevented dispersal of spider mites, Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida (Acari: Tetranychidae), by directly consuming dispersing individuals.

Pesticides can exert dramatic effects on mite communities, and these effects can be more severe on predators than on phytophagous mites, with practical consequences for pest management. Environmental conditions, in particular availability of alternative foods, could affect the resilience of <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> populations after pesticide applications.

40|$|Two {{invasive}} {{spider mite}} species (Stigmaeopsis nanjingensis Ma and Yuan, 1980 and Schizotetranychus bambusae Reck, 1941) were spotted on bamboo collections in Hungary. The possibilities of biological control were investigated on these mites with two different <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> species (Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, 1957 and Hypoaspis miles Berlese, 1892 [Stratiolaelaps scimitus Womersley, 1956]). The species Phytoseiulus persimilis consumed larger amount of S. bambusae mites than Stratiolaelaps scimitus mites {{and none of}} the <b>predatory</b> <b>mite</b> species could consume the S. nanjingensis species with its special nets...|$|R
40|$|The <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> Kampimodromus aberrans, Typhlodromus pyri and Amblyseius andersoni were reared on herbivorous mites (Panonychus ulmi, Eotetranychus carpini and Colomerus vitis), a {{potential}} alternative prey (Tydeus caudatus) and two non-prey foods, i. e. the pollen of Typha latifolia and the mycelium of Grape downy mildew (GDM) Plasmopara viticola. Developmental times, survival, sex ratio and fecundity {{as well as}} life table parameters were estimated. The findings of this research improve knowledge on factors affecting the potential of <b>predatory</b> <b>mites</b> in controlling phytophagous mites in European vineyards...|$|R
