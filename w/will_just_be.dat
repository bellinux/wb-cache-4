25|$|Buddhism understands life {{as being}} pervaded by Dukkha, as {{unsatisfactory}} and stressful. Ending one's life to escape present suffering {{is seen as}} futile because one <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> reborn again, and again. One of the three forms of craving is craving for annihilation (vibhava tanha), and this form of craving {{is the root of}} future suffering. Dying with an unwholesome and agitated state of mind is seen as leading to a bad rebirth, so suicide is seen as creating negative karma. Ending one's life is also seen as throwing away the precious opportunity to generate positive karma. While suicide {{does not seem to be}} interpreted as a breaking of the first precept (not killing other beings) it is still seen as a grave and unwholesome action.|$|E
25|$|Compression fossils, such {{as those}} of fossil ferns, are the result of {{chemical}} reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an expression of diagenesis. Often what remains is a carbonaceous film known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all that remains is an impression of the organism in the rock—an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: adpression.|$|E

She also views Little as [...] "the only one who was working with electronic music in the way [...] was interested in at the time". Lorde details that her songs are shaped by her lyrics, which she felt as a [...] "more cohesive way of working." [...] She said, [...] "I tend to start with lyrics– sometimes the seed of a song <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a word that I thought was rad, one that summed up a particular idea I'd been trying to pin down."

500|$|In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing [...] "Old Mystics" [...] for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not fit onto Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: [...] "it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left a little confused by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming." ...|$|E

He was critical on the Clash of Civilisations theory which he saw as an American vision of the world.

The three-year contract would begin in May 2010 when Hunt completed his prior commitments to play Rugby Union in France. The local media was quick to label the signing a publicity stunt with most media outlets tipping Hunt {{to return to the}} NRL before his contract expired. Hunt completed his last game for the Broncos in a preliminary final loss to the Melbourne Storm at Etihad Stadium. [...] "It's a bit of a sad moment for me but I will still be playing football in the future, it <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> a different code." [...] Hunt said after the game.

2500|$|Following protests {{angry about}} the death of Tara, Whedon and the writing team made a {{decision}} to keep Willow gay. In 2002, he told The Advocate about the possibility of Willow having a relationship with a man, [...] "We do that now, and we will be burned alive. And possibly justifiably. We can't have Willow say, 'Oh, cured now, I can go back to cock!' Willow {{is not going to be}} straddling that particular fence. She <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> gay." [...] Kennedy is markedly different from Tara. She is younger, outspoken, and aggressively pursues Willow, who hesitates to become involved again. When they first kiss in the episode [...] "The Killer in Me", Willow's realization that she let Tara go reacts with a curse put upon her by another witch named Amy Madison (Elizabeth Anne Allen), turning Willow into Warren, Tara's murderer. The spell is broken when Willow acknowledges her guilt and Kennedy kisses her again. Kennedy expresses that she does not understand the value of magic and assumes it involves tricks, not the all-consuming energy that Willow is capable of. When Willow eventually exhibits what power she has, it briefly frightens Kennedy. Willow worries about becoming sexually intimate with Kennedy, unsure of what may transpire if she loses control of herself.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you <b>will</b> <b>just</b> <b>be</b> making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
