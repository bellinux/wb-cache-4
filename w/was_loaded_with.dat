5|$|The J75 {{engine was}} {{slightly}} {{heavier than the}} PS-13, and therefore required ballast {{to be placed in}} the nose to return the centre of gravity to the correct position. In addition, the Astra fire-control system was not ready, and it too, was replaced by ballast. The otherwise unused weapons bay <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> test equipment.|$|E
5|$|During convoy {{service in}} World War II, Empire Simba {{initially}} sailed between the United Kingdom and North America carrying cargos of scrap iron from the United States. She was bombed by a German aircraft on 1 March and abandoned. She was towed to port for repairs but {{was struck by}} a German land mine dropped in a bombing raid. After six months of repairs, she began sailing roundtrips to Freetown, Sierra Leone. On one return voyage to the UK in July 1944, she collided with another ship in the convoy. After splitting the rest of the war between voyages to North America and Africa, Empire Simba <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> chemical weapons in August 1945 and scuttled west of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Surviving railway {{workers in}} the railyards {{at the heart of}} the {{disaster}} carried out rescue work, pulling people from the harbour and from under debris. The overnight train from Saint John was just approaching the city when hit by the blast but was only slightly damaged. It continued into Richmond until the track was blocked by wreckage. Passengers and soldiers aboard used the emergency tools from the train to dig people out of houses and bandaged them with sheets from the sleeping cars. The train <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> injured and left the city at 1:30 with a doctor aboard, to evacuate the wounded to Truro.|$|E

5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of time to catch up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{served in}} the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet from her commissioning to 1911, when she was sent abroad for overseas duties. She returned to the scouting forces the following year, where she remained through {{the first two years}} of World War I. She spent 1916 as a minelayer, and was disarmed in 1917. She was one of six cruisers permitted to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles, and she remained in service with the new Reichsmarine through the 1920s as a training ship. She was withdrawn from active duty in 1929, and later used as a barracks ship by the Kriegsmarine, a role she filled through World War II. After the end of the war, she <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skagerrak.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{was among}} the six light cruisers Germany was {{permitted}} to retain by the Treaty of Versailles. In {{the service of the}} newly reorganized Reichsmarine, Berlin served as a training cruiser, starting in 1922. That year, Wilhelm Canaris was assigned to the ship, which went to Norway in November 1923. In January 1924, Berlin departed German waters for an extended overseas cruise, which was the first time a German warship had done so since the end of World War I. While on the cruise, Canaris met a naval cadet by the name of Reinhard Heydrich, who {{went on to become a}} close friend and eventual architect of The Holocaust. In 1928, Berlin conducted a training cruise around the world, which included a stop in Fremantle. Training duties lasted until 1929, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1935, the Kriegsmarine used Berlin as a barracks ship in Kiel. There, she survived World War II; in the aftermath of the war, she <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak to dispose of them, on 31 May 1947.|$|E

5|$|Berlin was {{withdrawn}} from service in 1916 and disarmed. München was badly damaged by a British mine in October 1916, and thereafter decommissioned {{for use as}} a barracks ship. Hamburg was also used as barracks ship later in the war, and Leipzig became a training ship in 1917. Danzig was the last ship to leave active service, in late 1917. Of the five surviving ships, Berlin and Hamburg were retained by the newly reorganized Reichsmarine as training ships. The remaining three, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were surrendered as war prizes to the United Kingdom, which sold them for scrapping in the early 1920s. Hamburg and Berlin soldiered on as training cruisers into the late 1920s and early 1930s; by the mid-1930s, they had again been converted into floating barracks. Hamburg was sunk by British bombers in 1944, and later raised and broken up for scrap in 1949. Berlin survived World War II and <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak after the war to dispose of the munitions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Germans invaded Belgium in May 1940, there were still 40 tonnes of gold left in Belgium, held at the bank's offices in the port of Ostend. The only ship {{available}} in the area was A4, commanded by Lieutenant Van Vaerenbergh. On 19 May 1940, the vessel <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> the gold and, avoiding Dunkirk which was being bombed by the Luftwaffe, headed for the British coast, accompanied by the ship P16 which was carrying refugees. After being transferred from port to port because of concerns {{for the safety of}} the cargo during unloading, the gold was landed at Plymouth on 26 May, two days before the Belgian surrender. The gold was finally deposited at the Bank of England. A4 also carried Hubert Ansiaux, the civil servant charged with overseeing the evacuation of the gold to England and the future Governor of the National Bank.|$|E
5|$|C-17s {{have also}} {{supported}} ADF training. In this role they have moved helicopters {{and other equipment}} between Australian bases, and supported training deployments to the United States. In April 2010, members of the Australian Army's No. 176 (Air Dispatch) Squadron became the first paratroopers to jump from a non-American Globemaster; the type was first used to support training by the Army's Parachute Training School in June that year. A C-17 transported an Army M1 Abrams tank {{for the first time}} during a training exercise conducted on 11 May 2012. To mark the arrival of the RAAF's final Globemaster, four of the aircraft flew over Brisbane together on 22 November 2012. Each of the C-17s involved in the flight carried a different type of cargo to showcase the type's capabilities; A41-211 was configured for aeromedical evacuation tasks, another C-17 embarked an Abrams tank, one carried two Tiger helicopters and the fourth <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> several Bushmasters.|$|E

5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief effort for the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy of errors, the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off. In addition, a sheriff dispatch in the Texas town mentioned that aid was possibly being sent from several other towns with the same name as well as from other Texas towns like Abilene.|$|E
5|$|In late May, Kaiyō formed part of {{the escort}} for Convoy HI-65, {{together}} with the escort carrier , bound for Singapore. One of the escorts was torpedoed en route {{and two of the}} merchantmen collided while trying to dodge the other torpedoes. The rest of the convoy arrived at Singapore on 12 June. Kaiyō was assigned to fast Convoy HI-66 for the return voyage and reached Japan on 26 June. She was briefly docked at Kure Naval Arsenal in early July to have more 25mm AA guns fitted. Together with the escort carrier , Kaiyō <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> aircraft bound for the Philippines to be delivered in Convoy HI-69. They departed on 13 July and arrived a week later. The convoy left Manila four days later and reached Japan on 1 August. The ship's machinery broke down as she was preparing to join another convoy on 4 August and she was transferred to Sasebo.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian {{pursued the}} He111 over the Saltdal valley and, with three attacks from astern, set the bomber ablaze, forcing it to crash. Hull then downed a Junkers Ju52 {{transport}} plane and, after unsuccessfully chasing another He111, destroyed two more Ju52s. The transports {{had been coming}} {{to the aid of}} the hard-pressed German forces fighting around Narvik; one <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> supplies, while the other two were carrying Fallschirmjäger paratroops. One of the latter aircraft successfully landed in German-held territory before burning out, allowing the crew and paratroopers aboard to exit safely, but the second spiralled out of control and crashed, killing eight German paratroopers. Hull then attacked another He111, which soon retreated, giving off smoke. Having used up all his ammunition, Hull returned to Bodø. In the space of about an hour, in a technologically-outdated aircraft and without assistance, he had destroyed four German planes and damaged a fifth.|$|E

5|$|The {{first stop}} for the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it was greeted by a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The truck <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo the expedition continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{evacuation}} of its citizens on 13 January, the US government stated that it recognised that Zanzibar lay within Britain's sphere of influence, and would not intervene. The US did, however, urge that Britain cooperate with other Southeast African countries to restore order. The first British military vessel on the scene was the survey ship HMS Owen, which was diverted from the Kenyan coast and arrived {{on the evening of}} 12January. Owen was joined on 15January by the frigate Rhyl and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Hebe. While the lightly armed Owen had been able to provide the revolutionaries with an unobtrusive reminder of Britain's military power, the Hebe and Rhyl were different matters. Due to inaccurate reports that the situation in Zanzibar was deteriorating, the Rhyl was carrying a company of troops of the first battalion of the Staffordshire Regiment from Kenya, the embarkation of which was widely reported in the Kenyan media, and would hinder British negotiations with Zanzibar. The Hebe had just finished removing stores from the naval depot at Mombasa and <b>was</b> <b>loaded</b> <b>with</b> weapons and explosives. Although the Revolutionary Council was unaware of the nature of Hebes cargo, the Royal Navy's refusal to allow a search of the ship created suspicion ashore and rumours circulated that she was an amphibious assault ship.|$|E
