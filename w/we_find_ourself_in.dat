40|$|Social health inequalities - {{the psychosocial}} theory Abstract During the past 30 {{years it has}} become clear that there are huge {{differences}} in health and life expectancies depending on your social status. This thesis deals with theories that try to explain this phenomenon, emphasizing the psychosocial theory. Studies show that the higher your social status, the better health and longer life expectancy you have. Health and life expectancy follow a social gradient through all layers of society. This is true for all countries that have past the epidemiologic transition, where further increase in income cease to have an effect on life expectancy (most western countries). Several theories are trying to explain this phenomenon. The psychosocial theory asserts how much control you have over your life and the possibilities you have for social participation are crucial for health and longevity. Despite material and economical development in western societies, people report increasingly of suffering among other things from anxiety and depression, lack of control and insecurity. These are factors leading to stressreactions in our body. Continuous stress reduces our resistance to illnesses, and stressreactions can in it self lead to diseases. According to the theory it is our sensitivity towards social relations that lead to anxiety, depression and other psychosocial riskfactors to stress. The greater the social differences in a society are, the higher the percentage of the population report of suffering from the riskfactors. The theory therefore asserts it is the interplay between the social structure and the social situation <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourself</b> <b>in</b> that effects our health...|$|E

However, {{in real life}} problems <b>we</b> <b>find</b> <b>ourself</b> very often <b>in</b> a situation where parameters are not defined precisely. This may have many sources like inaccurate measurement, inability to establishing precise values, randomness, inconsistent information or subjectivity. In this {{paper we propose a}} sampling method for solving optimization problems with uncertain parameters modeled by random variables. Moreover, by applying confidence intervals theory, the execution time has been significantly reduced. We will also show an application of the method for the flowshop problem with deadlines and parameters modeled by random variables with the normal distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the theory}} of complex valued {{functions}} of a complex variable arguably the first striking theorem is that pointwise differentiability implies C ∞ regularity. As mentioned in Ahlfors [Ah 78] {{there have been a}} number of studies [Po 61], [Pl 59] proving this theorem without use of complex integration but at the cost of considerably more complexity. In this note we will use {{the theory of}} non-absolutely convergent integrals to firstly give a very short proof of this result without complex integration and secondly (in combination with some elements of the theory of elliptic regularity) provide a far reaching generalization. One of the first and most striking theorems about the analysis of complex valued functions of a complex variable is that merely from considering the class of pointwise complex differentiable functions on an open set <b>we</b> instantly <b>find</b> <b>ourself</b> <b>in</b> the category of C ∞ functions. Theorem 1. Given open set Ω ⊂ C. Suppose f: Ω → C is a complex differentiable at every point. Then f is C ∞ on Ω. Typically Theorem 1 is proved via the method of complex integration. The first step is to prove that the integral of a differentiable function over the boundary of a rectangle inside a ball is zero, this was first proved by Goursat [Go 01]. The existence of an anti-derivative is then concluded...|$|R

This welcome he acknowledged by sundry contortions of countenance, imitative of the clown {{in one of the}} new pantomimes, which were so extremely successful, that one stout gentleman rolled upon an ottoman in a paroxysm of delight, protesting, with many gasps, that if somebody didn't make that fellow Griggins leave off, he would be the death of him, he knew.

The {{variety of}} forms taken by the rural {{community}} in the medieval and modern period {{raises the question of}} the criteria which determined the construction of social identities. In particular, we are dealing with the question of the relationship of kinship to residence of community filiation to spadal relations. Since these different types of logic are at play the forms of reproduction within the family, we are led to reflect upon the interferences, the competition or the convergences which might be established between these two levels which are often analysed separately : how might we approach the problem of the relationship between community phenomena and the dynamics of domestic reproduction ? By extension, <b>we</b> shall <b>find</b> <b>ourself</b> obliged to reexamine the very notion of "transmission" and the relation between the circulation of goods within the framework of kinship relations and outside of such relations by opposing logics of transferal relating to goods and rights to logics of integration/exclu sion relating to people.

With a bit of technical adjustments, see [49, Sect.  4] the above argument can be justified also in the general case. Thus, if f and g are two functions for which inequality (6.5) holds as an equality one can prove [49, Prop.  6], that there exist two positive constants α and λ such that f(x)=α g(λ (x-x_ 0)) for some x_ 0 ∈R^n. From this the characterization of the functions in (6.2) as the only extremals in the Sobolev inequality immediately follows.|$|R
