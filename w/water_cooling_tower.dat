In circulating <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> when clarifying additional water the reduction of HCO 3 - and CO 32 - concentrations happens with corresponding pH increase. Absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide by cooling tower circulating water offsets this increase. The estimation of the probability of adhesion {{to the surface of}} the dispersed phase, distributed in the volume of circulation water, and the heat exchange surface of the condenser for different degrees of evaporation of the coolant is made. The distribution of cooling water micro-disperse particles which are adsorbed on the heat exchange surfaces of the condenser (deposit formation) and on the surface of larger particles (particle aggregation) reflects the efficiency of applied water treatment technology. It is shown that acidification of additional water facilitates solution of most fine fractions and increases hardness of treated water...|$|E

This curve is very helpful for designers in order to find the actual value of the number of transfer units, if the values of inlet water temperature or inlet air wet bulb temperature are changed. Also an empirical correlation was conducted to obtain the required number of transfer units of the tower in hot water operation.

40|$|Natural and {{engineered}} {{water systems}} {{are the main}} sources of Legionnaires’ disease. It is essential from a public health perspective to survey water environments {{for the existence of}} Legionella. To analyze the main serogroups, genotypes and pathogenicity of the pathogen, a stratified sampling method was adopted to collect water samples randomly from shower <b>water,</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> water, and local public hot springs in Wenzhou, China. Suspected strains were isolated from concentrated water samples. Serum agglutination assay and real-time PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) were used to identify L. pneumophila. Sequence-based typing (SBT) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were used to elucidate the genetic polymorphisms in the collected isolates. The intracellular growth ability of the isolates was determined through their interaction with J 774 cells and plating them onto BCYE (Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract) agar plates. Overall, 25. 56 % (46 / 180) of water samples were Legionella-positive; fifty-two strains were isolated and two kinds of serogroups were co-detected from six water samples from 2015 to 2016. Bacterial concentrations ranged from 20 CFU/ 100 mL to 10, 720 CFU/ 100 mL. In detail, the Legionella-positive rates of shower <b>water,</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> water and hot springs water were 15. 45 %, 13. 33 %, and 62. 5 %, respectively. The main serogroups were LP 1 (30. 69 %) and LP 3 (28. 85 %) and all strains carried the dot gene. Among them, 52 isolates and another 10 former isolates were analyzed by PFGE. Nineteen distinct patterns were observed in 52 strains isolated from 2015 to 2016 with three patterns being observed in 10 strains isolated from 2009 to 2014. Seventy-three strains containing 52 from this study and 21 former isolates were selected for SBT analysis and divided into 25 different sequence types in 4 main clonal groups belonging to 4 homomorphic types. Ten strains were chosen to show their abilities to grow and multiply in J 744 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a high prevalence and genetic polymorphism of Legionella in Wenzhou’s environmental water system. The investigated environmental water sources pose a potential threat to the public where intervention could help to prevent the occurrence of Legionnaires’ disease...|$|E

Part of chilled water is pumped into a RUWCT where it is heated by warmer ambient moist air. This paper presents a simulation study where a steady-state mathematical model for such a desuperheater heat recovery system complete with a RUWCT has been developed. Simulation results based on the specifications of an actual chiller plant have demonstrated that the model developed is stable and behaves as expected. With the model developed, the operating characteristics of the refrigeration system with a desuperheater and a RUWCT were studied. The required flow rate of chilled water to be pumped into the RUWCT was calculated in order to satisfy a certain heat load. The maximum heating capacity of the system under different operating conditions were also evaluated. The simulation results also indicated that the use of a RUWCT would achieve a higher energy efficiency than the use of electrical heating as backup heat provisions when building space cooling load is reduced.

40|$|Trace toxic {{metals in}} {{municipal}} solid waste may escape from the incineration process in flue gas, in dry collected ash, in wet scrubbed ash, or as a suspended aerosol. Therefore, understanding the behavior of heavy metals in the flue gas and the best controls in the air pollution control equipment are important and necessary. The control conditions of water cooling and spray dryer systems during incineration processes significantly influence the formation of heavy metal compounds. The formation of chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) species under various control conditions (<b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> and spray dryer reactor) was investigated in this study. The object of the experiment is to understand the effects of water cooling and spray dryer systems individually on the formation of heavy metal species. The operating parameters that are evaluated include different control systems, control temperatures, and chlorine content. A thermodynamic equilibrium model was also used to evaluate experimental data. In order to match real incineration conditions, a two-stage simulation was performed in this experiment. The {{results showed that the}} relationship of speciation between the simulation prediction and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis is consistent for Cr compounds; both indicated that Cr 2 O 3 is the major species.

40|$|Cooling towers are an {{integral}} component of many refrigeration systems, providing comfort or process cooling across {{a broad range of}} applications. Cooling towers represent the point in a cooling system where heat is dissipated to the atmosphere through evaporation. Cooling towers are commonly used in industrial applications and in large commercial buildings to release waste heat extracted from a process or building system through evaporation of <b>water.</b> <b>Cooling</b> <b>tower</b> systems operation is most efficient when the heat transfer surfaces are clean. However, these are dynamic systems due in part to their operating environment and {{because of the nature of}} their application. Cooling towers operate outside and therefore are open to the elements, making them susceptible to dirt and debris carried by the wind. Further, they often experience wide load variations and their operation can be significantly influenced by the quality of the water used for makeup in the system. The combination of process and environmental factors can contribute to four primary treatment concerns encountered in most open-recirculating cooling systems: corrosion, scaling, fouling, and microbiological activity. As shown in Figure 1, these treatment concerns are inter-related such that reducing one can have an impact on the severity of the other three. • Corrosion: Corrosion is an electrochemical or chemical process that may lead to the premature failure of system metallurgy...|$|E

In this work, two D-amino acid mixtures {{were found to}} enhance two non-oxidizing biocides [tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate (THPS) and NALCO 7330 (isothiazoline derivatives) ] and one oxidizing biocide [bleach (NaClO) ] against a biofilm consortium from a <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> in lab tests. Fifty ppm (w/w) of an equimass mixture of D-methionine, D-leucine, D-tyrosine, D-tryptophan, D-serine, D-threonine, D-phenylalanine, and D-valine (D 8) enhanced 15 ppm THPS and 15 ppm NALCO 7330 with similar efficacies achieved by the 30 ppm THPS alone treatment and the 30 ppm NALCO 7330 alone treatment, respectively in the single-batch 3 -h biofilm removal test. A sequential treatment method was used to enhance bleach because D-amino acids react with bleach. After a 4 -h biofilm removal test, the sequential treatment of 5 ppm bleach followed by 50 ppm D 8 achieved extra 1 -log reduction in sessile cell counts of acid producing bacteria, sulfate reducing bacteria, and general heterotrophic bacteria compared with the 5 ppm bleach alone treatment. The 10 ppm bleach alone treatment showed a similar efficacy with the sequential treatment of 5 ppm bleach followed by 50 ppm D 8. The efficacy of D 8 was found better than that of D 4 (an equimass mixture of D-methionine, D-leucine, D-tyrosine, and D-tryptophan) in the enhancement of the three individual biocides against the biofilm consortium...|$|E

The group of experiments has a factorial design and it was possible to correlate the results in terms of the three major operating variables Air Rate, Water Rate and Packed Height. Two complete sets of experiments {{were carried out}}. The first showed the limitations of the method which severely restrict its range of useful applicability and which are discussed in some detail. The second set, designed to overcome these difficulties, gave highly satisfactory results, showing that the method is extremely useful under suitable conditions of, operation. It is also shown that the liquid-film heat transfer coefficient is far from negligible in the present work and it is felt that it ought {{to be included in the}} design of water cooling apparatus. Equations are presented describing the variations of the three film coefficients and the tie-line slope with change in magnitude of the three major operating variables. These are found to agree well with those of other workers whose experiments were carried out in more or less the same range of Air and Water Rate but with much larger Packed-Heights.

40|$|Acanthamoeba polyphaga {{mimivirus}} (APM), a virus of free-living amebae, {{has reportedly}} caused human respiratory disease. Using 2 newly developed real-time PCR assays, we screened 496 respiratory specimens from 9 pneumoniapatient populations for APM. This virus was not detected in any specimen, which suggests {{it is not}} a common respiratory pathogen. Investigation of a suspected Legionnaire’s pneumonia outbreak in 1992 led to the isolation of a new microorganism from a <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> in Bradford, England. This pathogen was thought to be a bacterium because it resembled small gram-positive cocci; however, in 2003 it was correctly identified as a virus (1). Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APM), named for its ameba host and bacteria-mimicking characteristics, is a double-stranded DNA virus with the largest viral genome described to date (1. 2 Mb) (2). Mimiviridae is the newest member of the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus (NCLDV) group, which also contains Poxviridae, Iridoviridae, Asfarviridae, and Phycodnaviridae (1). APM encodes specific translation proteins that are more commonly associated with cellular organisms than with viruses (2). Other ameba-associated microorganisms from environmental sources, such as Legionella pneumophila, are known to cause outbreaks of acute pneumonia in immunosuppressed and elderly persons, although person-to-person transmission is uncommon. Whether APM is similarly responsible for individual cases or outbreaks of respiratory disease has yet to be conclusively determined. Previous studies have reported serologic evidence of APM infection in 7. 1 % to 9. 7 % of patients with community- or nosocomially acquired pneumonia (3, 4). APM DNA was also amplified by a nested PCR assay from a bronchoalveolar lavage specimen of a 60 -year-old patient receiving intensive care for hospital-acquired pneumonia (3). In this study, we used newly developed real-time PCR assays to screen pneumonia patients from a variety of epidemiologic settings for APM infections...|$|E

Aim: The aim of this research is to study the intensity of sediments of hardly soluble salts crystals on the surfaces of the heating of evaporative cooling equipment and condensers from supersaturated circulating water in the circulating cooling systems of power plants with water cooling towers. Materials and Methods: The methodology of the research was to study the mass and size of the hardly soluble crystals in circulation water and sediments on heat exchange surfaces of the condenser and the evaporator surface of the <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower.</b> Source water for the experiment was selected from Styr river. Experimental studies were carried out at the installation of a scale model of circulation cooling system.

Results: The study the intensity of sediments sparingly of soluble salt crystal on the surfaces of the heating of evaporative cooling equipment and condensers from supersaturated circulating water in the circulating cooling systems of power plants with water cooling towers were held. It has been determined that as the circulation water is cooling, with its runoff along the cooling surface and aeration by counter-steam mass flow there are salinity increase and increase the weight of precipitated carbonate salts crystals, which ultimately leads to the formation of loose sediments in the unheated watering surfaces of water cooling towers. Allocation of crystallization centers of sparingly soluble carbonate salt when it is heated in the heat exchange condenser tubes is due to the thermal dissociation of good soluble bicarbonate salts into sparingly soluble carbonate salts and then sediment at the heated tubes surface...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{the concept of}} an in situ electrolytic processor, a machine with electrochemical functions that purifies aqueous fluids at the point of production, whether from a bore water supply or effluent from a tannery. Where the contaminants in an effluent are useful they are separated in a specialised electrolyser for re-use in the process that produced the original effluent. The value in doing this exceeds the cost of electrolytic processing for tannery effluent. The functions of an electrolytic purifier were resolved into: flotation by bubbles, flocculation by corrosion of aluminium anodes, electrowinning by cathodic plating, disinfection, oxidation-reduction and pH modification. Improved understanding of the control of these functions has led to the ability to design better electrolysers because the functions were combined in a form that was appropriate to the required purification process. A link between extra-faradic corrosion of an aluminium anode and pH modification is postulated. Electrochemical principles were used as the basis for development of real processor models. These models were tested using bore <b>water,</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>tower</b> fluid, virus contaminated water, laundry water, municipal waste water, landfill leachate and pulp mill effluent. The most effective model, designed {{during the course of the}} project and described as the Flume, incorporated a novel corroding anode composed of thin pieces of aluminium, water flow in a cathodic flume, and a cheap water-porous membrane to separate the electrolyte into anolyte and catholyte. The novel anode was designed to improve clearance of corrosion products by maintaining a fast flow speed in proximity to the zone of anodic corrosion. The Flume model was used in an extensive test at a tannery. Greater than 90 % of chromium in tannery effluent was removed by a combination of electroflocculation and electroflotation, at a lower cost than by treatment using standard chemical flocculent, using a side-stream Flume processor at a tannery. A smaller scale Flume model was used to test mechanisms of treatment in the laboratory using synthetic tannery effluent. When treating alkaline effluent, the separating membrane in the Flume model enabled production of alkali at the cathode and production of acid at the anode. This was used for pH modification of effluent and, where the majority of the flow was anolyte, was able to produce a catholyte of pH greater than 13 from a wide range of inflow pH. The caustic catholyte is a valuable by-product of the electrolytic processing, especially when the upstream processes require net input of alkali (as is the case at a tannery or kraft pulp mill) and more generally because downstream biological treatment processes benefit from receiving neutralised effluent. The degree of pH moderation of the whole outflow compared to the inflow was found to be controllable by adjustment of cell voltage. This effect enables treatment of effluent with variable pH. Optimisation of an electrolyser for energy recovery, by both reduction of electrode over-potentials and electrolyte resistance, was incorporated in the full-scale designs. Based on a feasible cell voltage of 5 V, 20 % recovery of the energy input is expected...|$|E
