5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 {{feet off the}} ground and covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} of his neck {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic.</b> It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E

25|$|The {{murder of}} Karyn Hearn Slover {{occurred}} on September 27, 1996 in Decatur, Illinois, when Karyn disappeared shortly after leaving {{her job as}} an advertising sales representative at the Decatur Herald & Review. Karyn was a 23-year-old mother whose dismembered body was discovered <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> bags sealed with duct tape in Lake Shelbyville.|$|E

25|$|As {{had been}} the case with both Howlett and Allen, Sinclair's body was {{subsequently}} dissected, with the various dismembered parts <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> bags and stored in either a wardrobe, a tea chest or within a drawer located beneath the bathtub. The bags used to seal Sinclair's remains would be sealed with the same crepe bandages Nilsen had found upon Sinclair's wrists. Nilsen attempted to dispose of the flesh, internal organs and smaller bones of all three victims killed at Cranley Gardens by flushing their dissected remains down his toilet. In a practice which he had conducted upon several victims killed at Melrose Avenue, he also boiled the heads, hands and feet to remove the flesh off these sections of the victims' bodies.|$|E
25|$|When {{questioned}} {{as to why}} {{the heads}} found at Cranley Gardens had been subjected to moist heat, Nilsen stated that he had frequently boiled the heads of his victims in a large cooking pot on his stove in order that the internal contents would evaporate, thus removing the need to dispose of the brain and flesh. The torsos and limbs of the three victims killed at this address would be dissected within a week or so of their murder before being <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> bags and stowed in the three locations he had indicated to police; the internal organs and smaller bones he would flush down the toilet. This practice — which had led to his arrest — had been the only method he could consider to dispose of the internal organs and soft tissue as, unlike at Melrose Avenue, he had no exclusive usage of the garden of the property.|$|E

Despite this, he wrote positively of the show's use of Scully, arguing that, [...] "the fun of the episode is watching Scully watch Doggett and his team … slowly work through the closed off subway tunnels, finding bodies <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> and other mysteries beside." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robiola is {{generally}} {{served as a}} table cheese, either alone or with oil, salt and pepper. It must be stored properly after being purchased, and will keep fresh for up to one month. Its tangy taste is attributable to being infused with the wild herbs on which the animals pasture. Robiola {{can also be used}} in cooking including famous Piemonte dishes such as [...] "risotto robiola" [...] and [...] "aglio robiola spaghetti" [...] and other dishes. Special care should be exercised in properly storing the cheese (do not <b>wrap</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic,</b> as the cheese can [...] "choke" [...] and spoil). Best stored refrigerated unwrapped in its crust, or <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> paper. Best used within a week of purchase.|$|R

500|$|Following the VMAs, {{media outlets}} {{attempted}} to analyse {{the meaning of}} the dress with suggestions by BBC News ranging from anti-fashion, to feminism, aging and decay, and society's attitude towards meat. Chef Fergus Henderson explained this meat attitude as [...] "People often don't want meat to look like meat. They want it to be neatly <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> from a supermarket." [...] People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "wearing a dress made from cuts of dead cows is offensive enough to bring comment, but someone should whisper in her ear that more people are upset by butchery than are impressed by it." [...] The Vegetarian Society also condemned the dress, releasing a statement that said [...] "No matter how beautifully it is presented, flesh from a tortured animal is flesh from a tortured animal.

500|$|Dr. Donna Gooden acts as, {{among other}} things, the town's {{veterinarian}} and medical examiner. On Twin Peaks, Laura's best friend was named Donna, and Donna's father, Dr. Hayward, {{was also the}} town doctor and medical examiner. While drinking a Cherry Coke, Maudette states, [...] "Isn't cherry the best?" [...] Sherilyn Fenn, the actress who portrays Maudette, famously tied a cherry stem into a knot with her tongue in Twin Peaks. Later, Ray Wise suddenly has white hair, just as his Twin Peaks character Leland Palmer's hair turned white overnight in one episode. Dual Spires {{is famous for its}} cinnamon pie and apple cider, as Twin Peaks was famous for cherry pie and [...] "damn fine" [...] coffee. The mayor of Dual Spires is named Douglas Fir, and the town of Twin Peaks was filled with Douglas-fir trees. The local paper in Dual Spires is [...] "The Great Northern," [...] while Twin Peaks had a hotel called the Great Northern. In both series, there are stacks of donuts at the police station. In both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks, a sawmill was the source of the town's livelihood and burned down in a case of arson. Paula Merral is found <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> by the lake, just as in Twin Peaks Laura Palmer's body was found [...] "dead, wrapped in plastic" [...] on a rocky beach. The Barkers have a framed prom photo of their niece wearing a tiara prominently displayed, and a similar photo of Laura Palmer remains the iconic Twin Peaks image. Leo the cinnamon owl was the festival mascot, whereas the character of Leo Johnson was suspected of Laura Palmer's murder in Twin Peaks. Owls were a major part of Peaks as well. The pet bird in Dr. Gooden's waiting room was the same type of bird that bit Laura's shoulder in Twin Peaks. There is similar camera work and sound effect focus on a ceiling fan whipping around {{at the top of the}} stairs at Sheriff Jackson's house; this happened often in Twin Peaks. The sheriff's house also looks similar to the Palmers' house. Paula secretly dated the sheriff's son and shared [...] "secret special lover earrings" [...] with him, and in Twin Peaks, Laura and the nephew of one of the townsmen each had half of a golden heart necklace. A local teenage boy wears a jeweled crown. In Peaks, Audrey Horne's older brother wore a Native American headdress. In both series, the sheriff's deputy is a Native American who is very in tune with nature. Sheriff Andrew Jackson's name references the seventh president of the United States, just as the name of the sheriff of Twin Peaks, Harry Truman, references the 33rd. Shawn and Gus find a book written by Earl Wyndam; in Peaks, Windom Earle was a psychopathic ex-FBI agent.|$|E

5000|$|Sugarcult {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Eleven, in 1999. Their second album, <b>Wrap</b> Me Up <b>in</b> <b>Plastic,</b> was released <b>in</b> 2000.

Start Static featured several songs {{that had previously been}} released on <b>Wrap</b> Me Up <b>in</b> <b>Plastic.</b> <b>In</b> May 2002, the band re-released <b>Wrap</b> Me Up <b>in</b> <b>Plastic</b> with a new track listing that included songs from both Eleven and the original <b>Wrap</b> Me Up <b>in</b> <b>Plastic,</b> as well as new artwork. In 2003, Ben Davis officially left Sugarcult. Davis had been regularly missing shows since the release of Start Static, and left Sugarcult to get help for his alcoholism. Pagnotta was close to Davis, and wrote the song [...] "Champagne" [...] about his addictions when he was forced to leave the band. Davis was replaced by Kenny Livingston, the former drummer for the band Lefty. Sugarcult toured with Green Day in Japan for one week in March 2005, but Marko had to miss the final show because his wife was giving birth to their first child.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{though the}} {{traditional}} method is still widely practiced, modern {{understanding of the}} chemistry behind the formation of century eggs has led to many simplifications in the recipe. For instance, soaking raw eggs in a solution of table salt, calcium hydroxide, and sodium carbonate for 10 days followed by several weeks of aging while <b>wrapped</b> <b>in</b> <b>plastic</b> is said {{to achieve the same}} effect as the traditional method.
