500|$|Drake {{ended his}} studies at Cambridge nine months before graduation, and in autumn 1969 moved to London. His father remembered [...] "writing him long letters, {{pointing}} out the disadvantages of going away from Cambridge... a degree was a safety net, if you manage to get a degree, at least {{you have something to}} fall back on; his reply to that was that a safety net <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> he did not want." [...] Drake spent his first few months in the capital drifting from place to place, occasionally staying at his sister's Kensington flat, but usually sleeping on friends’ sofas and floors. Eventually, in an attempt to bring some stability and a telephone into Drake's life, Boyd organised and paid for a ground floor bedsit in Belsize Park, Camden.|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} {{finished}} by October 1990, {{five months after}} Nimoy was approached to write the story. Several months were spent working out the budget; because of the disappointing box office returns of The Final Frontier, Paramount {{wanted to keep the}} sixth film's budget approximately the same as the previous installment, although the script called for space battles and new aliens. Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelley's salaries were cut with the understanding that they would share in box office profits. Meyer estimated that almost two months were spent fighting with the studio about the budget. [...] "To some degree, almost every area of the production was affected by the cuts—but the script <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that did not become a casualty," [...] Meyer said. The original budget hovered around $41million. While not expensive for a Hollywood production, this would have presented a risk due to Star Trek films' niche audience and lower international appeal. The final budget came in at $27million.|$|E
500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that really humanized her, you know, her love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E

2500|$|After {{years apart}} the two reunited {{to write their}} own {{material}} and [...] "create music based around our harmonies because that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that people really enjoyed about our performances in the band". Lucas had seen a folk group, Tiddas, performing [...] "Inside My Kitchen" [...] on TV music video program, rage, [...] "t was a revelation {{for me to see}} three women singing harmonies, playing acoustic guitar and telling their stories through song. Right then and there I decided that I wanted to play acoustic guitar, focus on my vocals and write songs".|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen praised {{recording}} engineer Mark Rankin's contributions stating, [...] "I {{think it was}} pretty key to have Mark there. He went through the process with us, and now he's like a brother. He was completely an outsider to what we were doing, and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that we consciously decided. For this record {{we wanted to go}} out of our comfort zone, usually we’re around friends of ours. For this one, I think it was important to work with somebody who didn’t even know what some of our influences were. Someone completely out of the box for us, and I think he was key in making this record sound the way it does." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{remains to}} risk a brief comment: that he was and remains a great teacher [...] [...] [...] who made sense of life and of the life to come; in whose {{presence}} insuperable difficulties became less daunting; who took endless troubles {{to help those who}} brought their problems to him; someone to whom the spiritual quest in prayer <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> needful, who by his own life demonstrated the validity and truth of traditional teachings; and that, however emasculated by modernism, these remain the only valid criteria for those who, as he would put it, have ears to hear. His life was a celebration of “The Marriage of Wisdom and Method”: which is the title of one of his essays.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{activity}} of the New Left became Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War as conducted by liberal President Lyndon Johnson. The anti-war movement escalated the rhetorical heat, as violence broke out on both sides. The climax came in sustained protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Liberals fought back, with Zbigniew Brzezinski, chief foreign policy advisor of the 1968 Humphrey campaign, saying the New Left [...] "threatened American liberalism" [...] in a manner reminiscent of McCarthyism. While the New Left considered Humphrey a war criminal, Nixon attacked him as the New Left's enabler—a man with [...] "a personal attitude of indulgence and permissiveness toward the lawless". Beinart concludes that [...] "with the country divided against itself, contempt for Hubert Humphrey <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> on which left and right could agree." ...|$|E
2500|$|During that time, {{she tries}} to {{convince}} Homer that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that was missing because their lives would be miserable without Bart, Lisa and Maggie. He {{proved to be more}} unconvinced and more depressed after seeing that his life {{would have been a lot}} better if he had won, even leaping into the pot to try to [...] "live in the sauce". The saucier bashes him for his foolishness and saying if you could live in the sauce, then he would have jumped in himself. Marge convinces him to take a walk with her to the Springfield Wall of Fame. Eventually, he agrees and learns that his name has been put up. Marge reveals that she confronted Dondelinger and forced him to do the right thing. A boy then has his picture taken with him. Homer, now much happier, goes to a Korean restaurant that Bart says 'sells beef that spells the date of your death'.|$|E
2500|$|Heilmann {{was known}} as a line drive hitter who clubbed the ball harder than any batter of his era with the {{exception}} of Babe Ruth. His one major handicap as a player was a lack of speed that led to his being known by the nickname [...] "Slug". He was long known as [...] "one of the slowest men in baseball." [...] Hall of Fame sports writer Tommy Holmes noted: [...] "Heilmann was never much faster than an ice wagon on the base paths. Without doubt, he is the slowest moving great hitter who ever lived." [...] According to Holmes, Ty Cobb's speed added 50 hits a year to his output, while Heilmann's lack of speed robbed him of infield hits. Sportswriter Harry Grayson later wrote that Heilmann's inability to beat out infield hits <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that kept Heilmann from matching Rogers Hornsby as the greatest right-handed batter in baseball history.|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single [...] managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.|$|E
2500|$|In 1966 Brett {{successfully}} {{applied to}} be a music journalist at pop music weekly, Go-Set, and in May she replaced founding feature writer, Doug Panther. She later reflected, [...] "My career is inexplicable and it's a career path that nobody should follow! It basically starts with an 18-year old refusing {{to go to}} university because that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> that my parents wanted of me, that and to be slim. So I defied both of those desires. My mother said I {{had to get a}} job, which shocked me. There was a new newspaper opening up in Australia called Go-Set and I walked into the office and I started work the next day. I don't think this would happen today." [...] The paper's editor was Tony Schauble, and according to Go-Set staff photographer, Colin Beard, [...] " [...] had been to see Schauble several times and had made a favourable impression on him and more importantly, she had a car, which was an attractive incentive to employ her." [...] Fellow writers included Vince Lovegrove, Molly Meldrum, Ed Nimmervoll and Stan Rofe. In November 1966 Brett was interviewed on The Go!! Show, a Victorian-based pop music show, by its host, Johnny Young (also a pop singer). Young described Brett's style [...] "She seemed genuinely interested in the pop stars she interviewed, but she could also be intimidating at times." ...|$|E
