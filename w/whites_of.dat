5|$|A {{person with}} cholangitis may {{complain}} of abdominal pain (particularly {{in the right}} upper quadrant of the abdomen), fever, rigors (uncontrollable shaking) {{and a feeling of}} uneasiness (malaise). Some may report jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin and the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes).|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Encephalopathy often occurs {{together}} with other symptoms and signs of liver failure. These may include jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin and the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes), ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity), and peripheral edema (swelling of the legs due to fluid build-up in the skin). The tendon reflexes may be exaggerated, and the plantar reflex may be abnormal, namely extending rather than flexing (Babinski's sign) in severe encephalopathy. A particular smell (foetor hepaticus) may be detected.|$|E
50|$|Some non-European {{languages}} have a {{wide variety}} <b>of</b> terms for <b>white.</b> The Inuit language has seven different words for seven different nuances <b>of</b> <b>white.</b> Sanskrit has specific words for bright <b>white,</b> the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> teeth, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> sandalwood, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> the autumn moon, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> silver, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> cow's milk, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> pearls, the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> a ray of sunlight, and the <b>white</b> <b>of</b> stars. Japanese has six different words, depending upon brilliance or dullness, or if the color is inert or dynamic.|$|R

5|$|Juveniles have lighter greys {{and browns}} amidst the starker blacks and <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> their plumage; two- or three-year-old birds {{of both sexes}} closely {{resemble}} and are difficult to distinguish from adult females. Immature birds have dark brownish eyes until around two years of age. Australian magpies generally live to around 25 years of age, though ages of up to 30 years have been recorded. The reported age of first breeding has varied according to area, but the average is {{between the ages of}} three and five years.|$|E
5|$|Pope Paul III and His Grandsons {{ranks as}} one of Titian's finest and most {{penetrating}} works. Although unfinished and less technically accomplished than his Portrait of Pope Paul III of a few years earlier, it is renowned for its rich colouring; the deep reds of the tablecloth and the almost spectral <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> Paul's gown. The panel contains subtle indications of the contradictions in the character of the Pope, and captures the complex psychological dynamic between the three men.|$|E

5|$|The Red Guards {{executed}} the <b>Whites</b> <b>of</b> economic/social power, including politicians, major landowners, industrialists, police officers, civil servants, {{teachers and}} leaders {{and members of}} the White Guards. Ten priests of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and 90 moderate socialists were also killed. The level of executions varied over the war months; the numbers peaked in February during the period of securing the power. March saw low counts because the Reds could never seize new areas outside Red Finland. The numbers rose again in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland. The two major terror centres were Toijala and Kouvola; 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion {{and the light}} reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, Ingres minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|This notice was {{published}} in the Bechuanaland News and Malmani Chronicle on 2 February 1889. A grand indaba of the izinDuna and the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> Bulawayo was soon convened, but because Helm and Thompson were not present, the start of the investigation was delayed until 11 March. As in the negotiations with Rudd and Thompson in October, Lobengula did not himself attend, remaining close by but not interfering. The izinDuna questioned Helm and Thompson at great length, and various white men gave their opinions on the concession. A group of missionaries acted as mediators. Condemnation of the concession was led not by the izinDuna, but by the other whites, particularly Tainton.|$|E

5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The primary goal of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In the early, or {{fulminating}} form, hemorrhaging {{appears on}} {{the second or third}} day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes deep red. Hemorrhagic smallpox also produces a dusky erythema, petechiae, and hemorrhages in the spleen, kidney, serosa, muscle, and, rarely, the epicardium, liver, testes, ovaries and bladder. Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness, when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present. A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8–10 days. The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period, and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage. Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors (e.g. platelets, prothrombin, and globulin) and an increase in circulating antithrombin. Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia; however, deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe. Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin. This form of smallpox occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the smallpox strain. Hemorrhagic smallpox is usually fatal.|$|E

25|$|Fucidin tablets and suspension, whose active {{ingredient}} is sodium fusidate, occasionally cause liver upsets, which can produce jaundice (yellowing {{of the skin}} and the <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes). This condition will almost always get better after the patient finishes taking Fucidin tablets or suspension. Other related side-effects include dark urine and lighter-than-usual feces. These, too, should normalize when the course of treatment is completed.|$|E
25|$|Yellowing of {{the skin}} and <b>whites</b> <b>of</b> the eyes follow the {{prodrome}} after about 1–2 weeks and can last for up to 4 weeks.
