40|$|On Aso Caldera, gravity {{surveys have}} been made by using a <b>Worden</b> <b>gravimeter</b> from 1964 to 1965, in order to {{investigate}} the problem, whether there exsists or not a cecular change in gravity value connected with volcanic activities, and to get clues for figuring out the subterranean structure of this caldera. In this paper, the gravity values observed at each station and the distribution of Bouguer anomalies are reported. The distribution of Bouguer anomalies shows that the low gravity anomaly decreasing {{toward the center of the}} caldera is very conspicuous. The iso-anomaly contour lines conform to the caldera shape, and the relative anomaly at the center of Aso caldera to the neighbour amounts to about - 20 mgal. This fact shows that Aso caldera is characterized by strong negative anomalies in contrast to the outer somma part and it can be classified as "low anomaly type caldera" such as Kutcharo caldera lake or Aira caldera of the so-called Krakatau type. Comparing the gravity values obtained by the present surveys with the ones obtained by the Earthquake Research Institute in 1964 and by the Geographical Survey Institute in 1959, it is concluded that there was no significant secular change in gravity value during the period from 1954 to 1964. And further discussions on atmospheric pressure and temperature effects on the <b>Worden</b> <b>gravimeter</b> are made...|$|E
40|$|St. Barnabé fault, in St. Hyacinthe {{plain of}} the St. Lawrence lowlands, was {{postulated}} by Clark (1947) on his geological {{study of this}} area. Structural features of this type are {{of great interest to}} the geophysicist to establish relation between physical quantities measured at the surface and geometry of such structures. A subsurface fault can be diagnosed, under density contrast condition, with surface gravity measurements. The present detailed gravity survey was undertaken to determine if such a condition existed, to correlate geological information with gravity data, and to assess this data in terms of possible parameters of the fault structure.

40|$|Gravity {{value at}} Astronomical point, Syowa station, was {{determined}} by observations with a <b>WORDEN</b> <b>gravimeter</b> in the third Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition 1958 - 59, and the following result has been obtained: g_ = 982. 540 cm/sec^ 2 Latitude 69 ° 002 ̆ 74 S Longitude 39 35. 4 E Height 29. 2 m relative to g_ = 979. 6470 cm/sec^ 2. The accuracy of this value {{was estimated to be}} a few milligals by investigating the drift of the gravimeter during the period of the expedition and considering the uncertainty in the scale value of the gravimeter. This estimation was, however, based on several assumptions and the result may include a serious error. Fortunately, Syowa Station has been built on the ground and not on ice, therefore, we can reoccupy the very point of the station with our gravimeter and confirm the observed result. In the fourth expedition 1959 - 60, a re-measurement of the gravity value at Syowa Station was planned and carried out by using the same gravimeter in the way similar to the preceding expedition. It was confirmed that the gravimeter had a small and linear drift during the whole period of the expedition by continuous observations in Tokyo, Singapore, Cape Town as well as at Syowa Station. The drift rate for the period of 77 days during the forward and backward voyage between Cape Town and Antarctica was deduced to be + 0. 24 milligal per day. This value agreed well with a value, + 0. 25 milligal per day, which was deduced for the period of stay at Syowa Station. We have obtained a mean value of gravity, 982. 5427, from observations at the station in this expedition. This is 2. 6 milligal higher than the former mean value. Errors due to the drift and the changing in the scale value might have caused this difference. It is considered, however, that this is accurate enough to be used safely as a reference value in gravity measurement in this district. Therefore, we have concluded that the former value has an expected, accuracy and it is unnecessary to correct it by present result. On the way to and from Antarctica, observations with the gravimeter were made in Singapore Island. Ten stations were re-occupied and ten other stations were newly established. The distribution of gravity in this island has been made fairly clear by our survey. Similar observations were carried out in Naha, Ryukyu, on the return way of the expedition...|$|E
40|$|Along {{the inland}} {{traverse}} route from Syowa Station to location C 21 (F 451, 74 ° 572 ̆ 7 S, 38 ° 272 ̆ 7 E) {{and along the}} traverce routeon the sea ice in Lutzow-Holm Bay toward the Cook Point, the gravity was measured by <b>Worden</b> <b>Gravimeter</b> in 1961 On the inland traverse, the intervals of the observation stations were 6 km {{in the range from}} the coast to point C 6 (F 158, 71 ° 002 ̆ 7 S, 41 ° 002 ̆ 7 E), and 12 km in the range from C 6 to C 21 The number of the observation stations on the sea ice of the Lutzow-Holm Bay was seventeen Seven stations of them coincided with the points where the depth was sounded by plummet The error of the measurment seemed to be mainly caused by the abnormal drift of gravimeter Though the carrier (container) of the gravimeter was covered with sheets of foam rubber and set in a wooden box, which was set on a thick sheet of foam rubber and was mounted with rubber bands to the snow car, the gravimeter must have suffered frequent shocks when the snow car passed the group of sastrugi The mean drift of the gravimeter was 0 285 mgal/day in the year. But it was smaller in the period of traverse, that is, 0 182 mgal/day in the autumn inland traverse, 0 247 mgal/day in the spring inland traverse and 0 082 mgal/day in the Cook Point traverse The negatue drift was noticed at some camp sites where we stayed for several days The mean error of the measurments estimated from all viewpoints was about 3 5 mgal The results obtained from the inland traverse route are listed in a table with the location ana the height of the observation station, the values of the standard gravity, the free air anomaly, the thickness of ice, the height of bed rock and the distance from Syowa Station along the route The thickness of ice was calculated under three assumptions (1) the Bouguer anomaly is zero, (2) the density of ice is 0 9 g/cm^ 3, (3) the density of bed rock is 2 67 g/cm^ 3. Since the seismic sounding by our party was a failure, the Bouguer anomaly could not be calculated But the traverse route of the third expedition party crosses our route, and a part of traverse route of the forth expedition party is very close to our route, then their results of seismic sounding can be utilized and the rough estimation of the Bouguer anomaly can be made At station F 52, about 100 km from Syowa Station, the thickness of ice calculated from the gravity is approximately equal to that from the seismic sounding, that is, the Bouguer anomaly is about - 6 mgal. But in the region of Oku-Shirase Daira (the head of the Shirase Glacier), the difference of ice thickness becomes 1000 ～ 1500 m, and the Bouguer anomaly is about - 75 ～- 110 mgal. If the Bouguer anomaly at the farther stations is taken as - 100 ～- 150 mgal, considering the value in the neighbourhood of Pole of Relative Inaccessibility or South Pole, the true thickness of ice will be 1300 ～ 2000 m smaller than that calculated from gravity The results obtained on sea ice in Lutzow-Holm Bay are listed in another table At some stations where the depth of sea is known, the Bouguer anomaly was calculated under the assumptions (1) the Bouguer anomaly is zero, (2) the density of sea water is 1 02 g/cm^ 3 (freezing point - 1 5 ℃), (3) the density of rock 2 67 g/cm^ 3. As to the free air anomaly and the Bouguer anomaly, too, the vicinity of the tongue of the Shirase Glacier has the smallest value ⊿g_O=- 78 2 mgal ⊿g_O"=- 32 6 mgal and farther place has larger value This gradient continues to the offing of the Lutzow-Holm Bay where the maximum value of anomaly ⊿g_O=+ 79 mgal ⊿g_O"=+ 216 mgal has been observed in the second expedition. It must be noticed that the maximum of the free air anomaly in the neighbourhood of lat 68 °S corresponds {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf, the minimum in the neighbourhood of lat 69 5 °S corresponds to the depression of the bottom of sea and the maximum in the neighbourhood of lat. 71 7 °S corresponds to the neighbourhood of the Yamato Mts. As to the Bouguer anomaly at the place in the range between the meridians 35 °E and 40 °E, the value of ⊿g_O" 280 mgal in the neighbourhood of 68 °S decreases to about zero in the neighbourhood of 69 °S, to the approximately estimated value - 75 ～- 110 mgal in the neighbourhood of 71 °S and to the reasonabley assumed value - 100 ～- 150 mgal at the southern place of 72 °S. In the neighbourhood of 68 °S, the western place has smaller Bouguer anomaly and in the neighbourhood of 69 °S, the western place has larger Bouguer anomaly. The elevation of Mohorovicic discontinuity M is calculated with the formulae presented by KORYAKIN, DEMENITSKAYA, and with the graph presented by WOOLLARD. KORYAKIN 2 ̆ 7 S formula is M=M_O- (⊿g_O"/ 2 _πG × density contrast) = 35. 3 - 0 0332 ⊿g_O", and DEMENITSKAYA 2 ̆ 7 S formula is H= 35 (1 - tanh 0 0037 ⊿g_O"). Where H is the thickness of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s crust. If H is taken as M, M will have the error by the depth of sea. For the value of M in the neighbourhood of Syowa Station, any of the above formulae would give about 35 km, but for the mean gradient of M in the range between 68 °S and 69 °S, the formula of KORYAKIN gives about 59 m/km, the curve of WOOLLARD gives about 119 m/km and the formula of DEMENITSKAYA gives aboat 186 m/k...|$|E
