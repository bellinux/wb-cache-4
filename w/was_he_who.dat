5|$|A {{virtually}} unknown work by Gaudí is the Casa Clapés (1899–1900), at 125 Carrer Escorial, {{commissioned by the}} painter Aleix Clapés, who collaborated on occasion with Gaudí, such as in decorating the Palau Güell and the Casa Milà. It has a ground floor and three apartments, with stuccoed walls and cast-iron balconies.

5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that it <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>who</b> conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story {{would be the same}} were Clark still alive.|$|E

60|$|These {{are several}} of the {{passages}} on which, in 1887, I relied {{as evidence of the}} Professor's approval, which, I should have added, is only partial It <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>who,</b> unsolicited, professes himself 'much more our ally than our adversary.' It <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>who</b> proclaims that Mr. Max Midler's central hypothesis is erroneous, and who makes 'no objection' to my idea that it is 'builded on the sand.' It <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>who</b> assigns essential merits to our method, and I fail to find that he 'strongly declines the honour' of our alliance.

5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant and it <b>was</b> <b>he</b> <b>who</b> {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy {{was shocked to see}} Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E

Slytherin believed that students of non-magical parentage should be refused entry to the school.
