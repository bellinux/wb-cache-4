Probus improves the state-of-the-art by introducing novel solutions that allow for efficient verification of data security properties and by limiting the overhead required to provide its security guarantees.

For a long time almost all school timetables were created manually, a timeconsuming task, which often yielded suboptimal schedules. In the last thirty years, however, systems have been designed which automate timetable creation. Timetabling in general {{is the problem of}} finding suitable combinations of two or more types of resources which have to be at the same place during several discrete periods of time and which have to satisfy various additional constraints. Some of these constraints are strict while some are not (the latter express preferences or desiderata). In the case of school timetabling problems these [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} of teachers to attend trainings is currently done randomly, by rotation and {{not based on}} their work performance. This poses a problem in selecting the right teacher to attend the right course. Up until now, there is no intelligent model to assist the school management to determine the integrity level of teacher and assign them to the right training program. Thus, this study investigates the integrity traits of teacher using association rule technique with an aim, which can assist the school management to organize a training related to teachers’ integrity performance and to avoid sending the wrong teacher for the training. A dataset of Trainees Integrity Dataset representing 1500 secondary school teachers in Langkawi Island, Malaysia in the year 2009 were pre-processed and mined using apriori.

However, other demographic factor such as gender, race, and grade position of teachers were not able to reflect their low integrity level in this study.

40|$|Our {{emphasis}} is on the management of water service delivery (WSD) and on the institutional dynamics of the actors involved in the various water systems, therefore focusing on the interplay between human society and the environment. Water service delivery in Kenya and Ghana is of low quality and there are <b>weak</b> <b>integrity</b> mechanisms in place, which are prone to corruption. Water service delivery is also characterized by pragmatic and opportunistic management practices. We explore the extent to which corruption and management practices affect the performance of WSD by developing an exploratory agent-based model (ABM) that builds on the principal-agent theory. Based on empirical research from case studies in Kenya and Ghana, the different actors involved in WSD are modeled in terms of principals and agents that play various games reflecting different social dilemmas. Payoffs from the games are defined based on transparency, accountability, participation, and the social costs {{of the relationship between the}} principals and the agents. Decisions made by bounded-rational actors take into consideration the expected payoff but also social comparison. The results show that corruption risks and opportunistic practices reduce the performance of WSD. Furthermore, the relevance of the work is the highlighting of the use of social simulation (ABM), built on case studies, to understand these complex relationships in Kenya and Ghana...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} study deals with an electrically actuated MEMS device. An experimental investigation is performed, via frequency sweeps in a neighbourhood {{of the first}} natural frequency. Resonant behavior is explored, with special attention devoted to jump and pull-in dynamics. A theoretical single degree-of-freedom spring-mass model is derived. Classical numerical simulations are observed to properly predict the main nonlinear features. Nevertheless, some discrepancies arise, which are particularly visible in the resonant branch. They mainly concern the practical range of existence of each attractor and the final outcome after its disappearance. These differences are likely due to disturbances, which are unavoidable in practice, but have not {{been included in the}} model. To take disturbances into account, in addition to the classical local investigations, we consider the global dynamics and explore the robustness of the obtained results by performing a dynamical integrity analysis. Our aim is that of developing an applicable confident estimate of the system response. Integrity profiles and integrity charts are built to detect the parameter range where reliability is practically strong and where it becomes <b>weak.</b> <b>Integrity</b> curves exactly follow the experimental data.

40|$|Hydrogen is an {{emerging}} energy carrier for oil refining and fuel cell applications. The {{development of an}} efficient and stable catalyst to produce hydrogen gas is required for industrial applications. However critical issues in the catalyst {{that lead to the}} deactivation of reactions include active metal particle growth and carbon fouling. Industrial catalysts that are frequently overwhelmed by such issues are substituted or re-treated, which is not time and cost efficient. Therefore, developing durable catalysts that are resistant to sintering and carbon fouling remains an area of interest. A novel and anti-agglomeration Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst is first reported in this thesis. A specific study of the ZrO 2 hollow shell showed that the varied porosity of the hollow shell contributed to the catalyst’s ability to inhibit the agglomeration of active Ni particles. The steam reforming of methane was selected as the probe study for this catalyst in this research. Before a thorough analysis of the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst was performed, the systematic synthesis of Ni@SiO 2 was studied. The analysis showed that the Ni particle size can be controlled by tuning the synthesis temperature. Water-to-surfactant ratio in the microemulsion was shown to influence the morphology of the Ni@SiO 2 particle. The tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) amount added with fractionated dispensing and the amount of NiCl 2 were found to have affected the size and morphology of the Ni@SiO 2. For the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 sample, the catalyst was characterised by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction. TEM was used for morphology analysis, while X-ray Diffraction was performed for phase analysis and crystallite size measurements. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was done to measure specific surface area, total pore volume, and the t-plot micropore volume of the samples. Reducibility analysis of the Nickel species of the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst was carried out using Temperature Programmed Reduction. The anti-agglomeration property of the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 was established from the TEM and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis. Results showed that the active Ni particles were inside the yolk-shell structured framework, which deterred Ni particles from moving onto the surface of the catalyst. Ni particles were found to be stabilised by the abundant volume of pores in the ZrO 2 hollow shell. This result indicates that the Ni particles were anchored by the pores and remained stable during the steam reforming of methane. The Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst was tested by varying the volumes of feed (GHSV) and the steam-to-carbon ratio. This catalyst was also subjected to a recyclability test and proved to be better than conventional impregnated Ni/ZrO 2 catalysts. The Temperature Programmed Hydrogenation analysis also proofed that the yolk-shell structure framework inhibited higher order of carbon deposits on the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst. Varying the porosity of the ZrO 2 hollow shell was found to affect the performance of the steam reforming of methane. This varied porosity can be achieved by varying the amount of surfactant during the synthesis of Ni@SiO 2 @ZrO 2. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy analysis results showed that the porosity of the ZrO 2 hollow shell contributed to the moderately strong hydrothermal stability of the catalyst for the steam reforming of methane. The hollow shell of the ZrO 2 was influenced by the instability of the SiO 2. TEM analysis of used BrNi- 4. 8 catalysts showed that the yolk-shell structure framework of the catalyst collapsed. This result suggests that the shell has <b>weak</b> <b>integrity,</b> and proves that the SiO 2 was not able to maintain the yolk-shell framework. The results also suggest that the varied porosity of the ZrO 2 hollow shell influences the catalysts’ efficiency even though they share the same yolk-shell structure framework. This is likely due to the differences in the pores of each catalyst configuration, which directly affects the Nickel species involved in the catalytic reaction. Finally, it was demonstrated that the Ni@yolk-ZrO 2 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance in comparison to conventional catalysts for the steam reforming of methane. Catalytic activity remained stable and achieved a methane conversion of more than 90...|$|E

Blade ice loading specification in both milling and impact cases, under the Unified Polar Class Rules (URI 3), by the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), was implemented. An optimization example and analysis were given for an R-class propeller. The strength of the R-class propeller was assessed for all 7 polar classes and 5 loading cases. Comparison was also made for all polar classes and ice loading cases. As the blade has little skew with a wide chord, both the spindle torque and the in-plane bending moment are small, so only out-of-plane bending failure is the key factor for strength.

We have determined that key factors responsible for these past failures include cytokine (interleukins 1 and 6 and tumor necrosis factor) stimulation by mannuronic acid monomers from alginate capsules with <b>weak</b> mechanical <b>integrity,</b> which results in fibroblast proliferation. With this insight, we formulated mechanically stable microcapsules by using alginate high in guluronic acid content and report prolonged reversal of diabetes in the spontaneous diabetic dog model by the {{intraperitoneal injection}} of encapsulated canine islet allografts.

Histological evidence of viable islets retrieved from the peritoneal cavity 6 months posttransplant confirmed the biocompatibility and immunoprotective nature of this capsule formulation. The finding that intraperitoneal injection of alginate-immunoprotected islets, a minimally invasive surgical procedure, is effective in prolonged (> 1 year) maintenance of glycemic control, without the need for lifelong immunosuppression, may have significant implications for the future therapy of type I diabetes in humans...|$|R

For instance, incorporating a new program in a legacy database application can create an integrity mismatch, since the database model and the program data view can be quite different (e. g. standard file model versus OO model). In addition, neither the legacy DBMS (too <b>weak</b> to address <b>integrity</b> issues correctly) nor the new program (that relies on data server responsibility) correctly cope with data integrity management.

Although still {{little is known}} about the ecological consequences of altered hydromorphology, understanding the factors at play can contribute to sustainable environmental management. In this study we aimed to identify the hydromorphological features controlling a key ecosystem function and the spatial scales where such linkages operate. As hydromorphological and chemical pressures often occur in parallel, we examined the relative importance of hydromorphological and chemical factors as determinants of leaf breakdown. Leaf breakdown assays were investigated at 82 sites of rivers throughout the French territory. Leaf breakdown data were then crossed with data on water quality and with a multi-scale hydro- morphological assessment (i. e. upstream catchment, river segment, reach and habitat) when quantitative data were available. Microbial and total leaf breakdown rates exhibited differential responses to both hydromorphological and chemical alterations. Relationships between the chemical quality of the water and leaf breakdown were <b>weak,</b> while hydromorphological <b>integrity</b> explained independently up to 84. 2 % of leaf breakdown. Hydrological and morphological parameters were the main predictors of microbial leaf breakdown, whereas hydrological parameters had a major effect on total leaf breakdown, particularly at large scales, while morphological parameters were important at smaller scales. Microbial leaf breakdown were best predicted by hydromorphological features defined at the upstream catchment level whereas total leaf breakdown were best predicted by reach and habitat level geomorphic variables. This study demonstrates the use of leaf breakdown in a biomonitoring context and the importance of hydromorphological integrity for the functioning of running water.

Shear creep, shear stress relaxation, dynamic impulse measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy {{were used to determine}} the {{rheological properties}} and the texture of processed cheese slices. The shear creep, the shear stress relaxation and the dynamic impulse halfsquare measurements were carried out using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. A Texture Analyser TA. HD was used for the shear stress relaxation measurements. Comparison of shear stress relaxation results between the two instruments showed agreement. The shear creep compliance of IWS cheese show higher values than that of SOS cheese at 21 °C. On the other hand, the shear stress relaxation moduli indicated lower values for IWS cheese than SOS cheese at 21 °C. This indicated that IWS cheese was more liquid-like than SOS cheese though there are no significant compositional differences. Higher shear creep compliance is related to less resistance of the cheese to deformation while lower shear stress relaxation modulus indicates less resistance to deformation. These results are also in agreement. The melting properties of the two types of slices were studied with dynamic impulse measurements. IWS cheese melted at a lower temperature (50 °C) than SOS cheese (60 °C). Microscopic structure indicates more protein-protein interaction in SOS cheese than IWS cheese, which had smaller fat globules evenly distributed within the protein network, thereby reducing the protein-protein interaction and making the network <b>integrity</b> <b>weak,</b> thus confirming the shear creep and shear stress relaxation findings. The rheological and textural differences between the two cheeses were attributed to different process conditions used during the cheese manufacture.
