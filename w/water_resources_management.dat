50|$|<b>Water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> is the {{activity}} of planning, developing, distributing and managing the optimum use of <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> It is a sub-set of water cycle <b>management.</b> Ideally, <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> planning has regard to all the competing demands for water and seeks to allocate water on an equitable basis to satisfy all uses and demands.

The 2009 Water Resources Law (Ley de Recursos Hídricos) and the draft National <b>Water</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> Strategy of 2004 (Estrategia Nacional para la Gestión de los Recursos Hídricos Continentales del Perú) contain the necessary elements for Integrated <b>Water</b> <b>Resources</b> <b>Management</b> as stated in international good practices namely, integration of sectoral policies, participation of stakeholders, decentralization of management to the river basin level and recognition of water as a social and economic good. Despite the new law, several key challenges remain, including limited institutional capacity, increasing water stress in the coastal region, deteriorating water quality, poor efficiency in the irrigation sector, as well as inadequate access to and poor quality of water supply and sanitation.|$|E

This chapter suggests that integrated <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> debate {{needs to be}} taken beyond its prima facie grounds if the concept is to yield fruit. According to the Collins Concise Dictionary Plus, integrate means to make or be made into a whole. If this is applied to the subject at hand, the question becomes what constitutes integrated <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management?</b> Stated differently, what exactly is being integrated in integrated <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management?</b> The task of the chapter is not just to argue for integrated <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> but to sketch a conceptual framework. A conceptual framework can be regarded as a template incorporating (a set of) ideas about how a subject can be visualized and operationalized. A useful conceptual framework, we suggest, needs {{to come to grips with}} both theoretical and practical issues.

40|$|This {{research}} studies the characteristic features of shifting paradigms in South African Water legislation {{over the past}} hundred years and aligns these changes in legislation with established world views in <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management.</b> A comparative analysis is used to describe and compare how changes in South African water legislation {{over the past century}} have changed <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> paradigm and vice versa. Three distinct legislative periods are explored within South African water law. The first period from 1912 to 1955 was dominated by the Irrigation and Conservation of Waters Act of 1912 which favoured the agri-industrial and minority landowners. The second period is recognised as the pre-modernism and industrial modernism as paradigms that are closely aligned to the earliest national water legislation. It is characterised by the advancement of the hydraulic mission and growing demand for <b>water</b> <b>resources.</b> The third phase is the National Water Act which transformed <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> in South Africa. It represents a radical shift in legislation from the dominant paradigm in South Africa and provides one of strongest features indicating that legislation, along with political will, is the major driver and enabler in contributing towards change in <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management.</b> In South Africa, the paradigm shift in <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>management</b> is the direct result of legislative influence driven by a quest to emphasise the need for social justice and equity in order to redress an unjust Apartheid system...|$|R
