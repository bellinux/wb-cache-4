25|$|The University of Essex {{conducted}} a study to evaluate the efficacy of including the Wii in an established falls prevention training program to improve balance, mobility, and educate recovery from the instance of a fall. After a 7-week falls prevention training, {{the results indicated that}} Wii can positively support a standard rehabilitation, although the use of the game alone would not be encouraged. On the other hand, participants found the experience of Wii game as enjoyable, which can support patients engagement to training. A follow up longitudinal study would be needed to conclude if the incidence of falls can be reduced along time. Extending this study, another research conducted by the same University of Essex found that training with Wii can imply on mood and self-esteem. This behavior was observed in women <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> last mentioned research for fall prevention. As said by investigators, it would not be appropriate to generalize, however one participant who had the biggest improvement on the functional measures had the largest positive changes in well-being, which may indicate that the use of the Wii as an adjunct to standard falls prevention training can improve not only functional but also psychological outcomes.|$|E
25|$|According to Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Thái Tông and his wife, the Empress Chiêu Thánh, did {{not have}} their first son for some time. This {{situation}} worried the grand chancellor Trần Thủ Độ because he had profited from similar circumstances with the Emperor Lý Huệ Tông in overthrowing the Lý dynasty. Therefore, in 1237 Trần Thủ Độ decided to force Prince Hoài Trần Liễu, Thái Tông's elder brother, {{to give up his}} wife, Princess Thuận Thiên, for the Emperor when she had been pregnant with Trần Quốc Khang for three months. After the royal marriage, Thuận Thiên was entitled the new empress of the Trần dynasty, while Chiêu Thánh was downgraded to princess. Furious at losing his pregnant wife, Trần Liễu rose in revolt against the royal family. Meanwhile, Thái Tông felt awkward about the situation and decided to become a monk at Yên Tử Mountain in Quảng Ninh. Finally Trần Thủ Độ successfully persuaded Thái Tông to return to the throne, and Trần Liễu had to surrender after judging that he could not stand with his fragile force. All soldiers <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> revolt were killed; Trần Thủ Độ even wanted to behead Trần Liễu but was stopped by Thái Tông.|$|E

500|$|In {{the days}} after the lynching, {{newspapers}} fiercely condemned the event. Within a week, news of the lynching was published as far away as London. A New York Times editorial opined that, [...] "in no other land even pretending to be civilized could a man be burned to death in the streets of a considerable city amid the savage exultation of its inhabitants". In the New York Age, James Weldon Johnson described the members of the lynch mob as [...] "lower than any other people who at present inhabit the earth". Although many southern newspapers had previously defended lynching as a defense of civilized society, after Washington's death, they did not cast the practice in such terms. The Montgomery Advertiser wrote that, [...] "no savage was ever more cruel ... than the men <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> horrible, almost unbelievable episode". In Texas, the Houston Chronicle and the Austin American criticized the lynch mob, but spoke highly of Waco. The Morning News of Dallas reported the story, but did not publish an accompanying editorial. In Waco, the Times-Herald refrained from editorializing about the lynching. The Waco Morning News briefly noted their disapproval of the lynching, focusing their criticism on papers they felt had attacked the city unfairly. They cast the condemnatory editorials {{in the aftermath of the}} lynching as [...] "Holier than thou" [...] remarks. A writer for the Waco Semi-Weekly Tribune defended the lynching, stating that Washington deserved to die and that blacks should view Washington's death as a warning against crime. The paper later carried an editorial from the Houston Post condemning the lynching, characterizing the column as part of an attack on the city.|$|E

2500|$|Furthermore, {{this can}} also occur when {{minorities}} living {{in rural areas}} undergoing urbanization, are introduced to fast food. A study done in Thailand focused on urbanized metropolitan areas, the students <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> study as were diagnosed as “non-obese” in their early life according to their BMI, however were increasingly at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes, or obesity as adults, as opposed to young adults who lived in more rural areas during their early life. Therefore, early exposure to urbanized regions can encourage unhealthy eating due to widespread presence of inexpensive fast food. [...] Different racial populations that originate from more rural areas and then immigrate to the urbanized metropolitan areas can develop a fixation for a more westernized diet; [...] this change in lifestyle typically occurs due to loss of traditional values when adapting to a new environment. For example, a 2009 study named CYKIDS was based on children from Cyprus, a country east of the mediterranean sea, who were evaluated by the KIDMED index to test their adherence to a mediterranean diet after changing from rural residence to an urban residence. It was found that children in urban areas swapped their traditional dietary patterns for a diet favoring fast food.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2008 and 2011, {{at least}} 60 Baltimore, Maryland police {{officers}} {{engaged in a}} kickback scheme with an automobile repair shop. When these officers responded to traffic accidents, they would refer motorists to the repair shop in exchange for payments of $150 to $300 for every referral. Samuel Ocasio was a former Baltimore police officer <b>who</b> <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> scheme between 2009 and 2011. He was charged under the Hobbs Act for extorting money from the automobile repair shop. Before his trial began, Ocasio sought a jury instruction that would have required the jury to find, as a prerequisite for convicting him for conspiracy to commit extortion, that [...] "the government must prove {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that the conspiracy was to obtain money or property from some person who was {{not a member of the}} conspiracy". The United States District Court for the District of Maryland ultimately refused to provide Ocasio's proposed instruction and Ocasio was found guilty on one count of conspiracy and three counts of extortion. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, Ocasio argued that [...] "his conspiracy conviction was fatally flawed because the conspirators had not agreed to obtain money from a person who was not a member of the conspiracy", but the Fourth Circuit affirmed his conviction. Ocasio appealed again, and on March 2, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.|$|E
