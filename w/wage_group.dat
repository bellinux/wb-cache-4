The study sample comprised 337 sewing machine operators (male, n= 122, female, n= 215; aged between 18 - 54 years old; mean 30. 74 ± 8. 44) from four different garment-making companies in Malaysia. They were being paid via time rate wages (n= 246) and piece rate wages (n= 91). Data was collected through Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and pen-and-paper assessment via Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). From the study, the piece rate <b>wage</b> <b>group</b> was found to take fewer breaks, had high work production demands, worked at a faster pace and experienced more exhaustion and pressure due to increasing work demands as compared to the time rate group. They were also observed working with higher physical exposure such as repetitive tasks, awkward static postures, awkward grips and hand movements, pulling, lifting and pushing as compared to those in the time rate <b>wage</b> <b>group.</b> The final RULA scores was also higher from the piece rate <b>wage</b> <b>group</b> (72. 53...|$|E

40|$|This paper sheds {{new light}} on the {{well-known}} phenomenon of dwindling wage elasticities for married women in the US over the recent decades. Results of a novel model experiment approach via sample data ordering unveil considerable heterogeneity across different <b>wage</b> <b>groups.</b> Yet surprisingly constant wage elasticity estimates are revealed within certain <b>wage</b> <b>groups</b> over time as well as across two widely used US data sources, the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). These findings refute the assumed presence of a single-valued aggregate wage elasticity for working wives. Although women’s responsiveness to wages remains largely unchanged over time, we find that the composition of working women into different <b>wage</b> <b>groups</b> has changed considerably, resulting in decreasing wage elasticity estimates at the aggregate level. All these findings were methodologically impossible to acquire had we not dismantled and discarded the stereotyped endogeneity-backed instrumental variable route, which has hitherto blocked the way towards sample data ordering...|$|R
40|$|This paper models {{individual}} wage variation in Finland by exploiting a high-quality dataset. The data is deflated to 1998 prices using earnings and salary index. For both genders {{the data is}} divided into four income quartiles. A linear mixed-effects model is estimated with the three degree polynomials of age, the duration of employment, and GDP growth as explanatory variables. The model provides predictors for {{individual wage}}s. The estimation period is 1975 - 1985. Genuine out-of-sample predictions are made first assuming a normal growth in 1986 - 1990, then a deep recession in 1991 - 1994. According to the models, the wage formation seems to be essentially different in different wage quartiles. Individual variation within a wage quartile is shown to be large. GDP is statistically significant only for one <b>wage</b> <b>group,</b> but still the prediction accuracy is remarkably worse during the recession period when GDP drops dramatically. The prediction errors for the middle-wage quarters seem to be considerably smaller than for the low and high-wage groups. There is some indication that the middle quarters can be predicted quite accurately several years ahead. The results show that individual aspects and the <b>wage</b> <b>group</b> {{play a significant role}} in modeling and prediction. This is potentially useful information when designing and developing pension schemes...|$|E

Direct effects on reported job training and corollary effects on wage growth as estimated in microdata of the National Longitudinal Samples (NLS) and Michigan Income Dynamics (MID) are consistently negative and stronger at lower education levels. Apart from a single exception, no effects are observable among the higher <b>wage</b> <b>group</b> whose education exceeds high school. The effects on job turnover are: a decrease in turnover among young NLS whites, but an increase among young NLS blacks and MID whites. Whether these apparently conflicting findings on turnover reflect a distinction between short and long run adjustments in jobs is a question that requires further testing. ...|$|E

We apply quantile regressions to Mincer-type equations to disentangle between- and within-education <b>group</b> <b>wage</b> inequalities, and we describe separately their evolutions. We use a matched dataset of administrative data and Census information, which contains yearly data. Our main results are: (1) the overall wage inequality was stable from 1976 to 1992 and slightly decreased from 1995 to 2004. (2) Within-education <b>group</b> <b>wage</b> inequalities increase with education and are higher across non-vocational degrees than vocational ones. (3) Between-education <b>group</b> <b>wage</b> inequalities increase with experience. (4) The within-education <b>group</b> <b>wage</b> inequalities were rather stable from 1976 to 1992 and decreased between 1995 and 2004, strongly for low levels of experience. (5) The between-education <b>group</b> <b>wage</b> inequalities decreased all over the period, due to decreasing education premiums, particularly for low levels of experience.

40|$|Purpose – The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{investigate}} the sheepskin effects in the returns to education in the Sri Lankan labor market by ethnicity. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on the latest Sri Lankan Consumer Finance and Socio-economic Survey. The study employs the quantile regression method for each conditional quantile <b>wage</b> <b>group,</b> rather than the mean regression analysis used in most labor market analysis. The quantile regression technique fits hyperplanes through out the conditional wage and is ideal for characterizing the entire wage distribution. The standard Mincerian wage equation was estimated for the full sample of male workers and separately for the two main ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. Findings – The empirical findings are broadly encouraging. Quantile regression results suggest that average returns to education for both ethnic groups differs significantly from the returns at the two extreme ends of the wage distribution. In general, the returns to education are positive for both groups, but the returns are higher for Sinhalese workers than for Tamil. An increasing trend in returns to education is evident for both ethnic groups when moving up wage distribution. Sinhalese workers experience higher returns to education than for Tamil especially at the bottom of the wage distribution, but the difference becomes less at the upper part of the distribution. Estimated results with spline in years of education suggest that returns to secondary education are higher for Sinhalese workers, but the returns to tertiary education are greater for Tamil workers at the upper part of the wage distribution. Findings indicate that returns to experience are also higher for Sinhalese workers than for Tamil workers. Originality/value – This is the first study that examines sheepskin effects in the returns to education by ethnicity in Sri Lanka in a Mincerian framework, employing quantile regression models.

40|$|This thesis employs {{advanced}} econometric {{methods to}} understand the determinants of race inequalities in labour markets and in higher education in Brazil. It then investigates whether race diversity {{can be used as}} a policy to reduce existing inequalities in pay and college campuses. It uses data from the National Household Sample Survey PNAD of 2005 and the National Examination of Higher Education Courses (ENC/Provão) of 2003. The main methodological contributions of this thesis are: 1) extending wage models to include several variables which can explain more than 40 percent of the total variation in wages; 2) computing a proxy for parental education (this has not been possible to estimate using PNAD since 1996); 3) correcting wage equations for selection bias using a robust instrument (most studies ignore the sample selection problem by using employed males only); 4) implementing a new algorithm that combines Heckman Two-Step, complex sample weights and constrained least squares (this increases robustness of the detailed decomposition of the discrimination term). This is done in a generalized wage decomposition setting where the level of discrimination is invariant to the choice of the reference <b>wage</b> <b>group.</b> Results show an existing pay-gap and a significant level of discrimination against nonwhites even after corrections are made. Selection bias appears to underestimate the discrimination term considerably. This study also develops a theoretical framework for the study of the impact of diversity on labour productivity and on discrimination simultaneously. Results support policies which seek greater diversity in order to reduce the existing inequalities in labour markets and on higher education campuses. However, the outcome of policies aimed at increasing diversity on campuses can significantly differ depending on the existing level of diversity and the subject majors attended by students.

Learning while working is predicted to be able to account for wage divergence so far unexplained.

This selectivity can explain relative wages changes within as well as between <b>groups.</b> <b>Wage</b> divergence within <b>groups</b> is an equilibrium property in the 1970 s.

The reasonable practice of dividing household income by persons (or adults) in the household eliminates the widely noted increase in income inequality from 1980 to 1995, and calls into question whether income inequality decreased substantially from 1964 to 1975.

Contrary to expectations, the outcomes of these agreements show strong consistency across a range of substantive and procedural labour standards.
