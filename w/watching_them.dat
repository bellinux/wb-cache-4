5|$|In contrast, however, many Christian evangelists {{and church}} {{organizations}} {{took a more}} supportive role. For example, televangelist Jim Bakker expressed {{public support for the}} group Stryper, <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> perform and becoming personal friends with the band's members. Many new bands began to arise, eventually drawing the attention of record labels that specialized in Christian music.|$|E
5|$|Although {{humanity}} and the Overlords have peaceful relations, some believe human innovation is being suppressed and that culture is becoming stagnant. One {{of these groups}} establishes New Athens, an island colony {{in the middle of}} the Pacific Ocean devoted to the creative arts, which George and Jean Greggson join. The Overlords conceal a special interest in the Greggsons' children, Jeffrey and Jennifer Anne, and intervene to save Jeffrey's life when a tsunami strikes the island. The Overlords have been <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> since the incident with the Ouija board, which revealed the seed of the coming transformation hidden within Jean.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named Scott is also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

5|$|As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's {{artifact}} flies over William and hovers {{above his}} head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts {{the woman at}} gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William {{under the care of}} The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens {{the back door of the}} van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as frowning and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Massive Dynamic {{executive}} Mark Young (Ptolemy Slocum) {{delivers a}} {{presentation at the}} company’s Manhattan office. When he is done and the other attendees have left, he sees an unusual butterfly. Upon picking it up, he experiences a cut on his hand and is then attacked by a swarm. Mark jumps out of a window, to his death. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), despite preparing {{to go out to}} dinner with her sister, instead agrees to Phillip Broyles' (Lance Reddick) demand that she join the Fringe team's investigation at the scene. While examining the body, Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) sees lacerations on Young’s skin and notes a lack of corresponding tears on his shirt. At the scene, Olivia has a brief vision of her deceased lover John Scott (Mark Valley) <b>watching</b> <b>them,</b> which troubles her.|$|E
5|$|Outside, Madonna rummages debris, {{tries to}} make a phone-call from a payphone, gets frustrated, and starts smashing objects {{in front of her}} with the rod. Her actions catches the {{attention}} of a man, played by Howard. He picks up his sniper rifle to shoot at the object of disturbance, but seeing Madonna through the lens, runs after her. They meet each other at a destroyed building where both of them notice each other and circle around with weapons in their hand. They come close and instead of attacking they throw away the weapons, embrace each other and engage in a dance-routine. After they complete their dance, and the song ends, the couple notice a little boy <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> from the destroyed building. The video ends with the couple leaving the city with the little boy hand-in-hand together with a large dog, and a panorama of the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} two men street dancing in a white hall, with {{speakers}} and chairs scattered around. Shots of an audience lead to Roberts walking to a microphone positioned on a stage before she starts lip-synching, wearing a 1970s style outfit. After knocking over the microphone stand, Roberts performs a routine with three female back-up dancers in front of multiple speakers. During the chorus, she dances with the same three dancers, whilst shots of men <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> are shown. Roberts then leads the three women through the hall before they perform a dance section in {{the bridge of the}} track. Three men marching in a small white room are shown, leading to a shot of Roberts marching alongside a marching band of drummers. She is then shown in a multi-coloured sweater-dress, stood atop a speaker and surrounded by dancers. Final shots show Roberts producing shapes of letters L, O, V, and E with cheerleaders. The video ends with Roberts casually interacting with her dancers.|$|E
5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was <b>watching</b> <b>them</b> from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E
