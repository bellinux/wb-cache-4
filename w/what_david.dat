25|$|A {{conclusion}} of sorts appears at 1 Kings 1-2, concerning Solomon enacting a final revenge {{on those who}} did <b>what</b> <b>David</b> perceived as wrongdoing, and having a similar narrative style. While the subject matter in the Book(s) of Samuel is also covered by the narrative in Chronicles, it is noticeable that the section (2 Sam. 11:2–12:29) containing {{an account of the}} matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in 1 Chr. 20.|$|E

25|$|Leanne {{split up}} with Peter {{and started a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick. They book their wedding for Christmas Day but Leanne visits Peter after Peter confesses he wants her back. Leanne's sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) revealed all at the wedding, causing Nick to leave Leanne. Nick confides in his sister-in-law, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), and she reveals to him that Eva has been quietly causing trouble between him and Leanne. After a heart to heart, they give into temptation and sleep together. They agree {{that it was a}} mistake. Nick and Leanne reconcile and finally marry– just after Kylie announces she is pregnant. Nick encourages Kylie to have an abortion and she nearly goes through with it. David, who is desperate to start a family, discovers Kylie's pregnancy and stops her. David overhears Kylie talking about her one-night stand with Nick, and begins a vendetta on Nick and Leanne, which includes a poison pen letter to Leanne, stolen money, bad reviews on the internet and watering down the spirits at the Bistro. Nick and David went in the Bistro van and started arguing about the one-night stand with Kylie. David was desperate not to let Nick reveal all to Kylie and Leanne, as David feared losing Kylie if she found out <b>what</b> <b>David</b> had done to take revenge on Nick. David tried to get Nick to stop the van. In the struggle, David removes Nick's seatbelt and stops the van {{in the middle of the}} road, which results in the van being hit by a lorry, knocking them both unconscious. David wakes up shortly after with minor injuries, but Nick does not. Nick is left comatose and has a blood clot removed from his brain. While Nick is in his coma, Kylie gives birth to a baby girl, Lily. When Nick awakes from his coma, he suffers a panic attack when he sees David in front of him. Later, when Nick can talk more fluently, he blackmails David to get Lily a paternity test to see who the father is or he will tell the police and the Platt family how the accident was really caused. David does so, and with his friend Tina, he opens the results, revealing that David is the father of baby Lily. Nick later finds life frustrating when he cannot remember simple things. He is discharged from hospital with a walking stick, and goes to live with Leanne. On the day of Lily's christening everything is revealed. Leanne finds out about Nick and Kylie's one-night stand and the entire Platt clan discover that David caused the car accident. They disown David, but Nick is distraught when Leanne flees Weatherfield. She later comes back, but she splits up with Nick after he shouts at Simon and smacks her across the face at Christmas 2013. On the same day, Kylie goes on a drunken rampage and gets arrested. In January 2014, David and Kylie make up.|$|E

In addition {{to the need to}} add CGI backdrops to every shot, hanging upside down from wires whilst fighting proved to be <b>what</b> <b>David</b> Jason described as [...] "a nauseous experience". The sequence had to be filmed in very short bursts as [...] "all of the actors and stunt people could only manage around four to five minutes before they wanted to [...] ". Karen David, who played Liessa, pulled several stomach muscles during the filming, and Jason described the experience as like [...] "being hung upside-down like the last chicken at Sainsbury's...

500|$|The two {{panels of}} {{interlace}} {{use the same}} design, of <b>what</b> <b>David</b> H. Wright describes as the [...] "alternating pair thin-line type" [...] which he calls [...] "perhaps the most sophisticated of Insular interlace types". [...] The panels are symmetrical about a vertical axis, except for the left end of the upper panel, which is different. Whereas the other ends of the pattern finish in a flat line parallel with the vertical framing line, part of a shape like an incomplete D, the top left finishes in two ellipses pointing into the corners. [...] The lines forming the interlace patterns are coloured in the dark blue/black and the bright yellow, but differently. [...] In the lower panel the yellow colours the left half of the design, but the upper panel begins at the (deviant) left in the dark colour, then switches to yellow once the pattern changes to that used {{for the rest of}} the panels. [...] It continues in yellow until the central point, then changes to the dark colour for the right hand side of the design.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 25, Pryce {{graduated}} to Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body, joining the newly formed Token Racing team. The team was created by Tony Vlassopulos and Ken Grob after the original Token team closed down in 1973 {{due to a lack}} of financial backing which had led to the end of the previous Rondel Racing outfit. Pryce was given the seat thanks to his backing from Titan Properties, and <b>what</b> <b>David</b> Tremayne described as [...] "evident promise". Pryce made his début for the team at the BRDC International Trophy, a non-championship Formula One event held at Silverstone, but lack of an airbox and an engine cover, along with his shortage of experience in the car, made him the slowest driver of the 16 competitors during qualifying: 26 seconds slower than James Hunt's Hesketh in pole position. The Welshman retired 15 laps into the race with a gear linkage problem. Pryce's World Championship début came at the 1974 Belgian Grand Prix, where he qualified in 20th place, 3 seconds slower than the fastest time set by Clay Regazzoni. Once again, he failed to finish, completing 66 laps before retiring after a collision with Jody Scheckter's Tyrrell.|$|E

500|$|After the war, Falkes made Bedford Castle his {{headquarters}} and he expanded it considerably, resulting in <b>what</b> <b>David</b> Baker has {{described as a}} [...] "major refortification". Falkes destroyed the neighbouring churches of St Paul's and St Cuthbert's to make space for a new bailey, reusing the stone for the castle. The exact form of the castle after this expansion remains uncertain. The castle {{appears to have been}} quadrangular, with the western edge running along the rear of the modern High Street and the northern edge running along the modern roads of Ram Yard and Castle Lane. The castle had a new barbican; an outer and an inner bailey, with the inner bailey in the south-east corner, protected by an internal ditch and a stone-lined palisade; further stone lined ditches lay around the castle; and a new keep was built on the motte. Brown suspects that the new keep was probably a shell keep with a tower, similar to those built at Launceston or Bungay. The stone-lined palisades and ditches built at Bedford were very unusual in England – their closest equivalent are those found at Skenfrith Castle in Wales. The castle had a postern watergate facing towards the river, and a great hall within the inner bailey in the middle, at least 13 m (43 feet) wide and 40 m (131 feet) long. There was possibly a large stone gatehouse positioned on the outer bailey wall. A mound in the north-east corner of the castle probably supported a large tower.|$|E
500|$|The sun {{was shining}} {{on the morning of}} the final, and Somerset's captain Brian Rose was glad when Northamptonshire won the toss. The {{conditions}} favoured batting first, but had Somerset won the toss they would most likely have chosen to bat second, given their success in chasing throughout the season. Northamptonshire captain Jim Watts opted to field, giving Somerset the benefit of batting first. Somerset's opening batsmen began quickly, taking the score to 34 before Peter Denning was caught by the wicket-keeper George Sharp off the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz. His wicket in the seventh over brought in Viv Richards. Before going out to bat, Richards focussed his mind on the fact that [...] "it wasn't a day for daring, carefree sixes. It was a day for maturity". Rose played a patient innings for his 41 runs, before being bowled by Watts, leaving Somerset 95/2. At the other end, Richards was playing <b>what</b> <b>David</b> Foot described as [...] "a controlled gem". He remained at the wicket until the final over, scoring 117 runs in a chanceless innings. His boundaries were scored predominantly from straight drives and leg hits, powerfully struck. Ian Botham played aggressively when he came in at number five, scoring 27 runs off 17 deliveries, and Joel Garner played similarly when he batted towards the end of the innings, adding 24 runs to the total. Somerset batted through their full allocation of overs, finishing on 269/8. Of the Northamptonshire bowlers, Watts was the most economical, conceding 34 runs off his 12 overs. Tim Lamb conceded the most, allowing 70 runs to be scored from his 12. The wickets were shared by the bowlers; Watts, Lamb and Griffiths took two each, while Sarfraz Nawaz and Peter Willey claimed one apiece. Towards the end of the innings, Watts broke a bone in his right hand when catching a throw from the outfield, which prevented him from participating further in the match.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is an {{archaeologist}} {{and the central}} protagonist of Prometheus. After discovering a series of identical cave paintings depicting a star chart with her lover, Charlie Holloway, they convince Weyland Corporation founder Peter Weyland to finance an expedition to a probable origin candidate: the moon LV-223. After arriving at the moon and awakening in 2093 on the ship, the USCSS Prometheus, Shaw and Holloway introduce their theory that the star charts were created by Engineers: a hypothetical, technologically advanced species which created humanity. Entering the structure covering the Engineer ship, the Juggernaut (near where the Prometheus settled), Shaw discovers many Engineer corpses and a preserved head—proving her and Holloway's theory. After having sex with an infected Holloway, Shaw is impregnated with an extraterrestrial organism which she has surgically removed. She meets Peter Weyland, who had faked his death to remain alive long enough to meet an Engineer in cryosleep so his youth could be restored. After talking to Janek about the Engineers, Shaw concludes that they intended to destroy humanity and joins Weyland's expedition. She is subdued after she demands that an Engineer tell her why they intended to destroy humanity. After seeing the Engineer decapitate David and kill the expedition's crew, Shaw convinces Janek to sacrifice the Prometheus by flying the ship into the Juggernaut. She returns to the Prometheus life-support unit, where the Engineer attacks her; he is subdued and impregnated by Shaw's extraterrestrial offspring. David convinces Shaw to return for his head and body so he can pilot another Engineer ship, and she asks him {{to take them to}} the Engineer's home world. With a final report to Earth detailing the events, Shaw and David leave the moon. After David, whom Shaw has repaired, unleashes the mutagen against the Engineers and their ship crashes, Shaw sends a transmission of her singing [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] by John Denver. David later confesses to Walter that she [...] "did not die in the crash", as he initially claimed to the team from the colony ship Covenant, ten years after her disappearance. Walter later finds her dissected corpse, which David had used for his experiments to create a perfect version of the Alien, whilst Daniels finds sketches of <b>what</b> <b>David</b> had done to her.|$|E

2500|$|In Gombe National Park in 1960, Jane Goodall {{observed}} a chimpanzee, David Greybeard, poking pieces of grass into a termite mound and then raising the grass to his mouth. After he left, Goodall approached the mound and repeated the behaviour {{because she was}} unsure <b>what</b> <b>David</b> was doing. She found that the termites bit onto the grass with their jaws. David had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} [...] "fish" [...] or [...] "dip" [...] for termites. Soon after this initial discovery of tool use, Goodall observed David and other chimpanzees picking up leafy twigs, stripping off the leaves, and using the stems to fish for insects. This modification of a leafy twig into a tool was a major discovery: previously, scientists thought that only humans made and used tools, and that this was what separated humans from other animals.|$|E

It was lip-synched by an effeminate drug dealer played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth demanded the song be played over and over, once beating the protagonist while the song played. During filming, Lynch asked for the song to be played repeatedly to give the set a surreal atmosphere. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, [...] "I was mortified because {{they were talking about}} the 'candy-colored clown' in relation to a dope deal... I thought, 'What in the world...?' But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate <b>what</b> <b>David</b> gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to 'In Dreams'." ...|$|E
