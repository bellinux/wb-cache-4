[...] He ordered Liu Rengong to contribute troops, <b>while</b> <b>also</b> <b>inviting</b> Wang Rong and Wang Chucun's son and successor (Wang Chucun having died in 895) Wang Gao {{to join in}} the campaign as well. Liu claimed that he could not spare troops because he needed to defend against Khitan incursions, despite Li Keyong's repeated orders. Eventually, on one occasion, Liu threw Li Keyong's order onto the ground and tried to assassinate officers that Li Keyong had left at Lulong; they barely fled with their lives. In anger, Li Keyong launched a major attack against Liu in fall 897, but with him taking Lulong forces under Liu's son-in-law Shan Keji (單可及) lightly, he was defeated at Mugua Creek (木瓜澗, in modern Baoding), losing half of his troops, and the Lulong forces were only forced to withdraw due to a storm. After this battle, Liu became independent and was no longer under Li Keyong's command, entering into an alliance with Zhu Quanzhong instead.|$|E

Stormwater management as art? Absolutely. Rain is a resource that should be valued and celebrated, not merely treated as an urban design problem—and yet, traditional stormwater treatment methods often range from ugly to forgettable. This book shows that it’s possible to effectively manage runoff <b>while</b> <b>also</b> creating <b>inviting,</b> attractive landscapes.

5000|$|This work depicts Matisse's atelier (studio) that he {{had built}} for himself in 1909, entirely awash in one tone of vibrant, rusty red. At 64 inches by 51 inches, the {{interior}} still life successfully accomplishes a monumentality <b>while</b> <b>also</b> seeming <b>inviting.</b> Unassertive yellow lines create the outlines of Matisse’s furniture, creating objects out of the expansive red space. A grandfather clock sits approximately {{in the center of}} the composition, serving as a vertical axis that brings balance and harmony to the spatial discontinuities of the studio. The paintings and objects within the room, seemingly suspended in the sea of red, establish a sense of spatial depth by creating angles and perspective in an otherwise flat picture. They also give the eye a place to rest and bring a sense of harmony to the colors. Most of the objects are painted with whites, blues, and greens, colors that contrast and balance the thinly-applied red paint. There is also a tabletop that dominates the bottom left corner of the canvas, jutting out from the edge as if the viewer were next to it and looking down from a corner of the room. The spatial discontinuities of the table, the objects in the room, the chairs on the right side of the canvas, and the window on the left wall give the sense that this is the artist’s environment, dominated by creativity and color more than laws of natural order.|$|R

40|$|The {{heroine of}} Gertrude Stein’s “Melanctha,” the {{centerpiece}} {{story of her}} Three Lives (2006), is an unconventional character whose “wandering” entails involving herself in relationships with both men and women. As her lover Jefferson, contrary to Melanctha, {{on the other hand}} sets as “ethical” goal in life and strives to be “good,” there has persisted a tendency in readings of the story to read Jefferson and his classically Aristotelian moral values as superior to Melanctha. The objective {{of this article is to}} overturn this conclusion and reinstate Melanctha as ethical, through the framework of Lacanian psychoanalysis. Specifically, I will point to how Jefferson is in fact immersed in a false belief in the wholeness of the Symbolic, which is something that Melanctha continuously doubts. Melanctha refuses Jefferson’s attempts to decipher her and instead continuously heads towards the beyond of language, towards the “evil” real thing. Unobtainable as this real thing may be, “wandering” towards it while ever questioning what it may be is what Lacan claims is “ethical. ” As Melanctha remains a subject who does not know, <b>while</b> <b>also</b> <b>inviting</b> readers to “wander” with her, she is Lacan’s ethical subject...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{challenges}} {{writings on}} affect that locate affective dynamism in autonomic bodily responses while positing discourse and language as "capturing" affect. To move beyond such "verticalism", the paper seeks to further {{an understanding of}} language, and semiotics more broadly, as itself affective. Drawing on participatory research conducted in Rio de Janeiro, it uses poetic expression as a paradigmatic case of the affective life of semiotics. Conceptually, it builds on Guattari's discussion of affect in connection to Hjelmslev's semiotic approach and Bakhtin's account {{of the process of}} enunciation. It is argued that semiotics {{play a crucial role in}} conjuring affective intensities, whereby expressions themselves become affective, as they modify sensory and material registers including prosody and the voice. The argument thus leads to a new understanding of the expression of affect as well as the affectivity of expressions. As expressions become affective, they draw subjects into ongoing processes of affecting and being affected. Such a view moves away from conceptions of semiotics "capturing" or even "translating" or "constructing" affect. It also displaces prevalent conceptions of "affective transmission" in terms of the circulation of physical substances body to body. Moreover, it furthers discursive and semiotic methodologies <b>while</b> <b>also</b> <b>inviting</b> a reconsideration of affective ontologies...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Information {{provision}} {{is an important}} step in enabling pediatric patients to participate in healthcare. Storybooks and patient information brochures represent a channel through which children and adolescents with cancer are informed about their illness. However, the use of such written materials has received little academic attention. OBJECTIVE:The aim of this article was to carry out an exploratory analysis of written information resources for pediatric cancer patients. The potential of these to enhance patient participation will be discussed. METHODS:A convenience sample of 16 written resource materials in English and German were chosen for analysis. Thematic coding was carried out to identify major themes. RESULTS:Subthemes were summarized into 3 main categories: information on diagnosis, treatment, and illness experience. Information was provided on, for example, illness name and etiology, diagnostic and treatment procedures, emotions, and coping strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Storybooks and other written resources on cancer contain a broad array of information and describe illness-related issues to a varying extent. They represent an excellent possibility to ease patient participation in healthcare by providing them with necessary information <b>while</b> <b>also</b> <b>inviting</b> further discussion. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE:Nurses and other healthcare professionals can use written resource materials to engage in discussions with pediatric patients concerning their illness. Nurses {{should be aware of the}} information children and adolescents receive in these materials in order to be able to adequately answer questions that may arise or identify misunderstandings as well as lack of information...|$|E
40|$|In this project, I {{build on}} {{existing}} {{research in the}} critical intersection of media, sport, gaming and race to explore how fantasy football, an entertainment byproduct of the National Football League (NFL), rearticulates and recontexualizes the colonial ideology already prolific in the NFL and other products of American media culture. I investigate how fantasy football may represent an innocuous, yet exigent place to study the commodification and consumption of bodies in our contemporary media landscape {{because of the way}} that the increasingly popular game operates in a capitalistic logic, where NFL players are almost exclusively valued for their statistical production and fantasy football participants are positioned as 2 ̆ 2 owners 2 ̆ 2 of these players. Within this assumption, I analyze three specific colonial rhetorics of fantasy football: the language used to talk about NFL players in fantasy football discourse, the procedures of playing fantasy football and the numerical representation of NFL players within the game that serve as the main conduit for visual interactivity. Through a postcolonial lens, I argue that these various rhetorics in fantasy football serve to otherize, commodify, and ultimately dehumanize NFL players, <b>while</b> <b>also</b> <b>inviting</b> fantasy 2 ̆ 2 owners 2 ̆ 2 to attempt to control these bodies. However, because those who play fantasy football have no real access to the operations of the NFL or its players, I suggest that fantasy football participants become situated in an ideological illusion of control, caught in the contradiction between the game 2 ̆ 7 s colonial rhetorics and their own level of agency. Furthermore, I explore how these colonial rhetorics impact how we come to see, know and interact with race and rhetorically reshape black and white relations within the United States. In the end, I draw conclusions about the way colonial ideology functions and is rearticulated through fantasy football, as well as offer limitations of my own project and suggestions for future research...|$|E
