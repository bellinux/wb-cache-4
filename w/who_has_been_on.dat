Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence has discovered that the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> board for only a day.|$|E

During the meeting, none of the Malay Rulers take precedence above another and all are considered equal. Even the Yang di-Pertuan Agong has no precedence above the Malay Rulers and serves to represent the federal government. However, a Ruler <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the throne {{for a longer period}} of time is considered more senior and his advice is widely respected due to the wealth of his experience, but this advice need not necessarily be followed.|$|E
25|$|Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, early 1945. A Polish prisoner named Jankowski, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a death {{march from}} Auschwitz, brings a suitcase to the camp. When the inmates {{in the storage}} building open it, they discover a three-year-old child. Jankowski tells them he {{is the son of}} a couple from the Warsaw Ghetto, both of whom perished. Prisoner Kropinski becomes attached to the boy, and begs Kapo André Höfel to save him. Höfel, {{who is a member of}} the camp's secret communist underground, consults with senior member Bochow. He is instructed to send the child on the next transport to Sachsenhausen. Höfel cannot bring himself to do so, and hides him. Jankowski is deported to Sachsenhausen alone.|$|E

500|$|The story {{starts on}} 28 June 1914; Richard Hannay (Rupert Penry-Jones), a mining {{engineer}} and an intelligence officer during the Second Boer War, is in London following his recent return from Africa, finding England [...] "cliquey", [...] "class-bound" [...] and [...] "deathly, deathly dull". Evading German spies (Werner Daehn and Peter Stark), Scudder (Eddie Marsan) pushes himself into Hannay's flat and reveals {{himself to be}} a betrayed freelance British Secret Service Bureau agent, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the trail of a German espionage ring with headquarters in Scotland. He has heard rumours of a plot to assassinate a high-ranking European royal, which could lead to war. Believing he will soon be killed, he hands Hannay a notebook to pass to Captain Kell of the Secret Service Bureau. While Hannay answers the door, Scudder is shot by one of the German spies seeking his notebook who has entered the flat via a back door. The police arrive, and Hannay is arrested for murder before escaping.|$|E
500|$|The primary {{continued}} to grow more heated in February 2010. On February 5, the two candidates held their first face-to-face debate, and used the 30-minute forum to strongly criticize each other, with Sestak continuing to associate Specter with failed Republican policies and Specter arguing his opponent was more focused on criticizing him than debating policy. Sestak {{continued to}} attack Specter for switching parties, asking, [...] "Is the best the Democrats can do someone <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the other side, with respect, for 50 years, and cast 2,000 votes with President Bush?" [...] Likewise, Specter once again criticized Sestak's missed votes in Congress, which he said {{would have been enough}} to earn Sestak a court-martial for going AWOL in his former Naval career. Sestak also criticized Specter for voting in favor of the Iraq War, and Specter in turn condemned Sestak for supporting Obama's proposed troop increase for the War in Afghanistan, which Specter opposed. The next day, the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee voted to endorse Specter over Sestak, with 77 percent of voters supporting the incumbent Senator, or 229 votes compared to Sestak's 72. Sestak criticized the committee for its decision, but also argued it solidified his own position as a political outsider independent from the mainstream Washington establishment. Media outlets said the vote indicated Specter had convinced most important figures in the state party that he was not simply a crossover politician.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, Canada's {{minority}} Conservative government reversed {{a longstanding}} policy of automatically requesting clemency for Canadian citizens sentenced to capital punishment. The ongoing case of Alberta-born Ronald Allen Smith, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> death {{row in the}} United States since 1982 after being convicted of murdering two people and who continues to seek calls for clemency from the Canadian government, prompted Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day to announce the change in policy. Day has stated that each situation should be handled on a case-by-case basis. Smith's case resulted in a sharp divide between the Liberals and the Conservatives, with the Liberals passing a motion declaring that the government [...] "should stand consistently against the death penalty, {{as a matter of}} principle, both in Canada and around the world". However, an overwhelming majority of Conservatives supported the change in policy.|$|E

Part of the group continue to search for Clarke, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the run for three months due to now being a legend and subsequent target because of her defeat of the Mountain Men after Lexa's betrayal. This has earned her the nickname [...] "Wanheda" [...] (commander of death). Indra, one of Lexa's best and most trusted warriors, warns Lexa that the Ice Nation is marching on her; Indra is there when bounty hunter Roan (the banished Ice Nation prince) brings Clarke to Lexa, who sought to capture Clarke before members of Ice Nation did. Still angry at Lexa for her betrayal, Clarke is dragged out kicking and screaming while vowing revenge on Lexa.|$|E
2500|$|During the Yugoslav Wars some SRS {{supporters}} including Šešelj {{were active}} in paramilitary units loyal to Milošević, serving as his [...] "iron fist" [...] during military campaigns. Milošević's regime at times supported Šešelj and provided him with arms, whilst at others it accused him of war crimes. The SRS was also provided with resources to establish paramilitary volunteer forces such as the White Eagles. As the SRS protested against Milošević's extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2001, Milošević urged his supporters {{to vote for the}} SRS rather than his own SPS. The ICTY also indicted Šešelj, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> trial since 2007 following his surrender in 2003. Deputy President Nikolić became the new de facto SRS leader and presented a more moderate face, with a new approach to international cooperation and a vision of Serbia acting as a [...] "link between the West and the East." ...|$|E

40|$|Savęs žalojimas įkalinimo įstaigose sunkina reabilitacinį darbą, todėl ieškoma kognityvinių asmenybės struktūrų, kurias įmanoma koreguoti. Tyrime dalyvavo 285 nuteistieji. Rezultatai rodo, kad save žalojantiems, taip pat vyresnio amžiaus asmenims, įvykdžiusiems smurtinius nusikaltimus ir nuteistiems ilgesniam laikui, labiausiai reikia specialistų pagalbos – socialinių kompetencijų ugdymo ir kitokios vidinę darną skatinančios paramos. The self-harm {{behaviour}} of the convicted at correctional institutions negatively affects general psychological climate, rehabilitation, costs {{additional expenses}} {{and takes a}} lot of specialists’ time. Therefore, it makes sense to explore and rely on inner factors susceptible to correction while planning preventive measures. The aim of the research was to evaluate characteristics of sense of coherence and self-esteem among prisoners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the self-harm behaviour and prisoners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the self-harm behaviour. The hypothesis states that prisoners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the self-harm behaviour have lower levels of sense of coherence and self-esteem than prisoners <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the self-harm behaviour. The research group consisted of 80 convicted <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the selfharm behaviour and 205 convicted <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never harmed themselves. Methods employed: A. Antonovsky’s (1987) “Life orientation questionnaire” and M. Rosenberg’s (1965) “Self-esteem questionnaire”. The results showed that the convicted who were inclined to self-harm had lower sense of coherence and self-esteem indicators in comparison with those who were not inclined to self-harm. Lower indicators of sense of coherence and self-esteem are more characteristic to persons older in age; having convicted violent crimes; those who are sentenced for longer period of time. This should be taken into account when planning expedient self-harm prevention – social skills-building and narrative therapy promoting the sense of coherence...|$|R
