In 1908 Bixby's father James, an eastern professor who had moved west for a position at the Spade School, filed on and moved to a section of land four miles (6km) east of the Spade Ranch Headquarters. On March 3, 1909 the rest of the Bixby family arrived at the depot in Ellsworth. From the back of the wagon, as they freighted north from Ellsworth, Lawrence led their milk cow, Old Roanie, and as they passed the Spade Ranch store, Mike Peterson saw them from the front porch. The Spade Foreman laughed when he saw the Bixby piano in the wagon. [...] "I'll just give them six months," [...] he said. Bixby's mother Jennie worked as a ranch cook at the Spade Headquarters Cookhouse. Lawrence would later recall, [...] "Every time some old drunken cook drank up the extract, the foreman would send someone after mother. I used to go up and help her at the cookhouse. I rode Old Plunger and had an eleven dollar Sears Roebuck saddle." [...] In March 1909 James took Lawrence to a cattle sale near Hay Springs, Nebraska. There they bought 28 head of heifers for $467.00. This was the start of Bixby's herd {{and with the help of}} a neighbor they trailed the cattle south for the Spade. They stayed the first night at Newton's Ranch and the next at Sam Green's. [...] "Mr. Green couldn't read nor write," [...] Lawrence wrote, [...] "but he would tell us wonderful stories about Quantrill's Raiders. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the Spade and branded our heifers with the J Lazy B but before long Newton came with the sheriff and said he was short two white-faced heifers. We had no way to prove what we knew had happened, so we had to see them go". James chose the tranquil name of Cloverleaf Ranch for their new homestead but in the first year a rattlesnake bit their dog Spot, James killed a wolf and a neighbor threatened to contest Lawrence's sister Ina's homestead filing unless they gave him a cow, calf and a spool of wire.|$|E
60|$|We {{walked on}} until we reached {{that part of}} the Canongate street in which she lodged. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the door.|$|E
6000|$|About what {{distance}} is {{it from the}} observatory <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> last Thursday {{to the line of}} enemies' works you ranged the glass upon for me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those are {{two very}} {{remarkable}} facts, which {{never occurred to me}} before,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'The very first place <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at,</b> I'll make a note of them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{may have}} a chance to go aboard of a Japanese ship while <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Nagasaki. There must be a number of them at that port, coaling up and taking war {{supplies}} aboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{he saw the}} man at {{the wheel}} swerve a little in his seat, and he lifted the speaking-tube to his lips. [...] "Can we get through to Rakney, Murray," [...] he asked him, [...] "or shall <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> King's Lynn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But Dick hasn't done anything. I am sure of it. Why, I don't {{think he}} has seen her since <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> her home that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are on our}} way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz," [...] she answered, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> your cottage to {{pass the}} night." ...|$|E
60|$|He ran ahead, still {{swinging}} the pail. And we, following, came at length to a comfortable-looking farmhouse. As <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the doorway a stout, motherly woman filled it. She held her knitting in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry that}} is the one thing I can't do just now, when every moment of this weather is precious," [...] I said. [...] "If you can't wait until <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> noon, there's no {{apparent}} reason why you shouldn't state your business here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Trafalgar Square <b>we</b> [...] <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{the site}} of the War Room in the Cabinet ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as to that," [...] said Mr Tippet, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> all, {{there could}} be no {{reasonable}} objection to refreshments, although it is probable we might find it difficult to get anyone sufficiently enterprising to undertake the supply of such a line; for, you know, if the lever were to slip at the fulcrum and fall--" ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{drove up}} to London in her {{comfortable}} chariot: the children and servants following in a post-chaise. I paid, of course, for everything; and until our house in Berkeley Square was painted, <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> [...] "Stevens's Hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, thanks. It mainly needed rest, and I {{must confess}} that I didn't find it {{altogether}} a drawback when <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{the bottom of}} the big crag. I should have had to go up if I hadn't been lame." ...|$|E
60|$|And so we {{hurried out}} into the night and the rain. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the wood-shed and got an armful of dry kindling, which Euphemia was obliged to carry, as I had the bundle of bed-clothing, the umbrella, and the lantern.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see," [...] said Lisle, [...] "we {{have passed}} two tracks to the left, since we struck into this road. I cannot help {{thinking}} that these must lead to villages, {{and that the}} one we are following {{is a sort of}} connecting link between them. I vote that <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the next one we come to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Honest Hayraddin," [...] he said, [...] "thou hast {{travelled}} {{with us for}} ten days, yet hast {{never shown}} us a specimen of your skill in fortune telling, which you are, nevertheless, so fond of practising that you must needs display your gifts in every convent <b>at</b> which <b>we</b> <b>stop,</b> <b>at</b> {{the risk of being}} repaid by a night's lodging under a haystack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the morning," [...] replied Vittorio, [...] "before we set out, {{there will}} be coffee or tea, and bread and butter, with eggs. Then, when <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> noon, {{you will have a}} second breakfast of mutton chops, fried potatoes, fried fish, omelets, and other such things. Then, at night, when the day's journey is done, you will have dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> your camp {{you made}} things smooth for us. You gave Ruth some thrills, {{showed her the}} romance of track-grading, and {{generally}} helped her to a good time. Anyhow, the thing is fixed. We'll send the car for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it is. Now let me {{tell you}} something. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the village just north of here, and got the {{assistance}} of nearly a dozen men. They are scattered about, and should you attempt to molest us I shall give them a signal----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we got {{half way}} down <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> a pier {{where there was}} a train of cars to take people to Loch Lomond, {{on the way to the}} Highlands. Waldron said that we should come there, he supposed, when we go to the Highlands.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{should be}} more certain as to our {{whereabouts}} if <b>we</b> had <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> that heap of stones as I proposed, Mr. Fitzgibbon." ...|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the claims}} are not {{directed}} to an abstract idea under step {{one of the}} Alice analysis, {{we do not need}} to proceed to step two of that analysis[...] [...] [...] We think it is clear for the reasons stated that the claims are not directed to an abstract idea, and so <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> step one. <b>We</b> conclude that the claims are patent-eligible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no; {{we must go}} to {{the theatre}} and forget them. <b>We</b> can <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Brentano's for our tickets as we pass through Union Square." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are traveling," [...] replied Ojo, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> {{your house}} just {{to rest and}} refresh ourselves. I do not think Unc Nunkie cares very much to see the famous Crooked Magician; but for my part I am curious to look at such a great man." ...|$|E
60|$|The place <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> on {{the first}} night of our cycle trip is named Porlock, and after the walking and the pushing, and the strain on my mind when going down even the {{smallest}} hill for fear Jone's rope would give way, I was glad to get there.|$|E
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] said Gilbert, as they hurried along. [...] "There is {{one thing}} I forgot to tell you. Meeting Larry drove it {{completely}} out of my mind. On the way to this village <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> a place called Wikelipe, and there I met, whom do you suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us run!" [...] said Lettie, {{and joining}} hands we raced wildly along, with a flutter and a breathless laughter, till {{we were happy}} and forgetful. When <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>we</b> exclaimed <b>at</b> once, [...] "Hark!" ...|$|R
60|$|So, <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the Dazio, the town's customs hut, and velveteens {{has to pay}} {{for some}} meat and cheese he is {{bringing}} in. After which we slip into the cold high-street of Nuoro. I am thinking that this is the home of Grazia Deledda, the novelist, and I see a barber's shop. De Ledda. And thank heaven we are {{at the end of the}} journey. It is past four o'clock.|$|R
6000|$|... "Geraldine {{would simply}} love it," [...] she announced. [...] "She {{will be here}} in five minutes. Could <b>we</b> just <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> my house for a motor-coat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is but a}} small matter," [...] Simon answered; [...] "but I am a {{poor man}} and the payment would be welcome. Should it have chanced that <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> this island I should have craved your leave that I go ashore and ask for that which I have fairly won." ...|$|E
60|$|After that I {{was ready}} for {{anything}} that might happen. The lift had descended and the porter bade us enter. <b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> the third floor. In the open doorway {{of one of the}} flats Mr. Parker was standing, solid and imposing. He beckoned us, with a broad smile, to follow him.|$|E
60|$|On the way <b>we</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Harrison's office, {{where that}} gentleman left {{directions}} concerning {{things to be}} done during his absence. Evidently he was a thorough business man, and I {{could not help but}} wonder what he was worth when I saw him place several hundred dollars in bills in his pocketbook.|$|E
6000|$|Nobody washes out {{the corner}} of the corridor, though <b>we</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> {{stations}} long enough, and there are two more hours journey. Train officials go by and stare, passengers step over and stare, new-comers stare and step over. Somebody asks who? Nobody thinks of just throwing a pail of water. Why should they? It is all in the course of nature.--One begins to be a bit chary of this same [...] "nature", in the south.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>stopped</b> {{and looked}} <b>at</b> one another {{the moment we}} were alone again.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{makes us}} quite rich men. <b>We</b> will <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the first shop {{we come to}} and lay in a stock of bread and a pound or two of ham." ...|$|R
