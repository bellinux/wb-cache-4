He specialized in arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and relatives) and myriapods (centipedes, millipedes, and relatives), ranking {{among the most}} prolific arachnologists and myriapodologists in history. He described over 1,400 species of spiders, 1,000 species of millipedes, {{and the majority of}} North American centipedes, although the quantity of his output was not always matched <b>with</b> <b>quality,</b> leaving a mixed legacy to his successors.

5|$|In the 1910s, Omak {{was chosen}} as the {{location}} for a sawmill to expand economic growth. Omak Fruit Growers controlled the mill and a nearby orchard processing factory. The Biles-Coleman Lumber Company bought out the organization and built a sawmill outside municipal boundaries on the nearby Omak Mountain in 1924. A secondary sawmill was constructed in the Omak area. The company and their mills were purchased in 1975 by Crown Zellerbach and thus an associated organizationCavenham Forest Industriesacquired the mills. The company ultimately went bankrupt, and in response, employees purchased the mill for 45 million dollars and renamed it Omak Wood Products in an attempt to save their jobs. Omak Woods Products' payroll decreased to 480 in the early 1990s and later went bankrupt themselves, along <b>with</b> <b>Quality</b> Veneer, who later owned the property for 19 million dollars until 2000. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation later purchased the mill for 6.6 million dollars, having closed in 2009 because of low demand, ending over 130 jobs. As of 2013, there are proposals to reopen the mills during the summer season.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{identity}} is a mandatory requirement for RFID tags, despite special {{choice of the}} numbering scheme. RFID tag data capacity is large enough that each individual tag will have a unique code, while current bar codes are limited to a single type code for a particular product. The uniqueness of RFID tags means that a product may be tracked as it moves from location to location, finally ending up in the consumer's hands. This may help to combat theft {{and other forms of}} product loss. The tracing of products is an important feature that gets well supported with RFID tags containing a unique identity of the tag and also the serial number of the object. This may help companies cope <b>with</b> <b>quality</b> deficiencies and resulting recall campaigns, but also contributes to concern about tracking and profiling of consumers after the sale.|$|E
