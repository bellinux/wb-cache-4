5|$|From the nationalists' {{point of}} view, the Assyrian Levies were British proxies {{to be used}} by their 'masters' to destroy the new Iraqi state whose {{independence}} the British had consistently opposed. The British allowed their Assyrian auxiliary troops to retain their arms and granted them special duty and privileges: guarding military air installations and receiving higher pay than the Iraqi Arab recruits. Under British protection, the Assyrian Levies did not become Iraqi citizens after until 1924. The nationalists believed the British <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> the Assyrians to destroy Iraq's internal cohesion by becoming independent and by inciting others such as the Kurds to follow their example.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{calls were}} made to police in the United States Virgin Islands about downed power lines {{throughout}} {{the passage of the}} depression. High winds, gusting up to 40mph (65km/h) left roughly 500 people without telephone service on St. Croix. No major damage was reported on any of the affected islands in the wake of Christine. Residents in the drought-stricken regions of Florida <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> increased rainfall from the remnant wave of Christine; however, the system did not reach the United States before dissipating. The storm's remnants only produced squally weather in Florida on September7 and 8.|$|E
5|$|The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company {{formed a}} {{football}} team, New Brighton Tower F.C., and applied for membership to the Lancashire League. The team {{joined at the}} start of the 1897–98 season and promptly won the league. The club then applied for election to the Football League. Although they were initially rejected, the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted. They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> and so it was no longer considered financially viable.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of Ellandun {{went beyond the}} immediate loss of Mercian power in the southeast. According to the Chronicle, the East Anglians asked for Ecgberht's protection against the Mercians in the same year, 825, though it may actually {{have been in the}} following year that the request was made. In 826 Beornwulf invaded East Anglia, presumably to recover his overlordship. He was slain, however, as was his successor, Ludeca, who invaded East Anglia in 827, evidently for the same reason. It may be that the Mercians <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> support from Kent: there was some reason to suppose that Wulfred, the Archbishop of Canterbury, might be discontented with West Saxon rule, as Ecgberht had terminated Wulfred's currency and had begun to mint his own, at Rochester and Canterbury, and it is known that Ecgberht seized property belonging to Canterbury. The outcome in East Anglia was a disaster for the Mercians which confirmed West Saxon power in the southeast.|$|E
5|$|In 1095 Pope Urban II {{called for}} the First Crusade in a sermon at the Council of Clermont. He {{encouraged}} military support for the Byzantine Empire and its Emperor, AlexiosI, who needed reinforcements for his conflict with westward migrating Turks colonising Anatolia. One of Urban's aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the Eastern Mediterranean holy sites that were under Muslim control but scholars disagree as to whether this was the primary motive for Urban or those who heeded his call. Urban's strategy may have been to unite the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom, which had been divided since the East–West Schism of 1054 and to establish himself {{as head of the}} unified Church. The initial success of the Crusade established the first four Crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. The enthusiastic response to Urban's preaching from all classes in Western Europe established a precedent for other Crusades. Volunteers became Crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving plenary indulgences from the Church. Some <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a mass ascension into heaven at Jerusalem or God's forgiveness for all their sins. Others participated to satisfy feudal obligations, obtain glory and honour or to seek economic and political gain.|$|E

The Spencer family has been closely allied with the British royal family for several generations. Both of Diana's grandmothers had served as ladies-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Spencers <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a boy {{to carry on the}} family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and after Lady Diana Spencer, a many-times-great-aunt who was also a prospective Princess of Wales.|$|E

25|$|Seeking {{to expand}} their {{following}} outside Germany, the Puhdys recorded an English-language album, Far From Home in London with lyrical help provided by West German singer Wolfgang Michels. Consisting of re-recorded versions {{of some of their}} German hits, it failed to be the international breakthrough they <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for,</b> although it gave the band a chance to perform one-off concerts in several countries including the United States to try to generate interest. Like City's English album Dreamland, recorded the previous year, it was hampered by Birr's and Hertrampf's thickly accented English, though it won greater acceptance in Germany. Interestingly, the Fern, fern, fern backing vocals on the title track, originally Fern von Zuhause, were left in the original language.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies cricket team {{travelled}} to Australia in November, playing three Tests {{against the}} Australian {{team for the}} Frank Worrell Trophy. After a 05 whitewash on the last tour of Australia five years ago, the West Indies <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> a better result, but they never ran Australia closer than seven wickets in a Test match. Australia were inserted in the first Test, and after a spell after lunch yielded three wickets for Corey Collymore and Australia were 111 for 4, Ricky Ponting put on a century stand with Adam Gilchrist, and double-digit contributions {{from the rest of}} the order (excluding the number 11 Glenn McGrath) gave Australia a total of 435. West Indies were then rolled over twice, for 210 and 129, with Australia batting to 283 for 2 declared in between, as they lost by 379 runs. The second Test saw the West Indies win the toss, bat, and surrender a 257-run first-innings lead. Dwayne Bravo hit a career-best 113 in the second innings, sharing a 182-run seventh-wicket stand which set a target of 78 for the Australians, but they still won by nine wickets. Brian Lara made an unbeaten double ton on the first day of the third Test, ending on 226 to set a Test career record with his 11,204 runs at the end of the match. However, Australia made 428 when they batted, Shane Warne took six for 80 and helped take the West Indies apart to 204 in the second innings, and Matthew Hayden's 87 not out gave Australia victory on the final day. The West Indies Cricket Board later lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council, regarding the umpiring decisions in the series, asking for video assessment of the decisions made. The ICC general manager Dave Richardson later acknowledged that errors had been made.|$|E

25|$|Charles' Vicar Herbert and {{his family}} were safely within castle Mategriffon, but after {{negotiations}} the rebels granted Herbert {{and his family}} safe conduct to leave the island upon a promise that they never return. After the restoration of order in the city, the townsmen announced themselves a free commune answerable only to the pope. They elected leaders, one of whom was Bartholomaeus of Neocastro who was prominent in the unfolding events and would later chronicle much of the revolt in Historia Sicula, an important if sometimes contradictory source of information for historians. Again significantly, the leaders' next act was to send word, via a Genoese merchant named Alafranco Cassano, to the Emperor Michael advising him that his nemesis Charles had been crippled. Only thereafter were ambassadors sent to Pope Martin IV pleading for each city on the island to be recognised as a free commune under the sole suzerainty of the Holy Church. The islanders <b>were</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>for</b> status such as enjoyed by Venice, Genoa, Pisa and other cities, free to form their own government, but morally answerable only to the pope who would hold a vague and unstable suzerainty. However, the French pope was firmly in Charles' camp and he directed the Sicilians to recognize Charles as their rightful king. But Martin underestimated the Sicilians' hatred of the French, and especially of Charles, who ruled from Naples rather than Palermo, where he could have seen the suffering caused by his officials. Charles' island officials were far removed from his oversight; he did not see the avarice, the rape, theft and murder, nor did he see the high taxes levied against the meager possessions of the peasants, which kept them impoverished, but made no improvement in their lives.|$|E
