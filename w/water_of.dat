Determination of uranium isotopes was done by alpha-spectrometry method with previous radiochemical preparation (coprecipitation on iron hydroxide, extraction with tributyl phosphate and electrodeposition on stainless steel disk) on alpha-spectrometer of «Canberra». On the basis of experimental data, the ratios of uranium- 234 to uranium- 238 were calculated, uranium isotope chart of determination of genetic composition <b>of</b> <b>water</b> were built and investigated.

5|$|Actual {{purification}} of {{the waste}} water from the Brussels-Capital Region was not completed until the 21st century, when two purification stations were built.

The north station, completed in March 2007, is located near the border of the Brussels-Capital Region, between the Senne and the Charleroi-Willebroek Canal, near Buda Bridge. A portion of the cost was footed by the Flemish Government, as 7 of the adjacent municipalities lie within the Flemish Region. This station is capable of treating the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> 1,100,000 inhabitants and should finally be capable of fully purifying the Senne, which had long caused much of the pollution of the Scheldt river.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of Dunedin's settlement, much of the city's growth was on two areas of {{reasonably}} flat land close to the harbour, separated by the large Bell Hill and an area of low swampy land. The northern of these two flat areas surrounded the floodplain of the <b>Water</b> <b>of</b> Leith, a small river that runs through Dunedin. As the city grew the swamp was drained to become the new city's centre, and the hill was lowered by excavation to allow access between the two areas of settlement. A street grid was set up with the main road split in two by the city centre (now The Octagon) - Princes Street to the south and George Street to the north. As with many of the city's other place names, both these names and that of the <b>Water</b> <b>of</b> Leith reflect the names of places in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to <b>water</b> <b>of</b> different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater.
