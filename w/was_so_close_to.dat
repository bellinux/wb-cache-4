5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, {{the idea that he}} was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the World Trade Center site, {{there were}} {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated {{at that time}} that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E

5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, or at least not one who <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
5|$|Stanford's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense began {{from its}} 20-yard line. The Hokies gained their initial first {{down of the}} game when quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{completed}} a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale on the drive's third play, but Tech was unable to gain another. Tech punted from its 43-yard line, and the kick was downed at the Stanford 5-yard line, where the Cardinal offense started work. Two rushing plays were stopped for no gain, then Luck attempted a passing play on third down. Because {{the line of scrimmage}} <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Stanford goal line, Luck had to move into his own end zone to attempt the pass. Under pressure from the Virginia Tech defense, he threw to Derek Hall, who caught the ball in the end zone and was tackled before getting out. The result of the play was a safety, a 2-point defensive score for Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire {{as best he could}} while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{first officer}} misinterpreted the No. 4 engine’s fuel {{pressure}} drop {{as a sign}} of incipient engine failure and feathered the prop.

A sample of artefacts were catalogued and conserved for public display.

25|$|The British {{government}} did not find this response satisfactory and it eventually brought its case to the International Court of Justice, having failed {{in its attempt to}} involve the Security Council in the matter. It was the first case adjudicated by the ICJ, and in December 1949 the court awarded the British the sum of £843,947 or US$2,009,437 having found that, irrespectively of who laid the mines, the Albanians ought to have observed any such action, since the minefield <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> their coast, and thus they failed to inform the British of the danger. The Court also rejected the self-defence argument advanced by the United Kingdom and found that the mine-clearing operations undertaken by the British during Operation Retail, in the absence of prior Albanian consent, were illegal.|$|E

25|$|The city of Plymouth was {{hit hard}} during the Second World War {{due to its}} {{strength}} as a military base: HMNB Devonport was the largest naval base in Western Europe. As the ground <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the city centre and Plymouth Sound, {{it was unlikely that}} it would escape unharmed. The Football League was abandoned three games into the 1939–40 season, but Home Park continued to host matches until summer 1940 in the hastily organised South West Regional League. In April 1941 there was a series of Luftwaffe bombing raids on the city, known as the Plymouth Blitz; Home Park did not escape. The Grandstand was all but destroyed after sustaining multiple hits and the pitch was littered with impact craters, which left the club facing a major rebuilding operation when the war ended in 1945.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding {{his marriage to}} Rachel remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. By May 1806, Charles Dickinson, who, like Jackson, raced horses, had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a duel. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined {{it would be best}} to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> his heart that it could not be removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.|$|E
25|$|The Champions Trophy was {{the brainchild}} of Jagmohan Dalmiya, who was ICC {{president}} in the late 1990s. It had a dual aim of spreading the game to emerging nations and raising money for the ICC in between World Cups, thus enabling it to pump more cash into those fledgling cricket countries. The first tournament, labelled as a mini World Cup, was staged in Dhaka in October 1998 and raised more than £10 million. The second, in Nairobi, was a commercial success although the crowds stayed away. By the time the 2002 event was held – and there was disquiet as it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the World Cup five months later – the idea of playing in developing nations had been ditched and as revenue-generation was the main raison d'etre, it needed to be in one of the main countries as this allowed the format to be expanded. In 2004 the jamboree moved to England and it became clear the format of group games led to too many meaningless games. By the time the 2006 tournament in India came into view, the event was under fire from some quarters, and at one time there were even hints that India might decline to take part in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Grand Duke Michael {{was second}} {{in the line of}} {{imperial}} succession after his nephew, Tsarevich Alexei, but Alexei suffered from hemophilia and it was feared that he would not live long enough to inherit the throne. Under Russian House Law, Michael, {{as a member of the}} imperial family, could not marry without the consent of the ruling monarch, Nicholas II. Nicholas would not grant permission for Michael to marry Natalia, however, because Natalia was twice divorced and not of royal blood. In 1912, Alexei suffered a life-threatening hemorrhage in the thigh and groin while the family was at Spala, Poland. Michael feared that Alexei would not survive, which would make him heir and the possibility of his marriage to Natalia even more remote. Consequently, Michael decided to marry Natalia anyway. They married in a Serbian Orthodox Church in Vienna on 16 October 1912. A few days later George, his newly-wed parents, and Natalia's daughter from her first marriage met up in Cannes. From there, Michael wrote to his mother and brother to inform them of the marriage. The imperial family was shocked, seeing it as a betrayal of duty, especially as it was done while the Tsarevich <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> dying. Michael and his family were exiled from Russia. They stayed in grand hotels in Cannes, Paris, Chexbres, Bad Kissingen and London before settling in England in September 1913.|$|E
