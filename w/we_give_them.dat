In {{a letter}} to the editor of the Boston Globe written on January 8, 2012, Brown wrote, [...] "With out-of-control {{government}} spending and rising debt and deficits, politicians in Washington have proven time and time again that they cannot manage hard-earned taxpayer money responsibly. So why should <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> even more?" ...|$|E
500|$|Outliers has two parts: [...] "Part One: Opportunity" [...] {{contains}} five chapters, and [...] "Part Two: Legacy" [...] has four. The {{book also}} contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell {{as people who}} do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble The Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: [...] "It's not enough to ask what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't." [...] Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Dawkins and {{biologist}} John Maynard Smith {{participated in}} an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed {{the advice of his}} late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because [...] "what they seek is the oxygen of respectability", and doing so would [...] "give them this oxygen by the mere act of engaging with them at all". He suggests that creationists [...] "don't mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> recognition by bothering to argue with them in public." [...] In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that [...] "among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know." [...] When Moyers questioned him {{on the use of the}} word theory, Dawkins stated that [...] "evolution has been observed. It's just that it hasn't been observed while it's happening." [...] He added that [...] "it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn't actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems in the June 1796 Critical Review selected [...] "To Fayette" [...] {{as an example}} of Coleridge's poetry, stating, [...] "The Effusions are in general very beautiful. The following will please every lover of poetry, and <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> as a specimen of the rest".|$|E
2500|$|The New Pornographers went {{on their}} first tour to promote the album. The tour {{presented}} problems, including throat damage, broken-down buses, and having to take expensive cab rides. A.C. Newman spoke positively about the tour, stating, [...] "There's been fairly good crowds, but the shows haven't been that crazy. They've been getting better... We're not really a party band. I hope people can party. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> the music! Isn't that enough?" [...] The tour sold out.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 the Department of Counselling Services' Family Resource Centre {{organized}} Cayman Islands' first IMD observation {{consisting of}} two events; The 1st Annual International Men's Day Football Tournament & Expo open to the public, and secondly a [...] "Give Boys the Best Possible Start in Life" [...] Roundtable Discussion as a featured broadcast. Miriam Foster, Acting Programme Coordinator of the Family Resource Centre said, [...] "We feel {{it is important that}} boy's issues are highlighted and <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> an opportunity to express themselves." ...|$|E
5000|$|No nuns {{broke into}} our homes to kidnap our children. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> {{up to what}} we {{convinced}} ourselves was the nuns’ care. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> up maybe to spare them the savagery of gossip, the wink and the elbow language of delight in which the holier than thous were particularly fluent. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>them</b> up because of our perverse, in fact, morbid relationship with what is called respectability. Indeed, {{for a while it}} seemed as if in Ireland our women had the amazing capacity to self-impregnate. For their trouble, we took their babies and gifted them, sold them, trafficked them, starved them, neglected them or denied them to the point of their disappearance from our hearts, our sight, our country and, in the case of Tuam and possibly other places, from life itself.

2500|$|There was {{controversy}} surrounding the judges' comments over the audition of a Special Olympics participant named Jonathan Jayne. American Idol producer Ken Warwick responded saying that [...] "It's not a conscious decision, It's {{just that the}} {{further we go in}} the series, there are less and less good singers, so the numbers are made up by more bad ones." [...] Warwick said that he thinks everyone has the right to audition, and added that in some instances when there are singers with certain disabilities who just want to meet the judges, the producers will [...] "turn the cameras off and bring them in. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> a good experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 10 July 2012, Abbas and {{his sons}} were attacked, in the US Congress, for their alleged corruption. The debate was {{entitled}} Chronic Kleptocracy: Corruption Within the Palestinian Political Establishment In his testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Middle East and South Asia, Elliott Abrams stated that [...] "Corruption is an insidious destroyer not only of Palestinian public finance but {{of faith in the}} entire political system. And it has certainly had an impact on potential donors. I can tell you from my own experience, as an American official seeking financial assistance for the PA from Gulf Arab governments, that I was often told [...] "why should <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> money when their officials will just steal it?" [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{differences}} amongst theaters in Chicago and Under the Gun's ensemble, the theater's artistic director explained: [...] "I think what makes us different is our ensemble. Our idea of the ensemble is {{we are going to}} bring in a large group of people that we like, and we try to empower them to do the best work they can do. And <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> plenty of chances to fail with the only consequence of failing being that the show closes and they get to try another show...That’s a very different mindset than other theaters. I have to have the mindset of if a person is struggling in the show, is there anyway I can help them perform better? Because I am stuck with them. Unless I can trick them into punching me in the face, I can’t cut them." ...|$|E

2500|$|American {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} cosmologist Lawrence Krauss said, [...] "Christopher was {{a beacon of}} knowledge and light {{in a world that}} constantly threatens to extinguish both. He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning {{only to the extent that}} <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>them</b> meaning." [...] Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show Real Time with Bill Maher, saying, [...] "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time." [...] Salman Rushdie and English comedian Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens Vanity Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the New Statesman wrote, [...] "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens' illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he is increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like." [...] The Chronicle of Higher Education asked if Hitchens was the last public intellectual.|$|E
