5|$|Pat Moran, {{the foreman}} of a {{construction}} gang, {{worked hard to}} save up {{enough money to pay}} for the passage of his wife and daughter to their new home in America. On the day of their arrival, he heads to the pier to greet them and becomes involved in a serious accident. He is injured and taken unconscious to the hospital as an unidentified patient. His wife and daughter know nothing of what has befallen him and struggle to live in the city. The daughter gets a position in a sweatshop, and her eyesight deteriorates until she is unable to <b>work</b> <b>anymore.</b> Now blind, she resorts to playing the violin for money while her mother becomes a beggar.|$|E
25|$|Emancipation in the British West Indies in 1838 freed over {{one-half}} million slaves, {{transforming the}} islands’ societies and economies. Most freedmen {{preferred not to}} do plantation <b>work</b> <b>anymore,</b> and the sugar industries gradually declined. The white colonial elites and mulatto middle classes managed to reconstruct the social hierarchy so that the blacks remained at the bottom. In such a precarious position, black freedmen had to take any jobs that appeared, including those abroad. Thus, began the trans-Caribbean migration phase of the diaspora.|$|E
500|$|Nowitzki dated Sybille Gerer, {{a female}} {{basketball}} player from his local club DJK Würzburg. The relationship started in 1992 and lasted for 10 {{years before it}} eventually ended; Nowitzki said, [...] "At the end, we found out we developed in separate ways. ... It did not <b>work</b> <b>anymore,</b> but we are still good friends." [...] He added: [...] "I surely {{want to start a}} family and have kids, but I cannot imagine it happening before I become 30." ...|$|E

500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't <b>work</b> <b>anymore</b> and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gerard Way {{also said}} in a November 2009 {{interview}} with Rock Sound that the fourth album would be their defining work. [...] "A friend who heard the record recently said he now {{had no interest in}} listening to our older <b>work</b> <b>anymore,</b> that we had made all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the next thing you should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the war over, Cohl quit Éclair in May 1920 {{and made}} his last {{significant}} film, Fantoche cherche un logement [...] It was released as La Maison du fantoche [...] in April 1921 by AGC. [...] The only notice paid {{to it in the}} trade journals was a one-line plot summary. Nobody cared about Cohl's <b>work</b> <b>anymore,</b> or any other French filmmaker, for that matter. Cohl's career was finished, since there was no longer any way to justify the cost of an animated short subject in a world of live-action features.|$|E

30|$|Negative {{anticipation}} {{could be}} caused by a breakdown of psychological mechanisms which usually leads to a positive self-perception. Knowing that one is soon becoming self-employed, individuals do not deceive themselves about their actual <b>work</b> life <b>anymore</b> and come to a less positive evaluation of working conditions.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the planet}} Ter21 social class is {{divided on the}} {{fortunate}} (common and aristocrats) who reside at the top, and the others (including the mutants led by Gorgo the Foul who represent the poor living in misery, {{on the fringes of}} society, minorities of all kinds) who live down in the pits. At the top, it's a near-panopticonical dystopia with standard TV program (with the same presenter Diavaloo) depicting filmed violence for public consumption, and indoctrination. Seemingly no one <b>works</b> <b>anymore,</b> and all the life is mediated through the TriD (TV), even their dreams. People are addicted to [...] "love drug" [...] amorine, while the president is engaged in repeated body transplants. The masculine role is ridiculed by mass-produced holographic prostitutes. The technopriests represent the most damning, avaricious human drives.|$|R
2500|$|In January 1946 Zorner {{was moved}} to a harsher {{environment}} in a coal mine. He heard a rumour that officers of Major rank and above could {{not be forced to}} work. He refused to <b>work</b> <b>anymore</b> and was subjected to punishment by the NKVD. The following day he was locked in solitary confinement. The following morning Zorner explained that he would prefer to work as a carpenter and the NKVD officers agreed. From April 1946 the conditions slowly improved in the camp. Ill-treatment from the guards, which had been rare anyway, stopped altogether. [...] At the end of 1947 the prisoners were allowed to send letters to Germany. In 1948 they were permitted to receive packages from their families. In March 1949, Zorner and others planned to escape to Turkey, but events overtook them and the prisoners were repatriated to Germany.|$|E

30|$|Pension {{reform is}} a task {{involving}} a number of actors. A key problem behind this is that they commonly strongly discount today versus tomorrow. That stems from human nature {{as well as from}} limited knowledge of pension systems. The latter was not so much needed in the past, while it has become necessary recently, now that pension systems do not <b>work</b> properly <b>anymore</b> and require reforms. Designing and implementing reforms – unless implemented in times of strong austerity forced by the current situation – is a forward looking goal.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} place, I {{want to thank}} my {{supervisor}} Prof. Dr. Hans Burkhardt. All the time he supported my work with many valuable suggestions and fruitful discussions. Moreover, he created an excellent working environment, and he allowed me great latitude which have extremely stimulated me. Furthermore I am grateful to Prof. Dr. Friedrich Wahl for his agreement to act as the second referee, and I want to thank Prof. Dr. Backofen and Prof. Dr. Thiemann for spending their time on reading the thesis and asking many good questions during the disputation. Such a large project like the pollenmonitor can never be realized alone. I am very thankful to all partners who have contributed to this project. The most prominent is Dr. Eckart Schultz from the German Weather Service, the “father ” of the pollenmonitor. Without his optimism, his engagement, his endurance {{and his ability to}} convince the deciders at the various levels, the project would never have reached the present state. The second most important partner was Ulrich Heimann also from the German Weather Service. We three (Ulli, the pollenmonitor and I myself) have spent many days, evenings and weekends together, and nothing <b>worked</b> <b>anymore</b> each time one of us was indisposed. On the algorithmic and the software side I have benefited a lot from all the other PhD students, regular students and HiWi’s at our institute. I am especially grateful to Qing Wang for the very fruitful tea...|$|R

It didn't end up getting <b>worked</b> on <b>anymore.</b> It got to a point and Stone was over it. I think maybe to some degree Ed probably wasn't totally happy with where it was at, so it never came out. I think there's great guitar on that song.|$|R
