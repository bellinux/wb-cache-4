500|$|Kilner was a {{favourite}} of cricket writer Neville Cardus, who attributed several sayings {{to him in}} his prose.

[...] Few from the Alliance took this claim seriously. UMNO politicians insisted that a [...] "Malaysian Malaysia" [...] implied total equality, entailing the removal of Malay privileges. Senu Abdul Rahman, a federal Minister, felt Lee's advocacy of equality would deny the Malays the possibility of economic participation: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> opportunity, the opportunity to obtain economic wealth for our people." [...] Condemning Lee for stating he was a Malaysian by his own right, Senu asked: [...] "The right which Lee is enjoying today did not fall from the sky or out of the blue. It was given to him. Doesn't he have some feeling of gratitude to the natives of this country?" [...] Lee answered: [...] "No, I am not enjoying anyone's hospitality. I am here as of right. And 61 per cent of the people of Malaysia have to stand by that or it is lost. Without it they would have no future." [...] Some, such as Syed Jaafar Albar, took Senu's stance further and referred to the Malays, as the Bumiputra, as [...] "masters of the house", whose hospitality was being abused by the bangsa asing (aliens) or orang tumpangan (lodgers) such as Lee. This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun insisting [...] "we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{collection}} of private correspondence published by David Ben Gurion contained {{a letter written}} in 1937 which {{explained that he was}} in favour of partition because he didn't envision a partial Jewish state {{as the end of the}} process.

2500|$|The New Zealand Division {{was formed}} in March 1916, with Russell {{division}}al commander, and was sent to France the next month. With scant preparation, the division became operational in May 1916 in the Armentières sector of the Western Front. Soon it was involved in supporting the Somme Offensive, exposing problems and straining the men as extensive raids and patrols were carried out. Russell pushed for improvement, his goal being to create the best division in France. He inspected units daily and regularly visited the front line. Russell was a strict disciplinarian, and cracked down on high levels of desertion by recommending {{the death penalty for}} those found guilty of it. However, only five deserters were eventually executed and all were given posthumous pardons in 2000. Russell's insistence on rigid discipline was balanced by intensive training and tempered by close attention to the welfare of the troops under his command. In a letter to James Allen, the New Zealand Minister of Defence, Russell wrote: [...] "What <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> a platoon officer who will look after his men exactly as a mother does her boy of 10".|$|E
