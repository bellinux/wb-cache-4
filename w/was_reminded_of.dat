5|$|Shortly after Beebe's {{return from}} this expedition, Anthony Kuser {{requested}} that Beebe produce a condensed, popular {{version of his}} pheasant monograph. The book which resulted from this, titled Pheasants: their Lives and Homes (also known by the title Pheasants of the World), was released in 1926 and received the John Burroughs Medal. During the course of writing this book, Beebe <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> many experiences during the pheasant expedition which he had not included in his original monograph, and wrote an additional book titled Pheasant Jungles about his adventures during this expedition. While A Monograph of the Pheasants had been a factual account of this expedition, Pheasant Jungles was a somewhat fictionalized account, in which Beebe altered some aspects of his experience in order {{to appeal to a}} wider audience.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, while {{staying in}} Paris, he <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> trunks he had {{stored in the}} Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway {{discovered}} they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, {{when he returned to}} Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A Moveable Feast. By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.|$|E

5|$|News of the {{invasion}} quickly spread around the world via ambassadors and correspondents in Korea. Journalists in the United States were reporting on {{the invasion}} within five hours of the initial attack, and United States Ambassador to Korea John J. Muccio sent a telegram to the US State Department at 21:26 EST (10:26 KST) June 24. As the combat grew more intense, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson informed US President Harry S. Truman (who had been resting {{at his home in}} Independence, Missouri for the weekend), and Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie of the situation. The attack was particularly troubling to Truman, who likened it to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and to Lie, who <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the Invasion of Norway during World War II. Fearing the attack would spur a World War III, Truman resolved to act as quickly as possible to prevent an escalation of the conflict. Muccio met with Rhee, who informed him the South Korean Army would run out of ammunition within ten days, and {{would not be able to}} hold back the invasion on its own. He requested the United Nations and the United States assist South Korea in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and put all the blame on the Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E
25|$|In September 1941 the British War Cabinet ordered German {{civilians in}} Persia to be interned, which was against {{international}} law. Hitler in response ordered the internment of British civilians, {{most of which}} were {{to be found in the}} Channel Islands. 10 British for 1 German and shipped to the Pripet Marshes. The Islands had been ordered to carry out a census, so the Germans knew the place of birth of every Islander. Such a reprisal act was against international law. The Germans in the islands delayed, however in August 1942 Hitler <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the issue by a Swiss trying to arrange an exchange of prisoners for British civilians and reissued his order when he found his initial 1941 order had not been acted upon.|$|E

As intended, Bhima <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> an oath he had taken after the game of dice to crush Duryodhana's thighs. Bhima viciously attacks Duryodhana with a mace and strikes his thigh, mortally wounding Duryodhana. After having his face insultingly kicked by Bhima, Duryodhana bemoans that he was slain by unfair means, given that it was illegal to attack below the waist. Infuriated at the violation, Balarama, the brother of Lord Krishna, raises his weapon in attack. Lord Krishna consoles Balarama, by reminding him of Duryodhana's evil deeds. Relenting but fuming, Balarama curses Bhima to be known {{in the world as}} a crooked warrior and blesses Duryodhana with glory, naming Duryodhana his greatest pupil.|$|E
25|$|Casaubon has {{a romance}} with a Brazilian woman named Amparo. He leaves Italy {{to follow her}} and spends a few years in Brazil. While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the Colonel's conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently in a trance. Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply disturbing and embarrassing, as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E
500|$|According to Pitchfork Media, Wainwright [...] "started {{listening}} to the Carnegie Hall album {{in the weeks and}} months after September 11, craving some cheap showbiz cheer, but wound up discovering something deeper".

500|$|Hachisuka {{believed}} the carnivorous habits described by Tafforet to be unlikely for a starling, and thought {{the lack of}} a crest suggested that it was not closely related to Fregilupus. He <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> corvids because of the black-and-white plumage, and assumed the bird seen by Tafforet was a sort of chough. In 1937, he named it Testudophaga bicolor, and coined the common name [...] "bi-coloured chough". Hachisuka's assumptions are disregarded today, and modern ornithologists find Tafforet's bird to be identical to the one described from subfossil remains.|$|E

500|$|According to Méliès's memoirs, {{his initial}} {{attempts}} to sell A Trip to the Moon to French fairground exhibitors met with failure {{because of the}} film's unusually high price. Finally, Méliès offered to let one such exhibitor borrow a print of the film to screen for free. The applause {{from the very first}} showing was so enthusiastic that fairgoers kept the theater packed until midnight. The exhibitor bought the film immediately, and when he <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> his initial reluctance he even offered to add 200 to compensate [...] "for [...] inconvenience."

500|$|Impressed by her success, Snively {{arranged}} {{a contract for}} Monroe with an acting agency in June 1946. After an unsuccessful interview with producers at Paramount Pictures, she was given a screen-test by Ben Lyon, a 20th Century-Fox executive. Head executive Darryl F.

Monroe's contract began in August 1946, and she and Lyon selected the stage name [...] "Marilyn Monroe". The first name was picked by Lyon, who <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> Broadway star Marilyn Miller; the last was picked by Monroe after her mother's maiden name. In September 1946, she divorced Dougherty, who was against her having a career.|$|E
500|$|Jackson, who had counseled the Eatons to marry, {{refused to}} believe the rumors, telling his Cabinet that [...] "She is as chaste as a virgin!"

Jackson also believed that John Calhoun fanned the flames of the controversy as a way to gain political leverage for a growing anti-Jackson coalition. Duff Green, a Calhoun protégé and editor of the United States Telegraph, accused Eaton of secretly working to have pro-Calhoun cabinet members Samuel D.

The San Francisco-based string quartet Kronos Quartet—who previously performed for the Requiem for a Dream soundtrack—and Scottish post-rock band Mogwai {{also contributed to}} the film score. Mansell researched possible scores to compose one tying together the three storylines and sought to have an organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have [...] "a real human element to them that breathes." [...] While reading the script, Mansell <b>was</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>of</b> the post-rock music of Mogwai as well as Godspeed You!
