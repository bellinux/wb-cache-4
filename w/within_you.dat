In turn, both Gandhi and Martin Luther King had read Tolstoy, and King, Gandhi and Tolstoy had been strongly influenced by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. King quoted Tolstoy's War and Peace in 1959.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} thinker {{who contributed}} to pacifist ideology was Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. In one of his latter works, The Kingdom of God is <b>Within</b> <b>You,</b> Tolstoy provides a detailed history, account and defense of pacifism. Tolstoy's work inspired a movement named after him advocating pacifism to arise in Russia and elsewhere. The book was a major early influence on Mohandas K. Gandhi (1869–1948), and the two engaged in regular correspondence while Gandhi was active in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|According to Bhikhu Parekh, {{three books}} that {{influenced}} Gandhi most in South Africa were William Salter's Ethical Religion (1889); Henry David Thoreau's On the Duty of Civil Disobedience (1849); and Leo Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is <b>Within</b> <b>You</b> (1894). Ruskin inspired {{his decision to}} live an austere life on a commune, at first on the Phoenix Farm in Natal {{and then on the}} Tolstoy Farm just outside Johannesburg, South Africa. The most profound influence on Gandhi were those from Hinduism, Christianity and Jainism, states Parekh, with his thoughts [...] "in harmony with the classical Indian traditions, specially the Advaita or monistic tradition".|$|E

500|$|The exuberant first {{movement}} {{was derived from}} the final movement of the secular cantata. It opens with a virtuoso orchestral introduction of 24 measures, depicting vital joy. First the alto shouts: [...] "" [...] (Rejoice, you hearts), the tenor continues [...] "" [...] (fade away, you sorrows), then all voices proclaim in homophony: [...] "" [...] (the Savior lives and rules <b>within</b> <b>you).</b> The middle section is given mostly to alto and tenor, who illustrate mourning and fear in a sorrowful [...] "series of poignant descending chromatic passages and suspensions", although the words speak of the chasing away these moods: [...] "" [...] (You can drive away mourning, fear, anxious despair).|$|E
500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] {{was written}} by Minogue, Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, {{and was one of}} the first songs {{composed}} for the album. Minogue wrote the song prior to being in a relationship with French photographer Stephane Sednaoui with different lyrical context, but it was completed while she was dating. Of the song, Minogue said [...] "the way you start a new relationship with someone, they can bring out so many emotions <b>within</b> <b>you</b> and makes you question yourself a bit more." [...] The title [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] comes from when she first met Sednaoui in person, where she recalled him looking [...] "unusual" [...] and felt like he was [...] "the new cowboy coming into town".|$|E
500|$|Ian Inglis {{writes that}} the emotion Harrison conveys on the track [...] "belies its {{apparently}} trivial lyrics" [...] and that, together with the instrumentation and backing vocals, his pleas [...] "create an unusually atmospheric and strangely moving song". Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham deems the song to be [...] "essential Beatlemusic"; he views it as Harrison's [...] "most haunting and convincing musical contribution of the period", after [...] "Within You Without You", as well as [...] "possibly the most unnerving of all Beatles tracks". In a 2002 review for Mojo, Charles Shaar Murray described the song as [...] "eerie, serpentine" [...] and [...] "a fine and worthy companion for Peppers <b>Within</b> <b>You</b> Without You". Writing in Uncut that same year, Carol Clerk called it [...] "a weirdly atmospheric triumph".|$|E

500|$|The song has {{continued}} to invite widely diverse opinions. Among the most unfavourable assessments, author and critic Tim Riley, writing in 1988, dismissed [...] "Within You Without You" [...] as [...] "directionless", adding {{that it was difficult}} to conceive how [...] "lines such as 'Life flows on <b>within</b> <b>you</b> and without you' were taken seriously". He also said that the song was [...] "the most dated piece on the record... could easily have been left off with little to no effect" [...] on the album. In a 2009 review, Alex Young of Consequence of Sound grouped it with the [...] "major clunkers" [...] on Sgt. Pepper. Conversely, Ian Inglis considers the song to be [...] "absolutely central to the form and content" [...] of its parent album, and Ian MacDonald views it as the [...] "conscience" [...] of Sgt. Pepper and [...] "the necessary sermon that comes with the community singing". Musicologist Russell Reising writes that Harrison's song provides the exception on Sgt. Pepper, where the Beatles otherwise [...] "retreated lyrically into predominantly banal, occasionally schmaltzy, and often trivial vignettes". Author and critic Kenneth Womack terms it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul".|$|E

2500|$|In modern times, {{interest}} was revived by Leo Tolstoy {{in his late}} works, particularly in The Kingdom of God Is <b>Within</b> <b>You.</b> Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) propounded the practice of steadfast nonviolent opposition which he called [...] "satyagraha", instrumental in {{its role in the}} Indian Independence Movement. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, James Bevel, Thich Nhat Hanh and many others in the Civil Rights Movement.

[...] She kept the book with her constantly and wrote later that this book and parts of another book of a very different character, lectures by Abbé Arminjon on The End of This World, and the Mysteries of the World to Come, nourished her during this critical period. Thereafter she began to read other books, mostly on history and science.|$|E
