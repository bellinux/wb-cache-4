40|$|Long the {{foundation}} of economic analysis, the theory of rational choice holds that consumers are rational utility maximizers. Subject to a budget constraint, and given prices in the market, consumers will make choices that systematically increase their utility. Although few, if any, would deny that consumers make mistakes, rational choice theorists maintain that mistakes are not systematic or persistent. Different consumers make different mistakes, and any mistakes {{are likely to be}} corrected promptly as consumers discover that a better alternative exists. Thus, consumer choices as revealed in the market are compelling evidence that particular choices enhance consumer <b>welfare,</b> <b>as</b> long <b>as</b> <b>we</b> take the consumer’s preferences as given. Beginning at least with the work of Tyversky and Kahneman (1974), economists, psychologists, and other social scientists (including lawyers) have proposed that real people do not always make decisions in accordance with the predictions of the rational choice model, especially when risk and uncertainty are involved. These behavioralists have used laboratory experiments to identify certain biases in human decisionmaking. The experimental results suggest that at least some people make certain decisions in way...|$|R

40|$|Capitalist {{societies}} {{are full of}} unacceptable inequalities. Freedom is of paramount importance. These two convictions, widely shared around the world, {{seem to be in}} direct contradiction with each other. Fighting inequality jeopardizes freedom, and taking freedom seriously boosts inequality. Can this conflict be resolved? In this ground-breaking book, Philippe Van Parijs sets a new and compelling case for a just society. Assessing and rejecting the claims of both socialism and conventional capitalism, he presents a clear and compelling alternative vision of the just society: a capitalist society offering a substantial and unconditional basic income to all its members. Not just an exercise in political theory, this book reveals a new ideal of a free society and its meaning in the real world by drawing out its policy implications.

40|$|Europe is {{witnessing}} general {{attempts at}} a reformulation of the post-war social contract which {{gave rise to}} the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it (with public higher education <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it). I argue here for a strong thesis according to which Europe is facing the simultaneous renegotiation of the postwar social contract concerning the welfare state and the accompanying renegotiation of a smaller-scale, by comparison, modern social pact between the university and the nation-state. The renegotiation of the (nation) state/ university pact is not clear outside of the context of the changing <b>welfare</b> state contract, <b>as</b> state-funded higher education formed one of the bedrocks of the European welfare system in its major forms, and state-funded higher education remains one of its foundations. I am following here Stephan Leibfried and colleagues who argue that “competitive pressure to lower tax rates undermines the state’s resources and has the potential to unleash financial crises that, in turn, trigger cuts in welfare spending” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 7). Consequently, what they term “the golden-age "onstellation” of the four components of the state (the territorial state, the constitutional state, the democratic welfare state and the interventionist state) is currently threatened: “different state functions are threatened {{to a greater or lesser}} degree, and subjected to pressures for internationalization of varying intensity” (Hurrelmann et al. 2007 : 9). I argue here that higher education policies, and especially public funding for universities, are one of the dimensions of the “golden-age constellation” under renegotiations in Europe today: they come under the “interventionist state” and its functions in Leibfried’s formulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: “Prioritizing in Health Care – A {{challenge}} of the Welfare State?” It is a common fact that all resources are restricted. Health welfare {{becomes more and more}} expensive, due to better medication, new technology and administration. There is a need for prioritizing, but who has the responsibility, and how should it be done? In this report, you will read about where the prioritizing takes place in Denmark in different levels, and how prioritizing through economical evaluations afflict the social differences in the welfare state. In Great Britain and Norway the solution have been to collect all the different parts of involved in prioritizing, in one national prioritizing-council. Not only due to economical reasons, but also because of democratic difficulties in relation to prioritizing without informing the citizens about how it is done, and who is doing it. We have performed interviews with a medical doctor and a health economist to help us answer our questions and to use their knowledge and experience in our analysis. We have concluded that the prioritizing could be threatening the social equality, and therefore also threatening the <b>welfare</b> state <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it. We have also concluded {{that a lot of people}} see a national council not only as a good idea, but also as a solution to the problems involved with prioritizing as of today...|$|R

As president, Clinton was attracted to welfare expert and Harvard University Professor David Ellwood’s proposal on welfare reform and thus Clinton eventually appointed Ellwood to co-chair his welfare task force. Ellwood supported converting welfare into a transitional system. He advocated providing assistance to families for a limited time, after which recipients {{would be required to}} earn wages from a regular job or a work opportunity program. Low wages would be supplemented by expanded tax credits, access to subsidized childcare and health insurance, and guaranteed child support.|$|E

It encourages states to require some sort of employment search in exchange for providing funds to individuals, and imposes a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{will argue that}} {{generality}} is a virtue of Haybron’s account of welfare.

We will first focus on self-fulfillment and suggest an interpretation of Haybron’s account according to which the self-fulfillment of an individual consists in the fulfillment of the aspects of the self that are applicable to that particular individual. This makes Haybron’s account of welfare applicable to all sentient beings. Then we will focus on sub-personal nature-fulfillment and argue that the same interpretation leads to the conclusion that Haybron’s account of welfare recognizes even nonsentient beings <b>as</b> <b>welfare</b> subjects. <b>We</b> suggest a way of avoiding this latter conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies how trip {{chaining}} (combining commuting and shopping or commuting and child care) affects market competition: in particular, pricing and the equilibrium number of firms <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>welfare.</b> <b>We</b> use a monopolistic competition framework, where firms sell differentiated products {{as well as}} offering differentiated jobs to households, who are all located at {{some distance from the}} firms. The symmetric equilibria with and without the option of {{trip chaining}} are compared. We show analytically that introducing the trip chaining option reduces the profit margin of the firms in the short run, but increases welfare. The welfare gains are, however, smaller than the transport cost savings. In the free-entry long run equilibrium, the number of firms decreases but welfare is higher. A numerical illustration gives orders of magnitude of the different effects...|$|R
40|$|To study {{societal}} {{perception of}} animal welfare in The Netherlands and {{to search for}} intervention possibilities to influence this perception, 1074 randomly selected Dutch respondents completed a questionnaire on animal welfare. We analysed 15 propositions (4 -point Likert scale) and through factor analysis we defined four factors of societal perception of animal welfare: Human¿Animal Hierarchy (HAH), Use of animals for Human Consumption (HC), Life Quality of farm animals (LQ), and Farmers' Image (FI). On average, Dutch society perceived farm animal <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> slightly positive. <b>We</b> distinguished perception into the elements: Values, Convictions, Emotional Experiences (with animals and farms) and Factual Knowledge. Factors HAH and HC are considered as convictions in Dutch society. LQ is the only element significantly influenced by values. Pet owners and people without farm experiences perceived FI and LQ as being less positive than people without a pet or with farm experiences. These emotional experiences with farms, farm animals and/or pets are important elements of perception. FI is the only element influenced through factual knowledge. Hence, {{it is important that}} people experience and learn what farming entails and how farm animals live, e. g. through farm visits...|$|R

5000|$|The Institute {{was one of}} the key {{institutions}} that pressed for reform of the welfare system in the mid-1990s. Charles Murray, while an Institute fellow from 1981 to 1990, wrote his groundbreaking book Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980 (1984) argued that the welfare state had fostered a culture and cycle of dependency that was to the detriment of both welfare recipients and the United States as a whole. This launched a debate culminating in President Bill Clinton proposing to [...] "end <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it" [...] and the passage of landmark federal welfare reform in 1996. More recently, marking the 20th anniversary of federal welfare reform, the Institute published a report by former senior fellow Scott Winship that evaluated the plight of the poor since 1996. He concluded that, contrary to popular opinion, reform was more successful than not, helping move many single mothers off the dole and into the workforce. Furthermore, he reported that children—in particular, those in single-mother families—were significantly less likely to be poor today than they were before welfare reform.|$|E
5000|$|It was not however {{until the}} 1980s that U.S. food banks began to enjoy rapid growth. A second {{response}} to the [...] "rediscovery" [...] of hunger in the mid-sixties had been extensive lobbying of politicians to improve welfare. Until the 1980s, this approach had greater impact. In the 1970s, U.S. federal expenditure on hunger relief grew by about 500%, with food stamps distributed free of charge to those in greatest need. According to Poppendieck, welfare was widely considered preferable to grass roots efforts, as the latter could be unreliable, did not give recipients consumer-style choice {{in the same way}} as did food stamps, and risked recipients feeling humiliated by having to turn to charity. In the early 1980s, president Reagan's administration scaled back welfare provision, leading to a rapid rise in activity from grass roots hunger relief agencies. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. Poppendieck says that for the first few years after the change, there was vigorous opposition from left, who argued that state welfare was much more suitable for meeting recipients needs. But in the decades that followed, food banks have become an accepted part of America's response to hunger. Demand for the services of US food bank increased further in the late 1990s, after the [...] "end of <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> know it" [...] with President Clinton's Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act. In Canada, foodbanks underwent a period of rapid growth after the cutbacks in welfare that took place in the mid-1990s. As early as the 1980s, food banks had also begun to spread from the United States to the rest of the world. The first European food bank was founded in France during 1984. In the 1990s and early 2000s, food banks were established in South America, Africa and Asia, in several cases with van Hengel acting as a consultant. In 2007, The Global FoodBanking Network was formed.|$|E
40|$|Research {{comparing}} centralized and decentralized coordination schemes {{is often}} contradictory. For example, Oskar Lange (1969) among others {{points out that}} the centralized coordination scheme can outperform decentralized schemes while Arrow and Debreu (1954) show otherwise. This paper focuses on this issue in the context of agent-based marketplaces. Specifically, we use a computational approach to study the trade off between imperfect decision-making by the central coordinating agent (the central authority) and the imperfect coordination among decentralized seller agents. Using social <b>welfare</b> <b>as</b> a metric, <b>we</b> study how the correlation in the quality of the seller agents, the marginal costs of product building, decision-making costs and the fraction of consumer utility transferred as compensation to the winning seller agent affect the terms of this trade-off. We find that the decentralized scheme with its parsimonious use of information and simplistic decision rule does very well in comparison to the centralized scheme, which internalizes the externalities. This is surprising since one may expect the centralized scheme to always perform better than the decentralized scheme. This paper analyzes the results and provides intuition for this apparent anomaly. Acknowledgements: This work was funded in part by NSF CISE/IIS/KDI 9873005. Author...|$|R
40|$|Utilitarianism has an {{apparent}} pedigree {{when it comes}} to animal welfare. It supports the view that animal <b>welfare</b> matters just <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> human <b>welfare.</b> And many utilitarians support and oppose various practices in line with more mainstream concern over animal <b>welfare,</b> such <b>as</b> that <b>we</b> should not kill animals for food or other uses, and that we ought not to torture animals for fun. This relationship has come under tension from many directions. The aim {{of this article is to}} add further considerations in support of that tension. I suggest three ways in which utilitarianism comes significantly apart from mainstream concerns with animal welfare. First, utilitarianism opposes animal cruelty only when it offers an inefficient ratio of pleasure to pain; while this may be true of eating animal products, it is not obviously true of other abuses. Second, utilitarianism faces a familiar problem of the inefficacy of individual decisions; I consider a common response to this worry, and offer further concerns. Finally, the common utilitarian argument against animal cruelty ignores various pleasures that humans may get from the superior status that a structure supporting exploitation confers...|$|R
