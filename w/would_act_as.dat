5|$|In {{the interim}} buildup period, President Johnson-Sirleaf {{decided that a}} Nigerian officer <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> the Command Officer-In-Charge of the new armed forces. Major General Suraj Alao Abdurrahman succeeded the {{previous}} incumbent, Lieutenant General Luka Yusuf, in early June 2007; Lieutenant General Yusuf had been posted home to Nigeria to become Chief of Army Staff.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 1790, the United Belgian States (État-Belgiques-Unis or Verenigde Belgische Staten) {{was officially}} formed with a Treaty of Union. After negotiations, the delegates {{decided that the}} states should be unified into a single polity. A Sovereign Congress was created in Brussels which <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a {{parliament}} for the whole union. Autonomy over almost all important matters, however, was still decided independently by the states themselves.|$|E

5|$|The Air Force {{is looking}} to {{configure}} the CV-22 to perform combat search and rescue {{in addition to its}} primary long-range special operations transport mission. The Osprey <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a complement to Air Force HH-60G Pave Hawk and planned HH-60W rescue helicopters, being employed in scenarios where its ability to cover more ground quickly would be better suited to search and rescue than more nimble but slower helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Though Stanley and Black won the election, {{they never}} became {{political}} allies. At {{the time of}} their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because he feared he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while he was gone.|$|E
5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that hairy trout {{were the result}} of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, {{fisherman}} <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E

5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in North-West Europe {{under the supervision}} of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|In the interim, {{since most}} of the {{division}} was deployed {{in the southern part of}} the security zone, Hampel planned a divisional-level operation, named Operation Heiderose (Wild Rose) targeting Partisan positions north-west of Šekovići, south of the Spreča. The 27th Regiment, reinforced by the same Chetnik battalion that cooperated in Operation Fliegenfänger, would attack east towards Šekovići and the 28th Regiment would push south. A detached battalion of 7th SS Division <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a blocking force driving north. Hampel was apparently unhappy with the performance of the new commander of the 27th Regiment (SS-Obersturmbannführer Hermann Peter) and put the divisional chief of staff, SS-Sturmbannführer Erich Braun, in charge of the 27th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|John VI died in Lisbon in 1826. His elder son Peter, who had {{declared}} {{the independence of}} Brazil in 1822, becoming Emperor Peter I, succeeded to the Portuguese throne as Peter IV. Because the new Brazilian constitution did not allow further personal unions of Portugal and Brazil, Peter abdicated the Portuguese crown in favour of his elder daughter Maria da Glória, who became Maria II of Portugal. She was only seven years old, so Peter stated she would marry his brother Miguel who <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> regent. However, in 1828, Miguel deposed Maria and proclaimed himself king, abolishing the 1822 liberal constitution and ruling as an absolute monarch. This started {{the period of the}} Liberal Wars.|$|E

5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} that he <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> the {{trustee of the}} princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged in a personal dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E
5|$|On 22 July 2016, the BBC {{reported}} that manager Bruce had resigned from his position. This was later {{confirmed by the}} club, which also announced that Mike Phelan <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> caretaker manager. On 13 October 2016, Phelan became Hull's permanent head coach. On 3 January 2017, Phelan was sacked by Hull City, {{less than three months}} after being made permanent. The decision was made following a 3–1 away defeat to West Bromwich Albion the previous day, leaving the Tigers bottom of the Premier League and three points adrift of safety.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} {{to be present}} as he broke open his secret instructions. He learned that his mission was {{to aid in the}} hunt for a large treasure near Hispaniola. A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to do most of the searching, but the Falcon <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

5|$|The 1776 {{constitution}} {{provided that}} the vice-president of the Legislative Council <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> governor (who {{was president of the}} Council) should that office be vacant. The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession, as did the subsequent 1947 constitution. A constitutional amendment in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor, and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. This office was first filled in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Defenders sees Cox, Ritter, Colter, and Jones reprise {{their roles}} as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Danny Rand / Iron Fist, respectively, from the {{previous}} television series. In March 2014, Loeb stated that the miniseries, officially titled Marvel's The Defenders, would begin filming after Iron Fist. In April 2016, Marvel announced that Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> showrunners for The Defenders. However, {{by the start of}} filming in New York City in October 2016, Petrie had left the series as co-showrunner. Filming concluded in March 2017. The eight-episode event premiered on August 18, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} Sea Harriers were a {{development}} batch and {{were used for}} clearance trials. The first production aircraft was delivered to RNAS Yeovilton in 1979 to form an Intensive Flying Trials Unit (also known as 700A Naval Air Squadron). In March 1980 the Intensive Flying Trials Unit became 899 Naval Air Squadron and <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> the landborne headquarters unit for the type. The first operational squadron 800 Naval Air Squadron was also formed in March 1980 initially to operate from HMS Invincible before it transferred to HMS Hermes. In January 1981, a second operation squadron 801 Naval Air Squadron was formed to operate from HMS Invincible.|$|E

5|$|The huge {{extent of}} the mediaeval parish of Llanbadarn made Sunday worship {{impossible}} for distant inhabitants, so early centres with a Christian identity like Llanychaearn and Llaneithr <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> chapels of ease, and later churches whether built by Welsh princes (such as Llanfihangel-y-Creuddyn) or Norman lords (e.g. Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn) were also subordinate to Llanbadarn before developing as separate parishes. Churches like Llanbadarn with a large hinterland of lesser churches are often known as mam-eglwysi, mother churches. There were no parishes in Wales prior to {{the coming of the}} Normans.|$|E
5|$|The plan seemed ill-conceived and {{suggests}} that Narborough was obsessed {{by the possibility of}} treasure. It is also possible that Phips was being used in a complex way, with the sly intention that HMS Rose <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a noisy decoy for his more important treasure hunt. Unlike the Falcon and Bonetta, Phips was not sent directly to search near Hispaniola where Narborough (correctly) believed a great treasure lay buried. Phips' instructions were not kept secret but were signed by the entire crew, thereby broadcasting their designs through the harbor and shipyards. On July 13, 1683, the articles of agreement (see image) were signed by Phips and seven other crew members, in the presence of Narborough and Haddock.|$|E
5|$|Under the Merger Treaty of 1967, the ECSC's Special Council of Ministers and the Council of the EAEC (together {{with their}} other {{independent}} institutions) were merged into the Council of the EEC, which <b>would</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a single Council of the European Communities. In 1993, the Council adopted the name 'Council of the European Union', following {{the establishment of}} the European Union by the Maastricht Treaty. That treaty strengthened the Council, with the addition of more intergovernmental elements in the three pillars system. However, {{at the same time the}} Parliament and Commission had been strengthened inside the Community pillar, curtailing the ability of the Council to act independently.|$|E
