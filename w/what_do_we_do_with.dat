5000|$|Half a Life was enthusiastically {{received}} by critics here and abroad. Writing in The Guardian, writer and critic Robert McCrum called the book [...] "a masterpiece....'Half my life ago, I killed a girl'. You'll rarely {{get a better}} first line. What follows—Strauss's precise, honest and rigorous account of a fateful road accident and its harrowing aftermath—fulfills every hope aroused in the casual reader. What starts as an 18-year-old's carefree outing in his father's car leads {{to the death of}} Celine Zilke, a classmate, followed by a court case (this is America). Simultaneously, however, there is redemption. Crystal, and with many facets, Half a Life deserves celebration." [...] In the Chicago Tribune, critic Elizabeth Taylor called it [...] "a book that inspires admiration, sentence by sentence...This is memoir in its finest form." [...] Writer Dani Shapiro, in The New York Times Book Review, found the memoir [...] "elegant, painful, stunningly honest." [...] She continued, [...] "At the center of this memoir thrums a question fundamental to {{what it means to be}} human: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> what we’ve been given?" [...] A critical favorite in the UK, Half a Life was called [...] "one of the best books I have ever read" [...] by Ali Catterall on The BBC, as well as [...] "precise, elegantly written, fresh, wise, and very sad ... indicative not only of a very talented writer, but of a proper human being” by Nick Hornby ...|$|E

When someone takes up a position where they feel they know {{what is really going on}} in the world, drawing on {{conspiracy theories}}, they will be seen by some as paranoid.

He killed his precious brothers. He also went to the Kara-Khitai for protection and hid there in subjection. He has not loved his nation but made it suffer cruelly. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> him? When he {{was seven years old}} he was taken by the Merkit, wore a black goat skin, went to Buur Steppe of the Selenge and lived pounding grain for the Merkits. His father Kurchakus Buyuruk Khan attacked the Merkit and saved his son. But this Toghril was taken again at the age of thirteen this time by Ajai Khan of the Tatar who took him and his mother. There he herded his camels. From there he escaped with Ajai Khan's shepherd. After that he fled in fear from the Naiman and went to Gur Khan of the Kara-Khitai at the Chui River in Sartuul (Muslim) lands. Staying there one year he fled again and wandered through Uyghur lands, fled through Tangut lands, leading five goats, feeding on camel blood and came to Temujin with one blind brown horse. That good son Temujin gave him tribute (donation) and fed him. But now he forgets what he was and is harboring evil intentions.' Wang Khan had the participants of this discussion, namely Elqudur, Khulbari and Arin Taij his {{brothers and}} nobles arrested. The younger brother of Wang Khan Jakha Khambu managed to escape and went to the Naiman. Wang Khan brought his arrested brothers into a ger and said 'What did you say about how I went through the Uyghur lands and Tangut lands? What did you miserables think?" [...] and spat on their faces. Then he made everyone else in the ger rise and spit on their faces. He let loose their horses." ...|$|E

HAIs are not simply an unfortunate consequence of care, as clinicians once thought. Certain targeted interventions can be highly effective at preventing them.
