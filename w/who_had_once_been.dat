Green's defense claimed that {{the fire in the}} family home had been set not by Debora Green, but by her son, Tim Farrar, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> caught by local police setting off Molotov cocktails. The defense also attempted to attribute Farrar's poisoning to Tim, who did much of the cooking in the household.|$|E
5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood, including Giuseppe Tosi, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto {{departed}} for Montevideo, {{the capital of}} Uruguay, on 23 October. He chose José Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to assist him. Paranhos was a brilliant young man <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a Liberal Party member and protégé of the disgraced Aureliano Coutinho. This surprising choice was a clear signal from Honório Hermeto to {{his colleagues in the}} cabinet of his independence. On 21 November, Honório Hermeto signed a treaty of alliance with Uruguay and the rebel Argentine provinces of Entre Ríos and Corrientes. On 3 February 1852, the allies defeated Rosas, who fled to the United Kingdom. As a reward for his role, the Emperor granted Honório Hermeto the title of Visconde de Paraná (Viscount of Paraná) in July 1852. The title was derived from the Paraná River, a tributary of the Río de la Plata, upon which free passage rights for Brazilian shipping was secured after Rosas' downfall.|$|E

5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee to Bosnia. The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year.

Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out {{as a method of}} murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E
25|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. (He also learned sword fighting, how to throw a javelin, camel riding, and rowing.) Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers.

25|$|However, {{there was}} little {{pressure}} they could bring {{to bear on the}} people who could ultimately make changes, longtime team owners Wellington Mara and his nephew Tim, who inherited his father Jack's stake in the team after Jack Mara died in 1965. The two managed team operations closely, but feuded so bitterly with each other that at one point a partition had to be erected between their seats in the owners' box. The effects of this uncertainty and instability at the highest managerial level affected the team's play, most significantly when it came to some apparently inexplicable personnel decisions. It was not lost on fans that players (Craig Morton and Fran Tarkenton) and coaches (Tom Landry and Vince Lombardi) <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> in the Giants' fold were now enjoying or had enjoyed great success elsewhere.

25|$|In the gubernatorial {{primaries}} held between December 1959 and January 1960, the Kirkpatricks worked {{actively in}} southwest Louisiana for former Governor Jimmie Davis, who defeated {{the mayor of}} New Orleans, deLesseps Story Morrison, Sr., in a hotly contested party runoff election. Davis asked Kirkpatrick to serve as his Director of Public Works to succeed Lorris M. Wimberly of Arcadia, the seat of Bienville Parish in north Louisiana, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> Speaker of the Louisiana House. As head of DPW, Kirkpatrick was also chairman of the Red River Authority and the Sabine River Authority. He worked with the State of Texas and without federal funds to establish the popular Toledo Bend Reservoir, a popular destination for fishing and boating on the Louisiana-Texas boundary. The project, which emphasizes conservation and stewardship of natural resources, was completed in 1966, two years after Kirkpatrick had left DPW. State Representative Cliff Ammons of Many, the seat of Sabine Parish, pushed to passage the bill to create Toledo Bend and the constitutional amendment to provide for its funding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} half of the 1990s, Mochizuki {{directed}} a series of yakuza movies that are considered his best work. Some of the films were a collaboration with novelist Yukio Yamanouchi <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> a legal advisor to one of the yakuza syndicates. The first of the films, Another Lonely Hitman, about an old-time yakuza hitman who ends up battling his own gang, was released in 1995. The movie took the Best Film award at the 5th Japan Film Professional Awards and Mochizuki won the Best Director award. What critics consider his best film appeared in 1997, Onibi or The Fire Within, another study of an aging yakuza trying to go straight. Onibi won the Best Film award at the 19th Yokohama Film Festival and Mochizuki took the festival's Best Director award for this movie and his other 1997 film A Yakuza in Love. These were followed by the 1998 manga-based Mobster's Confession, a comical, cynical account of a small-time gangster and his girlfriend. By this time, Mochizuki had begun to attain an international reputation and the Rotterdam Film Festival held a ten-film retrospective on the director in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Other than these, {{the rights}} of a serf were very limited. A {{landowner}} could punish his serfs at his discretion, and under Catherine the Great gained the ability to sentence his serfs to hard labour in Siberia, a punishment normally reserved for convicted criminals. The only thing a noble could not do to his serfs was to kill them. The life of a serf belonged to the state. Historically, when the serfs faced problems they could not solve on their own (such as abusive masters), they often appealed to the autocrat, and continued doing so during Catherine’s reign, though she signed legislation prohibiting it. Although {{she did not want}} to communicate directly with the serfs, she did create some measures to improve their conditions as a class and reduce the size of the institution of serfdom. For example, she took action to limit the number of new serfs; she eliminated many ways for people to become serfs, culminating in the manifesto of 17 March 1775, which prohibited a serf <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> freed from becoming a serf again. However, she also restricted the freedoms of many peasants. During her reign, Catherine gave away many state-owned peasants to become private serfs (owned by a landowner), and while their ownership changed hands, a serf’s location never did. However, peasants owned by the state generally had more freedoms than those owned by a noble.|$|E

500|$|... "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] {{was written}} by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty's {{religion}} had not {{been part of the}} original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody the 1927 film The Jazz Singer and establish that Krusty is Jewish. The episode was carefully researched and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as [...] "special technical consultants". It was directed by Jeffrey Lynch and Brad Bird; as it was Lynch's first credit as a director, Bird was assigned to help him. Comedian Jackie Mason, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>once</b> <b>been</b> an ordained rabbi, provided the voice of Rabbi Krustofski. The rabbi later became an infrequently recurring character voiced by Dan Castellaneta. Mason returned to voice the character in several later episodes.|$|E

Originally, this {{was intended to be}} Isaac Bashevis Singer, but the writers changed it when Singer died. Mason's lines had to be re-recorded in order to complete the change.
