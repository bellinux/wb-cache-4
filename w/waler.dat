5|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{many more}} Arabians came to Australia, though most {{were used to}} produce {{crossbred}} horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses {{and some of them}} became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the <b>Waler</b> and the Australian Stock Horse.|$|E
5|$|From 1916 the Stokes light trench mortar {{was issued}} to {{infantry}} {{to replace a}} range of trench catapults and smaller trench mortars, whilst it was also used in a battery at brigade-level to provide organic indirect fire support. In addition, individual soldiers often used a range of personnel weapons including knives, clubs, knuckle-dusters, revolvers and pistols. Snipers on the Western Front used Pattern 1914 Enfield sniper rifles with telescopic sights. Light horsemen also carried bayonets (as they were initially considered mounted infantry), although the Australian Mounted Division adopted cavalry swords in late 1917. Artillery included 18-pounders which equipped the field batteries, 4.5-inch howitzers used by the howitzer batteries, and 8-inch and 9.2-inch howitzers which equipped the heavy (siege) batteries. The 9.45-inch heavy mortar equipped a heavy trench mortar battery, while medium trench mortar batteries were equipped with the 2-inch medium mortar, and later the 6-inch mortar. Light Horse units were supported by British and Indian artillery. The main mount used by the light horse was the <b>Waler,</b> while draught horses were used by the artillery and for wheeled transport. Camels were also used, both as mounts and transport, and donkeys and mules were used as pack animals.|$|E
5|$|In the sub-basement {{were the}} Sprague screw {{machines}} for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, {{and the six}} Babcock & Wilcox <b>waler</b> tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators. The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The 12th Light Horse Regiment was {{established}} on 1 March 1915 at Liverpool, New South Wales, {{and two days}} later began forming at Holsworthy {{as part of the}} all-volunteer Australian Imperial Force (AIF), which was raised for service overseas during the First World War. Drawing the majority of its personnel from outback New South Wales, the regiment was assigned to the 4th Light Horse Brigade along with the 11th and 13th Light Horse Regiments and was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Percy Abbott. Upon establishment, the regiment had an authorised strength of 25 officers and 497 other ranks, who were organised into a regimental headquarters and three squadrons, each of which consisted of six troops. Armed usually with standard infantry weapons instead of swords or lances, and mounted on Australian <b>Waler</b> horses, the Australian light horse regiments performed several roles and were similar to both cavalry and mounted infantry. They mainly fought dismounted, using their horses to obtain mobility that foot soldiers did not possess, but they could also conduct certain cavalry roles, such as scouting and screening, while mounted.|$|E

25|$|The {{unit was}} to have 700 animals that {{included}} 360 mules. There were to be as many more but the ship that was carrying them was torpedoed in the Arabian Sea. They were replaced by 360 Australian <b>Waler</b> horses that had originally been with the 112th Cavalry in New Caledonia who were deemed unfit for jungle warfare. They had traveled to India where they served with the Chinese Army before being assigned to the 5307th.|$|E
25|$|Each troop {{was divided}} into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was {{nominated}} as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter. The Camel Corps were all trained infantrymen, {{and some of them}} had previously served with the Australian Light Horse regiments, but all required a period of training in horsemanship. Once formed, the regiment was assigned to the 5th Light Horse Brigade, alongside a French regiment and the 14th Light Horse Regiment. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry armed with rifles, not swords or lances, and mounted exclusively on the Australian <b>Waler</b> horse.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, {{the lateral}} support {{which can be}} {{provided}} by the shoring wall alone is insufficient to resist the planned lateral loads; in this case additional support is provided by <b>walers</b> or tie-backs. <b>Walers</b> are structural elements which connect across the excavation so that the loads from the soil {{on either side of}} the excavation are used to resist each other, or which transfer horizontal loads from the shoring wall to the base of the excavation. Tie-backs are steel tendons drilled into the face of the wall which extend beyond the soil which is applying pressure to the wall, to provide additional lateral resistance to the wall.|$|R

500|$|The African {{slave trade}} was {{closely tied to}} the imports of war horses, and as the {{prevalence}} of slaving decreased, fewer horses were needed for raiding. [...] This significantly decreased the amount of mounted warfare seen in West Africa. By the time of the Scramble for Africa and the introduction of modern firearms in the 1880s, the use of horses in African warfare had lost most of its effectiveness. [...] Nonetheless, in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), cavalry and other mounted troops were the major combat force for the British, since the horse-mounted Boers moved too quickly for infantry to engage. [...] The Boers presented a mobile and innovative approach to warfare, drawing on strategies that had first appeared in the American Civil War. [...] The terrain was not well-suited to the British horses, resulting in the loss of over 300,000 animals. As the campaign wore on, losses were replaced by more durable African Basuto ponies, and <b>Waler</b> horses from Australia.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 October 1885, Bridges married Edith Lilian Francis (1862–1926), {{daughter}} of Alfred John Dawson Francis and Margaret Agnes Anne Francis (formerly Wilson, born Green) at St John's Church, Darlinghurst, New South Wales, {{which was the}} same church in which his parents had married in 1858. They had seven children, three of whom died young. Bridges was survived by Edith and their four living children; one of his sons, William Francis, later followed in his footsteps, serving on the Western Front, achieving the rank of major in the AIF and receiving the Distinguished Service Order. He was also survived by his horse [...] "Sandy", the only Australian <b>Waler</b> horse to return from the First World War, due to quarantine restrictions. It is not clear when Bridges met Sandy but after his death Sandy was cared for {{by a number of}} Army vets until, by order of the Minister of Defence, the horse was returned to Australia where he lived at the Remount Depot at Maribyrnong, before being put down in 1923 due to ill health.|$|E

[...] The outer walls and roof were cast together in a single operation, in six nominal 20-metre lengths, using special travelling formwork. [...] This was struck inside the formed section, moved along to the next length and then jacked up into position, each within a 72-hour cycle. [...] Each 1000 cubic metre pour required approximately 1500 square metres of formwork. The inside shutters for the outer walls were vertical steel section panels and Alform Beam <b>walers,</b> which were attached to the top slab of the special steel traveller, while the outer shutters were crane handled vertical steel section panels with Alform Beam or steel channel <b>walers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{preferred}} <b>Walers</b> for cavalry duties were 15 to 16 hands high (60 to 64 in). Those over 16 {{hands were}} rejected {{for use in}} the South Australian Bushmen Corps. Unbroken horses, as well as those with grey and broken (spotted) coat colours were also rejected.

50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Indian cavalry used mainly Arab horses. Later, {{large numbers of}} <b>Walers,</b> at that time {{considered}} the best cavalry horses, were imported from Australia.

50|$|The Indian Country-bred is an Indian horse type of {{indeterminate}} mixed breeding. These horses {{vary from}} good-quality riding horses to small and poorly-conformed animals used for pack and draught work.

Among these are the small horses of the Himalayas of northern India, particularly Bhutan, Sikkim and Darjeeling, and the strong horses of the Punjab. Outside influences include Arab horses imported to Bombay and Veraval from the Arabian Gulf, and the Australian <b>Walers</b> imported in very large numbers in the nineteenth century.|$|R
