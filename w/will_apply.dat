5|$|Cases in the United Kingdom were {{previously}} inconsistent upon {{the issue of}} permitting representative standing.

5|$|Across North America, {{electricity}} transmission systems are interconnected into wide area synchronous grids, or interconnections. Suppliers are legally required to follow reliability standards. In 2006, Québec's transmission system {{was recognized by}} the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as a full interconnection because it is asynchronous with neighboring systems. Québec will consequently {{be able to develop}} its own reliability standards, as needed, and these <b>will</b> <b>apply</b> in addition to the relevant North American standards. Besides the Quebec Interconnection, there are three other interconnections in North America: the Eastern Interconnection, the Western Interconnection, and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.|$|E
5|$|Lim Chin Leng has {{opined that}} Taw Cheng Kong stands as {{authority}} for {{the proposition that the}} Singapore courts <b>will</b> <b>apply</b> in domestic law the rules and principles of public international law that have previously been received into the common law. The Court of Appeal recognized a rule of customary international law that had been received into the common law, that is, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and ascribed to Parliament the intent to uphold that rule for the purposes of construing a statutory provision.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the verdict}} of juries, no player that throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises to throw a ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men <b>will</b> <b>apply</b> for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{questions}} {{may also be}} referred to the Tribunal when Parliament attempts to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. If the attempt is by way of an ordinary bill, the President can exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to it. It is then open to Cabinet to advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact circumvents or curtails his discretionary powers. If the bill is determined by the Tribunal not to have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. When Article 5A of the Constitution is brought into force, a similar procedure <b>will</b> <b>apply</b> to attempts to circumvent or curtail the President's discretionary powers through a constitutional amendment. If the Tribunal rules that the proposed amendment does have the effect of restricting the discretionary powers of the President, the Prime Minister is entitled to submit the bill to a national referendum for approval.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection <b>will</b> <b>apply,</b> though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E
