5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E
5|$|The Creator, after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said almost brutally. [...] "No. It's like this--I can't do {{anything}} underhand. I mean--I'm not so amazingly honest--now. But I've not {{that sort of}} mind. She <b>would</b> <b>find</b> me <b>out.</b> It <b>would</b> do no good and she <b>would</b> <b>find</b> me <b>out.</b> My life's too complex. I can't manage it and go straight. I--you've overrated me. And besides--Things have happened. Something--" [...] He hesitated and then snatched at his resolve, [...] "I've got to simplify--and that's the plain fact of the case. I'm sorry, but it is so." ...|$|R

25|$|Fisher {{had been}} {{an active member of}} the Scottsdale Baptist Church's men's ministry, but unlike Mary, he had begun to {{withdraw}} from its activities a few months prior to the murders. In 1998, the Fishers went to their church's senior pastor for marital counseling. Fisher told coworkers about a one-night affair with a prostitute he met in a massage parlor. He fretted that Mary <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that it was the cause of a urinary tract infection that left him ill for several days in December 2000.|$|E
25|$|Renaissance Humanism, {{of which}} Desiderius Erasmus (c. 1466–1536) was an {{important}} advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from Portugal who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French Huguenots, {{many of whom were}} shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher Baruch de Spinoza (1632–1677) <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned University of Leiden (established in 1575 by the Dutch stadtholder, William of Oranje, as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher René Descartes lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of telegrams ensued between the War Office in London and Gordon in Bombay about just what exactly {{he was planning}} on doing in China, and when Gordon replied that he <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> when he got there, Gordon was ordered to stay. Gordon disobeyed orders and left on the first ship to China, an action that very much angered the Army's commander, the Duke of Cambridge. Gordon arrived in Shanghai in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learned that there was risk of war with Russia. After meeting his old friend, Gordon assured Li that if Russia should attack he would resign his commission in the British Army {{to take up a}} commission in the Chinese Army, an action that if taken risked prosecution under the Foreign Enlistments Act. Gordon informed the Foreign Office that he willing to renounce his British citizenship and take Chinese citizenship as he would not abandon Li and his other Chinese friends should a Sino-Russian war begin. Gordon's willingness to renounce his British citizenship in order to fight with China in the event of war did much to raise his prestige in China.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} Asquith's {{attempt to}} introduce Home Rule in July 1916. David Lloyd George, then Minister for Munitions, {{was sent to}} Dublin to offer this to {{the leaders of the}} Irish Party, Redmond and Dillon. The scheme revolved around partition, officially a temporary arrangement, as understood by Redmond. Lloyd George, however, gave the Ulster leader Carson a written guarantee that Ulster would not be forced in. His tactic was to see that neither side <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> before a compromise was implemented. A modified Act of 1914 had been drawn up by the Cabinet on 17 June. The Act had two amendments enforced by Unionists on 19 July: permanent exclusion of Ulster, and a reduction of Ireland’s representation in the Commons. Lloyd George informed Redmond of this on 22 July 1916, and Redmond accused the government of treachery. This was decisive to the future fortunes of the Home Rule movement; the Lloyd George debacle of 22 July finished the constitutional party, overthrew Redmond’s power and left him utterly demoralised. It simultaneously discredited the politics of consent and created the space for radical alternatives. Redmond, after 1916 was increasingly eclipsed by ill-health, the rise of Sinn Féin and the growing dominance of Dillon within the Irish Party.|$|E
25|$|Still with {{dreams of}} {{becoming}} a culture expert, he moved to Philadelphia to become an instructor at Herman's Institute, while Fanny stayed in New York to finish her studies. Before his first professional fight, Welsh decided to change his name, fearing he may fail and that his mother <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> he was boxing. He first chose Fred Cymry, Cymry meaning Welsh, but on writing to Fanny, she suggested that 'Welsh' would be less confusing. Welsh took Jack Clancy on as his American manager, and on 21 December 1905 he experienced his first professional bout. His first opponent was Young Williams, and the two novices fought at the Broadway Athletic Club of Philadelphia. Welsh won by knockout in the third round, and was booked {{to return to the}} club for his second fight in January. He went six rounds with Johnny Keely on 25 January, with a 'no-decision' verdict, the standard practice in Philadelphia for full-distance fights at the time, given to the fight. His next match saw him stop Eddie Fay in the sixth, and with this promising start to his career, the Broadway Athletic Club lined up a more challenging opponent, journeyman Tommy Feltz. The fight went all six rounds, and although Feltz was past his best, he was expected to win the bout; so the result, given to Welsh by the Philadelphia Item, was seen as an upset. From that fight, Welsh started to take more frequent matches, sometimes accepting two bouts a week to build up his experience and stamina. In March 1906, he faced four opponents, defeating Tommy Love and Kid Stinger (both 'no-decision', but given by the Philadelphia Item) and then a points win over Eddie Lenny, followed by a draw with Johnny Dohan. The Lenny result was the first of eight bouts to which the Philadelphia Item failed to give Welsh a victory, though seven of them were 'no-decision' verdicts on the night. The seven matches after Dohan were Billy Maharg, who took the fight decisively on points, then Frank Carsey, followed by three experienced fighters, Jimmy Devine, Tommy Love and Matty Baldwin; the last two opponents on this losing streak were Philadelphians Billy Willis and Tim Callahan.|$|E
500|$|When {{the morning}} comes, Lila tells Dexter of why {{she went into}} rehab. She had been dating a man who {{introduced}} her to methamphetamine, a drug that she became very addicted to. But when her boyfriend broke up with her, Lila set his former house on fire after getting high. But later on, she <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that her boyfriend was squatting inside the house, and had been burned alive. Dexter asks her if she thinks that he was bad and deserved to die, something that Lila silently agrees to. Comforting her now, Dexter tells her [...] "It's okay then." ...|$|E

500|$|Baker {{was born}} in Long Beach, California and raised in what he {{considered}} a [...] "stifling, Republican Southern Californian household". Rebelling against his parents, he became attracted to the fringe elements of society, including beatniks (anyone living as a bohemian, acting rebelliously, or appearing to advocate a revolution in manners), artists and gays. In high school during the 1960s he explored his sexuality at underground gay teen nightclubs, while living in fear that his abusive father <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> At one point, his father hired a private detective to follow him, when he suspected Baker {{was having an affair}} with a male neighbor. This family dynamic would be used in many of his novels, most extensively in Boy Wonder.|$|E
500|$|Boles {{was arrested}} in Ypsilanti, Michigan on September 9, 2007 and pleaded guilty to one count of {{receiving}} and concealing stolen property. [...] He was sentenced to serve {{two to five years}} in prison for receiving and concealing stolen property in violation of his parole in Washtenaw County Circuit Court. [...] He had previously served six months in prison for unarmed robbery before he was paroled in 2005. [...] Boles' most recent infraction occurred when with an outstanding warrant, he provided a false name to officers investigating why he was blocking traffic with a car they <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> had been stolen from Detroit, Michigan. [...] He had been attempting to converse with sidewalk pedestrians while purchasing drugs. Boles lost his son, Christopher, to a traffic accident at the age of 17 in February 2016.|$|E
500|$|Samson's {{move into}} the adult film {{business}} began in 2000, after she {{wrote a letter to}} Italian porn actor and director Rocco Siffredi, asking to work with him. She initially wanted to make a movie in order to fulfill a fantasy, after her husband had given her the idea, and hoped no one she knew <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> However, after her first movie, Rocco Meats An American Angel In Paris, which was nominated for [...] "Best Foreign Release" [...] at the AVN Awards, she got what she described as [...] "porn fever" [...] and went on to make further movies. Her family soon discovered her film career when she appeared on The Howard Stern Show and Entertainment Tonight. Samson stated in 2006: [...] "My parents are devastated by my career choices".|$|E

500|$|General Secretary Yuri Andropov, on {{the advice}} of Defense Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, but against the advice of the Foreign Ministry, {{initially}} decided not to make any admission of downing the airliner, on the premise that no one <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> or be able to prove otherwise. Consequently the TASS news agency reported twelve hours after the shootdown only that an unidentified aircraft, flying without lights, had been intercepted by Soviet fighters after it violated Soviet airspace over Sakhalin. The aircraft had allegedly failed to respond to warnings and [...] "continued its flight toward the East Sea". Some commentators believe that the inept manner in which the political events were handled by the Soviet government was affected by the failing health of Andropov, who was permanently hospitalised in late September or early October 1983 (Andropov died the following February).|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Times {{about the}} ending of the show in 1989, Curtis hinted that the {{collaborative}} writing process caused tensions amongst the cast: [...] "Everybody on the show thinks they can put in good jokes, despite the fact that Ben Elton and I think there are already quite a few good ones in there to start with. It does usually end up funnier, but it's time to do something over which I have more control." [...] Twenty years on, Curtis recalled in the documentary Blackadder Rides Again that: [...] "They would literally sit around for the entire time discussing the script...sometimes we would just say to them [...] "if you stood up and tried to act this script out, you <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> things about it." [...] Ben Elton stated that by opening it up, they allowed the cast to question every aspect of the script.|$|E
500|$|After Jade {{challenged}} Mark {{to a game}} of pool, [...] "sparks of {{a different}} kind" [...] began to fly between them. McGregor explained the situation: [...] "Mark has had a really bad day at work, so he's out for a fun night. To his surprise, he enjoys Jade's company. Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss." [...] The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade {{had spent the night}} together and Mark was full of regret. Mark was [...] "terrified" [...] that Kate <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet, he does not feel any less guilty. Mark's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down. Despite talking to his superior officer, nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place.|$|E

500|$|The storyline {{continued}} throughout 1993 as Christine makes greater {{demands on}} Arthur, threatening to tell Pauline about their affair unless {{he does so}} himself. In September 1993, the situation finally reaches a climax on-screen. The scriptwriters had many conferences about ways in which Pauline <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about the affair; [...] "should she work it out herself or should some third party tell her the truth?" [...] In {{the end it was}} felt that Arthur should tell her himself, and when he does, Pauline becomes violent and hits him in the face with a frying pan. Although the audience had witnessed Pauline and Arthur rowing many times, this was something different, [...] "an act of betrayal on a massive scale." [...] Series production manager, Rona McKendrick, has commented on this [...] "iconic" [...] scene: [...] "It {{was one of the few}} times when you saw Pauline really, really let rip... you really felt the anger, understood the anger and realised why she went as far as she did." [...] This episode (written by Tony McHale and directed by Keith Boak) was chosen by writer Colin Brake as the episode of the year in [...] and is described by Wendy Richard as [...] "Pauline's crowning moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. It was inspired by an ex-boyfriend who was later revealed to be opposite of what Swift had originally thought. Swift recalled that, at first, [...] "He came across as prince charming." [...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out. I <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> who he really was," [...] she said. She wrote [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] in an emotional state, which she described as [...] "the breaking point", where she thought to herself, [...] "'You know what? Don’t even {{think that you can}} keep on hurting me.'" [...] The circumstances reached a point where she felt she had to walk away. [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on October 28, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store. The song was reissued on March 5, 2009, as remix, the same day she made her guest appearance on the television series [...] in the episode [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn". The remix was featured in the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "Rock Show", {{along with}} the five other first season episodes of Parks and Recreation, was {{released}} on a one-disc DVD set in the United States on September 8, 2009. The DVD included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode, as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes. The disc also included an [...] "Producer's Extended Cut" [...] of [...] "Rock Show", which incorporated scenes that were cut from the originally broadcast episode. Many of the deleted scenes were improvised dialogue from the actors in brief extensions of episodes already included in the originally broadcast episode. In one of the cut scenes, Marlene Knope tells the audience that Leslie's business meeting is actually a date. The producers decided to cut the moment, so the audience <b>would</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> {{at the same time}} Leslie learns it. In another cut scene, Andy tries to convince Ann that the doctor lied to her about Andy requesting more time with the leg casts because the doctor wanted more money. One of the longest cut scenes from the extended edition was a conversation between Leslie and Mark at the bar, in which Mark explains his ideals about city planning when he attended college are much different than the practical, technical aspects of his job. Although the scene was cut, Michael Schur said the monologue did a great deal to help develop Mark's character.|$|E
