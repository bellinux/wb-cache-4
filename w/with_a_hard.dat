His role as a Kodokan competitor was specially notable in the second police tournament against the Yōshin-ryū school, in 1886. He fought Enchi Kotaro, knocking him out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> ippon seoi nage. Later, in 1888, he fought in a third and last police tournament, in which he defeated Yōshin-ryū leader Terushima Taro.|$|E
5|$|Titanium {{can catch}} fire when a fresh, non-{{oxidized}} surface {{comes in contact}} with liquid oxygen. Fresh metal may be exposed when the oxidized surface is struck or scratched <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> object, or when mechanical strain causes a crack. This poses a limitation to its use in liquid oxygen systems, {{such as those in}} the aerospace industry. Because titanium tubing impurities can cause fires when exposed to oxygen, titanium is prohibited in gaseous oxygen respiration systems. Steel tubing is used for high pressure systems (3,000 p.s.i.) and aluminium tubing for low pressure systems.|$|E

5|$|As for the Street Fighter series, {{starting}} from Street Fighter X Tekken, Poison {{has a unique}} moveset of her own that mixes agile Pro Wrestling techniques and her own streetfighting abilities. Poison's standard throws include a multi-hitting slap and a Frankensteiner, Aeolus Edge and Kissed by a Goddess which are the names of her Fireball and Shoryuken-like moves, and Whip of Love which is a multi-hitting whip attack and is done {{in a similar fashion}} to Fei Long's Rekkas. Her famous flip kick from the original Final Fight games appears as a special called Love Me Tender. After the flipping axe kick, Poison can follow this move up with a reverse Frankensteiner (Poison-Rana). In addition, Poison's Super Art is called Love Storm, and starts with her charging a large version of Aeolus Edge. Once it hits, she flips into the air and lands <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hitting axe kick that stuns the opponent in a prone position. Afterwards, she repeatedly smacks the opponent with her horse whip and delivers a final blow that knocks them into the air. Poison also retained her signature backflip from the original game.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{decided to}} have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the {{financial}} depression. The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland {{time to make a}} full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session. Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island. The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery. The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured. During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated. Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.|$|E
5|$|Elevation rise {{across the}} park results from land uplift along the Burnside-Eden fault zone. This zone {{is a major}} land fault {{separating}} the Adelaide Plains from the Mount Lofty Ranges and runs north-north-east across the park from its southwest corner. The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement. Sediments were formed approximately 700million years ago (mya) from sand washed into a shallow sea. Sand layers were then folded and slightly metamorphosed during the delamerian orogeny, a period of mountain building caused by tectonic plate movements and resulting east–west compression of Australia. This pushed up a mountain range, {{on the site of}} the present Mount Lofty Ranges, approximately 450mya. The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350million years. Approximately 40mya, the location of today's ranges and plains were flat, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> sedimentary capping. About 2mya, block faulting raised the Mount Lofty Ranges, and much of the former land surface west of the ranges eroded away. The Gun Emplacement is a small remnant of this pre-erosion surface. It is a raised semi-circular flat area and has views over much of Adelaide from the southwestern corner of the park. The Emplacement is seen as an important regolith deposit, particularly for its role in understanding Adelaide's landscape's evolution. The Emplacement was declared a Geological Monument in 1978 for this geologic importance as well as its aesthetic and recreational value.|$|E

5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a roughened texture.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, American bands such as Aerosmith fused blues <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> rock edge.

25|$|Hand axes {{made using}} only a soft hammer {{are much less}} common. In most cases at least initial work was done <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hammer, before {{subsequent}} flaking with a soft hammer erased all vestiges of that work. A soft hammer is not suitable {{for all types of}} percussion platform and it cannot be used on certain types of raw material. It is, therefore, necessary to start <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> hammer or with a flake as a core as its edge will be fragile (flat, smooth pebbles are also useful). This means that although it was possible to manufacture a hand axe using a soft hammer, it is reasonable to suppose that a hard hammer was used to prepare a blank followed by one or more phases of retouching to finish the piece. However, the degree of separation between the phases is not certain, as the work could have been carried out in one operation.|$|E
