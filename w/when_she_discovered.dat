Hoping to save her Granny's recipes, she embarked upon a journey {{to take them to}} the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives. On her way, she encountered the Wolf, who asked her a series of suspicious questions.

5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> {{a bundle}} of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – {{with the intention of}} informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy Purse. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been unaware of any such payment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

5|$|The Oliviers {{returned}} to Britain in March 1943, and Leigh toured through North Africa {{that same year}} {{as part of a}} revue for the armed forces stationed in the region. She reportedly turned down a studio contract worth $5,000 a week to volunteer as part of the war effort. Leigh performed for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was diagnosed as having tuberculosis in her left lung and spent several weeks in hospital before appearing to have recovered. Leigh was filming Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> she was pregnant, then had a miscarriage. Leigh temporarily fell into a deep depression that hit its low point, with her falling to the floor, sobbing in an hysterical fit. This was the first of many major bipolar disorder breakdowns. Olivier later came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode– several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of depression and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.|$|E

25|$|The sub-plot intertwines {{with the}} main plot in two places:- Colin's reasons for helping Sheila are fueled by a deep regret for failing to assist Fiona <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> Annabel's {{involvement}} in the smuggling, and thus not being there when she was killed; {{the investigation into the}} initial murder causes an argument to happen between Mabbutt and Pebmarsh that is misheard by Mrs Hemmings, but which Poirot realises was in regards to the documents they had copied that they needed to get past the police before they were discovered.|$|E
25|$|Colonel Maurice Buckmaster {{ignored the}} message as {{unreliable}} {{because he did}} not know who Olschanezky was. As a result, German transmissions from Inayat Khan’s radio continued to be treated as genuine, leading to the unnecessary deaths of SOE agents, including Olschanezky herself, who was executed at Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp on 6 July 1944. When Vera Atkins investigated the deaths of missing SOE agents, she initially confused Inayat Khan with Olschanezky (they were similar in appearance), who was unknown to her, believing that Inayat Khan had been killed at Natzweiler, correcting the record only <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> Inayat Khan’s fate at Dachau.|$|E
25|$|The myth of Huitzilopochtli {{is uniquely}} Aztec. Huitzilopochtli is {{therefore}} {{considered to be}} the cult god or the patron god of the Aztec. As a solar deity, Huitzilopochtli is closely related to and overlaps with Tonatiuh. Huitzilopochtli’s mother was Coatlicue, or She of the Serpent Skirt. Coatlicue, known for her devout nature and virtuous qualities, was at Mount Coatepec or Coatepetl ("Serpent Hill"; near Tula, Hidalgo) one day, sweeping and tending to her penance, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> a bundle of feathers on the ground.

25|$|Bruce Ivins was born, {{and spent}} his youth, in Lebanon, Ohio, {{a small town}} 30 miles {{northeast}} of Cincinnati.

His father, a pharmacist, owned a drugstore and was active in the local Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce. The family went regularly to Lebanon Presbyterian Church, although Ivins was later a Catholic parishioner. According to C.W. Ivins, one of Ivins' older brothers, their mother Mary was violent and physically abusive to all three children. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> she was pregnant with Bruce, a pregnancy that was unplanned and unwanted, she repeatedly tried to abort the child by throwing herself down a set of stairs. Ivins would eventually hear the story of his mother's attempt to abort him.|$|E
25|$|After Artemis's {{death as}} Wonder Woman, her soul {{was sent to}} a form of Hell. While in the underworld Artemis became a figurative bride to one of the {{thirteen}} ruling Princes of Hell named Dalkriig-Hath. As his bride Artemis became part of Dalkriig-Hath's legion of demonic warriors. Eventually Artemis was able to kill Dalkriig-Hath and regain access {{to the world of the}} living. Wanting to separate herself from her former title as Wonder Woman, Artemis used her skills learned in Tartarus to her advantage and joined a group of demon hunting heroes called the Hellenders. Based in Waverly, Pennsylvania she was assigned the codename Javelin, which she quickly rejected for the name Requiem. Artemis developed a romantic interest in fellow Hellender Sure-Shot, a master of arsenal and projection weapons. This interest was dropped though <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>discovered</b> that Sure-Shot's perceived self-assuredness was brought on by psychotropic drugs which were meant to keep various Hellender members fearless while battling the likes of demons and ghouls.|$|E
