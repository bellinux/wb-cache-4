5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six on the left and four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
25|$|Father Time, a Saturn-like image, is a {{reminder}} of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed and envy toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.|$|E
25|$|The epic {{begins with}} a {{dedication}} section, with the poet paying homage to Virgil and Homer. The first line mimics the opening line of the Aeneid, and pays a hopeful tribute to the young King Sebastião. The story, then (in imitation of the classical epics) portrays the gods of Greece watching over the voyage of Vasco da Gama. Just as the gods had divided loyalties during the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas, here Venus, who favors the Portuguese, is opposed by Bacchus, who is here associated with the east and resents the encroachment on his territory. <b>We</b> <b>encounter</b> Vasco da Gama's voyage in medias res as they have already rounded the Cape of Good Hope. At the urging of Bacchus, who is disguised as a Moor, the local Muslims plot to attack the explorer and his crew.|$|E

25|$|Numerous popular stories {{throughout}} the world reflect a firmly-rooted belief in an intimate connection between {{a human being and}} a tree, plant or flower. Sometimes a man's life depends upon the tree and suffers when it withers or is injured, and <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> the idea of the external soul, already found in the Ancient Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers from at least 3000 years ago. Here one of the brothers leaves his heart {{on the top of the}} flower of the acacia and falls dead when it is cut down. Sometimes, however, the tree is a mysterious token which shows its sympathy with an absent hero by weakening or dying, as the man becomes ill or loses his life. These two features very easily combine, and they agree in representing to us mysterious sympathy between tree and human life.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} story, then titled [...] "The Shroud," [...] {{was written}} by Joseph Stefano, who had previously worked on The Outer Limits. Hannah Louise Shearer was given the task of re-writing the original take. The first draft had Yar's death occur earlier in the episode with {{the main focus of}} the episode being the Armus creature rather than her death. It was the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry who argued in favor of her sudden demise as he felt it was suitable for a security officer. Roddenberry also argued against killing Armus in retaliation. Shearer later described the decision, saying [...] "Gene felt we couldn't kill the creature, because it is not up to us as human beings to make a moral judgement on any creature that <b>we</b> <b>encounter,</b> because we are not God".|$|E
500|$|Before Outliers, Gladwell, who {{typically}} writes from a contrarian viewpoint, wrote two best-selling books: The Tipping Point (2000) and Blink (2005). Both {{books have been}} described as [...] "pop economics". The Tipping Point focuses on how ideas and behaviors reach critical mass, such as how Hush Puppies rapidly grew popular in the 1990s. Blink explains [...] "what happens during the first two seconds <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> something, before we actually start to think". All Gladwell's books focus on singularities: singular events in The Tipping Point, singular moments in Blink, and singular people in Outliers. Gladwell was drawn to writing about singular things after he discovered that [...] "they always made the best stories". Convinced that the most unusual stories had the best chance of reaching the front page of a newspaper, he was [...] "quickly weaned off the notion that [...] should be interested in the mundane".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E
2500|$|Arias: less {{frequent}} than in Italian opera, Rameau nevertheless offers many striking examples. Particularly admired arias include Télaïre's [...] "Tristes apprêts," [...] from Castor et Pollux; [...] "Ô jour affreux" [...] and [...] "Lieux funestes," [...] from Dardanus; Huascar's invocations in Les Indes galantes; {{and the final}} ariette in Pigmalion.

"Because {{the play}} is so {{stripped}} down, so elemental, it invites all kinds {{of social and political}} and religious interpretation" [...] wrote Normand Berlin in a tribute to the play in Autumn 1999, [...] "with Beckett himself placed in different schools of thought, different movements and 'ism's. The attempts to pin him down have not been successful, but the desire to do so is natural when <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> a writer whose minimalist art reaches for bedrock reality.

2500|$|The {{entry of}} 4 August 1959 reads: [...] "To have humility is to {{experience}} reality, not {{in relation to}} ourselves, but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act {{from the point of}} rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both David Wiles of the University of London and Harold Bloom of Yale University have {{strongly}} {{endorsed the}} reading of this play under the themes of Carnivalesque, Bacchanalia, and Saturnalia. Writing in 1998, David Wiles stated that: [...] "The starting point for my own analysis will be the proposition that although <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> A Midsummer Night's Dream as a text, it was historically part of an aristocratic carnival. It was written for a wedding, {{and part of the}} festive structure of the wedding night. The audience who saw the play in the public theatre {{in the months that followed}} became vicarious participants in an aristocratic festival from which they were physically excluded. My purpose will be to demonstrate how closely the play is integrated with a historically specific upper-class celebration." ...|$|E

Introduction We describe our experiences in trying to implement a hierarchical reinforcement learning system. This includes our design objectives, the problems <b>we</b> <b>encountered,</b> the solutions <b>we</b> devised for some of these problems, and our conclusions afterward.

2500|$|Each {{object is}} a [...] "mirror of all others." [...] Our {{perception}} of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement {{and understanding of the}} world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual [...] Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can we turn our attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.|$|E
2500|$|Craig Pearson, Executive Vice President of Maharishi University of Management (MUM), {{says that}} {{spending}} time in buildings that follow these principles makes one smarter. Proponents say that MVA homes have escaped wildfires that burned neighboring homes, and that businesses located in MVA office buildings have greater profit and lower absenteeism. Residents of MVA homes in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa say they felt vitality, calm and happiness when they moved into their Vedic houses. A mother says that her boys are more orderly. Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has said, [...] "Living in a proper vastu can eliminate 60 to 80 percent of the problems <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> in life."

Yale University architecture professor Keller Easterling says that MVA is fueled by a desire to create outposts for broadcasting the Maharishi Effect.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{significantly}} {{differs from}} all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, [...] "Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He {{is not just a}} plain frontal image. The wandering tribals <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found that these people are settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why I cast two of them in my film." ...|$|E

If we used the negative binomial distribution to model the number of goal attempts a sportsman makes before scoring r goals, though, then each unsuccessful attempt would be a [...] "success", and scoring a goal would be [...] "failure". If we are tossing a coin, then the negative binomial distribution can give the number of heads ("success") we are likely to encounter before <b>we</b> <b>encounter</b> a certain number of tails ("failure").
