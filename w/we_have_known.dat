After the first hour, his strokeplay was what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it to be: audacious, inventive and always breathtaking. He cut and straight-drove the fast bowlers, smote and murdered the spinners and when Steve Waugh tried to fox him with a slower one, he deposited him over long-off.|$|E
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, stating that the film was [...] "more than a movie. It's some kind of miracle." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, {{highlighted}} the use of 3-D which he said, [...] "surpasses even what James Cameron accomplished in the flight sequences of Avatar". Scott {{also said that the}} film [...] "in a little more than 90 minutes rewrites the rules of cinema as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> them". Quentin Tarantino said it was one of his top ten movies of 2013. Empire, Time, and Total Film ranked the film as the best of 2013.|$|E

500|$|On August 26, George H. W. Bush toured devastated {{areas of}} Louisiana with Governor Edwin Edwards. President Bush remarked, [...] "The {{destruction}} from this storm goes beyond anything <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> in recent years," [...] but noted that damage was less severe than in Florida. After {{his visit to}} Louisiana, President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area, but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration. FEMA initially opened five field offices throughout Louisiana. These centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid. After Franklin mayor Sam Jones and Congressman Billy Tauzin criticized FEMA for failing to open a field office in Franklin, FEMA promised to do so. [...] In {{the first few days}} following the storm, Louisiana National Guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees, roofing shingles, and torn aluminum siding. The state National Guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water. About 1,300National Guardsmen were deployed to southern Louisiana.|$|E
500|$|... "His Last Vow" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, with Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{saying that}} the episode was [...] "as good a finale as Sherlock's ever had", with a very strong plot. Mark Jefferies of The Mirror called the episode [...] "easily the best yet in this run", with a [...] "fascinating" [...] plot. He also praised Mikkelsen as [...] "brilliant". Josh Wilding, also writing for The Mirror, said the episode [...] "was {{in many ways the}} best episode of Sherlock yet" [...] and called it [...] "simply one of the greatest TV shows of all-time", giving it 5/5. Caroline Frost of the Huffington Post called it a [...] "fitting finale to the series, with writers and actors all saving their best for last", despite the third series' [...] "patchy" [...] performances. Serana Davies of The Telegraph called the episode [...] "the best of the lot" [...] and gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Moffat [...] "the superior Sherlock writer". Although her review was mainly positive, she questioned whether the programme had become [...] "a little vain, rather a show-off". Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said the episode was [...] "perfect", and a [...] "ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence", a sentiment echoed by Ellen Jones of The Independent, who stated that it contained [...] "intelligence, humour and obscure fanboy references galore" [...] which [...] "delivered the goods". She went on to state that it is [...] "enough detail in this episode to justifying watching it again and again, once weekly, until series four". Chris Harvey of The Telegraph praised the [...] "beautifully done" [...] conclusion of the episode featuring Moriarty, saying it was [...] "very playful, very neat. And very unexpected". Sandipan Deb, writing in Indian newspaper Mint, was positive about the episode, calling it [...] "the best" [...] episode in the series, and praised its [...] "stunning twists and turns, its thrilling upending of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> about the characters for a lifetime, an emotional depth not seen before, and its clever throwaway references to the Canon". Deb also praised the [...] "uber-cool cinematic technique", singling out the moment when Sherlock has been shot and falls to the floor as an [...] "extraordinary leap of the imagination and cinematic bravura". However, it was stated that the writers were [...] "influenced by the zoned-out Holmes films directed by Guy Ritchie".|$|E

Once the young Peterson was finally persuaded that it was performed by a single person, he was so intimidated {{that he did not}} touch the piano for weeks. [...] Peterson also stated that, [...] "If you speak of pianists, the most complete pianist that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> and possibly will know, from what I've heard to date, is Art Tatum." [...] "Musically speaking, he was and is my musical God, and I feel honored to remain one of his humbly devoted disciples." ...|$|E

Michael Drogan, director of MMC, said: [...] "Following the completion of investigations, which have now been published, we recognise there is significant asbestos contamination {{in areas of the}} woodland and have evidence of pockets of contamination {{in other parts of the}} site." [...] Rochdale councillor Tom Stott responded: [...] "In their initial reports they said there was little contamination. Now it is 'significant'.

2500|$|Jackson {{held that}} the {{critical}} distinction {{was the nature of}} the Communist Party: [...] "If the statute before us required labor union officers to forswear membership in the Republican Party, the Democratic Party or the Socialist Party, I suppose all agree that it would be unconstitutional. But why, if it is valid as to the Communist Party?" [...] But [...] "the Communist Party is something different, in fact, from any other substantial party <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> and hence may constitutionally be treated as something different in law." [...] Jackson reviewed at length the reasons why the Communist Party was unique: [...] It constituted a minority which advocated the seizing of power through non-majoritarian means, it was a political party controlled by a foreign government, it was dedicated to violence as the means of seizing power (including [...] "occasional terroristic and threatening methods, such as picketing courts and juries, political strikes and sabotage"), it sought to achieve its violent ends by controlling the labor movement (control it must conceal in order to be effective), and it considers all its members [...] "agents" [...] of the party (unlike loosely-knit [...] "native" [...] parties).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y. Bekavac also stated in a press release on the college website that Scripps will also no longer submit the Reputational Survey to U.S. News as [...] "for years <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> of flaws in the methodology; {{many of us have}} spoken with editors at U.S. News in an attempt to improve its approach [...] but nothing can really improve a system that seeks to reduce 3,300 educational programs in American higher education to one set of numbers, and then rank them. College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
