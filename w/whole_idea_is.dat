500|$|Steve Jackson {{reviewed}} Bunnies & Burrows in The Space Gamer No. 10. Jackson {{concluded that}} [...] "B & B is probably with the retail price [...] {{at least to}} a FRP fan. The writing style is intelligent, lucid, and occasionally witty; the rules are workable [...] the art, as I think I pointed out, is so bad it's great; and the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> appealing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> {{that you}} have that nostalgic night out, so people who are older can listen to it too. None of us are naive enough not to know what kids do. It’s {{important}} not to patronise the youth of today, we’re not gonna be writing about ‘oh let’s just hold hands for a while’ you know? They need their music to connect. A lot of songs are about sex {{and you have to}} be realistic about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{comparisons}} {{have been}} made between the lyrical content of [...] "Homesick" [...] and MercyMe's 2001 single [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the 'sequel' to [...] "I Can Only Imagine." [...] Regarding these comparisons, Millard said [...] "’I Can Only Imagine’ took the focus off {{of what you are}} going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going... ’Homesick’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here. I don’t think as a Christian that it’s right for me to say, ‘I wish you could’ve stayed here,’ because truthfully, we’re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be. The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that we’re the ones who have to wait.” Millard has also noted, [...] "The difference with ‘Homesick’ [...] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away. When you lose somebody, you learn what being homesick is really about." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{advocate}} depute was Brian McConnachie, who {{characterized the}} material stating [...] "It's clear from that material that the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to glorify martyrdom operations..." ...|$|R
50|$|Murdoch {{designed}} the Provisional Parliament House in Canberra. However, {{he had no}} enthusiasm for the project, saying expenditure on {{it could not be}} justified at the time; and he thought the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> a waste of money.|$|R
5000|$|None of {{the changes}} seems to have {{achieved}} very much. Experienced locomotive engineers have expressed astonishment and disbelief at the [...] "cacophony" [...] that the mixed valve gear gave rise to, and many have stated that the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> a disaster.|$|R
500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can feel all these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{pictorial}} {{ideals of}} Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter {{years of the}} 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 New York Times review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that [...] "John Stuart Ingle proves that Magic Realism lives" [...] in his [...] "virtuoso" [...] still life watercolors. Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the [...] "magic" [...] effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: [...] "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given. The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> to take something that's given and explore that reality as intensely as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{prolonged}} touring of fourth album Catalyst (2004), {{which included a}} supporting slot on Green Day's American Idiot Tour, the band were left drained and sought an extended break. They {{were able to take}} two months off and regroup afterward, something they had not previously done during their career. The quintet decided to take on a new approach for the writing process of Coming Home, rather than the usual [...] "tour bus and dressing room jams", they moved into a house together in Malibu, California called the Morning View Mansion to write and demo new material. Despite this, main composer and lead guitarist, Chad Gilbert took a book containing over 40 riff ideas that he had written during the previous tour into the mansion. Drummer Cyrus Bolooki explained that, [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that we can be sitting around, watching TV, and suddenly be like, 'Hey, I've got an idea. Let's do this'. We've always wanted to do something like this, but we were never sure just how to do it. I know all the guys are really excited to get into the house, hang out and make some music." [...] The band spent four months in Malibu with studio engineer and long term friend Paul Miner, from August 2005 through November, eventually leaving with 14 finished demos to present to their record label.|$|E
50|$|He {{came close}} to {{returning}} to the operatic stage when Richard Wagner considered casting him as Klingsor in Parsifal in 1882. However, the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> abandoned shortly afterwards due to a role confusion—the emasculated Klingsor was not a castrato, but a eunuch castrated past puberty and thus singing baritone, not soprano.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 VWFL player Debbie Lee made {{headlines}} for pushing {{to play against}} men in the made-for-television team the Hammerheads. She has commented, [...] "My <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> with the Hammerheads was to promote women's football. At no point in time did I really think I {{was going to play}} against the men, and frankly it wouldn't really have been smart for me to do that. My <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to cause a bit of activity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Fleming {{published}} {{books about}} various events and {{figures of the}} Revolutionary era. He also wrote about other periods of American history, and wrote over a dozen well-received novels set against various historical backgrounds. He said, [...] "I {{never wanted to be}} an Irish-American writer, my <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to get across that bridge and be an American writer".|$|R
6000|$|... "Psha!" [...] Mrs. Grantly's temper {{was never}} bitter, {{but at this}} moment it was not {{sweetened}} by her husband's very uncivil reference to her sex. [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> nonsense, and you should {{get it out of}} your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} this," [...] he said, with a smile, {{as if her}} wild trepidation interested him as an anticipated symptom. [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> new and startling to you. But I {{know you}} won't dismiss it abruptly, and I won't be discouraged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> dead. Humanity {{itself is}} dry-rotten, really. There are myriads {{of human beings}} hanging on the bush--and they look very nice and rosy, your healthy young men and women. But they are apples of Sodom, {{as a matter of}} fact, Dead Sea Fruit, gall-apples. It isn't true that they have any significance--their insides are full of bitter, corrupt ash.' ...|$|E
50|$|A {{road was}} first {{built in the}} District in 1975 by Sika and since then has not been rehabilitated. While the {{transporting}} of chiefs, messengers and security personnel was still {{going on in the}} District {{at the time it was}} a chiefdom, the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> discouraged by a young graduate from the BWI called Jonathan V. Dayee from Kparblee Town in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|According to Claudia Brücken, [...] "The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} a {{programme}} called Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. That was when we discovered how much we {{wanted to write about}} that idea and what a great introduction it would be for Thomas and me to have a duet as a first single. Two characters talking about that whole thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ez {{wanted to}} create {{something}} fresh and different and told “The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to dig inside instead of looking at others”. Experimenting and having fun was high priority.

6000|$|Mr Bethany {{clasped his}} knuckled {{fingers on the}} tablecloth. 'It's no good,' he {{concluded}} after a long pause; 'the fellow's got up into my head. I can't think him out. We must thrash it out quietly {{in the morning with}} the blessed sun at the window; not this farthing dip. To me the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> as revolting as it is incredible. Why, above a century--no, no! And on the other hand, how easily one's fancy builds! A few straws and there's a nest and squawking fledglings, all complete. Is that why--is that why that good, practical wife of yours and all your faithful household have absconded? Does it'--he threw up his head as if towards the house above them--'does it REEK with him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me?" [...] said Archie. [...] "Hard on your father? Well, dash it all, I don't think I {{treat him}} {{with what you}} might call actual brutality, what! I mean to say, my <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> rather to keep out of the old lad's way and curl up in a ball if I can't dodge him. I'd just as soon be hard on a stampeding elephant! I wouldn't for the world say {{anything}} derogatory, as it were, to your jolly old pater, but there is no getting away from the fact that he's by way of being one of our leading man-eating fishes. It would be idle to deny that he considers that you let down the proud old name of Brewster a bit when you brought me in and laid me on the mat." ...|$|E
60|$|April 20.--In {{the last}} three days I have made several expeditions to the Blue John Gap, and have even {{penetrated}} some short distance, but my bicycle lantern is so small and weak that I dare not trust myself very far. I shall do the thing more systematically. I have heard no sound at all, and could almost believe that I had been the victim of some hallucination suggested, perhaps, by Armitage's conversation. Of course, the <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> absurd, and yet I must confess that those bushes at the entrance of the cave do present an appearance as if some heavy creature had forced its way through them. I begin to be keenly interested. I have said nothing to the Miss Allertons, for they are quite superstitious enough already, but I have bought some candles, and mean to investigate for myself.|$|E
5000|$|He had {{two basic}} motivations. One was {{to destroy the}} labor unions {{and the other was}} to {{maintain}} the free market. Keynes despised the American Keynesians. His <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to have an impotent government that would do nothing but, through tax and spending policies, maintain the equilibrium of the free market.

5000|$|The <b>whole</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> if Gokul is {{suspended}} {{even for a}} day, a new investigating officer can be appointed and a scam of this stature which runs to thousands of crores can be shut. ... I couldn’t do anything for Gokul who had done the investigation going out of his way. I was very disturbed and couldn’t sleep for two days. I told my wife and decided to resign on Wednesday.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "Drive-cycle" [...] {{basically}} is {{the representative of}} the road. Drive cycles are used to reduce the expense of on road tests, time of test and fatigue of the test engineer.

5000|$|In 1967 Weston {{traveled}} throughout Africa with a U.S. cultural delegation. The {{last stop}} {{of the tour}} was Morocco, where he decided to settle, running his African Rhythms Club in Tangier for five years, from 1967 to 1972.

5000|$|Harby {{was also}} known for his {{opposition}} to modern art, sculpture and music.
