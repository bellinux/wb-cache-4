5|$|By {{this period}} of the conflict, the number of German {{divisions}} remaining on the Western Front was rapidly declining, both in numbers and quality, a fact in the Allies' favour. By the night of 23 March, Montgomery had the equivalent of more than 30 divisions under his command, while the Germans fielded around 10 divisions, all weakened from constant fighting. The best German formation the Allied airborne troops <b>would</b> <b>face</b> was the 1st Parachute Army, although even this formation had been weakened from the losses it had sustained in earlier fighting, particularly when it had engaged Allied forces in the Reichswald Forest in February. First Parachute Army had three corps stationed along the river; 2nd Parachute Corps to the north, 86th Corps in the centre, and 63rd Corps in the south. Of these formations, 2nd Parachute Corps and 86th Corps had a shared boundary that ran through the proposed landing zones for the Allied airborne divisions, meaning that the leading formation of each corps — these being 7thParachute Division and 84thInfantry Division — <b>would</b> <b>face</b> the airborne assault. After their retreat to the Rhine both divisions were under-strength and did not number more than 4,000 men each, with 84thInfantry Division supported by only 50 or so medium artillery pieces.|$|E
