[...] He's not yelling at them, so he must think something about you.' And that held <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{warned of}} {{potential}} domination by a Stalin dictatorship over part of Europe, Roosevelt {{responded with a}} statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin: [...] "I just have a hunch that Stalin is {{not that kind of}} a man[...] [...] [...] I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> world of democracy and peace." [...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, The Kolkata Telegraph {{reported}} that director Rituparno Ghosh wanted to cast Chakraverti {{in a film}} based on a case the Wiccan had encountered while practicing the craft. Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evilâ€“ A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, since I had lived the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, she came down to Delhi and lived <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. I showed her how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E

"I {{disposed}} of a cornelian of no great price, which bore this conceit, {{to the wife}} of the emperor's ambassador, but conceiving there was no more in the purchase than some waywardness of fancy, I took no precaution to note the stone.
