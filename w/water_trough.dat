5|$|The Namib Desert Horses were {{originally}} forced {{to compete with}} domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed. Due in part to this competition for limited forage, the horses nearly became extinct. However, they were saved {{in part due to}} the efforts of Jan Coetzer, employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine (CDM or DBCM), mining in part of Sperrgebiet. Garub was a station for the re-filling of steam locomotives until 1977, when diesel locomotives took over the route. The horses, who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives, were placed in danger when the pumping stopped, with several horses dying of dehydration. Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water, which they did in 1980, installing holding tanks and a <b>water</b> <b>trough.</b> Between 1964 and 1984, population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses, but generally averaged 140 to 160. In 1984, an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses, while ground-based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals.|$|E

Albright, have considered to be historical evidence of the ten plagues; for example, an ancient <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> found in El Arish bears hieroglyphic markings detailing a period of darkness. Albright and other Christian archaeologists have claimed that such evidence, as well as careful study of the areas ostensibly travelled by the Israelites after the Exodus, make discounting the biblical account untenable.|$|E

25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the <b>water</b> <b>trough.</b> After the calf had satisfied its thirst, they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E

Using camera trapping, we monitored the use of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> by wild rabbits over 228 weeks in three consecutive periods, from June to October in 2008, 2009 and 2010, on farmland in north–west Spain. Wild rabbits used 43 % of the <b>water</b> <b>troughs.</b> A significantly higher number of rabbits were observed drinking at troughs surrounded by shrub cover than at those in open fields. Most drinking events were recorded from July to September (98 %), though the use of <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> was not clearly related to weather. Wild rabbits drank mainly during the morning (52 % of rabbits), less so in the evening and at night, and rarely in the afternoon. Wild rabbits were photographed together with red–legged partridges (Alectoris rufa) in 6 % of photographs. These findings suggest <b>water</b> <b>troughs</b> are useful for species such as wild rabbits and should be allocated close to shrub areas...|$|R

2500|$|Snails can be bred {{in boxes}} or cages stacked several units high. An {{automatic}} sprinkler {{system can be}} used to provide moisture. Breeding cages need a feed trough and a <b>water</b> <b>trough.</b> Plastic trays a couple of inches deep are adequate; deeper water troughs increase the chance of snails drowning in them. Trays can be set on a bed of small gravel. Small plastic pots, e.g., flower pots about 3inches deep, can be filled with sterilized dirt (or a loamy pH neutral soil) and set in the gravel to give the snails a place to lay their eggs. After the snails lay eggs each pot is replaced. (Set one pot inside another so that one can be easily lifted without shifting the gravel.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{and near}} to the churchyard are four {{structures}} that are listed at GradeII. [...] The churchyard wall of sandstone and brick dates partly from the late medieval period with additions made in the 18th and 19thcenturies. It incorporates a <b>water</b> <b>trough.</b> [...] The lychgate to the churchyard was erected in 1920 as a war memorial to the First World War. It is oak-framed on a sandstone plinth, with an oak crucifix on the front gable. [...] In the churchyard is a stone sundial from the late 18thcentury consisting of a vase baluster on a round step sitting on a square flagstone base with a copper dial and gnomon. [...] Just outside the churchyard wall are stocks probably dating from the early 18thcentury. [...] The churchyard also contains the war graves of six British servicemen, four of World War I and two of World War II.|$|E
2500|$|It was [...] "to give {{religious}} and spiritual support" [...] to the villagers that Henry the Navigator, as Governor in the military-religious Order of Christ, initiated construction near the fishing port {{of a small}} church dedicated to Saint Mary. Henry also ordered {{the construction of a}} fountain and <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> in 1460 to provide drinking water for the people and their animals. The foundation of the church and the Jerónimos Monastery by Manuel I around 1459 {{on the site of the}} older church resulted in its transfer from the Order of Christ to the Hieronymite monks, and at the same time in its being renamed Santa Maria de Belém. The existing structure was started on the orders of Manuel I (1469–1521) at the courts of Montemor-o-Velho in 1495, as a final resting-place for members of the House of Aviz, in his belief that an Iberian dynastic kingdom would rule after his death. In 1496, King Manuel petitioned the Holy See for permission to construct a monastery at the entrance of the Tagus River. It was after the arrival of Vasco da Gama a year later with samples of gold he had discovered that the monastery became a symbol of Portuguese expansionism. The church became a house of prayer for seamen leaving or entering the port.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, townspeople grazed cattle on the Green, {{although}} it was owned by the College. [...] To protest the townspeople's failure to remove their cattle at night, students regularly would herd the animals into the basement of Dartmouth Hall and hold them hostage. Not until 1836, when the school and some individual citizens funded a fence, did anyone have a sure means of keeping cattle off the Green. [...] The removal of the fence in 1893 prompted students to request that a portion of it be left as a [...] "Senior Fence." [...] Underclassmen were prohibited from sitting on it, with consequences that might include being dumped in a <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> or otherwise humiliated. Over Green Key Weekend, the seniors would pass on their rights to the Fence to the junior class. In 2003 the fence was relocated from two parallel sections of fence {{on the east side}} of the Green to its current location at the southwest corner. [...] The administration decided to use the fence in this way in order to prevent students from cutting across the corner of the Green and wearing away the grass. [...] Although the humiliation of undergraduates is no longer enforced, the fence is still held in some regard by the senior class.|$|E

2500|$|Though BioShock Infinite {{shares the}} same name {{with the other two}} games, Levine has stated that this is a new direction, and was coy to answer if they shared the same universe. Levine {{referred}} to the term BioShock not as a specific location or setting, but a concept conjoined by two ideas: the exploration of a fantastical setting, and the use {{of a large number of}} tools and abilities in creative manners to survive. Along with the System Shock games, which Levine and other Irrational developers had worked on, the titles share the same idea of a [...] "component of learning about a new place" [...] and shocking the player into discovering more of the setting, according to Levine. Levine affirmed that with the similarities between the games, [...] "It would be dishonest to say this is not BioShock". Similarly, Timothy Gerritsen, director of product development, stated they wanted to keep the feel of the BioShock experience but still consider Infinite to be a new intellectual property; as a means to sever the implied connection to the previous games, the teaser purposely shows a Big Daddy figurine being crushed at the onset. This was furthered by the selection of the word Infinite as part of the title, to reflect the [...] "many possibilities" [...] they wanted to explore with the BioShock concept. The game does not completely eschew BioShock, as certain elements like the sound effects representing the player's health or for gaining new quests from BioShock are reused without modification in Infinite; Levine stated that they had worked these common elements as former BioShock players would already understand their impact, and that they had spent a great detail of time during BioShock to get these elements right and felt no need to reinvent the sounds again. Further, the introduction of Infinite purposely mimics several elements from BioShocks opening: one example given by writer Drew Holmes is the act of walking through a candle-lined <b>water</b> <b>trough</b> in a Columbia church to be baptized, which visually is similar to swimming through the flaming wreckage of the plane to reach the bathysphere terminus for Rapture.|$|E
