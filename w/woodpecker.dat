5|$|The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> {{is similar}} to some other species in its genus. The Syrian <b>woodpecker</b> lacks its relative's black cheek bar and has whiter underparts and paler red underparts, {{although}} juvenile great spotted woodpeckers often have an incomplete cheek bar, so can potentially be misidentified as Syrian. The white-winged <b>woodpecker</b> has a far more extensive white wing patch than the great spotted <b>woodpecker.</b> The Sind <b>woodpecker</b> {{is very similar to}} the Syrian species, and can be distinguished from great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> in the same way.|$|E
5|$|According to the London Borough of Hillingdon, {{the most}} common species' of birds found within the woods are mute swan, Canada goose, robin, green <b>woodpecker,</b> jay, nuthatch, lesser spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> greater spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> cuckoo, sparrowhawk, tree creeper, tawny owl, willow tit and woodcock.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black <b>woodpecker,</b> great spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> middle spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> lesser spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> European green <b>woodpecker</b> and Eurasian three-toed <b>woodpecker.</b> Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed <b>woodpecker</b> enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Woodpeckers,</b> when climbing, can {{rotate the}} outer rear digit (4) {{to the side}} in an ectropodactyl arrangement. Black-backed <b>woodpeckers,</b> Eurasian three-toed <b>woodpeckers</b> and American three-toed <b>woodpeckers</b> have three toes - the inner rear (1) is missing, and the outer rear (4) points always {{backward}} (never rotates).|$|R
40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} animals should make {{foraging}} decisions after assessing {{the quality of}} available habitat, but most models fail to consider the spatio-temporal scales at which animals perceive habitat availability. We tested three foraging strategies that explain how Magellanic <b>woodpeckers</b> (Campephilus magellanicus) assess the relative quality of trees: 1) <b>Woodpeckers</b> with local knowledge select trees based on the available trees in the immediate vicinity. 2) <b>Woodpeckers</b> lacking local knowledge select trees based on their availability at previously visited locations. 3) <b>Woodpeckers</b> using information from long-term memory select trees based on knowledge about trees available within the entire landscape. We observed foraging <b>woodpeckers</b> and used a Brownian Bridge Movement Model to identify trees available to <b>woodpeckers</b> along foraging routes. <b>Woodpeckers</b> selected trees with a later decay stage than available trees. Selection models indicated that preferences of Magellanic <b>woodpeckers</b> were based on clusters of trees near the most recently visited trees, thus suggesting that <b>woodpeckers</b> use visual cues from neighboring trees. In a second analysis, Cox's proportional hazards models showed that <b>woodpeckers</b> used information consolidated across broader spatial scales to adjust tree residence times. Specifically, <b>woodpeckers</b> spent more time at trees with larger diameters and in a more advanced stage of decay than trees available along their routes. These results suggest that Magellanic <b>woodpeckers</b> make foraging decisions based on the relative quality of trees that they perceive and memorize information at different spatio-temporal scales...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Woodpeckers</b> {{are often}} portrayed {{as if they}} just peck other creatures as a defense, while real <b>woodpeckers</b> only peck wood on trees.|$|R
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn <b>woodpecker</b> and white-headed <b>woodpecker</b> also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian <b>woodpecker</b> and great spotted <b>woodpecker,</b> also feed in this way.|$|E
5|$|The {{woodpeckers}} are {{an ancient}} bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets {{and the true}} woodpeckers, Picinae. The largest of the six tribes within the Picinae is the pied woodpeckers, a group which includes the great spotted <b>woodpecker.</b> Within the large genus Dendrocopus the great spotted woodpecker's closest relatives are the Himalayan, Sind, Syrian and white-winged woodpeckers and possibly the Darjeeling <b>woodpecker.</b> The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> has been recorded as hybridising with the Syrian <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} natural enemies of the Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black <b>woodpecker</b> (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
50|$|Predators {{of adult}} red-bellied <b>woodpeckers</b> include {{birds of prey}} such as sharp-shinned hawks and Cooper's hawks, black rat snakes and house cats. Known predators of nestlings and eggs include {{red-headed}} <b>woodpeckers,</b> owls, pileated <b>woodpeckers,</b> gray rat snakes and black rat snakes. When approached by a predator, red-bellied <b>woodpeckers</b> either hide from the predator, or harass it with alarm calls. They defend their nests and young aggressively, and may directly attack predators that come near the nest.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} resin {{chemistry of}} loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P. echinata) pines selected as cavity trees by Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers</b> (Picoides borealis) in eastern Texas. We sampled resin from (1) pines selected by Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers</b> that contained naturally excavated active cavities, (2) pines selected by forest biologists that contained artificially installed cavity inserts and were actively {{being used by}} Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers,</b> and (3) control pines of similar age and appearance to the active cavity trees. We hypothesized that if <b>woodpeckers</b> are inducing a change in resin chemistry by excavating resin wells, this change should appear in active cavity trees selected by <b>woodpeckers</b> and trees selected by biologists, but not in control pines. If <b>woodpeckers</b> are selecting pines that have specific resin chemistry, concentrations of some resin components in active cavity trees selected by the <b>woodpeckers</b> for natural cavity excavation should be different from both control pines and pines selected by biologists. A large diterpene acid peak containing an isopimariclevopimaric- palustric methyl-ester mix in active natural cavity trees was approximately 20 % greater than controls and 22 % greater than trees with artificial cavities. None of the other eight resin chemicals differed among treatments. The activity of Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers</b> at resin wells {{did not appear to}} affect the composition of cavity tree resin. <b>Woodpeckers,</b> however, may select pines with specific resin chemistries for cavity trees...|$|R
50|$|Picides is an infraorder of the Piciformes order, that {{includes}} <b>woodpeckers</b> and honeyguides. The honeyguides {{were thought to}} be closely related to the barbets, as their aerial displays and vocalizations are more similar to each other than either are to <b>woodpeckers.</b> However, phylogenetic analysis has shown that honeyguides and <b>woodpeckers</b> are indeed sister taxa.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied <b>woodpecker</b> and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's <b>woodpecker,</b> northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most <b>woodpecker</b> movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped <b>woodpecker,</b> which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} {{woodpeckers}} in the Americas, the ivory-billed <b>woodpecker</b> and the imperial <b>woodpecker,</b> {{have been considered}} extinct since the mid-to-late 20th century, though there have been possible but disputed sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the United States since 2004, and a small population may survive in Cuba. Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa <b>woodpecker</b> from Japan, with a single declining population {{of a few hundred}} birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam and helipad construction, road building and agricultural development.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{found in}} birch {{woodland}} include the chaffinch, tree pipit, willow warbler, nightingale, robin, woodcock, redpoll and green <b>woodpecker.</b>|$|E
40|$|Recently, <b>woodpeckers</b> {{have been}} {{observed}} to damage facades of buildings at several different locations in the Netherlands. Insight into the mechanisms underlying this strange behavior of <b>woodpeckers</b> is needed. Moreover, {{there is a need}} to identify solutions to mitigate the damage by <b>woodpeckers</b> to facades of buildings. It is suggested that competition regarding available high quality nesting holes might occur between <b>woodpeckers</b> and secondary cavity nesters, such as ring neck parakeet Psittacula krameri and the European starling Sturnus vulgaris (e. g. Aitken et al., 2002; Lohmus and Remm, 2005). This might in particular be the case, when competition takes place in an area with a shortage of suitable trees that can be used by <b>woodpeckers</b> for excavating cavities. As a result of competition and/or a shortage of suitable nesting trees, <b>woodpeckers</b> might excavate nesting cavities in facades of buildings. In order to mitigate damage by <b>woodpeckers</b> to facades of buildings, it is recommended to hang reflective ribbons on the sidings of buildings to frighten <b>woodpeckers.</b> Moreover, damage to facades should be repaired as soon as possible with rigid, white or pastel colored materials. If a shortage of suitable nesting trees might be an issue, it is suggested to provide <b>woodpeckers</b> with alternative artificial nesting sites nearby (Jasumback et al., 1999). This could be done by placing nest boxes, artificial or dead wood near the location where <b>woodpeckers</b> damage facades of buildings. In case this is not effective, it is suggested to cover the facade of the building entirely with vinyl, aluminum, aviary mesh, or plastic netting (Harding et al., 2007; Belant, 1997; Jasumbach et al., 2000). In regards to park management it is suggested to conserve old, damaged and dead trees, as these are important for creating and maintaining a sustainable breeding habitat for <b>woodpeckers.</b> For future construction near forests, parks or wooden areas it is recommended to use rigid materials that cannot be damaged by <b>woodpeckers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Arizona <b>woodpeckers</b> {{are nearly}} {{identical}} to Strickland's <b>woodpeckers,</b> growing to be about 7 to 8 inches in length. Their plumage is mainly brown and white in coloration, brown on top with a dark rump with white underparts speckled with brown spots. Arizona <b>woodpeckers</b> usually have white bars on their wings, and have two white stripes across their face which join with another white bar on their neck. Male Arizona <b>woodpeckers</b> also have a red patch on the nape of their head which is lacking on females.|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the <b>woodpeckers</b> (the wryneck, black grey-headed, green, greater, lesser-spotted, white-backed, three-toed <b>woodpeckers).</b> The {{purpose of the}} work: the revealation of the {{specificity}} of ecology, demography, and interspecies relations of the <b>woodpeckers.</b> For the first time, the demographic parameters of the <b>woodpeckers</b> populations of the Russia European centre have been studied. It has been proved, that the large species variety of the <b>woodpeckers</b> became possible under the conditions of sympatry due to the differentiation {{of the terms of}} multiplication, the differences in the level of number, the biotopic and trophic segregation.

5|$|Great spotted {{woodpeckers}} are hunted by woodland {{birds of}} prey such as the Eurasian sparrowhawk and the northern goshawk. This <b>woodpecker</b> is a host of the blood-feeding fly Carnus hemapterus, and its internal parasites may include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transversus. Protozoans also occur, including the potentially fatal Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> is the favoured host of the tapeworm Anomotaenia brevis.|$|E
5|$|Group-living species {{tend to be}} {{communal}} group breeders. In {{addition to}} these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend {{to stay at the}} edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff <b>woodpecker</b> makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic <b>woodpecker</b> and acorn <b>woodpecker</b> are cooperative roosters.|$|E
5|$|Other {{means are}} also used to garner prey. Some species such as the red-naped sapsucker sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous <b>woodpecker</b> specialises in attacking the nests of {{arboreal}} ants and the buff-spotted <b>woodpecker</b> feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker feed wholly or partly on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include insects such as dark bush-crickets, {{white admiral}} and ringlet butterflies, and bird {{species such as}} sparrowhawks, tawny owls, great spotted <b>woodpeckers</b> and European green <b>woodpeckers.</b> Songbirds and sparrowhawks are popular sights.|$|R
50|$|<b>Woodpeckers</b> {{are known}} to prey on X. nasalis. <b>Woodpeckers</b> are {{attracted}} to the bee larvae sounds within the nest, and will drill holes with their beaks along the tunnels to reach the larvae.|$|R
40|$|Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers</b> {{are unique}} among <b>woodpeckers</b> {{in that they}} {{excavate}} their roost and nest cavities entirely within living pines. Studies {{show that there is}} a propensity for squirrels to use unenlarged cavities, none have shown evidence of Red-cockaded <b>Woodpeckers</b> being killed by southern flying squirrels. However, we report an instance of two nestlings found dead {{at the base of the}} nest tree and 3 flying squirrels inside the nest cavity...|$|R
5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted <b>woodpecker</b> is a sharp kik, which may be {{repeated}} as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> is omnivorous. It digs beetle larvae {{from trees}} and also takes many other {{invertebrates}} including adult beetles, ants and spiders. Crustaceans, molluscs and carrion may be eaten, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps. The nests of other cavity-nesting birds, such as tits, may be raided for their eggs and chicks; nest boxes may be similarly attacked, holes being pecked to admit entrance by the <b>woodpecker</b> where necessary. House martin colonies can be destroyed in repeated visits.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> {{spends much}} of its time {{climbing}} trees, and has adaptations to this lifestyle, {{many of which are}} shared by other <b>woodpecker</b> species. These include the zygodactyl arrangement of the foot, with two toes facing forward and two back, and the stiff tail feathers that are used as a prop against the trunk. In most birds the bones of the tail diminish in size towards its end, but this does not occur in woodpeckers, and the final vertebra, the pygostyle, is very large to anchor the strong tail muscles.|$|E

30|$|Burn {{severity}} and beetle occurrence can {{be strongly}} correlated (Hood and Bentz 2007), {{making it difficult}} to tease apart the relative importance of these factors to three-toed <b>woodpeckers.</b> It is unclear whether the <b>woodpeckers</b> are responding primarily to beetle availability, burn severity, or a combination of both. Foraging <b>woodpeckers</b> may use burn severity, as well as other external visual and auditory cues of beetle occurrence, to increase their success at locating beetle larvae.|$|R
5|$|The {{status of}} one bird on the North American list, the ivory-billed <b>woodpecker,</b> is controversial. Until 2005 this bird was widely {{considered}} to be extinct. In April of that year, {{it was reported that}} at least one adult male bird had been sighted in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge in Arkansas. This report however, has not been universally accepted, and the American Birding Association still lists the ivory-billed <b>woodpecker</b> as extinct.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{for the great}} spotted <b>woodpecker</b> is estimated at 73.7–110.3million individuals, with 35% {{of the population in}} Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently overspilled into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted <b>woodpecker</b> is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|American {{black bears}} have been spotted in the {{chaparral}} region, {{usually in the}} fall. The most common birds include titmice and the acorn <b>woodpecker.</b> blue-gray gnatcatchers, lesser goldfinches, and Anna's hummingbirds have also been seen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Woodpeckers</b> {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds with chisel-like beaks, short legs, stiff tails and long tongues used for capturing insects.

5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the <b>woodpecker's</b> skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a <b>woodpecker's</b> anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of <b>woodpeckers.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Woodpeckers</b> {{cause severe}} damage to utility poles and crossarms, {{resulting}} in substantial economic losses to utility companies.
