25|$|During {{the course}} of the voyages, Ming China had become the {{pre-eminent}} naval power of the early 15th century. The Yongle Emperor had extended imperial control over foreign lands during the span of the voyages. However, in 1433, the voyages ceased and Ming China turned away from the seas. It is not exactly known why the voyages completely ended in 1433. Duyvendak suggested that the complete cessation of the expeditions was partly due to the considerable expenses. <b>Whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> the costs for undertaking the voyages had not overburdened the Ming treasury. The trade was still flourishing long after the voyages had ceased. Chinese ships continued to control the Eastern Asian maritime trade. They also continued trading around India and East Africa.|$|E

[...] "I don't {{think of myself as}} a powerful person," [...] she told Forbes in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world's hundred most powerful women. [...] "You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be.</b> But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "Angevin Empire" [...] {{was coined}} in 1887 by Kate Norgate. As {{far as it}} is known there was no {{contemporary}} name for this assemblage of territories which were referred toif at allby clumsy circumlocutions such as our kingdom and everything subject to our rule <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> or the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term espace Plantagenet was acceptable.|$|E

500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show {{one of the first things}} we think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the FVdG {{insisted that}} the [...] "goal is {{everything}} and ... must be everything" [...] (a play on Bernstein's formula that [...] "the final goal, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> is nothing to me: the movement is everything"), it was unable {{to do much more}} than keep its own structures alive during World War I. Immediately after the declaration of war, FVdG tried to continue its antiwar demonstrations to no avail. Although it constantly criticized the Burgfrieden and militarism in general, industrial action was not possible except for a few minor cases (most notably resistance by the carpenters' union to Sunday work). The FVdG also received support from abroad. The faction in the Italian USI led by Armando Borghi, an antimilitarist minority in the French CGT, the Dutch NAS, as well as Spanish, Swedish, and Danish syndicalists were all united with the FVdG in their opposition to the war.|$|E
500|$|Steiger remarked of the film: [...] "I {{think my}} best {{work is in}} The Pawnbroker. The last scene, where I find the boy dead on the street. I think that's the highest moment, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> with my talent." [...] He drew upon {{inspiration}} for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from Picasso's [...] "Guernica", which depicts war-ravaged villagers. Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail wrote that Steiger's character [...] "seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man". Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of anti-Semitism, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin.|$|E

2500|$|When Schutzstaffel chief Heinrich Himmler visited Zagreb in 1943, {{indicating}} the impending roundup of remaining Jews, Stepinac wrote Pavelic {{that if this}} occurred, he would protest for [...] "the Catholic Church is not afraid of any secular power, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> when it has to protect basic human values". When deportatation began, Stepinac and Marcone protested to Andrija Artukovic. According to Phayer, the Vatican ordered Stepinac to save as many Jews as possible during the upcoming roundup. Though Stepinac personally saved many potential victims, his protests {{had little effect on}} PaveliÄ‡.|$|E

2500|$|Further, Adrian Fortescue {{noted in}} his article in the 1910 Catholic Encyclopedia the {{distinction}} between [...] "Roman Church" [...] and [...] "Church of Rome". He said that the expression [...] "Church of Rome" [...] commonly applied by non-Catholics to the Catholic Church but, according to him, {{it can only be}} used correctly to refer the diocese of Rome; and the term [...] "Roman Church", in case of the patriarchate, can be used as equivalent to [...] "Latin Church": [...] "A German Catholic is not, strictly speaking, a member of the Church of Rome but of the Church of Cologne, or Munich-Freising, or <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> in union with and under the obedience of the Roman Church (although, no doubt, by a further extension Roman Church may be used as equivalent to Latin Church for the patriarchate)." ...|$|E
