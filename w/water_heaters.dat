40|$|This paper investigates how {{to develop}} a learning-based demand {{response}} approach for electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> in a smart home that can minimize the energy cost of the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> while meeting the comfort requirements of energy consumers. First, a learning-based, data-driven model of an electric <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is developed by using a nonlinear autoregressive network with external input (NARX) using neural network. The model is updated daily {{so that it can}} more accurately capture the actual thermal dynamic characteristics of the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> especially in real-life conditions. Then, an optimization problem, based on the NARX <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> model, is formulated to optimize energy management of the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> in a day-ahead, dynamic electricity price framework. A genetic algorithm is proposed in order to solve the optimization problem more efficiently. MATLAB (R 2016 a) is used to evaluate the proposed learning-based demand response approach through a computational experiment strategy. The proposed approach is compared with conventional method for operation of an electric <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> Cost saving and benefits of the proposed <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> energy management strategy are explored...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> cannot supply {{hot water}} in cloudy and raining days alone. It in {{combination}} with {{air source heat pump}} <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> (ASHPWH) is a good choice. The performance of the two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is affected by the water temperature. It is important that the ASHPWH operate at a right temperature of the water. A solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with 4 m 2 flat-plate collector assisted by a 1. 5 kW ASHPWH is studied in this paper. The results show that both the collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and the COP of the ASHPWH system decreases as the water temperature increases. The highest and lowest collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> are 54. 4 % and 45. 6 % respectively. The COP of the ASHPWH system ranges from 6. 48 to 2. 61 as the water temperature increases. Operating sequences of these two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> affect solar energy utilization ratio and the power input of the ASHPWH system. 1...|$|R

5|$|Commercial solar <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> began {{appearing}} in the United States in the 1890s. These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels. As with photovoltaics, solar water heating attracted renewed attention {{as a result of}} the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices. Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20% since 1999. Although generally underestimated, solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154GW as of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone sealant from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{required}} for water heating accounts for approximately 40 percent of national residential natural gas consumption in California. With water heating contributing such {{a substantial portion}} of natural gas consumption, it is important to pay attention to <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> efficiencies. This paper reports on an investigation of a patented, buoyancy-operated flue damper. It is an add-on design to a standard atmospherically vented natural-draft gas-fired storage <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> The flue damper was expected to reduce off-cycle standby losses, which would lead to improvements in the efficiency of the <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> The test results showed that the Energy Factor of the baseline <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> was 0. 576. The recovery efficiency was 0. 768. The standby heat loss coefficient was 10. 619 (BTU/hr-oF). After the damper was installed, the test results show an Energy Factor for the baseline <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> of 0. 605. The recovery efficiency was 0. 786. The standby heat loss coefficient was 9. 135 (BTU/hr-oF). The recovery efficiency increased 2. 3 percent and the standby heat loss coefficient decreased 14 percent. When the burner was on, the baseline <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> caused 28. 0 CFM of air to flow from the room. During standby, the flow was 12. 4 CFM. The addition of the damper reduced the flow when the burner was on to 23. 5 CFM. During standby, flow with the damper was reduced to 11. 1 CFM. The flue damper reduced off-cycle standby losses, and improved the efficiency of the <b>water</b> <b>heater.</b> The flue damper also improved the recovery efficiency of the <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> by restricting on-cycle air flows through the flue. With or without the flue damper, off-cycle air flow up the stack is nearly half the air flow rate as when the burner is firing...|$|R
