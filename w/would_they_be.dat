5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> able to travel between different time machines as the cores would be different. The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|Reluctantly, Dowding defined three categories, A, B and C. Category A {{units were}} {{to bear the}} brunt of the fighting, and were to be kept at full {{strength}} in aircraft and pilots. Only if the A units suffered exceptionally high losses <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> replaced. B units were relief units, to be maintained at operational strength and only used if absolutely necessary. C units were generally stripped down to just five or six pilots. These units were devoted to training new pilots. Although not fit for fighter-fighter action, they could defend quieter areas. The system potentially could have had fatal results for Fighter Command, with C units becoming less and less effective. But the system had not been running long enough by 14 September for it to have a serious impact on Fighter Command's strength. The replacement units were sufficient in number and effectiveness to continue to replace exhausted units. By 15 September, the C units could still give a good account of themselves in battle.|$|E

25|$|The {{choice of}} {{the players and the}} nature of the rules are common {{subjects}} of debate with every edition. It continued to cause confusion until 2013 when it was clarified that the CLT20 rules state the players are free to choose their team. However, for a player named in an IPL team's squad, he would have to forego 20% of his salary to choose another team. The IPL offers the most lucrative salaries and is the only tournament to have a clause relating to the CLT20 in its contracts. As a result, players are unlikely to choose against their IPL teams. For non-IPL teams wanting to keep their players, not only <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> forfeiting the compensation fee, some have felt the need to offer their players compensation in an attempt to sway their decision.|$|E
25|$|It {{is clear}} {{now that the}} present {{situation}} cannot be allowed to continue. It is evident also that the Stormont government {{is no longer in}} control of the situation. Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. We have also asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E
500|$|In April 1999, {{although}} Sony Pictures optioned from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer all preceding script {{versions of}} a Spider-Man film, it only exercised the options on [...] "the Cameron material," [...] which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five page [...] "scriptment" [...] credited only to James Cameron. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> using his script. The studio lined up Roland Emmerich, Tony Scott, Chris Columbus, Ang Lee, David Fincher, Jan de Bont and M. Night Shyamalan as potential directors. Fincher {{did not want to}} depict the origin story, pitching the film as being based on The Night Gwen Stacy Died storyline, but the studio disagreed. Sam Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000, for a summer 2001 release. He had been a fan of the comic book during his youth, and his passion for Spider-Man earned him the job.|$|E

500|$|At {{a private}} meeting held in May 2007 between developers, EnergieKontor UK, and invited local councillors, plans were put forward for another large wind farm {{consisting}} of 24turbines on the moors above nearby Haslingden, spanning Thirteen Stone Hill and Oswaldtwistle Moor. Following the meeting Catherine Pilling, a Rossendale Liberal Democrat councillor, expressed her view that {{the natural beauty of}} the Rossendale Valley was under threat as it was increasingly being targeted by wind farm developers. [...] "Our party is very much in favour of renewable energy," [...] she said, [...] "but Rossendale is an area of outstanding beauty, and you have to ask: <b>Would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> building a similar thing in the Lake District?" [...] Rossendale Borough Council leader Duncan Ruddick representing the electoral ward of Worsley in Rossendale, the proposed site of the new wind farm, said he was against wind farms and would be campaigning against it and speaking at the Development Control committee when it came. The leader of the Labour local councillors was also opposed to the plan, saying that he was concerned {{about the size of the}} turbines and that the visual impact on the [...] "beautiful West Pennine Moors" [...] would be devastating. Planning permission for the development was granted by Hyndburn Council in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|There {{remained}} {{the issue of}} cooperation between the Manhattan's Project's Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Montreal Laboratory. At the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 17 February 1944, Chadwick pressed for resources {{to build a nuclear}} reactor at what is now known as the Chalk River Laboratories. Britain and Canada agreed to pay the cost of this project, but the United States had to supply the heavy water. At that time, the United States controlled, by a supply contract, the only major production site on the continent, that of the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company at Trail, British Columbia. Given that it was unlikely to have any impact on the war, Conant in particular was cool about the proposal, but heavy water reactors were of great interest. Groves was willing to support the effort and supply the heavy water required, but with certain restrictions. The Montreal Laboratory would have access to data from the research reactors at Argonne and the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge, but not from the production reactors at the Hanford Site; nor <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> given any information about plutonium. This arrangement was formally approved by the Combined Policy Committee meeting on 19 September 1944.

2500|$|Since the 1960s, those singers {{who wrote}} songs outside the Soviet {{establishment}} {{have been known}} as [...] "bards". The first songs traditionally referred to as bard songs {{are thought to be}} written in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and the very existence of the genre is traditionally originated from the amateur activities of the Soviet intelligentsia, namely mass backpacking movement and the students' song movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Many bards performed their songs in small groups of people using a Russian guitar, rarely if ever <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by other musicians or singers. Though, bards using piano or accordion are also known. Those who became popular held modest concerts. The first nationwide-famous bards (starting their career in the 1950s) are traditionally referred to as the First Five: Mikhail Ancharov, Alexander Gorodnitsky, Novella Matveyeva, Bulat Okudzhava, Yuri Vizbor. In the 1960s, they were joined by Vladimir Vysotsky, Victor Berkovsky, Yuliy Kim, and many others.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{agricultural}} work as being seasonal and transient, the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high. [...] Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. immigration status). [...] In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker. Crew leaders may also provide workers with H-2A visas and transportation to the place of work from a home country. Part of the H-2A visa, {{is that it does not}} provide an adequate choosing of their employment, how much <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> paid for their work, or even the hours, are not negotiable. Undocumented people who come without any visas, have a greater chance of choosing of where they wish to work and decide to leave the employment if they wish and have a better chance of not being exploited.|$|E
2500|$|King {{played a}} major {{diplomatic}} role as Minister to the Court of St. James from 1796 to 1803, and again from 1825 to 1826. Although he was a leading Federalist, Thomas Jefferson kept him in office until King asked to be relieved. Some prominent accomplishments that King had from his time as a national diplomat include a term of friendly relations with Britain and the United States (at least until it became hostile in 1805). With that in mind, {{he was able to}} successfully reach a compromise on the passing of the Jay Treaty being an avid supporter of it. King was outspoken against potential Irish immigration to the United States in wake of the Irish Rebellion of 1798. In a September 13, 1798 letter to the Duke of Portland, King said of potential Irish refugees, [...] "I certainly do not think they will be a desirable acquisition to any Nation, but in none <b>would</b> <b>they</b> <b>be</b> likely to prove more mischievous than in mine, where from the sameness of language and similarity of Laws and Institutions they have greater opportunities of propagating their principles than in any other Country." [...] Also, while in Britain, he was in close personal contact with South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda and facilitated Miranda's trip to the United States in search of support for his failed 1806 expedition to Venezuela.|$|E

[...] In August 423, Honorius died and power was seized in the west by John, who had held the office of Primicerius Notariorum. John appears to have ushered in a period of religious toleration. John seems to have attempted to curb the power of ecclesiastics and the privileges of the church in an attempt to treat all people equally. [...] In 423, Theodosius II published a law that demanded that Christians (whether they were really such or pretended to be so) were not to disturb Pagans who were living peaceably and doing nothing contrary to the law. [...] In 425, Theodosius II sent an expedition to the west to depose John and establish Valentinian III as emperor of the west. After John was captured and executed, Valentinian III was proclaimed emperor in the city of Rome. While in the west, Theodosius II enacted two anti-pagan laws in 425. The first of these stipulated that all pagan superstition was to be rooted out. [...] The second law barred pagans from pleading a case in court and also disqualified them from serving as soldiers.
