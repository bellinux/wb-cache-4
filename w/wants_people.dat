500|$|Jay Park's {{music is}} {{generally}} contemporary R and hip hop, {{but he also}} incorporates pop, dance, soul, electronic and acoustic into his songs. Prior to debuting with 2PM, Park was coached vocally by former SOLID member and renowned R artist Kim Jo-han, also known to be the vocal coach of many idols in the industry. Kim {{went on to say}} that [...] " [...] has an appealing and unique voice" [...] and [...] "definitely stood out amongst the rest". Park began to write rap lyrics since eighth grade. Since becoming a solo artist, he has complete creative control over his music : he writes and composes his own songs, produces his albums, chooses the people he wants to work with, and participates in the mastering and mixing of his songs, something almost unheard-of for a singer in the Korean music industry. More than making hit songs, Park says he <b>wants</b> <b>people</b> to hear to his style of music, to make them listen to [...] "Jay Park-sounding" [...] music. Being fluent in both English and Korean, Park writes songs in these two languages. He admits that he is more at ease when writing songs in English than in Korean, as he started learning Korean in his late teens. Having grown up listening to music of American artists, he admits his music sounds more [...] "American" [...] than K-Pop, saying it is the style of music he wants to make, while still being recognized as K-Pop. His musical process starts by listening to a lot of beats sent by various producers, while thinking of what kind of song he wants to write, and eventually short-listing a selection of potential beats to work with. Then, Park works on the melody of the song, along with ideas and lyrics. He writes the hook of the song first, and finally the verses. Park is inspired by everything when writing songs : [...] "just listening to good songs, seeing a good live performance, having good conversations with people. Just everyday life". Some songs Park wrote are influenced by songs from other artists, for example, his song [...] "Turn Off Your Phone" [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: Jeonhwagireur Kkeonwa) from his album New Breed was inspired by Leessang's hit single [...] "Turn Off the TV ..." [...] (Korean: Revised Romanization: TV Reurkkeotne) from their 7th album Asura Balbalta.|$|E

For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.
