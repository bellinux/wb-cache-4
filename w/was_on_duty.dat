5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. He told his operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E

5|$|Despite his age of 59 or 60 at the time, Brandon was {{permitted}} to serve with the Confederate States Army in 1861 as lieutenant colonel of the 21st Mississippi Infantry Regiment and went to Virginia. In July 1861, Brandon contracted a cold, prompting {{him to take a}} leave from active service until the end of August. His subordinates did not believe him fit for duty again and he did not receive an appointment to colonel. Brandon and his regiment were placed in the Confederate Army of the Potomac in Virginia. During the summer and fall of 1861, Brandon's unit <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> in the northeastern part of the state. During the Yorktown siege, his regiment, along with other Confederate army units, were spread out across eastern Virginia between Culpeper, Fredricksburg, and Norfolk, forming the Warwick Line. Brandon's regiment would again see action in the Battle of Williamsburg, fought the day after the action at Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|Glynn Stephen Lunney (born November 27, 1936) is {{a retired}} NASA engineer. An {{employee}} of NASA since its creation in 1958, Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs, and <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> during historic {{events such as the}} Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis. At the end of the Apollo program, he became manager of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union. Later, he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming {{a vice president of the}} United Space Alliance.|$|E
5|$|While Glenn <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> at Patuxent and in Washington, he read {{everything}} he could find about space. His office was asked to send a test pilot to Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to make runs on a spaceflight simulator, as part of research by the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) into re-entry vehicle shapes. The pilot would also {{be sent to the}} Naval Air Development Center in Johnsville, Pennsylvania, and would be subjected to high g-forces in a centrifuge for comparison with data collected in the simulator. His request for the position was granted, and he spent several days at Langley and a week in Johnsville for the testing. NASA asked military-service members to participate in planning the mockup of a spacecraft. Since he had participated in the research at Langley and Johnsville, he was sent to the McDonnell plant in St. Louis as a service adviser to NASA's spacecraft mockup board.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{the launch}} of Kiev's new patrol police on 4 July 2015, the militsiya ceased all patrolling but {{continued}} working at precincts and administrative offices. After that the new police patrol was rolled out across Ukraine. The organisation was formally established as the National Police on 2 September 2015. By late September 2015, 2,000 new constables <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> in Kiev, 800 <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> in Kharkiv and 1,700 <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> in the cities of Odesa and Lviv. At this point, the militsiya was 152,000 officers strong, and continued to handle most policing across Ukraine. The basic salary of the new police force (almost $400 a month) is about {{three times as much}} the basic salary of the former militsiya; an attempt to decrease corruption.|$|R
