5|$|Abra's initial role in {{the show}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Third World rights {{champion}} and humorous surgical , whose major storylines centered on serious rule breaking (including stealing returned anti-retroviral drugs to send to African countries in need, performing an experimental xenotransplantation without authorisation, and secretly using Holby City Hospital's theatres at night to perform charity operations on African children) {{as well as his}} relationship with colleague nurse Kyla Tyson. Upon returning to the show in April 2008, the character took a darker turn, resorting to self-harm as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, following a harrowing experience in the war torn Congo.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a physician {{in the nineteenth}} century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition {{as the result of}} experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contentious}} financial {{issue at}} the time was the protective tariff. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced. Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a crisis, {{a point in}} the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|By {{the rules}} of war of the period, the victor possessed {{absolute}} rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not. Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. Thucydides recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in Sicily were taken prisoner by Nicias and sold for 120 talents in the neighbouring village of Catania. Likewise in 348 BC the population of Olynthus was reduced to slavery, as <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Thebes in 335 BC by Alexander the Great and that of Mantineia by the Achaean League.|$|E
5|$|Casson's {{vision for}} Dorset House <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a 'community where every {{individual}} {{was encouraged to}} feel {{that she had a}} real object'.

She actively involved herself in the daily therapeutic activities, often inspired by her artistic childhood and build closer relationships between patients and staff, creating a community feel. At one point she even cast herself in Dorset House's drama production, playing Mr. William Collins in their 1934 rendition of Pride and Prejudice.|$|E

5|$|Cec Linder as Felix Leiter: Bond's CIA liaison in the United States. Linder was {{the only}} actor {{actually}} on location in Miami. Linder's interpretation of Leiter <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a somewhat older man than the way the character was played by Jack Lord in Dr. No; in reality, Linder was a year younger than Lord. According to screenwriter Richard Maibaum, Lord demanded co-star billing, a bigger role and more money to reprise the Felix Leiter role in Goldfinger that led the producers to recast the role. At the last minute, Cec Linder switched roles with Austin Willis who played cards with Goldfinger.|$|E

30|$|Another {{approach}} (used herein) is to {{take advantage}} of the clear disparity in zonal scales, between PSSR and upwelling, to extract the contributions to ‘PSSR.’ <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> if estimates <b>of</b> ‘PSSR’ are the same, when measured by ionosondes spaced in longitude, the estimate of ‘PSSR’ is likely to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> PSSR-only, and <b>that</b> an upwelling <b>was</b> not present.

5|$|Despite the {{disadvantages}} posed by his Alexandrian and Jewish origin, Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life.
