5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> the crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle {{was all that was}} needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|E
5|$|From May No.80 Wing units {{participated in}} the Australian-led Borneo Campaign. No.457 Squadron <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> No.81 Wing and {{deployed}} to Labuan on 18June {{as part of the}} Operation Oboe Six landings in the Brunei Bay region. The squadron provided air defence and flew close air support sorties alongside No.76 Squadron, and shot down a Japanese aircraft on 20June. In April No.452 Squadron <b>was</b> <b>attached</b> <b>to</b> No.78 Wing and took part in the landing at Tarakan in May. Delays in repairing Tarakan's airfield meant that it did not see any combat until 30June, however. The squadron subsequently supported the landing at Balikpapan in July, and one of its Spitfires shot down a Japanese aircraft {{in the early hours of}} 24July. During this period No.79 Squadron remained at Morotai and continued to fly ground attack sorties against Japanese positions on the nearby island of Halmahera. On 30July 1945 No. 80 Wing Headquarters was absorbed into the newly formed No.11 Group. While it was intended that the wing's three flying squadrons would come under the command of this group, in the event it only took operational control of No.79 Squadron before the war ended.|$|E
