Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a <b>water</b> <b>pumping</b> and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. A reconstruction has been made on which visitors can walk, on the same line as the original in Shapwick Heath National Nature Reserve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Presently, {{engine cooling}} pump {{is driven by}} toothed belt. Therefore, the pump speed is {{dependent}} on engine speed which varies their output. At normal engine operating conditions (Higher RPM and low load, Higher RPM and high load), mechanical <b>water</b> <b>pumps</b> in existing engines are inevitably oversized and so {{the use of an}} electric <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> together with state-of-the-art thermal management of the combustion engine has measurable advantages. Demand-driven cooling, particularly in the cold-start phase, saves fuel (approx 3 percent) and leads to a corresponding reduction in emissions. The lack of dependence on a mechanical drive also results in considerable flexibility in component packaging within the engine compartment. This paper describes the testing and comparison of existing mechanical <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> with that of the electric <b>water</b> <b>pump.</b> When the existing mechanical <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> is replaced with the new electric <b>water</b> <b>pump</b> the percentage gain in system efficiency is also discussed.
