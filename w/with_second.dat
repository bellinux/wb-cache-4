5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} a state that one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous <b>with</b> <b>second</b> blessing sanctification.|$|E

5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership <b>with</b> <b>second</b> cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in {{the top half of the}} table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points <b>with</b> <b>second</b> placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E

5|$|The team {{began the}} 1888season with {{part-time}} outfielder Dave Rowe as their player-manager. He {{was released from}} the team after beginning the season with a win–loss record of 14–36 though 50games. He was replaced <b>with</b> <b>second</b> baseman Sam Barkley, who did not improve the team's play, winning 22 of the next 58games. He was replaced with non-playing manager Bill Watkins, who finished the season. Although the Cowboys completed their initial season in last place out of the league's eight teams, there were notable player achievements; on June6, Henry Porter threw a no-hitter, and on June13, Barkley hit for the cycle.|$|E
5|$|A then-record {{crowd of}} 13,500 descended on Seedhill for {{the visit of}} Darlington on 4 April, but the top two teams in the {{division}} could not be separated as the game finished in a 1–1 draw. Nelson remained second in the table going into the Easter period, during which teams played four matches {{in the space of}} five days. The first of these games ended in a 2–1 defeat away at Crewe Alexandra, despite Newnes' first goal since September. John Stevenson then scored his second Nelson goal the following day in a 1–1 draw with Bradford Park Avenue. On 13 April, the team avenged their loss to Crewe with a comprehensive 7–0 victory at Seedhill, their biggest winning margin in the Football League. Joe Eddleston opened the scoring and went on to net his third hat-trick of the season, taking his tally of goals to 25, a total that would never be beaten during Nelson's time in the League. The other goals were added by Laycock, who scored twice, Chadwick and Cameron, who netted his last goal for Nelson. However, the team then took just three out of an available ten points {{at the end of the}} season, ending their hopes of returning to the Second Division. Following a 1–1 draw at Doncaster Rovers, Nelson suffered their first and only home defeat of the season, losing 4–2 to Wrexham. On 21 September the team achieved their final win of the campaign, beating Southport 2–1 thanks to two goals from Laycock. The 1924–25 season ended with consecutive away losses at Durham City and bottom-of-the-league Rotherham County, leaving Nelson <b>with</b> <b>second</b> in the Third Division North on 53 points, ahead of third-placed New Brighton on goal average.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} {{development and}} pre-production which took four months for scripting, the film started the first schedule {{in the forests}} of Chalakudy in Kerala with Karthi, Reemma Sen and Andrea during October 2007. The project developed a reputation for its gruelling shoots, a novel concept in Tamil films, {{at an early stage}} of production. Thirty-five days into the shoot, Selvaraghavan gave a statement that the film was forty percent over and the film should release by May 2008 whilst also mentioning that rains in Kerala led to the budget going over expectations two months into the project. In January 2008, the unit moved to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to shoot in the deserts in the region, however they were delayed again by unseasonal rains. Missing its original release date, the film's progress carried on through 2008, with shooting occurring {{towards the end of the}} year inside sets at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. In the studios, choreographer Shivshankar composed a classical dance for Reemma Sen and Parthiepan, and the sequence was shot over twenty days. Shooting carried on in sets for three more months <b>with</b> <b>second</b> half scenes being recorded. Shoots in all regions were tough and demanding for the crew as the film featured more than three thousand junior artistes from a variety of unions across India, with the language barrier becoming a problem. The project, eighteen months into shoot, soon began to face questions about its progress, with the producer, Ravindran, having to complain to the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look for his next film, Paiyaa, following the long period he had spent with Aayirathil Oruvan. In February 2009, filming was completed after 263 days of shooting; therefore the producers signaled for a summer release but it was postponed by six months.|$|E

5|$|For 2001, Pescarolo Sport {{replaced}} their C52s {{with the}} C60. Their first race with the C60 {{came at the}} 12 Hours of Sebring, with Jean-Christophe Boullion, Sébastien Bourdais and Laurent Rédon selected to drive the car; however, engine problems after 167 laps forced them to retire, and they were classified 25th overall, and seventh in class. At the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Catalunya, Boullion and Bourdais completed 57 laps before another engine problem forced them to retire. For the 2 Hours 45 Minutes of Donington Park, Boullion partnered Rédon to fourth place, the fastest of the non-Audi entries. However, oil pump issues struck at the 1000 km of Monza, forcing Boullion, Rédon and Bourdais to retire. Three C60s were entered in the 2001 24 Hours of Le Mans; Pescarolo ran Boullion, Bourdais and Rédon in one car, and Emmanuel Clérico, Cottaz and Boris Derichebourg in another, whilst SMG ran Gache alongside Jérôme Policand and Anthony Beltoise in their C60. Only the Boullion/Bourdais/Rédon C60 finished (in 13th overall, and 4th in the LMP900 category), as the other Pescarolo car crashed out after 42 laps, and SMG's C60 succombed to engine problems 9 laps later. Pescarolo Sport's next race with the C60 came at the 1000 km Estoril, where Boullion, Rédon and Derichebourg {{were able to take}} the car's first ever victory, although they had initially been disqualified for ignoring blue flags; Boullion and Rédon immediately followed this with another victory in their next race, which was the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Magny-Cours. Boullion and Derichebourg finished the season off <b>with</b> <b>second</b> at the 2 Hours 30 Minutes of Nürburgring. Courage finished the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) season classified in sixth, whilst they took fifth in the FIA Sportscar Championship, and third in the European Le Mans Series (ELMS).|$|E
