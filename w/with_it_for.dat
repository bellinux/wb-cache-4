5|$|Holden's early {{architectural}} {{training was}} in Bolton and Manchester {{where he worked}} for architects Everard W. Leeson and Jonathan Simpson before moving to London. After a short period with Arts and Crafts designer Charles Robert Ashbee, {{he went to work}} for Henry Percy Adams in 1899. He became Adams' partner in the firm in 1907 and remained <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the rest of his career.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and sticking broadly <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|His first {{exposure}} to musical training {{came in the}} form of piano lessons, which he later said in his instructional video A Work in Progress did not have much impact on him. He had a penchant for drumming on various objects around the house with a pair of chopsticks, so for his thirteenth birthday his parents bought him a pair of drum sticks, a practice drum and some lessons, with the promise that if he stuck <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a year they would buy him a kit.|$|E

5|$|Id had {{no clear}} {{expectations}} for Wolfensteins commercial reception, but hoped {{that it would}} make around US$60,000 in its first month; the first royalty check from Apogee was instead for US$100,000. PC Zone quoted a shareware distributor as saying Wolfenstein 3D was the top shareware seller of 1992. By the end of 1993, sales of the Apogee episodes of Wolfenstein 3D as well as Spear of Destiny had reached over 100,000 units each, with the Apogee game still selling strongly {{by the end of the}} year as its reach spread without newer retail titles to compete <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> shelf space. Over 20 percent of its sales were from outside of the US, despite the lack of any marketing or non-English description and despite the game being banned from sale in Germany due to its inclusion of Nazi symbols. The Apogee episodes' sales vastly exceeded the shareware game sales record set by the developer's earlier Commander Keen series and provided id with a much higher profit margin than the sales of its retail counterpart.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} television contracts, the merged NFL required language which obligated {{the networks}} to show games to completion {{in the road}} team's television market. Other major professional sports leagues in North America, the NCAA, and even the International Olympic Committee also shared the same rule in regards to their own respective TV contracts. On November 23, 1975, NBC planned to air the heavily promoted children's film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory at 7:00p.m. Eastern, right after a game between the Raiders and Washington Redskins. When the game went into overtime, NBC stayed <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> almost 45minutes and then joined the Wonka film in progress, prompting angry calls from parents.|$|E
5|$|In the 1998 {{feature film}} The X-Files, when Scully is {{infected}} with the black oil and taken to Antarctica, it is the Well-Manicured Man who, having grown disillusioned with the Syndicate, gives Mulder the coordinates needed to find her and {{a sample of the}} vaccine needed to cure Scully. The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those infected <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work more closely with the colonists in the hope of being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by car bomb before his duplicity was discovered.|$|E

5|$|The {{garden warbler}} (Sylvia borin) {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused {{with a number of}} other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song {{is similar to that of}} the blackcap, its closest relative, which competes <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> territory when nesting in the same woodland.|$|E

5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> some time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E
5|$|Tensions between Britain and the Russian Empire in the 1850s, as starkly {{demonstrated}} by the Crimean War, along with Australia-wide moves towards self-government caused a reassessment of the colony's defence posture. The various colonies regarded themselves as possible targets for the Russian Pacific Fleet, then based in Siberia. In 1854, Governor Henry Young appointed a commission under Boyle Travers Finniss {{to report on the}} defence of the colony, in case of war. Boyle's report recommended leaving strategic defence {{in the hands of the}} Imperial Navy, though South Australia was to purchase a 400-ton naval vessel. Local defence was to be largely handled by the existing small Imperial garrison and local colonial force, supported by the artillery obtained in 1847. When the Crimean War ended in 1856, the danger passed and the perceived need for expensive defence preparations <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>For</b> many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the shallows of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of martello towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than one human is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E
