At point B, we have a roller joint and hence we only have 1 reaction force in the y direction. Let us assume these forces to be in their respective positive directions (if they are not in the positive directions like we have assumed, then <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> a negative value for them).|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that this {{function}} only computes the path-cost, not the actual path. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> to the path soon. This, like the Fibonacci-numbers example, is horribly slow since it wastes time recomputing the same shortest paths over and over. However, we can compute it much faster in a bottom-up fashion if we store path-costs in a two-dimensional array q rather than using a function. This avoids recomputation; before computing the cost of a path, we check the array q to see if the path cost is already there.|$|E
25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> one of our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium production reactor, a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E

[...] BSkyB eventually won the vote by 14 to 6, with two abstentions. Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton, Leeds United, Liverpool and Manchester United voted {{in favour of}} ITV.

500|$|While {{struggling}} with his past regenerations, the Doctor's Ganger alludes to several previous Doctors' words. He misquotes the First Doctor's line [...] "one day we shall get back... yes, one day" [...] from An Unearthly Child as [...] "one day <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> back"; quotes the Third Doctor's catchphrase [...] "reverse the polarity of the neutron flow"; and speaks with {{the voices of}} the Fourth and Tenth Doctors (Tom Baker and David Tennant, respectively), the former expressing that Doctor's fondness for jelly babies. Growing frustrated by the humans' distrust of him, the Doctor asks both Amy and Cleaves' Gangers to refer to him as [...] "John Smith". This is an alias the Doctor has used on several occasions, beginning with The Wheel in Space (1968).|$|E
500|$|Previous {{same-sex}} storylines in {{the show}} had led to criticism from conservative groups. Bower has said that she expects this storyline to come under fire, saying [...] "I do believe homophobia is still alive and well, and I {{have no doubt that}} <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> complaints about it". Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chris's storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because it's a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways. It wasn't just Chris's story. I think it's interesting to see how [...] affected his friends and his relationships with them too".|$|E

In his diary for 9 May Stenhouse summarised Aurora's position: [...] "...fast in the pack and drifting God knows where [...] We are all in good health [...] we have good spirits and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> through." [...] He recognised {{that this was the}} end of any hope of wintering the ship in McMurdo Sound, and expressed concern for the men at Cape Evans: [...] "It is a dismal prospect for them [...] we have the remaining Burberrys, clothing etc for next year's sledging still on board." [...] During the next two days the winds reached a force that made it impossible for the men to work on deck, but on 12 May the weather had moderated sufficiently for a temporary wireless aerial to be rigged, and Hooke began trying to contact the men ashore. His Morse messages failed to reach Cape Evans. Although the transmitter's range was normally no more than , Hooke attempted to raise the radio station at Macquarie Island, more than [...] away, again without success.|$|E

2500|$|During 1918 and 1919 van 't Hoff's ideological stance {{hardened}} in {{the light}} of the recent Russian Revolution. His design work at this time moved away from private houses and consisted largely of unrealised designs for prefabricated mass housing in association with the Utrecht architect P. J. C. Klaarhamer. In 1919 he joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands and was active in arranging an exchange programme with artists in the Soviet Union, making his political stance clear in a letter to fellow communist Chris Beekman: [...] "I myself am convinced <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> a Soviet government, albeit that the transition will take a toll of some of our lives".|$|E

[...] Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a [...] "serious breach of morality and good sense," [...] and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.|$|E
