Severe weather conditions pose a large threat to the safety of aircraft, since they are responsible for a large percentage of aviation related accidents. With the advent of the free flight environment, the exigency for an autonomous severe weather avoidance capability has increased. In this thesis, an intelligent <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> is developed for general aviation aircraft. Using a radar image from an onboard weather radar, the intelligent <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> determines the safest path around severe weather with a minimum detour in distance. The method used is the Simplified Memory Bounded A* search technique that reduces computation time and memory requirements. The algorithm for A* search using the heuristic function is initially developed and evaluated in non-real-time form using Matlab, and demonstrated to be reliable and fast in flight path re-routing for stationary thunderstorms as well as moving thunderstorms. It is extended into a real-time version coded in Borland C++, and integrated with the existing Simplified Flight Management System and coupled with the heading command and hold autopilot of the nonlinear, non-real-time, six degrees-of-freedom Engineering Flight Simulator. Test cases consisting of stationary and moving thunderstorms are used to evaluate the intelligent <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> online, in real-time. Results demonstrate that the new path suggested by the algorithm developed in this thesis is about 1 % to 25 % longer than the original path depending upon the size of the thunderstorm that lies in the original path. The detours in the test cases ranged from about 1 mile to 11 miles over and above the original path length. The algorithm did not exhibit any critical failures in the test cases and proved to be robust. The intelligent <b>weather</b> <b>agent,</b> when integrated with the Simplified Flight Management System and coupled with the heading command and hold autopilot, provides an effective and reliable guidance and navigation system for generating safe, alternate flight paths around thunderstorms and squall lines. It also forms the basis for the severe <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> component of a broader hierarchical intelligent agent based system for free-flight guidance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{ascertain}} {{the impact of}} animal manure addition on aglime weathering in acid soil and to understand the contribution of carbonate weathering to the atmospheric/soil CO 2 in acid soil profile, two contrastive profiles (control profile and manurial profile) in the HuaXi district of Guiyang, China were established, and carbonate rock tablets were buried in different depths of soil profiles to determine the weathering rate of aglime. The results showed that soil CO 2 increased owing to animal manure addition, but the dissolution of carbonate rock tablets decelerated, which was attributed to the increase of pH in acidic soil after animal manure addition. The relationship between the dissolution rate of carbonate rock tablets and soil pH indicated that the weathering rate of aglime was controlled by pH rather than CO 2 in acid soil. Thus, the contribution of protons in acidic soil as a <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> to riverine alkalinity {{may lead to the}} overestimation of CO 2 consumption via chemical weathering at regional/global scale using hydrochemical methods...|$|E

Second, it constitutes a <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> on the glass surface. A number of in-situ x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) studies for Fe, Ni, Zr, Th and U show that the more charged cations (Zr, Nb, Mo, Ta, Sn, Th and U) are little affected {{by the presence of}} dissolved water in the melt. In contrast, divalent iron and nickel are highly sensitive to the presence of water, which enhance nucleation processes, for example, of phyllosilicates at the Å-scale.

By contrast, the weathering of glass surfaces by water can be studied from a durability perspective. Experimental weathering experiments of nuclear waste glasses performed in the laboratory show a variety of surface enrichments (carbon, chlorine, alkalis, iron) after exposure to atmospheric fluids and moisture.

40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} weathering of rocks with sulfuric acid {{is usually not}} considered in reconstructions of the past evolution of the carbon cycle, although this reaction delivers cations and alkalinity to the ocean without involvement of atmospheric CO 2. The contribution of sulfuric acid as a <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> is still poorly quantified; the identification of riverine sulfate sources is difficult. The use of δ 34 S and δ 18 O of dissolved sulfate allows us to demonstrate {{that most of the}} sulfate in surface waters of the Mackenzie River system, Canada, derives from pyrite oxidation (85 % ± 5 %) and not from sedimentary sulfate. The calculated flux of pyrite-derived sulfate is 0. 13 × 1012 mol/yr, corresponding to 20 %– 27 % of the estimated global budget. This result suggests that the modern global ocean delivery of sulfide-derived sulfate, and thus {{chemical weathering}} with sulfuric acid, may be significantly underestimated. A strong correlation between sulfide oxidation rates and mechanical erosion rates suggests that the exposure of fresh mineral surfaces is the rate-limiting factor of sulfide oxidation in the subbasins investigated. The chemical weathering budget of the Mackenzie River shows {{that more than half of}} the dissolved inorganic carbon discharged to the ocean is ancient sedimentary carbon from carbonate (62 %) and not atmospheric carbon (38 %). The subsequent carbonate precipitation in the ocean will thus release more CO 2 in the atmosphere-ocean system than that consumed by continental weathering, typically on glacial-interglacial time scales...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to test the {{assumption}} that cryogenic weathering (here understood as in-situ disintegration of rock under cold-climate conditions including ice as a <b>weathering</b> <b>agent)</b> preferentially breaks up quartz grains. We apply the results of laboratory tests to a Quaternary sediment record. The combination of silt production, relative quartz enrichment in the silt fraction, and quartz grain micro- morphology is traced in a multi- 100 -kyr lake sediment archive as indicator data for cryogenic weathering. Constant cryogenic weathering conditions are inferred for at least the last 220. 000 years from a lake sediment core of El’gygytgyn Crater, northeast Russia. This is the longest continuous terrestrial archive currently known for the continental Arctic. Quartz enrichment in the fines evolves from seasonal freeze–thaw weathering as demonstrated in laboratory testing where over 100 freeze and thaw cycles crack quartz grains preferentially over feldspar. Microscopic grain fea- tures demonstrate that freeze–thaw cycling probably disrupts quartz grains along mineral impurities such as bubble trails, gas–liquid inclusions, or mineralogical sub- grain boundaries. Single-grain micromorphology (e. g. angular outlines, sharp edges, microcracks, brittle surfaces) illustrates how quartz becomes fragmented due to cryogenic cracking of the grains. The single-grain features stemming from the weathering dynamics are preserved even after a grain is transported off site (i. e. in mobile slope material, in seasonal river run-off, into a lake basin) and may serve as first-order proxy data for permafrost conditions in Quaternary records...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{criteria for}} andosol classification in the World Reference Base (WRB) of Soil Resources were evaluated using the Tohoku University World Andosol Database (TUWAD). The WRB proposal defines a diagnostic andic horizon comprised of vitr-andic, alu-andic, and sil-andic subtypes, and eight second level soil units. Several notable refinements to the WRB criteria were apparent from evaluation of soil properties from TUWAD and are proposed as revised criteria. Our {{analysis indicated that}} the most effective criteria for differentiating the andic horizon were glass content, phosphate retention, oxalate extractable Al and Fe, pyrophosphate-extractable Al, and bulk density. The vitr-andic horizon is distinguished by its low degree of weathering, evident from its low oxalate extractable Al and Fe, low P retention, and high glass content. The ratio of pyrophosphate to oxalate extractable Al is used to separate andic horizons dominated by Al-humus, complexes (alu-andic, Al(p) /Al(o) greater or equal than 0. 5), from those dominated by allophanic materials (sil-andic, Al(p) /Al(o) < 0. 5). When Al(p) data are not availabe, the Si(o) value of 0. 6 {{could be used as}} an approximate criteria. We also propose revisions to the nine second level soil units based on the dominant pedogenic processes occurring in andosols : non-crystalline material formation and organic matter accumulation. These soil units are based on the degree of weathering (oxalate extractable Al, Fe, glass content), the dominant <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> (organic acids vs. carbonic acid), type (melanic or fulvic) and quantity of organic matter, and high 1. 5 MPa water-holding capacity.

30|$|Lichens grow as {{a visible}} {{film on the}} stone surface and due to their {{macroscopic}} structure, their presence on stones is visibly evident. Lichens represent the symbionts of fungi (mainly ascomycete) and algae (mainly green algae) or fungi and cyanobacteria (less common)[28]. Lichens are comparatively more resistant to extreme temperature and desiccation which allows them to flourish and grow in wide variety of habitats {{some of them may}} be hostile to other forms of lives[102, 103]. Lichens are among the pioneer organisms which inhabits the exposed stone surfaces. Their growth may be favored by the presence of organic nitrogen rich excretes of birds (crows and pigeons). They have significant contribution in biogeophysical and biogeochemical deterioration of the monumental stone. The CO 2 produced during respiration is transformed into carbonic acid (a potent <b>weathering</b> <b>agent)</b> inside the thallus[28]. With the help of their specialized devices like hyphae (crustose lichens) and rhizoids (foliose and fructicose lichens) lichens gain attachment and penetrates into the pores, cracks and fissures of the stones leading to structural and physical damage[26]. Their metabolic activities are often associated with the release of highly corrosive organic carboxylicx acids (like oxalic acid etc) and chelating compounds by which they form complexes with the mineral cations of the substratum[24, 78]. Nitrogen fixation by them is also known to improve the bioweathering potential[30]. Recently documented lichen acids, a group of polyphenolic compounds such as anthraquinones[24] having polar moiety that chelates metallic cations by donating electron pair cause chemical deterioration of the monumental stones through the process of bioweathering. After death, lichens leave behind a pitting corrosion with etch mark due to their metabolic activity and to the incorporation of mineral fragments into the thallus. The contraction-expansion of the lichens as a consequence of desiccation and rehydration results in peeling and detachment of superficial mineral layer[28]. Their presence was also suspected for the formation of oxalate layer on patinas[24, 28].|$|E
40|$|A 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope {{curve of}} the middle Eocene to Oligocene was {{produced}} from analysis of foraminifera in Ocean Drilling Program Hole 689 B, Maud Rise, near the coast of Antarctica. Sediments from the hole are well preserved with no evidence of diagenetic alteration. The sequence is nearly complete from 46. 3 to 24. 8 Ma, with an average sampling interval of 166 kyr. Excellent magnetostratigraphy in Hole 689 B allows calibration to the geomagnetic polarity time scale of Cande and Kent (1992). Marine strontium isotopic ratios were nearly stable from 46. 3 to 35. 5 Ma, averaging near 0. 70773, after which they began to increase. A slow increase began after 40. 4 Ma, rising {{at a rate of}} only about 8 * 10 **- 6 /m. y. from base values of 0. 707707. From 35. 5 Ma to 24. 8 Ma the average slope increased to 40 * 10 **- 6 /m. y. The slope remained constant at least until 24. 8 Ma, when the record becomes discontinuous owing to unconformities. We evaluate several possible controls on the marine strontium isotope curve that could have led to the observed growth in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios near the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Three mechanisms are considered, including the onset of Antarctic glaciation, increased mountain building in the Himalayan-Tibetan region, and decreased hydrothermal activity. None of the mechanisms alone seems to adequately explain the increased 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios during the Oligocene. Glaciation as a <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> was too episodic and probably began too late to explain the upturn in marine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. There is evidence that uplift in the Himalayan-Tibetan region began in the Miocene, much too late to control Oligocene strontium isotope ratios. Lastly, hydrothermal flux changes since the Eocene were apparently not great enough alone to account for the rise in marine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. We suggest that a combination of causes, such as decreased hydrothermal activity perhaps followed by increased glaciation and mountain building, might best explain the growth of the marine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr curve during the Oligocene...|$|E

Abstract In order to investigate the effect of glaciation on mineral weathering, the stream water chemistry and the bacterial community composition were analysed in two catchments containing nominally identical sedimentary formations but which differed in the extent of glaciation. The stream waters were analysed for major ions, δ 34 S, δ 18 OSO 4 and δ 18 OH 2 O and associated stream sediments were analysed by 16 S rRNA gene tagged sequencing. Sulphate comprised 72 – 86 % and 35 – 45 % of the summer anion budget (in meq) in the unglaciated and glaciated catchments respectively. This indicates that sulfuric acid generated from pyrite weathering is a significant <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> in both catchments. Based on the relative proportions of cations, sulphate and bicarbonate, the stream water chemistry of the unglaciated catchment {{was found to be}} consistent with a sulphide oxidation coupled to silicate dissolution weathering process whereas in the glaciated catchment both carbonates and silicates weathered via both sulfuric and carbonic acids. Stable isotope measurements of sulphate, together with inferences of metabolic processes catalysed by resident microbial communities, revealed that the pyrite oxidation reaction differed between the two catchments. No δ 34 S fractionation relative to pyrite was observed in the unglaciated catchment and this was interpreted to reflect pyrite oxidation under oxic conditions. In contrast, δ 34 S and δ 18 OSO 4 values were positively correlated in the glaciated catchment and were positively offset from pyrite. This was interpreted to reflect pyrite oxidation under anoxic conditions with loss of S intermediates. This study suggests that glaciation may alter stream water chemistry and the mechanism of pyrite oxidation through an interplay of biological, physical and chemical factors.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Luton in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Primary succession on the basaltic lava flows of Mt. Etna was studied usmg chronosequence theory to investigate the first 500 years of ecosystem development. Separate experiments were conducted {{to look at how}} plant species, nutrient availability and lichen activity on the lava changed over time under different conditions based on the site location (age, aspect and altitude on the volcano). By comparing the results of these different areas of study, close links were observed between soil development and nutrient availability. Lichens were found to be an important stage in primary succession introducing biomass to form a developing soil as well as weathering the lava surface. The plant species present on the lava were found to change as plants first colonised the lava and were then replaced as further species appeared over time. Nutrient availability was investigated in living plant material by measurement of the enzyme nitrate reductase and also in the developing soil. Two large inputs of nitrogen were observed in the chronosequences. An early input believed to be lichen derived and another steadily increasing input associated with the soil. The biomass of the nitrogen fixing lichen Stereocaulofl vesuvianum on the lava flows was found to change over time with a rapid increase over the first 100 years of the chronosequence followed by a slower decline as competition and shading from vascular plants covered available habitat. S. vesuvianum was also found to be an efficient <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> on the lava altering the surface morphology. This weathering was observed qualitatively by detailed visual examination of the lava surface by scanning electron microscopy. Weathering was also measured quantitatively using an intelligent machine vision computer system, to collate the surface changes of many images simultaneously and compare surface change to a baseline chronosequence, allowing discrimination of fine differences in the extent of weathering. Two of the experiments conducted on Mt. Etna (nitrate reductase activity and lichen weathering) were repeated on a second volcano, Mauna Loa (Hawaii). This tested if the trends observed on Etna were typical of primary succession on lava and the impact of a different climate regime (tropical) compared to Etna (temperate). Nitrate reductase activity was found to be very low in the primary colonising species studied on Hawaii indicating that nitrogen is limited on the early lava flows. Lichen weathering by Stereocaulon vulcani on Hawaii was found to occur in a comparable manner to S. vesuvianum on Etna, and was similarly controlled by the lichen biomass and associated climatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Chemical {{weathering}} is {{an integral}} part of the earth surface processes, whose spatial patterns and controlling factors on continental scale are still not fully understood. Highlands of the Asian continent have been shown having some of the highest observed rates of chemical weathering yet reported. However, the paucity of river gauge data in many of these terrains has limited determination of chemical weathering budget in a continental scale. A dataset of three large watersheds throughout northern Xinjiang in Central Asia is used to empirically identify chemical weathering regimes and interpret the underlying controlling factors. Detailed analysis of major ion ratios and a forward model of mass budget procedure are presented to distinguish the relative significances and contributions of silicate, carbonate weathering and evaporite dissolution. The analytical results show that carbonic acid is the most important <b>weathering</b> <b>agent</b> to the studied watersheds. Silicate weathering contributes, on average, similar to 17. 8 % (molar basis) of total cations on a basin wide scale with an order of Zhungarer > Erlqis > Yili, indicating that silicate weathering, however, does not seem to be intense in the study basins. Evaporite dissolution, carbonate weathering and precipitation input contribute 43. 6 %, 29. 7 % and 8. 9 % of the total dissolved cations on average for the whole catchment, respectively. The three main morphological and hydrological units are reflected in water chemistry. Rivers from the montane areas (recharge area) of the three watersheds are very dilute, dominated by carbonate and silicate weathering, whereas the rivers of piedmont areas as well as the rivers of the sedimentary platform (runoff area) are dominated by carbonate weathering, and rivers of desert plain in the central Zhungarer basin (discharge area) are dominated by evaporite dissolution and are SO 4 rich. This spatial pattern indicates that, beside lithology, runoff conditions have significant role on the regional chemical weathering regimes. Chemical weathering processes in the areas appear to be significantly climate controlled, displaying a tight correlation with runoff and aridity. Carbonate weathering are mostly influenced by runoff, which is higher in the mountainous part of the studied basins. The identification of chemical weathering regimes from our study confirmed the weathering potential and complexity of temperate watersheds in arid environment and that additional studies of these terrains are warranted. However, because the dominant weathering reactions in the sedimentary platform of northern Xinjiang are of carbonates and evaporites rather than silicate minerals, and the climatic factors have important role on the rock weathering regimes, we think that weathering at the arid temperate drainage system (Central Asia) is maybe not an important long-term sink for atmospheric CO 2, if the future climate has no great change.

[...] It was also recently evidenced that bacterial communities can impact mineral stability {{leading to the}} release of inorganic nutrients. [...] To date a large range of bacterial strains or communities from diverse genera have been reported to be able to colonize mineral surfaces and/or to weather minerals, and for some of them a plant growth promoting effect was demonstrated. [...] The demonstrated or hypothesised mechanisms used by bacteria to weather minerals include several oxidoreduction and dissolution reactions as well as the production of <b>weathering</b> <b>agents,</b> such as protons, organic acids and chelating molecules.|$|R

Conflict detection and resolution is a critical capability for the realization of free flight, a new concept of air traffic management that allows pilots to select their own flight paths and airspeeds in real time. A particularly demanding situation within this environment occurs when multiple traffic and weather conflicts arise simultaneously. A solution that forms the basis for this thesis is an agent based hierarchical system that attempts to provide optimal and conflict free flight path guidance in these multiple conflict situations. An intelligent executive guidance agent, acting as a high-level arbitrator, receives guidance information from a previously designed lower-level <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> and a traffic detection and collision avoidance agent. When the flight path guidance from the two-lower level agents conflicts, the executive agent arbitrates by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the conflicting guidance. It classifies them as either tactical or strategic in nature, and then prioritizes them according to a pre-defined rule base of conflict priorities. The arbitration function thus acts as a fuzzy controller, and gradually switches the guidance between the <b>weather</b> <b>agent</b> and traffic agent, providing conflict free flight path guidance, as the aircraft flies in and out of dangerous regions. Results of test cases presented in the thesis demonstrate that the approach and algorithm can successfully resolve combined weather and traffic conflicts in real-time, subject to realistic imposed constraints. The severity of conflicting flight paths was managed within acceptable levels, and the ultimate recommended conflict free flight path is generally between those originally proposed by the <b>weather</b> and traffic <b>agents.</b> The algorithm does not exhibit any critical failures during cases tested, and proved robust and reliable. The proposed agent based hierarchical system, when integrated with a simplified flight management system coupled with a heading command and hold autopilot, offers an effective and reliable guidance and navigation system for generating safe, alternate flight paths in conflict situations...|$|R
