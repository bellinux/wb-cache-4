Along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries,</b> China has also escalated its use of GM animals, resulting in an increase in overall animal use.|$|E

A small batch of 170 vehicles was supplied to Britain, which used them in armored car regiments. They were first used in the Tunisian Campaign with the Royal Dragoons. They were also used in Sicily, Italy, and later in France, but were gradually retired. The Free French Army also used M3s for training before receiving M10 tank destroyers.|$|E

5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, unless there were bilateral transit agreements negotiated <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E
5|$|Before 28 October 2011, the {{succession}} {{order in the}} American Commonwealth realms, {{as well as those}} American territories under the British crown, adhered to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, by which succession passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and subsequently to daughters, again in order of birth. However, {{with the possible exception of}} Canada, following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement, succession is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of gender. As these states share the person of their monarch <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries,</b> all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.|$|E
5|$|China's {{rail system}} had long {{linked to the}} Trans-Siberian via northeastern China and Mongolia. In 1990 China added a link between its rail system and the Trans-Siberian via Kazakhstan. China calls its {{uninterrupted}} rail link between {{the port city of}} Lianyungang and Kazakhstan the New Eurasian Land Bridge or Second Eurasian Continental Bridge. In addition to Kazakhstan, the railways connect <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> in Central Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. With the October 2013 completion of the rail link across the Bosphorus under the Marmaray project the New Eurasian Land Bridge now theoretically connects to Europe via Central and South Asia.|$|E

5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries,</b> public order or morality, and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations {{from other parts of the}} world for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially based on the {{principle}} of neutrality and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> in the region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} intended to include an online multi-player offering, but that was later canceled. Since the game was in early development stages at the time, no further details were released. On September 17, 2009, Konami released the full list of Xbox Live achievements for the Xbox 360 version of the game. The game was released in North America on October 6, 2009, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> and the Microsoft Windows platforms being released at later times in 2009. The Microsoft Windows version, which was released on October 22, 2009, was {{originally intended to}} be released exclusively through Valve's Steam digital distribution service; this was later corrected when Konami announced that Saw would also be available through another online distributor, Direct2Drive.|$|E
5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E

5|$|Increasing labour export {{from the}} Philippines {{coincided with the}} {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries,</b> Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers from the Philippines, {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Alexandre Banza (10 October 1932– 12 April 1969) was a {{military}} officer and politician in the Central African Republic. Born in Carnot, Ubangi-Shari, Banza served with the French Army during the First Indochina War before joining the Central African Republic armed forces. As commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in 1965, Banza helped Jean-Bédel Bokassa overthrow the government of President David Dacko. Bokassa rewarded Banza by appointing him as minister of state and minister of finance in the new government. Banza quickly established the new regime's reputation abroad and forged diplomatic relations <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> In 1967, Bokassa and his protégé had a major argument over the president's extravagances. In April 1968, Bokassa removed Banza as minister of finance. Recognizing Bokassa's attempts to undermine him, Banza {{made a number of}} remarks highly critical of the president's handling of the government. Bokassa responded by abolishing the minister of state position.|$|E
