5|$|After the 1972Summer Games, Brundage {{retired as}} IOC president. Accounts of Brundage's {{state of mind}} in his {{retirement}} differ. IOC director Berlioux stated that Brundage <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Château de Vidy and take telephone calls or look at correspondence, waiting for Lord Killanin to turn to him for help. According to Berlioux, Brundage sometimes called her from Geneva {{and asked her to}} go there. The two would spend hours wandering the streets, saying little. Brundage's longtime , Frederick Ruegsegger, described a different, tranquil, Brundage, whom he compared to an abdicated Japanese emperor.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area {{to indulge in}} the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant {{that by the time}} Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934, Germany {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Poland, which {{disrupted}} the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe. In March 1939, Hitler demanded {{the return of}} the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a strip of land that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aid of Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland and he expected this time they would be met by force.|$|E

5|$|The {{only known}} {{actor in the}} {{production}} for William Russell in an unknown role. A surviving film still appears to show Russell {{in the role of}} Jack at the climax of the film in which Bertie encounters the newly married couple. The other cast credits are unknown, but many Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. The scenario was written by Lloyd F. Lonergan and the character of Bertie may have been based on Edwin Thanhouser's role of Bertie Nizril from Thoroughbred. The play was a three-act comedy by Ralph Lumley and was first produced on February 13, 1895. The play <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Garrick Theatre in New York City on August 17, 1896 and Edwin Thanhouser took over the role on August 29, 1896. A series of Bertie films was projected, but only this work was produced. Two other announced works included Bertie's Bride and Bertie's Baby.|$|E
5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as {{there was a lot}} of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

25|$|The {{immigrant}} group {{most strongly}} identified {{with this group}} were Germans. At late as the early 1850s there were still very few, but more started coming {{as a consequence of}} the failed Revolutions of 1848. By the end of the Civil War the South End had many businesses and organizations catering to that population, most notably the 1857 German Evangelical Protestant Church at Alexander and Clinton streets, still a district landmark. Other immigrant groups <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South End, but the Germans remained concentrated there for a century.|$|E
25|$|Six months later, Brusilovsky {{returned}} to Kiev, {{which had been}} liberated from Germany.

25|$|Across {{the top of}} the {{trapping}} pit was a thick stick or pole, and on {{this was}} fastened a plank, which covered {{the top of the}} trap. On one end of this plank was a piece of venison, and on the other a stone. The way the trap was meant to work was this: The wolf <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> venison, and just as it got on the plank to eat it, the plank would turn, causing the wolf to fall into the pit. The weight of the stone at the other end would bring the plank up again, ready baited for another wolf.|$|E
25|$|Other stories {{say that}} Asclepius was killed because after {{bringing}} people {{back from the}} dead, Hades thought that no more dead spirits <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> underworld, so he asked his brother Zeus to stop him. This angered Apollo who in turn killed the Cyclopes who made the thunderbolts for Zeus. For this act, Zeus suspended Apollo from the night sky and commanded Apollo to serve Admetus, King of Thessaly for a year. Once the year had passed, Zeus brought Apollo back to Mount Olympus and revived the Cyclopes that made his thunderbolts. After Asclepius's death, Zeus placed his body among the stars as the constellation Ophiuchus ("the Serpent Holder").|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, the Ceylon Defence Force, the {{predecessor}} to the Ceylon Army, began demobilisation. After Independence, Ceylon entered the bi-lateral Anglo-Ceylonese Defence Agreement of 1947. This was followed by Army Act No. 17 of which was passed by Parliament on 11 April 1949, and formalised in Gazette Extraordinary No. 10028 of 10 October 1949. It marked {{the creation of the}} Ceylon Army, consisting of a regular and volunteer force, the latter being the successor of the disbanded Ceylon Defense Force. The Defence Agreement of 1947 provided assurance that British <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> aid of Ceylon in the event it was attacked by a foreign power and provided British military advisers to build the country's military. Brigadier James Sinclair, The Earl of Caithness, was appointed as general officer commanding Ceylon Army, as such becoming the first commander of the Ceylon Army.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days, the {{inhabitants}} {{on the island}} were mostly farmers and fishermen. The major population concentrated in the northeast portion of the island. Farmers grew rice, vegetables and pineapples, while fishermen lived in huts connected by plank walkways in the small harbour of Tsing Yi Tong which stretched far back into the island. Many fishermen also lived on their junks and boats all the time, fishing in the nearby waters. Even {{as late as the}} 1970s, Tsing Yi Tong resembled Tai O with its characteristic stilt houses and water vehicles. Like many other fishing villages in Hong Kong, the Tsing Yi dwellers worshipped Tin Hau, the goddess of mercy and the sea. A Tin Hau Temple was built on the shore of Tsing Yi Tong. At the birthday of Tin Hau, fishermen of all nearby waters <b>would</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Temple for celebrations.
