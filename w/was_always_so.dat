5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so.</b> There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E
25|$|He {{finally came}} to be {{respected}} {{as one of the}} most intelligent cyclists ever, but when he died in 1987 he was still to a large extent one of cycling's greatest enigmas. Raphaël Géminiani knew him better than anyone and he was such a perceptive man that his comments are particularly interesting. He said that Jacques w{{as one of the most}} gifted riders of all time but this was hardly reflected by his record. He had won eight major Tours without once crossing the top of a mountain in the lead. His lack of offensive spirit made Géminiani mad with rage on countless occasions but he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> incredibly stylish, absolute perfection.|$|E
500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, Tucker Smallwood {{recalled}} that the filming was an unpleasant experience. He entered {{production of the}} episode with little knowledge {{of the nature of}} The X-Files, and was surprised when he received the screenplay. During his first day on set, he asked other cast members if the series <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> violent. An unidentified crew member said, [...] "this is awful even for us", and commented that it was probably the most gruesome episode of the series run. During the sheriff's death scene Smallwood insisted on performing his own stunts, until he hit [...] his head attempting a dive. Another uncomfortable moment for the actor involved lying face down in a pool of fake blood for more than 90 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Reception to {{the episode}} was positive. The episode's {{overnight}} ratings was 7.73 million viewers, 46% {{of the audience}} share, a figure that was finalised to 8.64 million viewers. The Times stated that the episode was an [...] "unqualified triumph". The Guardian commented that [...] "Shearman's script bamboozles expectations", and the episode [...] "should hopefully show 2005's kids what <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> wonderful about the iconic tin-rotters.". The London Evening Standard found the lack of surprise (namely, calling the episode [...] "Dalek") the only disappointment, and Daily Mirror simply stated that [...] "for 30 pant-shittingly wonderful minutes, BBC1's new Doctor Who {{was the best thing}} on telly. Ever." [...] In 2010 Den of Geek placed the episode as number 2 in their list of the Top 10 Dalek stories.|$|E
500|$|On 17 March 1918, Minifie {{took off}} in his Camel on a sortie. During the flight, {{he was forced to}} crash land in German-held {{territory}} near Houthulst Forest, Belgium. The exact circumstances of why he was forced to land are unknown, but it came as a result of either being shot down during a duel with Jasta 47's Friedrich Ehmann or Minifie's machine suffering engine failure. He was subsequently captured by German forces at Roulers, and taken as a prisoner of war; he spent the remainder of the war at prison camps in Karlsruhe and Clausthal, Germany. Roderic Dallas later wrote to Minifie's mother, informing her that Richard had been taken as a prisoner of war. In the letter he described Minifie as [...] "a brilliant pilot and air fighter", and stated that [...] "his aerial victories were gained by clean, clever fighting and he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> modest about his great achievements". On 1 April, the Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Flying Corps were combined to form the Royal Air Force, with personnel from the former services transferring to the new branch; Minifie was promoted to captain the same day. He was released from captivity following the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, returning to the United Kingdom on 13 December 1918. Minifie returned to Australia in May 1919, and was placed on the Royal Air Force's unemployed list on 1 November.|$|E
2500|$|Offstage, Larry was {{a social}} butterfly. He liked {{a good time and}} {{surrounded}} himself with friends. He and his wife, Mabel, loved to party, and every Christmas served lavish midnight meals. Some of his friends called him a [...] "yes man" [...] since he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> agreeable, no matter what the circumstances.|$|E
60|$|THE YOUNGER MISS WETHERELL. Thank you, Bennet. [To her sister] One's feet <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> cold after {{a railway}} journey.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{holidays}} in small,' laughed Louisa. 'Good! No, I {{like your}} madness, {{if you call}} it such. You <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> serious.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You English <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> frivolous,” {{said the}} Princess. “In Russia {{we have too}} many {{troubles}} to permit of our being light-hearted.” ...|$|R
60|$|The {{sister of}} the philosopher sat up stiffly. What crudeness! It <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> with this strange young man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will {{remember}} about changing your flannels, Peter?' she said, lingering over him. She <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> particular about their flannels.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ruttledge. And Mr. Joyce, {{your old}} guardian. Thomas says he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> welcome in your father's time, he will think it so queer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> busy," [...] she answered. [...] "Perhaps it {{is because}} I am so lazy. I never do anything, <b>so</b> there <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> much to do." ...|$|R
60|$|Plain women <b>are</b> <b>always</b> {{jealous of}} their husbands; {{beautiful}} women never are! They never have time. They <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> occupied in being jealous of other people's husbands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed! It <b>'s</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> {{refreshing}} {{to me to}} see {{a little bit of the}} country, as it were, especially at this season." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Anna. [...] "Gwendolen <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> beautiful--people fell dreadfully in {{love with}} her. I thought it a pity, because it made them unhappy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was, but I did {{not think}} she would go away with him. It was not like her--she <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> good and biddable, and told me everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you have}} milk?' she asked calmly, yet nervously poising {{the little black}} jug with its big red dots. She <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> {{completely}} controlled, yet so bitterly nervous.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems {{strange to}} see {{monsieur}} alone here," [...] Louis remarked. [...] "In London, it <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> different. Monsieur {{has so many}} acquaintances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every hairdresser's is," [...] {{answered}} Morgiana, rather contemptuously; [...] "but what I can't bear is {{that their}} fingers <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> very fat and pudgy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> good! Have {{you seen}} Charles? I was in hopes {{he would have}} come," [...] Lady Marney added in a {{somewhat}} mournful tone.|$|R
60|$|I was dumfounded. I {{certainly}} had not understood ALL of Enriquez's slang; it <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> decidedly his own, and peculiar. Yet I {{could not recall}} any allusion to this.|$|E
60|$|Philip sat silent {{while they}} chattered away and thought {{how good it}} was to see people happy. Now and then Griffiths teased him a little, kindly, because he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> serious.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad they}} like it, Grace. But, believe me, {{it will be}} some job for Tom {{to settle down and}} be a staid married man! He <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> full of fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is goot {{luck for}} you, Tuncan, for if I wass your chudge I would be bound to condemn you--you <b>wass</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> fond o' tellin' lies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Ethel, 'I {{remember}} your mother rejoicing {{that she had}} not to send you from home, and saying you <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> kind and gentle to her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Gladys! you <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> original,' murmured the Duchess, {{trying to}} {{remember}} what a cheiromantist really was, and hoping {{it was not the}} same as a cheiropodist.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always liked}} to meet Myra," [...] said Miss Cornelia. [...] "She <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> gay and cheerful--she {{made you feel}} better just by her handshake. Myra always made the best of things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to say," [...] said Aunt Juley severely, [...] "a fair-bearded gentleman. And not a day older; she <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> pretty," [...] she added, {{with a sort of}} {{lingering}} apology.|$|E
6000|$|... "At the club, most likely. I never {{dine out}} on Wednesdays, if I can help it. We <b>are</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> busy. I shall have a quiet, {{comfortable}} evening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>so?</b> It will <b>be</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> much done," [...] said Fleda. [...] "Though I'm poor," [...] {{she added}} with a smile, [...] "I don't mind the shilling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it {{was even}} about the devil we came to speak with you," [...] said the Mayor; [...] "but the worthy {{minister}} <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>so</b> hot upon the sectaries"-- ...|$|R
