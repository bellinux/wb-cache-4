5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river {{as well as the}} houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge of the ship and its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated, Kertész left Keystone after Prince {{left the}} company in 1937. He was {{commissioned}} by Harper's Bazaar for {{an article on the}} Saks Fifth Avenue department store in their April 1937 issue. The magazine continued to use him in further issues, and he also took commissions from Town and Country to supplement his income. Vogue invited the photographer to work for the magazine, but he declined, believing it was not appropriate <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He chose to work for Life magazine, starting with a piece called The Tugboat. Despite orders, he photographed more than just tugboats, including works on the entire harbor and its activities. Life refused to publish the unauthorized photographs. Kertész resented the constraints on his curiosity.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Shaw {{refused to}} seek {{clerical}} employment in London. His mother {{allowed him to}} live free of charge in her house in South Kensington, but he nevertheless needed an income. He had abandoned a teenage ambition to become a painter, and had no thought yet of writing for a living, but Lee found a little <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> ghost-writing a musical column printed under Lee's name in a satirical weekly, The Hornet. Lee's relations with Bessie deteriorated after their move to London. Shaw maintained contact with Lee, who found him work as a rehearsal pianist and occasional singer.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra {{with a cold}} is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearances}} of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, {{and he continued}} by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper director for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France {{before coming to the}} United States. He ended up recalling a former director, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.|$|E

5|$|Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and lets him keep Shiloh.|$|E
5|$|Born into a {{blue collar}} Irish-American family in upstate New York, LeHand studied {{secretarial}} science in high school, took {{a series of}} clerical jobs, and eventually began {{to work for the}} Franklin Roosevelt vice presidential campaign in New York. Following the Democrats' defeat, FDR's wife Eleanor invited her to join the family at their home in Hyde Park, New York to clean up the campaign correspondence. FDR subsequently hired LeHand to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> on Wall Street, where he was the partner in a law firm and also worked for a bonding company. After FDR was partially paralyzed in August 1921, LeHand became his daily companion and one of the main people to encourage him to return to politics, along with Eleanor and his political strategist, Louis McHenry Howe. She remained his secretary when he became Governor of New York in 1929 and when he became president in 1933, serving until a 1941 stroke left her partially paralyzed and barely able to speak. She moved to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts and died after another stroke in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E

5|$|Wheeler {{was present}} during the 1947 Partition of India into the Dominion of Pakistan and the Union of India and the {{accompanying}} ethnic violence between Hindu and Muslim communities. He was unhappy with how these events had affected the Archaeological Survey, complaining {{that some of his}} finest students and staff were now citizens of Pakistan and no longer able to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He was based in New Delhi when the city was rocked by sectarian violence, and attempted to help many of his Muslim staff members escape from the Hindu-majority city unharmed. He further helped smuggle Muslim families out of the city hospital, where they had taken refuge from a violent Hindu mob. As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 {{he was one of the}} last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.|$|E
