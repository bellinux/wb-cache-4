50|$|Another {{specialized}} area of waterproofing is {{roof top}} decks and balconies. <b>Waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> have become quite sophisticated {{and are a}} very specialized area. Failed waterproof decks, polymer or tile, {{are one of the}} leading causes of water damage to building structures, and of personal injury when they fail. Where major problems occur in the construction industry is when improper products are used for the wrong application. While the term waterproof is used for many products, each of them has a very specific area of application, and when manufacturer specifications and installation procedures are not followed, the consequences can be severe. Another factor, is the impact of expansion and contraction on <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> for decks. Decks constantly move with changes in temperatures, putting stress on the <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems.</b> One of the leading causes of <b>waterproof</b> deck <b>system</b> failures is the movement of underlying substrates (plywood) that cause too much stress on the membranes resulting in a failure of the system. While {{beyond the scope of this}} reference document, waterproofing of decks and balconies is a complex of many complimentary elements. These include the waterproofing membrane used, adequate slope-drainage, proper flashing details, and proper construction materials.|$|R

40|$|The idea of {{waterproofing}} {{is presented}} here {{in terms of}} how it affects and influences sustainable construction, the environment, and human involvement through a study of liquid-applied <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems,</b> in addition to a case study where a waterproofing failure has occurred. Waterproofing is an important element in the manufacturing process of a sustainable system and also {{is one of the most}} common forms of failure in a structure. In Florida, where humidity and water intrusion is a constant factor impacting the built environment, <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> become key to the longevity and subsequent sustainability of a structure, and once that fails the building will become uninhabitable soon afterwards. By looking into the current trends of <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> in construction as well as doing laboratory testing, advantages and disadvantages between the latest synthetic rubber and polyester resin based products will be determined and also what sort of implications the product application has on the environment. This study delves into the volatility and toxicity of liquid-applied waterproofing. Without such technology, green roofs, for example, would never have come to fruition. This idea has been around for a couple of decades now and just recently has the technology actually been improved enough to sustain a green roof over a number of years. To illustrate the process, a case study documenting the restoration project, Kiley Gardens in Tampa Florida, is included in this report. At that particular site there was inadequate waterproofing installed roughly 25 years ago and subsequently caused numerous problems to the structure beneath. This case study shows the relationship between old techniques of applying waterproofing and the technology that is now being used to rectify the problems caused by the original inadequacies...|$|R

50|$|This {{installation}} {{method is}} by far the most labor-intensive. In addition, material cost is a function of the width of the grate used in the trench.There are three main reasons why this is labor-intensive: the outlet pipe position in the floor, the levelling of the trench grate in the floor, and integration of the waterproofing. If the outlet is not exactly in the centre, then the channel must be customized, increasing cost and time to construct.This can be overcome by the use of modular trench drain systems. These allow the drain pipe to be connected anywhere along the trench, giving the builder and plumber more freedom to place the services, reducing construction time and costs, particularly in high-rise situations where moving plumbing services can be nearly impossible. Achieving a curbless or hobless entrance for special needs access is more readily achieved with a modular system, as the levelling of the shower floor to the bathroom floor is inherently problematic with non-modular systems as they have no on-site adjustment.Waterproofing is possibly the most critical aspect of the bathroom when integrating a channel/trench drain. There are two ways to approach the waterproofing issue. First is to develop a proprietary method where the waterproofing and trench drain are a kit. Second is to separate the waterproofing and trench drain.The first method has the benefit of an 'all-in-one' solution, but the downside is cost and limitation of the system in varying applications, i.e. limited generally to bathroom application. The second method is generally safest as the waterproofing is completed using established proven methods that most building contractors are familiar with. A second benefit is when the waterproofing is a separate item all methods of waterproofing (cementeous, bitumized, fibreglassed, paint-on, sweat-on, lead-lined, copper pan etc.) can be utilized. This will allow a modular system to be used in many applications such as pools, balconies, thresholds, pedestrian areas, public areas, essentially most wet areas where a <b>waterproofing</b> <b>system</b> is required, be it on ground or above (suspended slab).Stainless steel trench drains can also be installed in a home's shower and in commercial locations like hospital rooms, changing rooms and operating rooms.|$|E

50|$|From {{the late}} 1990s to the 2010s, the {{construction}} industry has had technological advances in waterproofing materials, including integral <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> and more advanced membrane materials.

40|$|This {{research}} reports {{a study on}} waterproofing methods of roof top slabs in Sri Lanka. Waterproofing has become {{an essential component of}} a structure to protect its aesthetic appearance, prevent structural damages and {{for the safety of the}} occupants. Accordingly the type and the method of waterproofing required may vary with the location & exposure conditions. In the construction industry, many commercially available materials are used for waterproofing roof slabs. Under this research, field surveys were carried out to identify the types of waterproofing material, different methods of applications & quality controlling measures related to waterproofing. Furthermore, issues related to waterproofing were studied to identify common problems, which can be arrived in a functioning building. Then the rectifying methods and their performance related to such issues were also studied. A laboratory test series was performed on commercially available waterproofing materials to check their suitability. For this both liquid applied waterproofing materials and admixture type waterproofing materials were used. Three specimens were prepared using each waterproofing materials. They were checked for water absorption under laboratory condition for 24 hrs. Two types of water absorption tests were done to study the effectiveness of the selected waterproofing materials. Furthermore specimens with integral admixtures were tested under compressive strength test to identify any increase in their compressive strength due to crystalline formation. Finally from the experiment it is concluded that liquid applied <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems</b> perform better than the integral <b>waterproofing</b> <b>systems.</b> Among the used waterproofing materials, K 11 flex waterproofing coating showed better performance than the other materials.
