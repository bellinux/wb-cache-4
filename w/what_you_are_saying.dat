5|$|Shand: Think <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> One {{or other}} was a {{deliberate}} and wicked lie.|$|E
60|$|BRIDGET. I don't {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> [Looks out.] There is a {{crowd of}} people talking to your pupils.|$|E
6000|$|STRAMMFEST. You do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> This is pure Bolshevism. Are you, the {{daughter}} of a Panjandrum, a Bolshevist? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is he, indeed? I was {{thinking}} of something else just at that moment. <b>You</b> remember <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> about Miss Palliser last night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} got on very well, Bertie, with Mrs. Dias. I did not hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> but <b>you</b> seemed to <b>be</b> doing stunningly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Since I saw you yesterday,' said Sir Gregory, 'I {{have been}} {{thinking}} much of <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> to me of your wish to go into Parliament.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheated!" [...] thundered {{the great}} man. [...] "Be careful, young lady; mind <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I have a witness; Eustace, you hear, 'cheated'! Eustace, 'cheated'!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold blanched. [...] "Reggie, old man, {{you don't}} know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> You can't {{remember}} Percy. I wish you wouldn't say these things, even in fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do {{not know}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> Rima. You might as well say: 'Come, let us go to the sun and find out {{everything}} in it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I couldn’t hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> {{and then}} when you went outside and I asked <b>you</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> going home <b>you</b> said ’yes,’ didn’t you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Warned by a {{sign from}} Gardner, the others ignored him, and Harding remarked to the farmer, [...] "You hadn't {{finished}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> when he disturbed you." ...|$|R
6000|$|HE, with {{exemplary}} meekness: [...] "Only <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> before Grinnidge came in. You didn't whisper then. I {{had to wait}} {{there for}} him while" [...] - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how {{on earth}} can that be?" [...] his friend asked. [...] "Are you sure that you know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying?</b> Is your head quite clear, old friend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Cilla,' he said, {{in great}} agitation, 'let me know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> Don't drive me crazy {{when it is}} not in the nature of things you should mean it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear! You don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> You {{forget that}} this self-abandonment, and extravagant grief {{would be wrong}} in any one; and, if nothing else, the display is unbecoming in you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father, that <b>is</b> just <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> wanted, and I <b>am</b> sure <b>you</b> {{spent hours}} every day walking about with the children, or telling them stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{go back to}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> just now," [...] Tavernake remarked, [...] "I quite {{agree with}} you about Beatrice's living alone. I am very anxious for her to marry me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And as to <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> Fanny, as {{to having}} nothing to support the title, a foreign title in that way is not like one here at home. Here it must be supported." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As usual, Chebron, {{your tongue}} outruns your discretion. This youth understands enough Egyptian to know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> {{and it is}} not courteous to speak of a person's {{characteristics}} to his face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not true, Henry. You cannot mean <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I {{have always}} been the same. I am the same now. What could alter me? You don't believe that {{anything}} could alter me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Here her {{attention}} was suddenly arrested by Madonna, who was eagerly and even impatiently signing on her fingers: [...] "What {{are you saying}} to Patty? Oh! do let me know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> to Patty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is because}} I have heard <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> over the {{telephone}} that I am here," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to know to whom <b>you</b> <b>were</b> sending that message which you have intercepted outside." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] I went on, [...] "was {{it easy to}} make {{yourself}} over from <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> <b>say</b> in high school, to the man you must have become to {{do such a thing}} at the trial?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Was that <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> to the tree?" [...] {{asked the}} Egyptian, demurely. Then, perhaps {{thinking}} it wisest not to press this point, she continued irrelevantly, [...] "It seems such a pity that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a minister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe it. Why, {{you are a}} mere boy--you don't know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I'll {{close up}} this {{business}} to suit myself and leave my keys with Captain Marshall, and that will end it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} wrong, for {{you might see}} that Mr. Shipley has twice checked his horse that he might hear <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and Phemie is always showing Mrs. Ashwood {{something}} in the landscape behind us." ...|$|E
60|$|Cease, cease, my foolish babe, <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> is sorrowful to me--much it displeases me; Behold {{with the}} rest, again I say--behold not banners and pennants aloft; But the well-prepared {{pavements}} behold--and mark the solid-walled houses.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} you try to make my cousin angry; you that ought to have so much sense? Don't <b>you</b> {{remember}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> yourself the other day, of the absurdity of combatting pretences which the world sanctions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no. I {{mean you}} and Maud {{have been talking}} to each other for quite a long time, and she seemed very {{interested}} in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> I hoped <b>you</b> might have some good news for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, rising, [...] "you {{have put}} it quite out of my head; I've been so absorbed in <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> But may I ask just where in your {{treatment}} of the theme your irony ends?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{bring your}} man in {{whenever}} you want to," [...] Norgate invited, as he turned away. [...] "I can promise, at least, that I shall not understand <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> and that I won't sneak your designs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that {{is where}} you make another mistake,' she replied. 'You DON'T trust {{yourself}}. You don't fully believe yourself <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> You don't really want this conjunction, otherwise you wouldn't talk so much about it, you'd get it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Wharton," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "do not disgrace {{yourself}} by conduct such as that. Something has put you out, {{and you do}} not know <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> I can hardly imagine that you should wish to insult me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Constance dear, what harm {{can there}} be in expressing them?" [...] said Fan. [...] "They are not absurd fancies any more than <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> just now. I am quite sure that Mr. Northcott is very fond of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>been</b> {{thinking}} over <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> regarding {{information as}} to Mahmud's intentions. With your permission, I am ready to undertake to go into his camp, {{and to find out}} what the general opinion is as to his plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{they knew}} <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> {{they would lose}} all respect for you, Beric," [...] she said {{laughing}} and colouring. [...] "We have been married nearly a year, sir--a great deal too long for you to pay me compliments." ...|$|R
