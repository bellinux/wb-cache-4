40|$|Described {{as one of}} {{the finest}} {{collections}} of stock scenery in the country, and a rare survival from the 19 th century, the painted scenery from Normansfield Theatre is the focus of this paper. A team of conservators from the Textile Conservation Centre, in collaboration with paintings conservators, conserved a representative selection of painted flats, a backdrop and a false proscenium for display on the stage as well as stabilising and storing the other items in a bespoke system so that they are accessible to researchers. Normansfield Theatre was a small private Victorian theatre and entertainment hall built in the grounds of a former hospital for people with learning difficulties. The theatre was used by the staff and patients for both therapeutic and recreational purposes between 1879 and 1909. The stage is a miniature version of a typical Georgian theatre, with grooves for scenic flats and mechanisms for hanging backdrops, set within a Victorian proscenium arch. Unusually over 100 pieces of stock scenery, created by established scene painters and dating from the 1870 s, survived in its original setting. Although textile conservators are familiar with treating painted textiles, the Normansfield scenery with its large flexible canvases and <b>water</b> <b>soluble,</b> under-bound <b>paint</b> presented new conservation challenges. Research into the scenery’s materials and construction, collaboration with paintings conservators and the conservation treatment itself were able to shed more light on the scene painter’s art...|$|R

40|$|The {{solubility}} enhancement {{process of}} hydrophobic drugs {{plays a key}} role in the formulation development to achieve the bioavailability and therapeutic action of the drug at the target site. As estimated, among the newly discovered chemical entities nearly 40 % drugs are poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble.</b> To get proper therapeutic level of drug in plasma, a high dose of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs is required. The orally administered drugs show its complete pharmacological effect if it is fairly <b>soluble</b> in <b>water</b> in gastric medium and such drugs show good bioavailability. The enhancement of oral bioavailability of such poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs remains one of the most challenging aspects of drug development. Various methods are used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs in aqueous medium. In this present study, surfactant micellization method was used to enhance the solubility of poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> drugs viz. glibenclamide, clofibrate.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra revealed that marine F. vesiculosus had additional types of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic compounds compared with brackish F. vesiculosus. The results suggested that glycine betaine in the marine ecotype could be {{the reason for this}} ecotype differentiation. Furthermore, the qualitative differences between the ecotypes were the same after one week's treatment of marine algae in brackish water and of brackish algae in marine water. These suggest that the additional types of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic compounds in marine F. vesiculosus are not caused by the salinity conditions at the growth sites.

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{substitute}} toxic and ecologically harmful leaning agents in the e lectronic industry (like Pregan Universal 4 or Kiwoclean), which are dangerous for the environment, form a lot of CO 2 during the combustion and {{need a lot of}} energy for their production. Harmful solvents for the cleaning of screens and devices after screen-printing of electronic circuits can be substituted by water. In comparison to cleaning agents on organic base the application of water is more cost efficient and leads to more safety in use. Hence a development of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> paste systems is necessary. The new systems should have comparable properties to commercial available systems (not <b>water</b> <b>soluble).</b> Therefore different polymers and solvents for <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> and ecological burn out organic vehicles were tested.

40|$|A {{consecutive}} extraction {{method was}} developed which allows {{to determine the}} total amount of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> phosphorus in soil. For that, soil was shaken with deionized water, which was removed and replaced after one hour; this procedure was repeated ten times. The concentrations measured at each extraction step allow to quantify desorption of total <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> phosphorus. Seven soils of the Ultuna long term soil organic matter experiment, Sweden, were used to test the method. Two additional soils from a horse paddock were used for method development. Soils treated with farmyard manure and sewage sludge showed the highest release of total <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> phosphorus, whereas calcium nitrate and ammonium sulfate showed the lowest. Fallow, green manure and peat treatments showed intermediate release. The amount of total <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> phosphorus was controlled by pH, total P and P-AL. The increase in potentially releasable <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P is about 20 per cent of total P but 55 per cent of P-AL in average among all soils tested. Data were compared with an earlier phosphorus fractionation of four of the soils used showing that all resin P and part of sodium bicarbonate P was released by consecutive extraction with water. The relative decline in consecutive P release was inversely related to the P quantity/intensity ratio. The estimation of total <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> phosphorus obtained by the method showed that the actual availability of P in soil to plants seems not to be limited by chemical binding and release of P to the soil solution, but by the ability of plants to obtain P from the soil solution...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the effect of wheat residue char (biochar) addition on <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P concentration in a wide range of biochar amended soils. Eleven agricultural fields representing dominant soil texture classes of Swedish agricultural lands were chosen. Concentrations of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P in the soils and in biochar were measured prior to biochar incorporation to soils in the laboratory. Experiments with three dominant soil textures- silt loam, clay loam and an intermediate loam soil with different rates of biochar addition (i. e., 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 %; w/w) showed that the highest concentration of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P was achieved at an application rate of 1 %. At higher application rates, P concentrations decreased which coincided with a pH increase of 0. 3 - 0. 7 units. When the eleven soils were amended with 1 % (w/w) biochar, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P concentrations increased in most of the soils ranging from 11 to 253 %. However, much of the <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> P added through the biochar was retained (33 - 100 %).

In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes. Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> matter, <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> inorganic matter and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins.
