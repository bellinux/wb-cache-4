25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one stop light, and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillar.</b> The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
50|$|The LaFerrari Aperta is {{a limited}} version (209 units) of the LaFerrari. 200 cars will be sold, the {{additional}} nine Ferrari LaFerrari are reserved for selected distribution during the 70th anniversary celebrations of Ferrari. The LaFerrari Aperta comes with a removable carbon-fibre hard top and a removable soft top. Other changes include more efficient powertrain's control electronics, re-angled radiators to direct air flow out along the underbody rather than over the bonnet, a longer front air dam to help boost downforce, L-shaped flap on the upper corner of each <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillar</b> to reduce compression on {{the rear of the}} cabin {{in the absence of a}} roof, different butterfly door angle with different wheel arches and a new carbon fibre insert allowing the doors to rotate.|$|E
50|$|Among the new {{features}} was the E181 7.4-litre engine, {{which was a}} development of a pre-war 6.2-litre unit used in some TS8 Tigers and the sole LS1 prototype. The revised bore dimensions came from the version used in later models of the Matilda tank. It was a six-cylinder pushrod OHV unit, which developed 100 bhp at 1.800 rpm and 328 lb ft of torque at 1,150 rpm. These were slightly better figures than the larger pre-war design 8.6-litre OHC engine, but fuel economy was also superior, {{although it was a}} much harsher-sounding engine. The TD7's flexible engine mounting was not 100% successful and so the PD1 reverted to a rigid engine mounting. The gearbox was a four-speed and reverse constant-mesh unit, with helical gear trains for second and third gear. Brakes, as standard, were triple-servo vacuum. A new, larger, radiator was fitted and its filler-cap was offset to the nearside to allow the driver's cab to be wider, the nearside <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillar</b> running down the vehicle centre-line.|$|E
50|$|As {{the era of}} {{building}} cars on separate chassis was ending, {{and with it the}} market for complete bodies, Hooper completed the transition from wood-framed bodywork to bodies built over a skeleton of cast or extruded aluminium. Cast alloy was first used about 1933 in door and <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars</b> where the 'fight' between roof and scuttle structures tended to cause cracking.|$|R
5000|$|As {{the most}} costly body {{components}} to develop or re-tool, a vehicle's roof and door design {{are a major}} factor in meeting safety and crash standards. Some designs employ slimmer, chamfered <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars,</b> A pillars, to help improve driver vision (thus reducing blind spots) through the use of stronger alloy steel in these components. As [...] "perhaps the most complex of all the structures on the vehicle", the center or B-pillar may be a multi-layered assembly of various lengths and strengths.|$|R
5000|$|The upright part of {{the frame}} around a <b>windscreen</b> (the A <b>pillar).</b>|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "Torpedo" [...] bodied 508 {{was added}} to the range in 1933, with four seats and four doors, and in 1933 still with the 3-speed [...] "crash" [...] gear-box. It was offered only with the [...] "Lusso" [...] ("de Luxe") trimmings. As on the [...] "Spider", seat covers and {{interior}} trimmings used coloured leather. The <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars</b> and door hinges were chrome plated, and the removable fabric hood could be stored in a suitably shaped storage bag provided for the purpose. The upgrade to a four speed transmission in 1934 was not accompanied by any aesthetic changes to the [...] "Torpedo" [...] bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Standing 1138 mm high, {{perhaps the}} most {{distinctive}} details were the brushed stainless steel roof and <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars.</b> Inside, the bucket seats, dash, door trim, centre console and rear bulkhead were trimmed in leather, electric windows having been standard, most cars also getting air conditioners. The steering column was manually adjustable for rake and reach, whereas the LHM aux. circuit controls adjusted the driver's seat vertically, the pedal box of the brake, clutch and throttle pedals horizontally forwards and backwards by around three inches (76 mm)--a first such application {{in the world for}} a production car, and also to raise and lower the concealed headlights in the front fenders.|$|R
50|$|Rootes made {{subtle changes}} to the car's body which {{individually}} were insignificant but when combined, considerably altered its appearance. For example, the number of horizontal bars {{in each of the}} side grilles was increased from three to four and the boot lid acquired an oblong number plate recess and surround in place of the square one of the earlier cars. The most striking change was the redesigned side flash, now narrower and lower {{down the side of the}} car with the Rapier script on its rear end. The most subtle change, however, was a reduction in thickness of the <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars</b> and a lowering of the scuttle line to give a 20% increase in windscreen area.|$|R
50|$|The series II {{came with}} a new longer and lower body with all {{passengers}} seated within the wheelbase, narrow <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars</b> and wide <b>windscreen.</b> Special construction {{of the body and}} frame bolted together was designed to produce a strong double box section. New built in luggage accommodation {{at the rear of the}} body was accessible by lifting the rear seat's hinged backrest, the previous Twelve had no covered luggage space. An external folding luggage grid was continued from the last car to cope with any extra luggage. The, new to the Twelve, Special coupé continued to have its special inbuilt luggage container. New instrumentation for the driver included an enlarged speedometer. Direction indicators were now concealed within the body and controlled from the steering wheel and given a driver's warning light in the centre of the wheel. The pedals were now mounted directly to the frame (chassis) and free from vibration.|$|R
50|$|The cab {{produced}} at Umeå from hot dip galvanized, {{high tensile steel}} allowed for greater strength at thinner panels and box sections while reducing overall weight. The new FH cab was a logical progression from, for its days spacious but boxy F series cab to more aerodynamically efficient, with much improved ergonomics and much better seating unit while reducing overall weight of the cab by almost 30%. The cabin was extensively tested in a wind tunnel to confirm shape aerodynamics properties to reduce air-drag thus improving fuel efficiency. The cab featured more sharply raked windscreen while wedge shaped sides rounded into front panel at much wider radius corners and the rear vision mirrors were also streamlined. The cabin was subject to the toughest cab impact test where procedure involved placing a 15 tonne static weight {{on the roof and}} one tonne pendulum striking at the cab rear wall and at the <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars,</b> {{at the end of which}} the cab doors must be able to be opened. In 1995 Volvo FH series became first heavy duty truck to be fitted with a SRS airbag to further improve passive safety.|$|R
50|$|The Typ 2K shares 50% of its modules {{with the}} Volkswagen Golf Mk5 and Volkswagen Touran. The new model Caddy {{has a more}} {{aerodynamic}} design, {{the angle of the}} <b>windscreen</b> and A <b>pillar</b> is more horizontal, making the dashboard bigger and the bonnet (hood) smaller.|$|R
50|$|The Statesman had {{a number}} of changes to the {{bodywork}} to set it aside from the Commodore. It was based on the longer station wagon wheelbase which made the car physically larger than the Commodore sedan and improved rear legroom. It was also fitted with a modified C-pillar which was covered in glass, giving the appearance of a wrap-around rear <b>windscreen.</b> The <b>pillars</b> were reinforced not only to provide improved strength, but also to give a more solid 'thunk' sound when closing the doors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Victor, {{launched on}} 28 February 1957, was coded the F series {{and saw a}} production run of more than 390,000 units. The car was of unitary construction and featured a large glass area with heavily curved windscreen and rear window. Following then current American styling trends, the <b>windscreen</b> <b>pillars</b> sloped backwards. In fact, the body style was derived directly from the classic 57 Chevrolet Bel Air, though this was not obvious unless the two cars were viewed side by side. Bench seats were fitted front and rear trimmed in Rayon and [...] "Elastofab", and two-colour interior trim was standard. The Super model had extra chrome trim, notably around the windows; remnants of the signature Vauxhall bonnet flutes ran along the front flanks and the exhaust pipe exited through the rear bumper. The car was equipped with arm rests on the doors, door-operated courtesy lights, a two-spoke steering wheel, and twin sun visors. An estate variant was launched in 1958. When re-styled, as the Series 2, the car lost all its '57 Chevy styling detail and the teardrop shaped Vauxhall flutes were replaced by a single chrome side-stripe running nose to tail. The sculpted [...] "porthole" [...] rear bumper tips, which rusted badly due to exhaust residue, were replaced by plain, straight ones. The old bumper ends continued {{to be used for}} many years on a variety of motor coaches and ice-cream vans.Although the engine was of similar size to that of the outgoing Wyvern it was in critical respects new. Fitted with a single Zenith carburettor it had an output of [...] at 4200 rpm and gained a reputation of giving a long trouble free life. This was also the year when Vauxhall standardized on [...] "premium" [...] grade petrol/gasoline, permitting an increase in the compression ratio from the Wyvern's 6.8:1 to 7.8:1. Premium grade petrol had become available in the UK at the end of 1953, following an end to post-war fuel rationing, and at that time offered average octane level of 93, but in the ensuing four years this had crept up to 95 (RON).|$|R
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} Citroën C3 Picasso in reviews for its ergonomics, Bauhaus-inspired styling, {{ease of use}} {{and the amount of}} space offered. Many reviewers criticised the interior, which they said [...] felt [...] "cheap". The quality and {{reliability}} of the petrol engines was also criticised by most reviewers as [...] "sluggish" [...] and struggling to carry the weight of the vehicle, although the diesel engines feedback was more positive as they are able to cope much better and run smoother. Reviewers' comments about the tight turning radius of the vehicle were favourable. The combination of the panoramic three-part <b>windscreen,</b> thin door <b>pillars</b> and high seats, which together increase the visibility of the roadled one reviewer to compare it with a greenhouse.|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, a coupé {{is often}} {{distinguished}} from a two-door saloon (US sedan) {{by the lack}} of a B pillar to support the roof. Saloon cars have an A pillar forward at the <b>windscreen,</b> a B <b>pillar</b> aft of the door, and a C pillar defining the aftermost roof support at the rear window. Thus with all side-windows down, a coupé would appear windowless from the A to the C pillars. These fixed-roof models are described as a hardtop or pillarless coupé. Though, to confuse things even further, there are many hardtop/pillarless two- and four-door saloons. Targa top, or just 'T'-top models are a variation on the convertible design, where the roof center section can be removed, in one or two sections, leaving the rest of the roof in place. Yet another variation on the convertible or drop-head coupé is the fully retractable hardtop. In this form the car has all the advantages of fixed-head vehicle but, {{at the touch of a}} button, the entire roof lifts off, folds and stows away in the trunk (boot). Though retractables were tried many years ago by Peugeot, in Europe and Ford, in the US, with the Fairlaine Skyliner, it is only in the 21st century that there has been an explosion in the popularity of this bodystyle.|$|R
