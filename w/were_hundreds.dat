5|$|One of {{the effects}} of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the {{introduction}} of stone and brick fortifications. Although there <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a standard plan in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.|$|E

5|$|The oligarch {{theory of}} planet {{formation}} states that there <b>were</b> <b>hundreds</b> of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, {{in the early}} stages of the Solar System's evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between 1,000 and 10,000AU from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.|$|E
