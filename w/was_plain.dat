5|$|From {{the time}} the GPK was authorised, {{controversy}} raged about the route a railway to England might take. It <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> that Carlisle would be reached from the south; a direct route from Glasgow over the Southern Uplands, the route that {{became known as the}} Annandale line, would involve severe gradients, and pass through almost unpopulated territory. The locomotives available at the time were not thought to be capable of climbing the steep inclines, and rope haulage was put forward by some as the solution. By contrast, a route from Kilmarnock through Cumnock and Dumfries—the Nithsdale line—would have much easier gradients and pass through considerable population centres, bringing in additional traffic. Moreover, the Nithsdale route would be much cheaper to build.|$|E
5|$|In August 1919, the Sejm (lower {{house of}} parliament) of the renascent Republic of Poland adopted a law {{defining}} the Banner of the Republic of Poland (chorągiew Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej). The banner {{was part of}} the insignia of the head of statethe State Leader (Naczelnik Państwa) and, later, President of the Republic. It <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> red emblazoned with the crowned White Eagle and bordered with a wężyk generalski, a wavy line used in the Polish military as a symbol of general's rank. It was modified on December 27, 1927 to reflect the adoption of a new official rendering of the national coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The west front has two {{flights of}} broad, balustraded steps {{leading up to}} the central door. Inside is a full-height hall with a part-hipped valley roof. On either side of this are {{octagonal}} turrets with cupolas and delicately pierced parapets. To the left of the hall is the former medieval kitchen with a balustraded parapet and buttresses. To the right is a range of parapetted rooms with a stepped buttress at the corner. The south front <b>was</b> <b>plain,</b> being the inside north wall of the original abbey church which was pulled down, but was rebuilt by William Talbot in 1828 to include bay windows. At this end of the building is Sharington's tower, an octagonal, three-storey tower, topped with a belvedere, balustrade and stair turret.|$|E

5|$|Tom Pryce's helmet design was, in {{comparison}} to later drivers', simple and restrained. His helmet <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> white all over until 1970. At that year's race at Castle Combe, his father asked Pryce to make his helmet stand out more {{so that he could}} easily identify him in a pack of cars. Pryce added five black vertical lines to his helmet, placed just above his visor. From that time the only change to this design was the addition of a Welsh flag to the side of his helmet in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, but it {{certainly}} has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms consists of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} buildings {{took some}} time to finish; only the original gateway was lavished upon from the beginning. The buildings were only of a modest splendour: the hall was not completed {{until the end of}} the seventeenth century; the rooms economically decorated without wood panelling; the main quadrangle only of one storey and garrets. Although an earlier chapel is suspected, the area above Staircase I– now the Senior Common Room– was in use by 1521. It appears that the ecclesiastical furnishings promised by Smyth never arrived, and have been presumed taken by the College's first Visitor, Cardinal Wolsey. Although the chapel (or perhaps oratory) <b>was</b> <b>plain,</b> two chalices and two patens survived from the original three of each and have been identified as older than those of Corpus or Trinity, dating to the late fifteenth century. Similarly the Old Library, now staircase IV, room 4, was completed in 1520–1, was not intended to be permanent but kept a considerable collection of books, most attained from benefactors, of which the most valuable were those donated by Henry Mason during the reign of James I. The library remained in that location until 1663.|$|E

25|$|The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway was {{incorporated}} in 1897 {{and transferred to}} the Caledonian in 1902; it was to link Paisley and Barrhead and enable a circular service from Glasgow. The line was substantially ready in 1902 but by now street tramways were electrically operated and eminently successful. It <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> that a passenger service would not be viable against tram competition and the intended passenger service was never started.|$|E
25|$|The bakery of the Order {{was located}} on a city block bordered by Old Bakery, Melita, St. John and Strait Streets. Its main façade was in Old Bakery Street facing the Church of St. Augustine, and it {{consisted}} of a central bay with two sloped roofs, with three-storey high sections on either side. The façade contained the two main doorways, {{but there were other}} entrances in Strait Street. The exterior <b>was</b> <b>plain,</b> contrasting with other Valletta buildings, however this was typical when built. Though the exterior may not have had any aesthetically pleasing features, the interior was spacious and adequate for its purpose.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom's Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal {{was instituted}} by King William IV in 1830. The {{original}} medal had the Royal Coat of Arms with the badge of Hanover on the obverse, {{while on the}} Queen Victoria version, introduced upon her succession to the throne in 1837, the Hanover emblem {{was replaced by a}} Trophy of Arms which incorporated a central shield bearing the Royal Coat of Arms. Upon the succession of King Edward VII to the throne in 1901, his effigy was placed on the medal's obverse. The medal's ribbon <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> crimson from 1830 until 1917, when white bands were added to the edges.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{has been described}} by EastEnders author, Rupert Smith, as an “eternal victim” – a female character who endures much misfortune and misery, but lacks the “pluck” of her “feistier sisters”. Early on in her narrative, Natalie was shown to be an insecure and lonely individual– a “gloomy kid” from a broken family with an uncaring, criticising and resentful mother, Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan). The character was often seen to be “shunted aside by stronger personalities”, such as her best friend Bianca – who was shown to bully and torment Natalie, telling her “that she <b>was</b> <b>plain</b> and wouldn't attract boys”, although in later years Natalie was shown to stand up to Bianca’s bullying.|$|E
