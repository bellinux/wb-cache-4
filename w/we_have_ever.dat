500|$|Only the {{flagship}} New York managed to match British practice in both categories. In Admiral Beatty's words, {{the results were}} [...] "distinctly poor and disappointing", and {{led him to the}} initial conclusion that he could not consider the American division the equivalent of a British one. The Americans worked to catch up, however, and with every target practice registered improved results. By the end of June 1918, Admiral Rodman was able to report that [...] "the firing was exceptionally fine, most encouraging and much better than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> done previously".|$|E

We sent producer Jeremy Isaacs {{the small amount of}} work <b>we</b> <b>had,</b> which was basically Down and Out and some kids' stuff. And he called us up to the London office...and said 'I've seen that film Down and Out. We'd like ten of those for our first week's transmission.'" [...] These were the 5 shorts of Conversation Pieces, and later the five short of the Lip Synch series.|$|R
500|$|Promising Television Mail that AP Films' latest venture {{would be}} [...] "bigger {{and better than}} {{anything}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> done before", Gerry Anderson realised that design defects {{would not be as}} quickly forgiven in a film adaptation as on the smaller screen. Puppets from the Thunderbirds television series were therefore expertly revamped, with new paint, wigs and costumes, while models and sets such as the Thunderbird machines were re-built from scratch with greater attention to detail. During production, the AP Films puppet wardrobe had a stock of over 700 costumes, with 150 extra costumes made mainly as spares in case of damage or loss.|$|E
500|$|The British press {{hailed the}} hunger strike as a triumph for Thatcher, with The Guardian {{newspaper}} stating [...] "The Government had overcome the hunger strikes by {{a show of}} resolute determination not to be bullied". At the time most thought the hunger strike a crushing defeat for the republicans, a view shared by many within the IRA and Sinn Féin, but Sands' by-election win was a propaganda victory, and the hunger strike became a Pyrrhic victory for Thatcher and the British government. Thatcher became a republican hate figure of Cromwellian proportions, with Danny Morrison describing her as [...] "the biggest bastard <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known".|$|E

Forming from a tropical wave over the Atlantic Ocean, Georges attained a peak intensity of 155mph (250km/h) on September20, 1998. Over the following several days, the storm tracked through the Greater Antilles and later entered the Gulf of Mexico on September28, the Category 2 storm made landfall in Mississippi before dissipating on October1. Before landfall, about 500,000 residents in Louisiana evacuated from low-lying areas. The mayor of New Orleans {{declared a state}} of emergency to allow federal assistance into the state. After nearly 1.5 million people were urged to evacuate coastal areas, officials described the evacuation as [...] "probably the largest [...] <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> achieved".|$|E

500|$|The play widely {{regarded}} as Synge's masterpiece, The Playboy of the Western World, was first performed at the Abbey Theatre on 26 January 1907. A comedy about apparent patricide, it attracted a hostile reaction from sections of the Irish public. The Freeman's Journal described it as [...] "an unmitigated, protracted libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood". Arthur Griffith, who believed that the Abbey Theatre was insufficiently politically committed, described the play as [...] "a vile and inhuman story told in the foulest language <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> listened to from a public platform", and perceived a slight on the virtue of Irish womanhood in the line [...] "...a drift of chosen females, standing in their shifts..." ...|$|E
500|$|Tommy Handley died {{suddenly}} on 9 January 1949; the BBC {{decided that he}} was [...] "so much the keystone and embodiment of the actual performance" [...] of ITMA, that they cancelled the show immediately. Jacques later remarked that Handley was [...] "one of the greatest radio performers <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known. I learned... so much from him". Later that year Le Mesurier divorced his wife; shortly after the divorce came through, Jacques proposed to him, asking, [...] "don't you think it's about time we got married?" [...] The couple wed on 10 November that year, at Kensington Registrar's Office. After a week's honeymoon in Southsea, {{she returned to the}} Players' where she was engaged to appear as Marrygolda in the Christmas pantomime Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Browner {{became a}} key part of the {{administration}} team handling, and one of the more visible administration figures in issuing public comments about, the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. [...] In late May 2010 she assessed the spill as [...] "probably the biggest environmental disaster <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> faced in this country" [...] and said that the administration was [...] "prepared for the worst". [...] She added that [...] "I think what the American people need to know that it is possible we will have oil leaking from this well until August, when the relief wells will be finished." [...] Mike Allen of Politico later wrote that [...] " [...] calm, authoritative television presence during the BP oil disaster made her one of the few officials whose stature was enhanced in the aftermath of the Gulf catastrophe." ...|$|E

500|$|Approximately 500,000 people {{evacuated}} from Jefferson and Orleans Parishes {{in advance of}} the hurricane. Elsewhere, about 31,000 others took refuge in shelters set up throughout the state. In Jefferson Parish, roughly 3,900 people evacuated to public shelters, while 20,000 temporarily moved to Orleans Parish, 14,000 of whom were located in the Louisiana Superdome. In Plaquemines Parish, about 15,000 residents evacuated and 2,300 took refuge in public shelters. Grand Isle's 1,500 residents were ordered to evacuate for the fourth time in a month. Due to the large-scale evacuations, 175 off-duty state troopers and 250 national guard troops were deployed to help speed up the process. Only two highways, U.S. Route 90 and Interstate 10 lead in and out of New Orleans; however, heavy rains from previous storms flooded parts of US 90, hindering preparation efforts. Lt. Col. Ronnie Jones of the Louisiana state police noted that the evacuation was [...] "probably the largest [...] <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> achieved".|$|E
500|$|Beecham and Sargent were allies {{from the}} early days of the London Philharmonic to Beecham's final months when they were {{planning}} joint concerts. They even happened to share the same birthday. When Sargent was incapacitated by tuberculosis in 1933, Beecham conducted a performance of Messiah at the Albert Hall to raise money to support his younger colleague. Sargent loved Beecham's company, and took in good part his quips, such as his reference to the rising conductor Herbert von Karajan, as [...] "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent" [...] and, on learning that Sargent's car was caught in rifle fire in Palestine, [...] "I had no idea the Arabs were so musical." [...] Beecham declared that Sargent [...] "is the greatest choirmaster <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> produced ... he makes the buggers sing like blazes." [...] And on another occasion he said that Sargent was [...] "the most expert of all our conductors – myself excepted of course." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} one of the most {{expensive}} in the series at the time, with two visual effects milestones for the series. During one of the sequences, the visual effects team switched from stock explosions on 2D to 3D versions. The producers wished to exceed the minute-long Horizon sequence in the previous episode. The scene where the doors close while the shield is collapsing was merely stock footage from [...] "Hot Zone", with the CGI of the shield added on. When the producers conceived the idea for the space jump between Sheppard and Zelenka, they thought it would be [...] "cool", as well as thinking that they were possibly too apprehensive. [...] However, the sequence was pulled off, and Paul Mullie described the jump as [...] "one of the best visual effects <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> done." [...] The scene were one team dies from the collapsing shield however, was not performed as well as the producers hoped.|$|E

500|$|In 2012, Wallabies coach Robbie Deans and {{selectors}} wagered {{the potential}} returns in finishing games with two openside flankers {{on the field}} {{as a way to}} counter McCaw. In September 2012 after the All Blacks v South African Test in Dunedin, then South African coach Heyneke Meyer said that McCaw was the greatest rugby player the world has ever seen. Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there. The challenge for the other guys now is to try and become as great as him and Dan.” ...|$|E
500|$|From 1842 Bennett {{had been}} a {{director}} of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's Third (Scottish) Symphony, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was Michael Costa, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, [...] "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa... with which I am not very well pleased, but I could not persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> had." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like nothing <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which was what he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone published May 23, 2014, Fallon described the album as [...] "completely different than anything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> done before.

500|$|Herne Hill {{station and}} the first section to be completed, from Victoria to Herne Hill via Stewarts Lane and , opened on 25 August 1862. The station was {{designed}} by architect John Taylor and railway engineers Joseph Cubitt and J.T. Turner. The building was intended to impress: it had tea rooms offering buffets, decorative brickwork and a tower (which also served the practical function of concealing the water tank for steam locomotives). The Building News described the station in 1863 as [...] "spacious and convenient... and {{of the very best}} quality". It also stated that [...] "an unusual amount of decorative taste has been displayed" [...] in the station's construction; even the viaduct was praised as [...] "one of the most ornamental pieces of work <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen attempted on a railway" [...] for its fine brickwork. The station's design prompted the journal to write a 2,000-word editorial bemoaning the comparatively poor architectural quality of other contemporary civil engineering projects. An architectural critic later noted the station was [...] "eulogised" [...] by journals upon its opening and that its architecture was still seen as exemplary {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
500|$|Bilheimer {{accepted}} Costa's proposition, {{and subsequently}} wrote, produced, and directed Not My Life {{as an independent}} film. Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that [...] "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen." [...] Bilheimer's wife, Heidi Ostertag, is Worldwide Documentaries' Senior Producer, and she co-produced Not My Life with him. She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because [...] "people {{do not want to}} talk about this issue." [...] Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because the poor and the outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions. Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film in such a way that every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln: [...] "If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{began working}} on the project in early 2007. They found {{difficulties}} in recruiting a production company for the shooting of [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] since most operators passed on the project, who considered it to be risky and dangerous. After six months, Yamani Watkins and Edy Enriquez attached to produce, while Elliott Lester was set to co-direct the short film. The crew spent a month in Ilulissat, Greenland, preparing pre-production; almost 200 different kinds of insurance were required to shoot the video. Determined to offset the impact of filming on the environment, Thirty Seconds to Mars worked with the Natural Resources Defense Council on strategies that minimized fuel consumption on the shoot, using renewable energy products. Jared Leto described the whole project as [...] "one of the most painstaking and difficult creative challenge <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> undertaken as a band. It has also {{been one of the}} most inspiring – a rare opportunity to reach into our imagination and push the limits of what's possible." [...] The short film for [...] "A Beautiful Lie" [...] marked the first music video entirely shot on location 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland.|$|E
