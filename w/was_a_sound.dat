5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

25|$|Cardiopulmonary {{resuscitation}} is {{an important}} life saving first aid skill, practiced throughout the world. It is the only known effective method of keeping someone who has suffered cardiac arrest alive long enough for definitive treatment to be delivered. In 1954, James Elam {{was the first to}} demonstrate experimentally that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> technique, and together with Dr. Peter Safar he demonstrated its superiority to previous methods.|$|E

He had good colour, and was especially interested in effects of atmosphere and sunlight, which he expressed with much vitality. He is represented in the Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and Manly galleries.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 1950s, the {{accepted}} method of resuscitation was the chest-pressure and arm-lift technique that {{was shown to}} be ineffective by Safar and Elam. In 1954, Elam {{was the first to}} demonstrate experimentally that exhaled air ventilation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> technique. Elam and Safar (and later Gordon) performed many experiments demonstrating the superiority of the rescue breathing technique. The problem then became one of popularizing the method.|$|E

25|$|Others, like Sir Robert Thompson, {{himself an}} ex-Chindit, have {{asserted}} that the idea behind the Chindits <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> one, but {{that they were just}} badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence. A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their propaganda value in 1943, {{at a time when the}} Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility. It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.|$|E
500|$|The stylistic device most {{commonly}} found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate [...] "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples {{can be seen in}} Joy in the Morning, Chapter 29: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or Psmith, Chapter 7: [...] "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily {{in the middle of a}} thunderstorm interrupted his meditation." [...] Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{spent the}} {{majority}} of the next two years at home with Hepburn, living what she described as a quiet life: reading, painting, and listening to music. On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy awakened at 3:00am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: [...] "Just as I was about to give [...] a push, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> of a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump." [...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, [...] "He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him." [...] MGM publicist Howard Strickling told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper.|$|E

500|$|During 1976–77, in {{the midst}} of the {{original}} UK punk movement, bands emerged such as Manchester's Joy Division, the Fall, and Magazine, Leeds' Gang of Four, and London's the Raincoats that became central post-punk figures. Some bands classified as post-punk, such as Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, had been active well before the punk scene coalesced; others, such as the Slits and Siouxsie and the Banshees, transitioned from punk rock into post-punk. A few months after the Sex Pistols' breakup, John Lydon (no longer [...] "Rotten") cofounded Public Image Ltd. Lora Logic, formerly of X-Ray Spex, founded Essential Logic. Killing Joke formed in 1979. These bands were often musically experimental, like certain new wave acts; defining them as [...] "post-punk" [...] <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that tended to be less pop and more dark and abrasive—sometimes verging on the atonal, as with Subway Sect and Wire—and an anti-establishment posture directly related to punk's. Post-punk reflected a range of art rock influences from Syd Barrett and Captain Beefheart to David Bowie and Roxy Music to Krautrock.|$|E
500|$|In its review, the Library Journal {{said the}} work by Heins {{reflected}} {{a thorough investigation}} {{of the subject matter}} and presented a good overview of the chronology of censorship. The review concluded the author's thesis that censorship under the guise of helping children caused more harm than good <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> one. Library Journal recommended the book both for academic libraries as well as public libraries, and called a lecture by the author on her book [...] "a must". School Library Journal wrote that the book was timely {{due to the fact that}} there were significant issues of censorship being reported. School Library Journal praised Heins for her high level of studious effort preparing the work, and recommended it for all those involved in issues surrounding freedom of expression. The journal said academia had been waiting for such a valuable resource for a significant period of time. The review concluded it was quite impressive that Heins kept to an objective viewpoint throughout discussions of censorship in her monograph.|$|E
500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "This song is a pulsy, {{possibly}} club-ready jam {{that deserves}} single status." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic used [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{as an example}} of, according to her, a recurring problem on Can't Be Tamed: [...] "too often, Cyrus equates grown-up with joyless". Alexis Petridis of the United Kingdom magazine The Guardian felt the song was a gamely attempt at Lady Gaga. He said the chorus invites the answer: [...] "probably that creepy bloke from the Disney Channel who went on about violating your godliness." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also found an alternate answer to the song's chorus. [...] "It’s commerce that owns your heart, Miley, and it always has been", he wrote. Mikael Wood of Billboard compared [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] to 2010 singles released by The Black Eyed Peas. Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{said it was a}} post-GaGa Hi-NRG track that was inclined to the generic. However, he said that lyrical references were a large reminder that Cyrus sung the track. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{to be one of the}} best tracks from Can't Be Tamed, despite containing a [...] "cheesy ABBA-worthy chorus". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times also perceived the song to be [...] "in the vein of Cascada" [...] and one of the most [...] "exciting" [...] on Can't Be Tamed. He said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> that [...] "Ms. Cyrus hasn’t previously shown any affinity for and may never again. Still, it’s a timely and sharp sound." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Quatermass and the Pit finally entered {{production}} Val Guest was occupied on Casino Royale (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) {{and he was}} best known for The One That Got Away (1957) and A Night to Remember (1958). Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963–64), The Saint (1962–69) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as A Night to Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as A Night to Remember and The One That Got Away enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism {{it needed to be}} convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was [...] "taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it." [...] He was also impressed with Hammer Films’ lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he {{was surprised to find that}} Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as “Roy Ward Baker”, having previously been credited as “Roy Baker”. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to her jazz-influenced former album, Winehouse's focus {{shifted to the}} girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. Winehouse hired New York singer Sharon Jones's longtime band, the Dap-Kings, to back her up {{in the studio and}} on tour. Mitch Winehouse relates in Amy, My Daughter how fascinating watching her process was: her perfectionism in the studio and how she would put what she had sung on a CD and play it in his taxi outside to know how most people would hear her music. In May 2006, Winehouse's demo tracks such as [...] "You Know I'm No Good" [...] and [...] "Rehab" [...] appeared on Mark Ronson's New York radio show on East Village Radio. These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of [...] "Pumps" [...] and both were slated to appear on her second album. The 11-track album, completed in five months, was produced entirely by Salaam Remi and Ronson, with the production credits being split between them. Ronson said in a 2010 interview that he liked working with Winehouse because she was blunt when she did not like his work. She in turn thought that when they first met, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> engineer and that she was expecting an older man with a beard. Promotion of Back to Black soon began and, in early October 2006 Winehouse's official website was relaunched with a new layout and clips of previously unreleased songs. Back to Black was released in the UK on 30 October 2006. It went to number one on the UK Albums Chart for two weeks in January 2007, dropping then climbing back for several weeks in February. In the US, it entered at number seven on the Billboard 200. It was the best-selling album in the UK of 2007, selling 1.85million copies {{over the course of the}} year.|$|E
