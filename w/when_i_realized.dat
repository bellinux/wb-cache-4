She feared she would spend {{the rest of her life}} on her back, and was angry with her colleagues for saving her. Bågenholm soon {{recovered}} from the paralysis, however, and later apologized to her friends; [...] "I was very irritated <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> they had saved me. I feared a meaningless life, without any dignity. Now I am very happy to be alive and want to apologize." [...] Bågenholm's kidneys and digestive system were not working properly, so she had to recover in an intensive care unit for two more months. After spending 28days in the Tromsø intensive care unit, she was flown to Sweden in an ambulance helicopter for the remainder of her recovery.|$|E

Several songs are the most popular, but others are the most important on other topics. We've dressed them different. [...] "Se Nos Muere El Amor" [...] is now with piano and flauta, as an example." [...] He further stated that it was [...] "an album that begun as an experiment, with a dose of informality, and suddenly, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> of what the producers were achieving with the songs I worked many years ago, the album finished as being very complicated." ...|$|E

I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture."

500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> that I never {{had to worry about}} work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals that he was an alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek series—something that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E

[...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it.

Soon that passed and it has never really bothered me since, except in cases when people tried to exploit it." [...] Riegels was {{reminded}} of his mistake throughout his life. Riegels once said: [...] "All the times I've run across or heard people saying 'wrong way,' even though they weren't referring to me, I immediately turned around to see if they were speaking about me. I still don't understand how I did it." [...] Riegels dealt with his situation by laughing about what happened. Riegels once joked [...] "If I had to do it again, I'd still run in the same direction, for I surely thought I was going the right way." [...] Riegels also said [...] "You run the wrong way with a football in front of 60,000 people, and it's pretty hard to lie out of it." [...] When presented his membership card into the Georgia Tech Lettermen's Club 42 years later, Riegels quipped, [...] "Believe me, I feel I've earned this." ...|$|E

[...] Lucian Truscott reported in The Village Voice: [...] "A stagnant situation there brought on some gay tomfoolery {{in the form of a}} chorus line facing the line of helmeted and club-carrying cops.

[...] One participant who had been in the Stonewall during the raid recalled, [...] "The police rushed us, and that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> this is not a good thing to do, because they got me in the back with a nightstick."

After the program had ended and I was preparing to leave, a girl of about 7 years old approached me and said ‘Do you know Siri?’ I responded that yes, I did. She then said, ‘I do, too. I know Siri.

40|$|According to orthodoxy, the {{contents}} of propositional attitudes are, well, propositions. To believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a proposition. On an alternative account, developed and defended by David Lewis (1979) and Roderick Chisholm (1979 and 1981), {{the contents}} of the attitudes are not propositions but properties: to believe, desire, hope or fear is to stand in a certain relation to a property. Call this alternative the property theory. Its chief advantage over orthodoxy is its superior handling of the irreducibly first-personal de se attitudes. Not knowing I am looking in a mirror, I see a man with an inkspot on his collar and say to myself, “His collar is stained. ” I may believe that Jason Turner’s collar is stained — perhaps, thanks to selective amnesia, I remember what Jason Turner looks like but not that I am he — but, until <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> it is a mirror I am looking in, I still lack the belief that my collar is stained.
