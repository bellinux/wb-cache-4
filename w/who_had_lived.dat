5|$|Captured {{resistance}} {{members were}} also {{executed by the}} German authorities. Famously, Edith Cavell, a British nurse <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Belgium before the war, was arrested after helping Allied soldiers to escape the country and was executed by a German firing squad in 1915. Another résistante, Gabrielle Petit, {{who had participated in}} various forms of resistance activity, was executed in 1916 at the Tir national in Schaerbeek and became a posthumous national heroine.|$|E
5|$|First {{elected to}} Congress in 1936, Voorhis had {{defeated}} lackluster Republican opposition {{four times in}} the then-rural Los Angeles County district to win re-election. For the 1946 election, Republicans sought a candidate who could unite the party and run a strong race against Voorhis in the Republican-leaning district. After failing to secure the candidacy of General George Patton, in November 1945 they settled on Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in the district prior to his World War II service.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, the White Bear {{public house}} {{came under the}} {{ownership}} of the Harman's Brewery in Uxbridge. It had been built close to Primrose Hill Farm near the junction of the Ickenham Road and Kings End. Kings End was a hamlet, with one building {{dating back to the}} 16th century. It was named after a family <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> there at that time.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly a window in the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E
5|$|The 500Hispanic {{settlers}} <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773. In the {{six years}} between the inspection {{and the removal of}} the settlers, the immigrant population of East Texas had increased from 200 Europeans to 500, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only five days to prepare to relocate to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.|$|E

5|$|The Magyars (or Hungarians), <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> on the Pontic steppe for decades, {{invaded the}} Carpathian Basin after their defeat by a {{coalition}} of Bulgarians and Pechenegs about 895 AD. Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus wrote that the seven Magyar tribes formed a confederation with the Kabars. Although the Kabars had originally lived in the Khazar Khaganate, they rebelled against the Khazars and joined the Magyars on the Pontic steppe.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the scene is a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration {{may have been a}} woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|Vukovar is an {{important}} regional centre on Croatia's eastern border, situated in eastern Slavonia {{on the west bank}} of the Danube river. The area has a diverse population of Croats, Serbs, Hungarians, Slovaks, Ruthenians and many other nationalities, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> together for centuries in relative harmony before the Croatian war. It was one of the wealthiest areas of Yugoslavia before the war. Vukovar's long-standing prosperity was reflected in one of Croatia's finest ensembles of Baroque architecture.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed to remember that Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E
5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived,</b> {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858. He saw Russia as a musical desert compared to Paris, Berlin and Leipzig, whose music conservatories he had visited. Musical life flourished in those places; composers were held in high regard, and musicians were wholeheartedly devoted to their art. With a similar ideal in mind for Russia, he had conceived {{an idea for a}} conservatory in Russia years before his 1858 return, and had finally aroused the interest of influential people to help him realize the idea.|$|E

5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, however, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of interest in World War I memorials. This was driven partially by a sequence of academic works on {{the social and cultural}} character of the conflict, aided by a sequence of artistic exhibits of some of more famous designers in the 1980s, and partially by generational change in many countries. As the generation <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> and fought during the war died off, explaining the context of the memorials became more important. In France, veteran groups had begun to build memorial museums alongside the major monuments and battlefields from the late 1930s onwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in {{the top floor of}} her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from {{depression}} and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity {{to compare it to}} the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{historians have}} long debated whether Hanpu was of Silla, Goryeo, or Jurchen ethnicity. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly {{argued that he}} was a Jurchen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Silla, the state that had {{dominated}} the Korean peninsula until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's story as a legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and Balhae (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century. In Korea, a recent KBS history special treated Hanpu as a native Silla man who moved north and settled in Jurchen lands during the demise of Silla.|$|E
5|$|From 1927, Lee was {{actively}} {{involved with the}} SCCCI, initially as General-Secretary, then as President. Under his leadership, the SCCCI supported the establishment of Nanyang University and convinced the British to grant citizenship to Chinese immigrants <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> in Singapore for eight years. Lee was Chairman of the Ee Hoe Hean Club from 1933–1935 and 1941–1945. Lee {{was also one of}} six Hokkien representatives in the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA), which acted as a bridge between the Chinese community and Japanese military administration during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. During an OCA assignment to the Endau Settlement in Malaysia, his convoy was ambushed by the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army and everyone in the convoy was shot. Only Lee survived, as a bullet hit a Buddhist medallion on his chest; this inspired him to spread Buddhism in Singapore.|$|E
