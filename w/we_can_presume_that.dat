40|$|OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) was {{performed}} in all patients and was evaluated as normal or abnormal according to standardized general criteria. The results of NPT were then compared to penile duplex ultrasonography parameters peak systolic velocity (normal > 35 cm/sec) and diastolic velocity (normal < 5 cm/sec), and to the flow rate needed to maintain erection (normal < 15 ml/min) with pharmaco-infusion cavernosometry. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 26 showed normal NPT where 25 patients (96 %) had normal penile systolic velocity, 18 patients (69 %) had normal penile diastolic velocity, and 22 patients (85 %) showed normal flow to maintain erection. On the other hand, 24 showed abnormal NPT, where 7 patients (29 %) had abnormal penile blood flow velocity and 18 patients (75 %) showed high flow rate to maintain erection. CONCLUSION: From this study, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> conclude that normal NPT {{appears to have a}} good correlation with normal systolic blood velocity and normal cavernosometry. However, this correlation is low when compared with diastolic blood velocity. On the other hand, a low correlation exists between abnormal NPT and abnormal systolic and diastolic blood flow or abnormal cavernosometry. According to this observation, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>presumed</b> <b>that</b> NPT, penile duplex and infusion cavernosometry considering together should be performed in order to achieve a reasonably accurate diagnosis.

50|$|Hungarian armies {{never went}} to Italy before. The {{military}} intelligence {{was one of the}} most important features of the nomadic warfare. Starting a war without knowing the enemies power, number of soldiers, will to fight, etc., was unimaginable in the nomadic societies. This is why in late October 898 they sent a light armored, quick moving small unit on reconnaissance, which crossed Pannonia in their way to Northern Italy, than arrived in Italy in Friuli camped three days with their tents near the river Brenta, sending their scouts in small groups to reconnoitre the land, its wealth, the number and the fighting spirit of the enemy troops, the routes of attack and retreat, the places which can be chosen as battlefield, where the most spoils are to find, the number of the cities, castles and the strength of their defence system. It is certain that the place of the future battle was chosen during this minor incursion.

50|$|During {{the next}} day the Hungarians {{attacked}} the German fleet under Prince Sieghard. Aventinus writes nothing about how they managed to attack the fleet; and he points only to the ease of the Hungarian victory and the paralyzing terror of the Germans, who could do nothing to defend themselves. Although there is nothing known about how the Hungarians accomplished this difficult task - destroying the Bavarian fleet - easy, can be outlined that they did it in the following way: the Magyar army, aligning on both the shores of the Danube, shot burning arrows on the ships, setting them on fire, like they did so many times during the period of the Hungarian invasions of Europe, when the Magyars set many cities on fire shooting, from great distance, burning arrows on the roofs of the houses behind the city walls, like they did with the towns of Bremen (915), Basel (917), Verdun (921), Pavia (924), Cambrai (954). Setting wooden ships on fire was no harder than burning down towns using flaming arrows. The distance of the ships floating on the Danube was also not an impediment to them. The width of the Danube at Pressburg is between 180 and 300 meters, but the range of the arrows shot from the nomadic composite bows could reach the extraordinary distance of 500 meters, so it {{is no doubt that the}} Hungarian arrows could reach the ships, which, if they were in the middle of the river, they had to be only 90 to 150 meters from the shore. Maybe the fire started on the ships by the arrows caused the terror and panic among the Bavarians, about which Aventinus writes, who initially thought that they are safe. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>presume</b> <b>that</b> those Bavarians who wanted to escape from the burning ships jumped in water, and there a part of them drowned, and those who arrived to the shore, were killed by the Hungarians. As a result, the majority of the Bavarians from the ships, together with their commanders, Prince Sieghard, counts Meginward, Hatto, Ratold and Isangrim, died on the last day of the battle.|$|E

The association between Lactococcus spp. and human infectious diseases is described as being mainly associated with lumbar osteomyelitis, hepatic abscess, and infective endocarditis. In the literature of orthopedic post-prosthetic infections, L. garvieae was associated with a case of hip prosthetic infection in a fishmonger woman.

5000|$|King Louis the Child {{decided that}} the forces from all the German duchies should come {{together}} and fight the Hungarians. He even threatened with execution those who would not come under his flag. We know about two armies which gathered: one, consisting of Swabian and other forces from southern Germany, led nominally by the king Louis the Child (but because of his young age, in reality {{the leader of this}} army were Gozbert count of Alemannia and Managolt the count of Ladengau in Franconia), and the other, consisting from troops gathered from Franconia, Lotharingia (presuming that if the duke of Lotharingia led the army, he gad to bring with him also an important troop from his country), Bavaria and maibe Saxony (however we do not know anything about the Saxons taking part of this battle, but we presume that they also heard the call and the threat of king Louis, and that maybe they want to put an end of the Hungarian attacks, because they suffered in 906 and 908 two devastating attacks from the Hungarian armies), led by Gebhard, Duke of Lorraine and Liudger, the count of Ladengau. These two armies tried to unite, and fight the Hungarians together. The Hungarians learned about plans of Louis the Child, and sent quickly a Hungarian army, which rushed to prevent the joining of the Swabian and Frankish forces. They reached Augsburg on forced march very quickly, totally unexpected for Louis the Child and his army, and, at 12 June 910, defeated in the battle of Augsburg the army of the King. Maybe the failure of the Frankish army to arrive at the battle scene was due to some Hungarian units, which [...] "kept busy" [...] the Franco-Lotharingian army, distracting the attention of its leaders from the other battle, the Battle of Augsburg. So, the Hungarian army, with a [...] "Napoleonean" [...] tactic (István Bóna), cleverly managed to attack, and deal with these two armies separatedly. After that first battle, the Hungarian army marched north, to the border of Bavaria and Franconia, and met with the Franco-Bavaro-Lotharingian army led by Gebhard, Duke of Lorraine at Rednitz. We do not know who led the Hungarians, but it seem to be a military leader, and not the Grand Prince of the Hungarians, who in the IX-X centuries never took place in a battle outside of the Hungarian territories, the campaigns being led by more minor military leaders, the horka or one of the princes. We do not know about the strength of the two armies before the battle, but knowing the fact that at least three (Franconia, Lotharingia, Bavaria) if not four (Saxonia) East Francian duchies took part in the battle, and the army was led by a duke and a count, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>presume</b> <b>that</b> the German army was bigger than the Hungarians, who before this battle had to fight another battle at Augsburg with the Swabian army of the German king Louis the Child, which, although was a victory, could cause them some losses too. Like in the before mentioned battle, in this battle too, met two war philosophies, styles and type of fighting, and weapons: the medieval European, inspired by the European-Frankish style of war and strategical thinking (consisting in heavy armours and weapons, the prevail of the strongest army without putting much importance on strategy), used by the Germans and the Nomadic War tactics, strategy and weapons used by the Hungarians (using exclusively cavalry, light or no armor, predominance of the bows and arrows, high mobility of the army corps, and predominance of delusive war tactics, which needed strategical thinking from the commanders).|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} the high-energy neutral atom (HENA) imager onboard the IMAGE satellite, we {{examined}} {{the relation between the}} SYM-H index and the ring current energy during a storm main phase. The energy range of the energetic neutral atom (ENA) flux data used here is 16 – 120 keV for hydrogen and < 180 keV for oxygen. From the data for the period 2000 – 2002, we selected 24 storm main phase events during which the IMAGE satellite was located at a geomagnetic latitude of ≥ 45 ° and a geocentric distance of ≥ 6 RE. According to the Dessler-Parker-Sckopke (DPS) equation, the ring current energy is expected to increase as the SYM-H index decreases. When the ENA energy flux is superimposed {{as a function of the}} SYM-H index for all 24 events, their overall correlation is negative; that is, the relation between the ENA energy flux and the SYM-H index is generally consistent with the DPS equation. However, an analysis of individual events showed only 10 events (42 %) in which the ENA energy flux was negatively correlated with the SYM-H index (negative correlation events). There were 10 events showing no clear correlation between the ENA energy flux and the SYM-H index (no correlation events) and 4 events which contradicted the DPS equation (positive correlation events). In the superimposed plot, we noted that a smooth curve can be drawn for an upper limit of the data distribution, and {{data from the}} no correlation or positive correlation events create downward branches in the distribution. These observational results are not explained by the conventional DPS equation but by the "generalized" DPS equation, which includes a term representing energy stored in the stretched magnetic field. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> reasonably <b>presume</b> <b>that</b> the stretched magnetic field prevents energetic particles from being injected into the ring current. From the generalized DPS equation, we conclude that the total (kinetic and magnetic) energy stored in the stretched field and ring current loss mechanisms are important for understanding the relation between the ground magnetic field variation and ring current energy variation...|$|R
