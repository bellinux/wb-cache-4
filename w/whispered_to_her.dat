2500|$|At al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham {{meet his}} family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, {{mirroring}} a similar scene {{earlier in the}} movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the United States, where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace for their outstanding work. Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own daughter what her grandfather <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as he was dying. The granddaughter tells her mother, [...] "Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all," [...] a similar line to what Fleury had whispered to Mayes.|$|E

He improvised the final moments of the characters' reconciliation, and what Gibbs <b>whispered</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> became a subject of discussion among viewers. Likewise, de Pablo's reaction to it was not scripted either. Harmon declined to divulge what was said, stating, [...] "That's our secret." [...] These events propelled the idea of Gibbs as a surrogate father figure to Ziva, marking the first time it was verbally acknowledged within the series.|$|E
