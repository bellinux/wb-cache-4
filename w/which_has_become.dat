5|$|Crawley's early {{development}} as a market town was helped by its location on the London–Brighton turnpike. The area was joined to the railway network in the mid-19th century; and since {{the creation of the}} new town, there have been major road upgrades (including a motorway link), a guided bus transit system and the establishment of an airport <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> one of Britain's largest and busiest.|$|E

The club offers tennis and swimming, but it is best known for its golf course, the home of the 1974 WGC-World Cup. Designed by Dick Wilson, the club began with temporary headquarters in 1959, opening officially in 1964.

Since 1973, the festival has been overseen by the Richard-Wagner-Stiftung (Richard Wagner Foundation), the members of which include a number of Wagner's descendants.|$|E
5|$|Surgeon-General to the First Fleet John White {{caught a}} {{specimen}} in May 1788, {{calling it a}} yellow-faced flycatcher in his Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales, {{which was published in}} 1790. Latham called it the black-cheeked warbler. John Gould called it the yellow-faced honeyeater in 1848, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> its official name.

Their spread {{consisted}} of elaborate dishes like kebabs, kormas, biryani, kaliya, nahari-kulchas, zarda, sheermal, roomali rotis, and warqi parathas. The richness of Awadh cuisine lies not only in the variety of cuisine but also in the ingredients used like mutton, paneer, and rich spices including cardamom and saffron.|$|E

5|$|Apical {{periodontitis}} is acute {{or chronic}} inflammation around {{the apex of}} a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it's alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around {{the roots of the}} tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.|$|E
5|$|Both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles {{are clearly}} visible by {{microscopy}} in brains of those afflicted by AD. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid peptide and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles (neurofibrillary tangles) are aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> hyperphosphorylated and accumulate inside the cells themselves. Although many older individuals develop some plaques and tangles {{as a consequence}} of ageing, the brains of people with AD have a greater number of them in specific brain regions such as the temporal lobe. Lewy bodies are not rare in the brains of people with AD.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E

5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} Virtual Console review, IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commended the gameplay depth and the detailed visual presentation. He acknowledged the difficulty, even on easy, but praised {{the game as}} one of the best examples of the niche shooting gallery genre. Mat Allen of Nintendo Life found the game to be an excellent example of what the Virtual Console is for: providing gamers chances to experience quality games that were overlooked in their time. He highlighted the release as providing a cheap option to play a game <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> an expensive collector's item.|$|E
5|$|In combat, a quick time event (QTE) feature, {{also called}} context {{sensitive}} attacks, is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe. The player performs {{a sequence of}} actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt. This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence, which, if successful, ends the battle; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist. Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game {{in the form of}} an encounter with female twins, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>become</b> a regular feature throughout the series.|$|E
