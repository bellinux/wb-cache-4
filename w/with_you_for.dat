25|$|In the meantime, Nomura {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the main character designs and orchestration of The World Ends <b>with</b> <b>You</b> <b>for</b> the Nintendo DS. In 2009, {{he was also the}} main character designer of Final Fantasy XIII. The graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role {{in the creation of the}} non-playable characters. In 2008, he was the character designer of Dissidia Final Fantasy. The game was originally envisioned by Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring a cast of Disney characters. He later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters. Nomura was responsible for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Amano's illustrations.|$|E

500|$|The {{biography}} is comprehensive, covering {{many different}} aspects of its subject's life. The author discusses Morrison's early life in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how this influenced his perspective of [...] "no surrender", a reference to Ulster Unionism. Rogan writes how, a young boy, Morrison exhibited [...] "poor communication skills, aggressive impatience, and absence of empathy", and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends. The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all. He'd play along <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> a while until he got bored – he seemed to tire of it quickly. He'd go indoors." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's soundtrack {{was well}} {{received}} by critics. The tracks [...] "Tu Hai Toh Main Hoon" [...] and [...] "Zara Zara" [...] garnered positive response from critics and audiences alike; Manavi Kapoor of Business Standard remarked, [...] "Zara Zara' and 'Tu Hai Toh Main Hun' are haunting and perfectly capture the poignant {{tone of the}} film." [...] Ushnota Paul writing for Filmfare was also laudatory of both the songs, as each [...] "lingers <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> long". In another soundtrack review for The Times of India, Mohar Basu praised McCleary's [...] "trademark effervescence", which made the soundtrack of Waiting [...] "oh-so-charming." [...] She summed up by writing that the album had, [...] "a few pleasant songs {{and even though they}} all sound fairly similar, it has a satisfying effect". Manish Gaekwad of Scroll.in gave a mixed review; he was analogous in the praise of the [...] "pleasent" [...] nature of the tracks, but was critical of the lyrics that didn't go beyond the [...] "greeting-card sentiment".|$|E

500|$|Super Meat Boys soundtrack was {{composed}} by Danny Baranowsky, who previously composed the soundtracks for the indie video games Canabalt, Cortex Command, and Gravity Hook. He also composed {{the music for}} the original Meat Boy. McMillen knew of Baranowsky's other work, and approached him late in Meat Boys development, asking him to supply whatever tracks he had on hand. For the soundtrack of Super Meat Boy, Baranowsky incorporated the music he had provided for Meat Boy into an expanded soundtrack. He tried {{to ensure that the}} music would accompany the action on the screen without overpowering the sound effects. Baranowsky was given complete freedom for the game's music, and retained all of the rights to it; McMillen believed that being more invested in the game would let Baranowsky express the part of him that was [...] "manic, obsessive, complex, and full of life". McMillen feels that the soundtrack [...] "gets your heart rate up, complements every aspect of its gameplay, and stays <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> days".|$|E

2500|$|As {{described}} in the Idra Rabba, before the Idra disjourned, three of the students died: Rabbi Yossi bar Yaakov, Rabbi Chezkiyah bar Rav, and Rabbi Yisa. As it is told, these students filled up with Godly light and therefore journeyed to the eternal world after their deaths. The remaining students saw their friends being carried away by angels.

2500|$|Sackville-West and Trefusis eloped {{several times}} from 1918 on, mostly to France. While there Sackville-West {{dressed as a}} man when they went out together. The affair ended badly. The mothers of both women, Lady Sackville and Mrs. Keppel, joined forces to {{sabotage}} the relationship and force both women back to their husbands. Both women were deeply interested in Spain, especially the Spanish Romany, with Trefusis writing to Sackville-West that they should go to Spain to show [...] "you my pupil, I as your cicerone...I will show eyes of black velvet...the sevillana, the fandango, undulating bodies, throbbing castanets". In another letter, Trefusis wrote of her wish to live forever in Spain with Sackville-West, [...] "a world of sun and love, and singing, and dancing". Trefusis sought to appeal to Sackville-West's fascination with the Romany people by telling {{her that she was}} turning into a [...] "Gypsy", writing: [...] "They said, this evening after you gone, that you were like a dazzling Gypsy. A Gypsy potentate, a sovereign-what you will, but still a Gypsy". Trefusis and Sackville-West both used Romany phrases to express intensely held feelings such as man camelo tuti ("I can't live without you"), nonero jeli ("our love"), and sartute loude gayeres ("escape with you"). Both families were concerned that the women were creating scandal. In a letter to Nicolson dated 1 June 1919 explaining why she would not leave Trefusis, Sackville-West wrote: [...] "I never ought to marry you or anybody else; I ought just to have lived <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> as long as you wanted me...I ought never to have married until I was thirty. I really think that is the best solution for people like me. Women ought to have the freedom the same as men when they are young. It's a rotten and ridiculous system at present, it's simply cheating one of one's youth. It was all right for the Victorians. But this generation is disregarding, and next will have disregarded, the chrysalis." [...] At another point, Sackville-West wrote to Nicolson [...] "if wasn't for you, I would go off with V." [...] Trefusis continued to pursue Sackville-West to great lengths until Sackville-West's affairs with other women finally took their toll. In November 1919, while staying at Monte Carlo, Sackville-West wrote in her diary that she was [...] "down on" [...] herself with [...] "serious thoughts" [...] of suicide as she believed that Nicolson [...] "would be happier without" [...] her in the world. [...] The two women apparently made a bond to remain faithful to one another, meaning that although both were married, neither could engage in sexual relations with her own husband. Sackville-West, who already had two children by Nicholson, was prompted to end the affair when she heard allegations that Trefusis had been involved sexually with her own husband, indicating that she had broken their bond. When she decided to end the affair with Trefusis, Sackville-West again contemplated suicide, writing in her diary that she [...] "hated myself to the extent of thinking I better vanish" [...] from the world forever. Despite the rift, the two women were devoted to one another, and deeply in love. They continued to have occasional liaisons {{for a number of years}} afterwards, but never rekindled the affair.|$|E
