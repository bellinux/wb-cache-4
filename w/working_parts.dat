5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean room would later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E

Since 2013, the conversion process has been improved by scientists at Karlsruhe Liquid-metal Laboratory (KALLA) as they succeeded in allowing the soot to be easily removed (soot is a byproduct of the process and damaged the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> in the past -most notably the nickel-iron-cobaltcatalyst-). The soot (which contains the carbon) can then be stored underground and is not released into the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|In {{paper is}} {{presented}} technology of bimetallic layered castings based on founding method of layer coating directly in cast process so-called method of mould cavity preparation. Prepared castings consist two fundamental parts i. e. bearing <b>part</b> and <b>working</b> <b>part</b> (layer). The bearing part of bimetallic layered casting is typical foundry material i. e. ferritic-pearlitic unalloyed cast steel, whereas <b>working</b> <b>part</b> (layer) is plate of austenitic alloy steel sort X 2 CrNi 18 - 9. The ratio of thickness between bearing and <b>working</b> <b>part</b> is 8 : 1. The aim of paper was assessed {{the quality of}} the joint between bearing and <b>working</b> <b>part</b> in dependence of pouring temperature and carbon concentration in cast steel. The quality of the joint in bimetallic layered castings was evaluated on the basis of ultrasonic non-destructive testing, structure and microhardness researches...|$|R

25|$|While to {{some extent}} his work {{consisted}} in improving the designs of his predecessors, Holden was responsible for several designs of his own. He completely reorganised Stratford Works, which, together with a considerable degree of standardisation, brought Stratford to an exceptionally high position among British locomotive works in the speed and efficiency of its locomotive production. Some of the extensively-built locomotive classes {{may not have been}} outstanding in performance on the road, or in fuel economy, but they were rugged in design and with their massive <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> were reliable and easy to maintain.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the steam}} engine, the Stirling engine is {{traditionally}} classified as an external combustion engine, as all heat transfers {{to and from}} the working fluid take place through a solid boundary (heat exchanger) thus isolating the combustion process and any contaminants it may produce from the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> of the engine. This contrasts with an internal combustion engine where heat input is by combustion of a fuel within the body of the working fluid. Most of the many possible implementations of the Stirling engine fall into the category of reciprocating piston engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{process is}} inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice {{that most of}} the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.|$|E

500|$|Among his brothers, Benjamin showed {{himself to}} be the most {{technically}} adept. He saw the need for farm machinery and expanded the company's line to include farm equipment, including combine harvesters and the steam-powered traction engines required to pull them through the fields. In 1883, Benjamin Holt produced his first horse-drawn [...] "Link-Belt Combined Harvester". It allowed a farmer to combine cutting and threshing grain into a single mechanical operation, enabling farmers to cut more wheat in one pass, increasing productivity and cutting labor hours nearly in half. One key innovation Holt implemented was using flexible chain belts rather than gears to transmit power from the ground wheels to the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> of the machine.|$|E
500|$|The Philadelphia {{pilot plant}} {{occupied}} [...] of space {{on a site}} one block west of Broad Street, near the Delaware River. The plant consisted of 102 [...] columns, known as a [...] "rack", arranged into a cascade of seven stages. The plant {{was intended to be}} able to produce one gram per day of uranium enriched to 6% uranium-235. The outer copper tubes were cooled by [...] water flowing between them and the external 4-inch steel pipes. The inner nickel tubes were heated by high pressure steam at [...] and [...] Each column therefore held about [...] of uranium hexafluoride. This was driven by vapor pressure; the only <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> were the water pumps. In operation, the rack consumed 11.6 MW of power. Each column was connected to a reservoir of [...] of uranium hexafluoride. Because of the dangers involved in handling uranium hexafluoride, all work with it, such as replenishing the reservoirs from the shipping cylinders, was accomplished in a transfer room. The columns at the Philadelphia plant were operated in parallel instead of in series, so the Philadelphia pilot plant eventually produced over [...] of uranium hexafluoride enriched to 0.86 percent uranium-235, which was handed over to the Manhattan Project. The Philadelphia pilot plant was disposed of in September 1946, with salvageable equipment being returned to the NRL, while the rest was dumped at sea.|$|E

2500|$|In direct {{competition}} with Alexander Chaplin, Dr. Alphonse Normandyâ€™s (1809â€“1864) apparatus is another successful distiller. It {{consists of three}} essential parts, the evaporator, the condenser and the refrigerator. The apparatus passes a mixture of steam and gasses from the evaporator to the tubes of the condenser. Normandy's distiller was very complex in structure, consisting of many numerous <b>working</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] With an elaborate layout and expensive cost, the distiller wasn't economically viable for smaller vessels.

2500|$|For {{successful}} {{preparation of}} potable water from seawater, {{the following conditions}} of a distilling apparatus were deemed essential. First, the distilled product must be aerated {{so it may be}} immediately available for drinking and storage purposes. Second, the amount of coal used to obtain the maximum volume of drinkable water must be at a minimum expenditure level and third, the apparatus' <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> must be simple enough to prevent from breaking down and to enable unskilled attendants to safely operate. [...] "The Alexander Chaplin distilling apparatus is among the forms of apparatus which have most fully satisfied such conditions".|$|E
2500|$|Rotary engines have {{a problem}} not found in {{reciprocating}} piston four-stroke engines in that the block housing has intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing. In contrast, reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber, so that extremes of [...] "freezing" [...] intake and [...] "flaming" [...] exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating <b>working</b> <b>parts.</b> The use of heat pipes in an air-cooled Wankel was proposed by the University of Florida to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing. Pre-heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy, also reducing wear and emissions.|$|E

2500|$|During {{this period}} the {{coalfield}} suffered {{a series of}} fatal explosions as the available mine ventilation techniques were unable to safely deal with large quantity of methane or firedamp produced by the Barnsley seam in the deeper and larger mines being sunk. [...] The contemporary colliery ventilation techniques were often poorly applied and even in collieries where the ventilation was well engineered the technique had a significant flaw. The flow of air was controlled by 'traps' or doors opened and closed by children when the tubs of coal passed. [...] The children, being children, did not always close the doors when they should, resulting in explosives gases building up in the <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> of the colliery often with fatal consequences.|$|E

2500|$|A low cut {{waistcoat}} {{should be}} worn when wearing a single-breasted coat. [...] The waistcoat {{plays an important}} part in black tie's refined minimalism by helping to conceal its <b>working</b> <b>parts</b> by discreetly covering the trouser's exposed waistband and the shirt bosom's bottom edge. Waistcoasts come in the 'V' or rarer 'U' shape, in backless or fully backed versions, double or single breasted, with or without lapels. Single breasted styles typically have three buttons, and double breasted ones three or four rows. Before World War II, while black tie was still gaining acceptance, men would wear a white waistcoat, along with other details now associated primarily with white tie, such as stiff fronted shirts. However, this style, though increasingly viewed as an affectation, is still acceptable in the United States.The waistcoat should be made from either the same fabric as the dinner jacket (traditional) or the same silk as the jacket's lapels (popular). When a waistcoat has lapels, they should be faced in the same silk as those of the jacket; in this case it is considered more refined if the body is made from the same fabric as the jacket. The buttons may be self-faced or covered in the same silk as the lapels. Vintage waistcoats were sometimes closed with studs made from onyx or mother of pearl, which were often surrounded by a setting of silver or gold.|$|E
