50|$|Packaged apps were {{launched}} on September 5, 2013. They have features {{very similar to}} a native desktop app, namely offline capable (by default), can interact with hardware devices, and can access local storage.

50|$|An AWE {{application}} {{can enhance}} the interactive console <b>window</b> <b>menu</b> items {{that can be used}} to execute program units and exit, providing a GUI for an interactive application. The program units can operate using pop-ups, menus, and display windows, so that the traditional console I/O is not used at all, and thus providing an all-Fortran GUI driven application on all three supported platforms.|$|E
50|$|The {{system menu}} (also called the <b>window</b> <b>menu</b> or control menu) is a popup menu in Microsoft Windows, {{accessible}} by left-clicking on the upper-left icon of most windows, or by pressing the Alt and Space keys. This menu provides the user {{with the ability}} to perform some common tasks on the window, some in atypical ways. For example, normally a user would move a window by dragging the title bar of the window - but with the option in the system menu the user gets a different cursor and procedure to move the window with.|$|E

50|$|Icons as {{parts of}} the {{graphical}} user interface of the computer system, in conjunction with <b>windows,</b> <b>menus</b> and a pointing device (mouse), belong to the much larger topic {{of the history of}} the graphical user interface that has largely supplanted the text-based interface for casual use.|$|R
25|$|The Xerox PARC user {{interface}} consisted of graphical {{elements such as}} <b>windows,</b> <b>menus,</b> radio buttons, and check boxes. The concept of icons was later introduced by David Canfield Smith, who had written a thesis on the subject {{under the guidance of}} Kay. The PARC {{user interface}} employs a pointing device along with a keyboard. These aspects can be emphasized by using the alternative term and acronym for <b>windows,</b> icons, <b>menus,</b> pointing device (WIMP). This effort culminated in the 1973 Xerox Alto, the first computer with a GUI, though the system never reached commercial production.|$|R

Colonnetti", has {{developed for the}} geometrical verification of Rockwell, Vickers diamond indenters, as prescribed by ISO Standards. This system consists of two instruments: an Interferometric Sine-Bar, for angular, straightness and flatness measures and a Rotary Table, for the verification of the spherical tip of Rockwell indenters. These two devices {{can be set up}} in one workstation, interfaced with the same computer for data analysis. A software package has been specifically developed to manage the entire system. The measurement test cycle is completely automated in order to ensure objective and reliable results. The operator interface, based on a graphic <b>window</b> <b>menu</b> in the Windows® environment, is extremely user friendly and it does not require any programming knowledge...|$|E
