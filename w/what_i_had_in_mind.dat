500|$|For New Amerykah Part One, Badu collaborated principally with Questlove, Madlib, 9th Wonder, Karriem Riggins, James Poyser, audio {{engineer}} Mike [...] "Chav" [...] Chavarria, and {{the members}} of musical group Sa-Ra, who made production and lyrical contributions to most of the tracks. She later explained choosing which producers to work with, saying [...] "All of these people have a reputation for being visionaries and knowing them well, I felt 'Okay, now it's time to put together a project that not only takes us to another place, another dimension, but highlights these sights.' And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for this project".|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{had seen}} Russell Crowe in Romper Stomper {{and found him}} [...] "repulsive and scary, but captivating". The actor had read Ellroy's The Black Dahlia but not L.A. Confidential. When he read the script, Crowe was drawn to Bud White's [...] "self-righteous moral crusade". Crowe fit the visual preconception of Bud. Hanson put the actor on tape doing a few scenes from the script {{and showed it to}} the film's producers, who agreed to cast him as Bud. Guy Pearce auditioned like countless other actors, and Hanson felt that he [...] "was very much <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for Ed Exley." [...] The {{director}} purposely did not watch the actor in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, afraid that it might influence his decision. As he did with Crowe, Hanson taped Pearce and showed it to the producers, who agreed he should be cast as Ed. Pearce did not like Ed when he first read the screenplay and remarked, [...] "I was pretty quick to judge him and dislike him for being so self-righteous ... But I liked how honest he became about himself. I knew I could grow to respect and understand him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want {{no time to}} think. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind, when I left Miss Letitia, is {{something}} which I refuse to explain, miss, to you, or to anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he has got}} to {{keep his}} {{distance}} this term," [...] said Major Jack, with a firm look on his face. [...] "I am not going to stand for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the past." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> them," [...] {{answered}} the bully, pulling a trunk key from one pocket and some small {{change from the}} other. [...] "Perhaps you'll say I was fighting with these in my hands." ...|$|R
2500|$|GameZone's Michael Lafferty {{scored the}} Xbox version 8 out of 10, writing [...] "the {{essence of the}} fantastic {{adventure}} is there, and while the game does chart an extremely linear path through the lands of Middle-earth, there are enough challenges along the route to enable players to joyfully experience the urgency and terror of the journey." [...] IGN's Kaiser Hwang scored it 6.7 out of 10. He was critical of the combat, the enemy AI, and how the plot was handled. He concluded [...] "the book itself is very non-linear in format and can {{be very hard to}} translate into an effective game without leaving some of the detail out. But to reduce to the story to almost childish levels is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Didn't we learn that from 1978's Lord of the Rings animated movie?" [...] GameSpy's Steve Steinberg scored it 3 out of 5, arguing [...] "the actual gameplay takes a backseat. The die-hard Tolkien will {{get a kick out of}} slugging and spell-casting their way through the first book of the Rings trilogy, but the casual gamer will only be disappointed by an otherwise generic action/adventure title. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker scored it 5.7 out of 10, writing [...] "even the blessing of Tolkien Enterprises isn't enough to save the game from its bland design and tedious gameplay." [...] He called it [...] "an average game at its best and a frustrating and boring one at its worst." [...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness." [...] He was heavily critical of the inability to invert the camera controls, which he referred to as an [...] "industry standard option" [...] in third-person games. He concluded [...] "this has [...] "licensed toss" [...] written all over it. The goal was [...] "to create the most authentic Lord of the Rings game experience possible." [...] Quite honestly, Melbourne House's [...] had more going for it." ...|$|E
60|$|How much of {{what follows}} I said to de Tessin at the time I do not clearly remember, but this is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But I know nothing. That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> I know nothing. And these others--the Councillors, Ostrog. They are wiser, cooler, {{they know}} so much, every detail. And, indeed, {{what are these}} miseries of which you speak? What am I to know? Do you mean--" ...|$|E
50|$|As a manager, I want {{to browse}} my {{existing}} quizzes so <b>I</b> can recall <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> place {{and figure out}} if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's nothing, mother," [...] {{he called}} to her, and as she dropped on her knees before him he sank limply against her. [...] "It was like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> Carlsbad; that's all. Don't worry about me, please!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, the banquet!' said Lorenzo, {{clasping}} his hands. 'What an inexhaustible matter! I {{could go}} on talking about it all day and all night for a year, and then find <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left unsaid half <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> my mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{have planned}} to do a great deal," [...] {{answered}} Barwell Dawson. [...] "As I stated before, I don't want to say too much about it yet, for if I do, I'll {{have all sorts of}} curiosity seekers at my heels. If some folks knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> to do, they'd be crazy to be taken along." ...|$|E
6000|$|Westover {{could not}} deny the force of this. [...] "You'd be anxious if I didn't tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> I dare say, more than if I did." [...] He told him of Jeff's {{behavior}} with Alan Lynde, and of his talk with him about it. [...] "And I think he was honest. It was something that happened, that wasn't meant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> I saw I {{must come}} out of this, and preach the kingdom of God. That was my idea. I don't want to force it upon you, but I want you to {{understand}} why I acted as I did. But let me come to the particular thing that has happened to-day. I did not think when I made my final decision to leave the church that it meant such poverty as this we are living in--permanently. That is what I want to make clear to you. I thought there would be a temporary dip into dinginess, but that was all. There was a plan; at the time it seemed a right and reasonable plan; for setting up a chapel in London, a very plain and simple undenominational chapel, for the simple preaching of the world kingdom of God. There was some one who seemed prepared to meet all the immediate demands for such a chapel." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Asada {{launched}} her own kimono brand named MaoMao. In January 2012, Asada cancelled {{the release}} of a book on her skating career; she stated, [...] "The way the book was advertised was different from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind." ...|$|R
60|$|I am heartily {{pleased that}} you set so much store by the dedication. You may {{be sure that}} it does not make me the less anxious to take pains, and to work out well <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not taking}} chances," [...] he replied doggedly. [...] "You must {{remember}} that my face is not known here as yours is, and with <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my pocket who will dare put aught of hindrance in my way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a splendid}} scolding!" [...] the new visitor exclaimed when, on the {{entrance}} of the Pope's legate, her companion closed the book on the scene. Peter pressed his lips to Madame Carré's finger-tips; the old actress got up and held out her arms to Miriam. The girl never took her eyes off Sherringham while she passed into that lady's embrace and remained there. They were full of their usual sombre fire, and it was always the case that they expressed too much anything they could express at all; but they were not defiant nor even triumphant now--they were only deeply explicative. They seemed to say, [...] "That's the sort of thing I meant; that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when I asked you to try to do something for me." [...] Madame Carré folded her pupil to her bosom, holding her there as the old marquise in a comédie de moeurs might in the last scene have held her god-daughter the ingénue.|$|E
6000|$|The note of envy {{struck me}} sharply--horribly. Without waiting {{to listen to}} the comment of her {{companion}} I hurried out of the building into the cold, white sunlight that threw into bold relief the mediocre houses of the street. Here was everyday life, but the portrait had suggested that which might have been--might be yet. What did I mean by this? I didn't know, I didn't care to define it,--a renewal of her friendship, of our intimacy. My being cried out for it, and in the world in which I lived we took what we wanted--why not this? And yet for an instant I stood on the sidewalk to discover that in new situations I was still subject to unaccountable qualms of that thing I had been taught to call [...] "conscience"; whether it were conscience or not must be left to the psychologists. I was married--terrible word! the shadow of that Institution fell athwart me as the sun went under a cloud; but the sun came out again as I found myself walking toward the Durrett house reflecting that numbers of married men called on Nancy, and that <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> in regard to her was nothing that the court would have pronounced an infringement upon the Institution.... I reached her steps, the long steps still guarded by the curved wrought-iron railings reminiscent of Nathaniel's day, though the [...] "portals" [...] were gone, a modern vestibule having replaced them; I rang the bell; the butler, flung open the doors. He, at any rate, did not seem surprised to see me here, he greeted me with respectful cordiality and led me, as a favoured guest, through the big drawing-room into the salon.|$|E
50|$|Guitarist and songwriter, A.J. Novello, {{had this}} to say on the album:...it wasn't exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> (It) was a little too metallic. Eddie's vocals were drenched in effects (Suttons' {{critical}} comparison to Ozzy began here), the songs were more left-field, and we initially disappointed some fans.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are {{a sturdy}} lot, lad, no two ways about that,--and they {{understand}} {{just how to}} keep themselves in the pink of condition." [...] Luke rubbed his chin reflectively. [...] "Do ye know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} we ought to search 'em thoroughly?" [...] he asked. [...] "They may have {{something}} belonging to me--some map of the lost mine, or something like that? I don't exactly remember <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> that suit-case Merwell got from the porter on the train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can {{do better}} with the hound!" [...] he cried. [...] "Sink me {{if it is not}} a rare plan. Throw him into the sail-room with the irons on, and do you come here, quartermaster, that I may tell you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Holter cites Scott Walker's song, [...] "Duchess", {{as a key}} {{influence}} on the album, noting: [...] "Somehow that song captures what I {{was trying to do}} on a larger level: this warm, golden group of love songs. That was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> but in the end I don't think it comes across." ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{moved into}} the record industry. I was under the {{impression}} that in order to be alive and to be able to create <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> I had to become successful. I realised that success and pure creativity are not very compatible... Instead of being able to move forward freely and do what you really wish, you find yourself stuck and obliged to repeat yourself and your previous success.|$|E
5000|$|My {{first thought}} when Alessandro walked in {{was that he}} didn't look like <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> His {{presence}} was intense but gentle, not the [...] "I'm gonna attack you" [...] energy fans might associate with NIN. Then he started, and within 30 seconds I was like [...] "That's the guy!" [...] I never once regretted it. Without taking anything away from Charlie Clouser, Alessandro is really into playing the studio parts as much as humanly possible.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind is {{classroom}} {{where students}} could sit {{around a table}} with a teacher who would talk with them and instruct them by a sort of tutorial or conference method, where student would feel encouraged to speak up. This would be a real revolution in methods.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> ask <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am to {{call myself}} to-day, Herbert," [...] I went on, [...] "I suggest <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> my thoughts. You say I am lucky. <b>I</b> know <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{done nothing to}} raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now look here!' {{repeated}} Tom. 'Be {{sure you}} don't make any mistake then, and don't forget. I shall tell my sister {{as we go}} home, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> view, and she'll approve, I know. Now look here! You're all right, are you? You understand all about it? Very well then. Come along, Loo!' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, {{the sound}} {{engineer}} Guillermo Zuloaga {{asked him to}} produce his first solo CD which was edited {{at the end of}} 1994, called The Inner World of the Planets. It {{is considered to be a}} significant CD inside the world of the Stick. The inventor of the instrument Emmett Chapman wrote to Cides in a letter: [...] " ... you have made real <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when I designed this instrument [...] " [...] after listening to his first work.|$|E
5000|$|The imprint {{was founded}} {{and run by}} Carol Wilson, who had {{previously}} discovered Sting and signed him to Virgin's music publishing company. Talking about the signing of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark to Dindisc, she later said: [...] "OMD were a perfect fit for <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> for DinDisc [...] - [...] they had a serious, artistic side with real depth, {{as well as a}} commercial, pop side. That duality was reflected in all the early DinDisc signings, like Martha and the Muffins, and then the Monochrome Set." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{national}} touring of PAID DUES is a {{dream come}} true. It’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> when I first brought the idea to Guerilla Union--something like a Warped tour for underground hip-hop, where my friends and I could be outside in the daylight enjoying summer with our fans instead of cramped up in some dark smelly nightclub worried about staying up too late and being too tired for work the next morning,” states MURS. “It also provides a safe and comfortable {{environment in which the}} younger fans can be introduced to a proper live hip-hop show." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{confirmed}} in January 2011 that Guo {{has decided to}} retire, and she will not compete in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> fulfilled my task, so the London Games is not <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind now. The chances {{should be left to}} other talents in the team." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{collective}} view {{of families}} brings {{us closer to}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind with care dialogues. It both recognizes how a family’s social position and group membership might affect its interaction with an early education and care institution and it seeks to expand families’ agentic opportunities. From this empirical point I begin my theoretical elaboration of care dialogues.|$|R
40|$|First, I want to {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> mind in talking about {{management}} and science. A broad view of management is that it involves procedures to forecast, plan, analyse, decide, motivate, communicate, and implement. On the scientific side, my definition is limited: science is the use of objective and replicable procedures to compare different approaches...|$|R
