500|$|All four modules of the S-series were {{included}} {{as part of}} the Dungeons of Dread hardcover collection, released on March 19, 2013. Lawrence Schick wrote in the foreword: [...] "The dungeon of the demi-lich Acererak was, for Gary, a kind of thought experiment: If an undead sorcerer really wanted to keep his tomb from being plundered by greedy adventurers, how <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? The answer, of course, was to defend the crypt with tricks and traps designed not to challenge the intruders but to kill them dead. And furthermore, to do it in ways so horrific that all but the most determined party would give up and leave well enough alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would not}} give much for it were he {{restored}} a score of times,' said the Prioress. 'What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> but plunge deeper?' ...|$|E
60|$|Try as <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not feel}} as valiant as <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> when first <b>he</b> emerged {{at the head}} of his party from under the portico of the Cordeliers Club, and it was with none too steady a voice that he ordered the girl roughly back to the house. Then he turned once more to his men.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{then told}} the mate solemnly, that <b>he</b> might <b>do</b> what <b>he</b> pleased, but go aloft again he could not, and <b>would</b> not. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> any thing else but that.|$|R
60|$|Gladly <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> so, when <b>he</b> {{heard that}} the Danes were {{wintering}} in the Humber.|$|R
6000|$|... "You terrify me, Stephen," [...] said Sybil {{rising from}} her seat. [...] "What {{can happen to}} him? What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do,</b> what would you resist? Tell me--tell me, dear friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed; M. Gordeloup knew better. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> if I {{were shut}} up? And {{no one will}} ever shut you up, my dear. If I were you, I would give no one a chance." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{the youth}} reached home again, anyone {{can imagine what}} {{a state of mind}} he was in. He had gone out once to seek a place, he said, but never <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> such a thing again.|$|E
50|$|In 716, while a pestilence {{swept through}} Naples, Romuald II of Benevento {{occupied}} the castle of Cumae. Immediately, Pope Gregory II {{ordered him to}} return it and offered compensation if <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> not and John led an army against him in 717. As promised, the pope himself contributed 70 pounds of gold to the undertaking.|$|R
6000|$|... "No? There {{was nothing}} to make her. He could not give her his heart, try as <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> Why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> turn the {{unchangeable}} to hate! hate! hate!" ...|$|R
6000|$|CORNELIUS [remonstrating]. Father Dempsey is {{the priest}} of the parish, Mr Broadbent. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be <b>doing</b> with a theory? ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} {{that was the}} fault of my upbringing; and <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> me the justice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was unfortunately {{in my power to}} offer, and had stood up like a man? ...|$|E
6000|$|Some base {{streak of}} {{competitiveness}} in Mr. Britling's nature {{made it seem}} impossible that he should relinquish the lady to Oliver. Besides, then, what <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with his dull days, his afternoons, his need for a properly demonstrated affection? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And what <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> there, sahib? He {{would have}} no friends, none to care for him; and while his Mahratti tongue would be of great service to him, here, it would be useless to him in his own country.|$|E
60|$|Vainly Saxon waked for Billy to say {{something}} that <b>would</b> show <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not countenance {{the killing of the}} scabs.|$|R
6000|$|... “How {{much have}} you go on?” whispered Clovis. The other whispered the sum through dry, shaking lips. It {{was more than}} he or any one {{connected}} with him could pay; <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> what <b>he</b> had said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> had been rash.|$|R
60|$|Her clear {{brown eyes}} looked full {{at him as}} she spoke, and all the young {{population}} watched to see what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> hesitated a moment, then took up his cup and plate, {{and sat down in}} the window- seat.|$|R
6000|$|What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Marguerite at {{the thought}} instinctively pressed {{her hands to her}} heart, the agony of it all had become {{physically}} painful. She hoped that perhaps this pain meant approaching death! oh! how easy would this simple solution be! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fain <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so, but the Countess and {{her daughters}} are set on {{carrying}} out the sport. They have set Master Sniggius to indite the speeches, and the boys of the school are to take the parts for their autumn interlude." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{next time}} that Peter deniéd his Lord [...] 'Twas Earth in her agony waited his word, [...] But he {{sat by the}} fire and naught <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do,</b> [...] Though the cock crew--though the cock crew-- [...] Over all Christendom, though the cock crew.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sam, do {{you really}} think it can be the fellow who robbed Songbird?" [...] demanded Dick. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be <b>doing</b> away out here?" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the first}} I knew that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> yield, but <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{it with an}} ill grace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, dear Cecil," [...] said Rosamond, {{with great}} difficulty. [...] "I know you would, and so <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> for you, only the cruel fever kept you apart." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{his face}} only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And {{yet she was}} fascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this spell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to submit, she wanted to know. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ye {{showed little}} sense," [...] said Mackay; while Haldane glanced curiously at me. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with a horse in two foot of snow? There are points I'm no' clear about; but there'll {{be time for}} {{questions}} later. Ah! Found ye anything, Trooper Cotton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Tom, father didn't wish it," [...] said Maggie, her {{anxiety about}} his feeling helping her to master her agitation. What <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> {{when she told}} him all? [...] "But mother wants you to come,--poor mother!--she cries so. Oh, Tom, it's very dreadful at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will fulfil it, sir, I am sure he will," [...] Miss Newcome said, in a haughty manner. [...] "He {{would do}} as much without being asked, I am certain <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> know the depth of my dear uncle's misfortune. Barnes is in London now, and----" ...|$|R
60|$|Jack {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{be very much}} obliged, if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a sort}} of {{dishonesty}} in his kindness. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not let {{you have}} the bitter truth. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not say <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not love you....|$|R
6000|$|All {{the little}} meadow people {{gathered}} around the hole where Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox had disappeared. They were very anxious, very anxious indeed. Would Reddy Fox catch Johnny Chuck? And what <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to him? Was all their fun to end in something terrible to sunny-hearted, merry Johnny Chuck, whom everybody loved? ...|$|E
60|$|Lenore again saw {{his eyes}} dim. How strangely {{sensitive}} he was! If he exaggerated {{such a little}} kindness as she had suggested, if he responded to it with such emotion, what <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> when the great and marvelous truth of her love was flung in his face? The very thought made Lenore weak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here he has sat {{for seven}} years. Oh, why <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? I begged him, I implored him, I went {{on my knees}} to him, {{but he would have}} his way. You see the key on the table. He had locked the door upon the inside. And he has written something. We must take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, no, I believe I'm not. I haven't {{the least}} idea <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> {{belongs to the}} church militant. He came to me with the model of a breech-loading cannon he's invented, and he wanted a {{passport}} to go to America, {{so that he might}} offer his cannon to our government." ...|$|R
60|$|We all {{waited to}} see what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> to hear what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, next.|$|R
50|$|Just as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>done</b> unto.|$|R
