5000|$|A person upon first {{seeing a}} ball bonder will usually compare its {{operation}} {{to that of}} a sewing machine. In fact there is a needle-like disposable tool called the capillary, through which the wire is fed. A high-voltage electric charge is applied to the wire. This melts the wire {{at the tip of the}} capillary. The tip of the wire forms into a ball because of the surface tension of the molten metal.The ball quickly solidifies, and the capillary is lowered to the surface of the chip, which is typically heated to at least 125°C. The machine then pushes down on the capillary and applies ultrasonic energy with an attached transducer. The combined heat, pressure, and ultrasonic energy create a weld between the copper or gold ball and the surface of the chip - which is usually copper or aluminum. This is the so-called ball bond that gives the process its name. (All-aluminum systems in semiconductor fabrication eliminate the [...] "purple plague" [...] - a brittle gold-aluminum intermetallic compound - sometimes associated with pure gold bonding wire. This property makes aluminum ideal for ultrasonic bonding.) Next the wire is passed out through the capillary and the machine moves over a few millimeters to the location that the chip needs to be wired up to (usually called the leadframe). The machine again descends to the surface, this time without making a ball so that the wire is crushed between the leadframe and the tip of the capillary. This time the surface is usually gold, palladium, or silver - but the weld is made in the same way. The resulting weld is quite different in appearance from the ball bond, and is referred to as the <b>wedge</b> <b>bond,</b> tail bond, or simply as the second bond.|$|E

40|$|Wire bonding is {{a widely}} used {{interconnection}} technology in electronic packaging. Due to the advantages of fast bonding process, high productivity, good electrical and thermal performance, Au wire bonding has been widely applied to various electronic packaging applications, such as Multi chip module (MCM), B all grid array (BGA) and Chip-on-board (COB). The organic substrates for Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) have a low glass transitional temperature, Tg, typically 130 °C. This imposes limitations on the wire bonding process because wire bonding must be performed at temperatures far below the Tgof the substrate to avoid softening of the materials. Meanwhile, a substrate with a high Tg incurs additional cost arising from material and fabrication processes. The objective of this thesis is to optimize metallization and process variables to enhance wire bondability and product yields of low temperature Au wedge thermosonic bonding. The wire bond strength with various metallization characteristics were correlated to establish the process window for successful low temperature wire bonding. The technological understanding acquired in this thesis {{can be used as}} a practical guideline for PCB metallization plating and processing conditions. The research was carried out in four stages. The first stage examined the surface characteristics of various metallization schemes on conventional FR- 4 PCBs. The second stage investigated the interrelation between the metallization characteristics and the wire bonding process variables. The third stage studied the improvement in wire bonding by plasma cleaning. The last stage was a study of high temperature wire bonding on Bismaleimide triazine (BT) substrate. Based on the bond tests and process windows established, optimizing bonding parameters for acceptable wire bond strengths at low temperatures were identified. Specific recommendations were made on the optimum surface and elemental characteristics of metallization that can improve wire bondability.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is on {{improving}} the understanding of mechanical and tribological mechanisms in microelectronic wire bonding. In particular, it focusses on the development and application of quantitative models of ultrasonic (US) friction and interfacial wear in wire bonding. Another objective of the thesis {{is to develop a}} low-stress Cu ball bonding process that minimizes damage to the microchip. These are accomplished through experimental measurements of in situ US tangential force by piezoresistive microsensors integrated next to the bonding zone using standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The processes investigated are thermosonic (TS) Au ball bonding on Al pads (Au-Al process), TS Cu ball bonding on Al pads (Cu-Al process), and US Al wedge-wedge bonding on Al pads (Al-Al process). TS ball bonding processes are optimized with one Au and two Cu wire types, obtaining average shear strength (SS) of more than 120 MPa. Ball bonds made with Cu wire show at least 15 % higher SS than those made with Au wire. However, 30 % higher US force induced to the bonding pad is measured for the Cu process using the microsensor, which increases the risk of underpad damage. The US force can be reduced by: (i) using a Cu wire type that produces softer deformed ball results in a measured US force reduction of 5 %; and (ii) reducing the US level to 0. 9 times the conventionally optimized level, the US force can be reduced by 9 %. It is shown that using a softer Cu deformed ball and a reduced US level reduces the extra stress observed with Cu wire compared to Au wire by 42 %. To study the combined effect of bond force (BF) and US in Cu ball bonding, the US parameter is optimized for eight levels of BF. For ball bonds made with conventionally optimized BF and US settings, the SS is ≈ 140 MPa. The amount of Al pad splash extruding out of bonded ball interface (for conventionally optimized BF and US settings) is between 10 – 12 µm. It can be reduced to 3 – 7 µm if accepting a SS reduction to 50 – 70 MPa. For excessive US settings, elliptical shaped Cu bonded balls are observed, with the major axis perpendicular to the US direction. By using a lower value of BF combined with a reduced US level, the US force can be reduced by 30 % while achieving an average SS of at least 120 MPa. These process settings also aid in reducing the amount of splash by 4. 3 µm. The US force measurement is like a signature of the bond as it allows for detailed insight into the tribological mechanisms during the bonding process. The relative amount of the third harmonic of US force in the Cu-Al process is found to be five times smaller than in the Au-Al process. In contrast, in the Al-Al process, a large second harmonic content is observed, describing a non-symmetric deviation of the force signal waveform from the sinusoidal shape. This deviation might be due to the reduced geometrical symmetry of the wedge tool. The analysis of harmonics of the US force indicates that although slightly different from each other, stick-slip friction is an important mechanism in all these wire bonding variants. A friction power theory is used to derive the US friction power during Au-Al, Cu-Al, and Al-Al processes. Auxiliary measurements include the current delivered to the US transducer, the vibration amplitude of the bonding tool tip in free-air, and the US tangential force acting on the bonding pad. For bonds made with typical process parameters, several characteristic values used in the friction power model such as the ultrasonic compliance of the bonding system and the profile of the relative interfacial sliding amplitude are determined. The maximum interfacial friction power during Al-Al process is at least 11. 5 mW (3. 9 W/mm²), which is only about 4. 8 % of the total electrical power delivered to the US transducer. The total sliding friction energy delivered to the Al-Al <b>wedge</b> <b>bond</b> is 60. 4 mJ (20. 4 J/mm²). For the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, the US friction power is derived with an improved, more accurate method to derive the US compliance. The method uses a multi-step bonding process. In the first two steps, the US current is set to levels that are low enough to prevent sliding. Sliding and bonding take place during the third step, when the current is ramped up to the optimum value. The US compliance values are derived from the first two steps. The average maximum interfacial friction power is 10. 3 mW (10. 8 W/mm²) and 16. 9 mW (18. 7 W/mm²) for the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, respectively. The total sliding friction energy delivered to the bond is 48. 5 mJ (50. 3 J/mm²) and 49. 4 mJ (54. 8 J/mm²) for the Au-Al and Cu-Al processes, respectively. Finally, the sliding wear theory is used to derive the amount of interfacial wear during Au-Al and Cu-Al processes. The method uses the US force and the derived interfacial sliding amplitude as the main inputs. The estimated total average depth of interfacial wear in Au-Al and Cu-Al processes is 416 nm and 895 nm, respectively. However, the error of estimation of wear in both the Au-Al and the Cu-Al processes is ≈ 50 %, making this method less accurate than the friction power and energy results. Given the error in the determination of compliance in the Al-Al process, the error in the estimation of wear in the Al-Al process might have been even larger; hence the wear results pertaining to the Al-Al process are not discussed in this study...|$|E
