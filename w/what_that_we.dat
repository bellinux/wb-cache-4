Every single {{thing that ever happened to}} me that mattered, in some way, had to do with her. That day, Winnie and I promised each other that no matter <b>what,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will always be together. It was a promise full of passion, truth and wisdom. It was the kind of promise that can only come from the hearts of the very young.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{adopting}} a diffractive methodology, as Barad does drawing on Haraway’s lesson, implies a profound rethinking of Western ontology and epistemology (ibid.: 83) because it replaces the analogical methodology, which consists in relating two separate entities {{by way of}} an external observer, with a methodology that shows how “practices of knowing are material engagements that participate in (re)configuring the world” (ibid.: 91). Producing differences is what establishes connections rather than reinforcing distinctions: As Haraway writes, “diffraction patterns are about a heterogeneous history, not originals” (Haraway 2000 : 101). A representation is not a sign that mirrors a separate external referent; it is rather a diffractive practice that reveals the coemergence and the co-implication of both meaning and matter. Agency is redefined as precisely “a matter of intra-acting,” from which the “agential realism” {{at the core of}} Barad’s philosophy is derived: since “intra-actions are constraining but not determinate,” (my italics) intra-acting neither belongs to a completely free subjectivity nor to a fully determined reality, but rather happens in a material-semiotic field where “particular possibilities for acting exist at every moment, and these changing possibilities entail a responsibility to intervene in the world’s becoming, to contest and rework what matters and what is excluded from mattering” (Barad 2003 : 826 – 827). Talking about constraining intra-actions {{brings us back to the}} idea of consistency theorized by Hayles, according to which, as we have seen, constraints are what enable us to select among viable, that is, consistent, rather than congruent representations, shifting representations from <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could see to the “interaction with reality [that] we see when we see” (see above).|$|E

All the designs specification considered after analyzing the problems from the handicapped person. Comfort of the person in the tri-wheeler is an important and we have given importance to it. The main content of the tri-wheeler is Solar PV panel, Brushless PMDC motor, Charge controller and battery. In this project we have discuss about the main idea of this project and to get a larger picture on what is the problem in the current technologies, <b>what</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> want to achieve in this project and the area that will cover on this project. This project is divided into some categories that are project background to describe the reasons to do this project, problem statement to inform about the problem or weakness of the existing technology, objective to make sure what actually this project must achieve and scope of this project to specify what will be used in this project. In automobile sector, the need for alternative fuel as a replacement of conventional fossil fuel, due to its depletion and amount of emission has given way for new technologies like Electric vehicles. Still a lot of advancement has to take place in these technologies for commercialization. The gap between the current fossil fuel technology and zero emission vehicles can be bridged by this technology. The electrical power is used to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle, better performance and it cause less pollution. Driving mode selectivity improves this system more economical, stable and more efficien...|$|E
