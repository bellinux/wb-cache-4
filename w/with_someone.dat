5|$|Benny was {{a tricky}} one because he doesn't speak English very well. I ended up kind of using his cousin Allessandro as an interpreter. It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and you know when things are working and when they’re not. When you're working <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E
