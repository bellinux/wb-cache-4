5|$|In Cesena in 1502, Leonardo {{entered the}} service of Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope Alexander VI, acting as a {{military}} architect and engineer and travelling throughout Italy with his patron. Leonardo created a map of Cesare Borgia's stronghold, a town plan of Imola {{in order to win}} his patronage. Maps were extremely rare at the time and it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> like a new concept. Upon seeing it, Cesare hired Leonardo as his chief military engineer and architect. Later in the year, Leonardo produced another map for his patron, one of Chiana Valley, Tuscany, so as to give his patron a better overlay of the land and greater strategic position. He created this map in conjunction with his other project of constructing a dam from the sea to Florence, in order to allow a supply of water to sustain the canal during all seasons.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that the mysteries developed after Isis's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself, later in the third century BCE. Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies, poems in praise of the goddess. The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros, both from the first century BCE, closely links Isis with mystery rites. Petra Pakkanen says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time, but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries, not with distinctive rites of her own. Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis {{is found in the}} first century CE, and they certainly existed in the second. Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt. They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites, and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well, to reflect Egyptian mythology. The end product <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries. Many Greco-Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 9th century, England was almost completely {{under the control of the}} Anglo-Saxons, with Mercia and Wessex the most important southern kingdoms. Mercia was dominant until the 820s, and it exercised overlordship over East Anglia and Kent, but Wessex was able to maintain its independence from its more powerful neighbour. Offa, King of Mercia from 757 to 796, was the dominant figure of the second half of the 8th century. King Beorhtric of Wessex (786–802), married Offa's daughter in 789. Beorhtric and Offa drove Æthelwulf's father Egbert into exile, and he spent several years at the court of Charlemagne in Francia. Egbert was the son of Ealhmund, who had briefly been King of Kent in 784. Following Offa's death, King Coenwulf of Mercia (796–821) maintained Mercian dominance, but it is uncertain whether Beorhtric ever accepted political subordination, and when he died in 802 Egbert became king, perhaps with the support of Charlemagne. For two hundred years three kindreds had fought for the West Saxon throne, and no son had followed his father as king. Egbert's best claim was that he was the great-great-grandson of Ingild, brother of King Ine (688–726), and in 802 it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> very unlikely that he would establish a lasting dynasty.|$|E

25|$|Adolf Hitler {{decided to}} visit Finland on 4 June 1942, ostensibly to congratulate Mannerheim on his 75th birthday.

25|$|In {{favour of}} Waldheim is, {{that he only}} had very minor {{possibilities}} to act against the injustices happening. Actions against these, depending on which level the resistance occurred, were of very different importance. For a young member of the staff, {{who did not have}} any military authority on the army group level, the practical possibilities for resistance were very limited and with a high probability would not have led to any actual results. Resistance would have been limited to a formal protest or on the refusal to serve any longer in the army, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> to be a courageous act, however would have not led to any practical achievement.|$|E
25|$|Diversified {{instruments}} or rituals used {{in medieval}} magic include, {{but are not}} limited to: various amulets, talismans, potions, as well as specific chants, dances, prayers. Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence of them. The idea that magic was devised, taught, and worked by demons <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the Sefer-ha-Razim and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people, gaining wealth, or personal advantage, and coercing women into sexual submission. Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home, on the body and in monastic and church settings.|$|E

Within two weeks of his arrival he hired Ossett Town Hall and staged a concert, which included a freshly-written sketch about his feet, which had been suffering in his army boots. After basic training {{he was promoted to}} the rank of corporal and he applied for a commission. He was turned down because training had caused a duodenal ulcer, and his hearing was still problematic; as a result he was downgraded from A1 to B1 fitness at the start of 1943.|$|E

[...] She also commented that without the witty banter of hosts Hogan and Chase, [...] "The show <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> notably lacking in luster." [...] Television editor Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register commented, [...] "Monday night's 59th installment was very nearly everything you could have wished it to be: quite entertaining, relatively fast-moving, unusually short on tastelessness and tackiness drenched in nostalgia, and featuring enough superbly chosen film clips for a monster round of Visual Trivial Pursuit.|$|E
500|$|Inglis {{notes that}} almost every account of the {{significance}} of Sgt. Pepper emphasizes the cover's [...] "unprecedented correspondence between music and art, time and space". After its release, album sleeves were no longer [...] "a superfluous thing to be discarded during the act of listening, but an integral component of the listening that expanded the musical experience." [...] The cover helped to elevate album art as a respected topic for critical analysis whereby the [...] "structures and cultures of popular music" [...] could henceforth justify intellectual discourse in a way that – before Sgt. Pepper – <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> like [...] "fanciful conceit". He writes: Sgt. Pepper [...] "cover has been regarded as groundbreaking in its visual and aesthetic properties, congratulated for its innovative and imaginative design, credited with providing an early impetus for the expansion of the graphic design industry into popular music, and perceived as largely responsible for the connections between art and pop to be made explicit." [...] Riley describes it as [...] "one of the best-known works that pop art ever produced". In the late 1990s, the BBC included it in its list of British masterpieces of twentieth-century art and design. In 2008, the iconic bass drum skin used on the front cover sold at auction for €670,000.|$|E

500|$|Meilhac and Halévy were {{a long-standing}} duo with an {{established}} division of labour: Meilhac, who was completely unmusical, wrote the dialogue and Halévy the verses. There {{is no clear}} indication of when work began on Carmen. Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating {{to the beginning of}} the collaboration. The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of opéra comique, with dialogue separating musical numbers. It deviates from Mérimée's novella in a number of significant respects. In the original, events are spread over a much longer period of time, and much of the main story is narrated by José from his prison cell, as he awaits execution for Carmen's murder. Micaëla does not feature in Mérimée's version, and the Escamillo character is peripheral—a picador named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen's grand passion. Carmen has a husband called Garcia, whom José kills during a quarrel. In the novella, Carmen and José are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera; Bizet's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that Mérimée's Carmen, on stage, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>seemed</b> [...] "an unmitigated and unconvincing monster, had her character not been simplified and deepened".|$|E
