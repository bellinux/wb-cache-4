As one remarkable instance we have the Leyden jar; and after the splendid experiments of Faraday in complete and final establishment of the substantial identity of magnetism and electricity, we may cite the magnet, both the natural and the electro-magnet, in neither of which it is possible to produce one kind of electricity by itself, or to charge one pole without charging an opposite pole with the contrary electricity at the same time. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a magnet with one pole: if we break a natural loadstone into a thousand pieces, each piece will have its two oppositely electrified poles complete within itself.

60|$|But {{though we}} have always a {{propensity}} to generalize from unvarying experience, we are not always warranted in doing so. Before we can be at liberty to conclude that something is universally true because we have never known an instance to the contrary, we must {{have reason to believe}} that if there were in nature any instances to the contrary, we should have known of them. This assurance, in the great majority of cases, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have,</b> or can have only in a very moderate degree. The possibility of having it, is the foundation on which we shall see hereafter that induction by simple enumeration may in some remarkable cases amount practically to proof.(111) No such assurance, however, can be had, on any of the ordinary subjects of scientific inquiry. Popular notions are usually founded on induction by simple enumeration; in science it carries us but a little way. We are forced to begin with it; we must often rely on it provisionally, in the absence of means of more searching investigation. But, for the accurate study of nature, we require a surer and a more potent instrument.|$|E
60|$|The {{prevailing}} {{hypothesis of}} a luminiferous ether, {{in other respects}} not without analogy to that of Descartes, is not in its own nature entirely {{cut off from the}} possibility of direct evidence in its favor. It is well known that the difference between the calculated and the observed times of the periodical return of Encke’s comet, has led to a conjecture that a medium capable of opposing resistance to motion is diffused through space. If this surmise should be confirmed, in the course of ages, by the gradual accumulation of a similar variance {{in the case of the}} other bodies of the solar system, the luminiferous ether would have made a considerable advance toward the character of a vera causa, since the existence would have been ascertained of a great cosmical agent, possessing some of the attributes which the hypothesis assumes; though there would still remain many difficulties, and the identification of the ether with the resisting medium would even, I imagine, give rise to new ones. At present, however, this supposition can not be looked upon as more than a conjecture; the existence of the ether still rests on the possibility of deducing from its assumed laws a considerable number of actual phenomena; and this evidence I can not regard as conclusive, because <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have,</b> in the case of such an hypothesis, the assurance that if the hypothesis be false it must lead to results at variance with the true facts.|$|E
6000|$|Let us now, for {{the more}} full {{understanding}} of the subject, {{go to the other}} extreme, and consider a case in which the management is as far as possible removed from that above referred to. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> a better example than the method often adopted in schools and seminaries for teaching composition; in other words, the art of expressing one's thoughts in written language--an art which one would suppose to be so analogous to that of learning to talk--that is, to express one's thoughts in oral language--that the method which was found so eminently successful in the one would be naturally resorted to in the other. Instead of that, the method often pursued is exactly the reverse. The pupil having with infinite difficulty, and with many forebodings and anxious fears, made his first attempt, brings it to his teacher. The teacher, if he is a kind-hearted and considerate man, perhaps briefly commends the effort with some such dubious and equivocal praise as it is [...] "Very well for a beginner," [...] or [...] "As good a composition as could be expected at the first attempt," [...] and then proceeds to go over the exercise in a cool and deliberate manner, with a view of discovering and bringing out clearly and conspicuously to the view, not only of the little author himself, but often of all his classmates and friends, every imperfection, failure, mistake, omission, or other fault which a rigid scrutiny can detect in the performance. However kindly he may do this, and however gentle the tones of his voice, still the work is criticism and fault-finding from beginning to end. The boy sits on thorns and nettles while submitting to the operation, and when he takes his marked and corrected manuscript to his seat, he feels mortified and ashamed, and is often hopelessly discouraged.|$|E

60|$|The {{preceding}} argument, which is, {{to my mind}} unanswerable, merges, however, in a {{still more}} comprehensive one, which is stated most clearly and conclusively by Professor Bain. The psychological reason why axioms, and indeed many propositions not ordinarily classed as such, may {{be learned from the}} idea only without referring to the fact, is that in the process of acquiring the idea we have learned the fact. The proposition is assented to as soon as the terms are understood, because in learning to understand the terms we have acquired the experience which proves the proposition to be true. “We required,” says Mr. Bain,(74) “concrete experience in the first instance, to attain to the notion of whole and part; but the notion, once arrived at, implies that the whole is greater. In fact, we could not have the notion without an experience tantamount to this conclusion.... When we have mastered the notion of straightness, we have also mastered that aspect of it expressed by the affirmation that two straight lines can not inclose a space. No intuitive or innate powers or perceptions are needed in such case.... <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the full meaning of Straightness, without going through a comparison of straight objects among themselves, and with their opposites, bent or crooked objects. The result of this comparison is, inter alia, that straightness in two lines is seen to be incompatible with inclosing a space; the inclosure of space involves crookedness in {{at least one of the}} lines.” And similarly, in the case of every first principle,(75) “the same knowledge that makes it understood, suffices to verify it.” The more this observation is considered the more (I am convinced) it will be felt to go to the very root of the controversy.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing {{question}} {{in the theory of}} rational points of algebraic surfaces is whether a K 3 surface X over a number field K acquires a Zariski-dense set of L-rational points over some finite extension L/K. In this case, we say X has potential density of rational points. In case XC has Picard rank greater than 1, Bogomolov and Tschinkel [2] have shown in many cases that X has potential density of rational points, using the existence of elliptic fibrations on X or large automorphism groups of X. By contrast, we do not know a single example of a K 3 surface X/K with geometric Picard number 1 which can be shown to have potential density of rational points; nor is there an example which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> show <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> potential density of rational points. In fact, the situation is even worse; the moduli space of polarized K 3 surfaces of a given degree contains a countable union of subvarieties, each parametrizing a family of K 3 surfaces with geometric Picard number greater than 1. Since Q ̄ is countable, it is not a priori obvious that these subvarieties don’t cover the Q̄-points of the moduli space. In other words, it is a non-trivial fact that there exists a K 3 surface over any number field with geometric Picard number 1 ! In this note, we correct this slightly embarrassing situation by proving the following theorem: Theorem 1. Let d be an even positive integer. Then there exists a number field K and a polarize...|$|R
