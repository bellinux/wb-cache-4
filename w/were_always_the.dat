25|$|During the 1850s, {{the cost}} of the Transactions to the Society was {{increasing}} again (and would keep doing so {{for the rest of the}} century); illustrations <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> largest outgoing. Illustrations had been a natural and essential aspect of the scientific periodical since the later seventeenth century. Engravings (cut into metal plates) were used for detailed illustrations, particularly where realism was required; while wood-cuts (and, from the early nineteenth century, wood-engravings) were used for diagrams, as they could be easily combined with letterpress.|$|E

Manuel II was king and {{maintained}} it against the African rebels in our dominions of Magul, Coolela, Cuamato and many other battles that illustrate our Portuguese army...When in 1910, Portugal abandoned the Blue and White, Portugal abandoned its history! And the people that abandoned their history are those people who fall and die.|$|E

25|$|During sea trials, the {{submarine}} was often forced back to port because of equipment problems, where the Navy personnel found that ASC engineers would diagnose and repair systems {{using a combination}} of supplier data and diagnostic tools not available to the sailors. Problems with the training were compounded by an attitude from ASC that problems <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> fault of the Navy operators. However, most were the result of equipment failure, and the problems caused by operator error could be attributed to poor training or a lack of training, both of which were the responsibility of ASC.|$|E
25|$|The Hall of Fame for Great Americans {{is largely}} forgotten. For two decades before 1997, in fact, it lacked {{the funds to}} hold new {{elections}} or to commission busts of the people it elected, including Louis Brandeis, Clara Barton, Luther Burbank, and Andrew Carnegie. It took nineteen years to raise the $25,000 needed to commission the bust of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In the late 1970s the state spent $3 million restoring the colonnade's crumbling foundation; more recently, it spent another $200,000 to restore the 98 bronze busts, many of which had deteriorated badly. By that time private gifts, which <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> Hall of Fame's primary source of support, had effectively ceased.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{sense of}} {{achievement}} when the agreement was finally signed and technicians employed by the CDF got down to the task of making the mechanism operational. In an interview, CDF Chief Executive Officer Ambassador Lorne McDonnough said “The CDF start-up team was always confident it would meet the projected launch date....” Despite this confidence he admitted that “...along the way there <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> glitches and frustrating delays that called for an extra dose of perseverance as well as the need to step back and revisit the problem with a fresh resolve”. Ambassador McDonnough noted that heightened expectations and the desire to see the CDF operational in the shortest possible time, meant that Member States sometimes underestimated the work which had to be done to make the CDF ready for full operations.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} NIMH {{accepted}} the grant proposal, in late May 1971, Susan Curtiss began {{her work on}} Genie's case {{as a graduate student}} in linguistics under Victoria Fromkin, and for the remainder of Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with Genie almost every day. Curtiss quickly recognized Genie's powerful nonverbal communication abilities, writing that complete strangers would frequently buy something for her because they sensed she wanted it and that these gifts <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> types of objects she most enjoyed. Curtiss concluded that Genie had learned a significant amount of language but that it was not yet at a usefully testable level, so she decided to dedicate the next few months to getting to know Genie and gaining her friendship. Over the following month, she and Genie very quickly bonded with each other.|$|E
25|$|His {{libraries}} served {{not only}} as free circulating collections of books, magazines and newspapers, but also provided classrooms for growing school districts, Red Cross stations, and public meeting spaces, not to mention permanent jobs for the graduates of newly formed library schools. Academic libraries were built for 108 colleges. Usually there was no charge to read or borrow; in New Zealand, however, local taxes were too low to support libraries and most charged subscription fees to their users. The arrangements <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same: Carnegie would provide the funds for the building but only after the municipal government had provided a site for the building and had passed an ordinance {{for the purchase of}} books and future maintenance of the library through taxation. This policy was in accord with Carnegie's philosophy that the dispensation of wealth for the benefit of society must never be in the form of free charity but rather must be as a buttress to the community's responsibility for its own welfare.|$|E
25|$|Minorities in {{the city}} {{included}} Sephardic Jews and Muslims (not only the Moors but also Arabs and Islamised Arabic-speaking Latinos). There was a large Jewish quarter occupying the parishes of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Julian and St. Nicholas along the Rua Nova dos Mercadores, where the Great Synagogue was located. The Jews (perhaps 10% of the population, or even more) were great traders, who took full advantage of connections to their coreligionists throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. Those who did not engage in trade were largely scholars or professionals such as doctors, lawyers, cartographers and other specialists in the sciences or arts. The Jewish community's business activities were fundamental to {{the vitality of the}} city's economy. The Jews of Lisbon included such distinguished families as the Abravanels, descendants of Samuel Abravanel, a converso who had served as royal treasurer in Andalusia and comptroller in Castile. He apparently fled to Portugal with his family where they reverted to Judaism and later served in high governmental positions. No matter how eminent a social position individual Jews of Lisbon might attain, however, they <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> first victims of popular revolts. Their living quarters were segregated from those {{of the rest of the}} population and they were forbidden to go out at night; as well as being forced to wear distinctive clothes and to pay extra taxes.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} of Roman emperors was especially {{at risk from}} being usurped by their legion commanders (see the imperial crisis of the 3rd century). Several of these agitators came from Britannia. In order to muster enough soldiers for their march on Rome, they reduced their British garrisons in every case far below the level needed for them to mount a credible defence. The forts in the west <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> first {{to have to give}} up their garrisons because this region was regarded as unimportant due to its remoteness and minor economic significance. Even the advance on Scotland under Antoninus Pius resulted in a substantial reduction of troops in Wales. Only a few forts like Segontium on the northwest coast remained occupied to keep the Celtic tribes living there under control. In the early third century, the Legio II Augusta returned to Caerleon after a prolonged campaign; despite that, the number of Roman troops in Wales remained very low. In the late third century, the local coastline was increasingly threatened by Irish and Scots bandits whose pirate ships operated mostly in the Bristol Channel, the seaway between the southwest peninsula of England and southern Wales. From there, they advanced into the richest regions of Britain, the Cotswolds and Wiltshire. For their defence, a new camp was built in Cardiff and other existing forts were repaired. Nevertheless, the border here became more and more porous since the decimated defending troops could no longer drive off the Irish settlers in the coastal regions.|$|E

500|$|Atchison {{started his}} {{screenplay}} in 1999, {{when he wrote}} a five-page treatment in about a month. In addition to the fact {{he was working on}} other projects, Atchison said he waited years before starting to write because he [...] "thought someone else would do it first." [...] This did not happen, so he began to write by himself. Few changes were made in the process of transitioning from the original draft to the final product. One change was that at first, Akeelah's mother had a smaller role and Akeelah's father was alive. Also, Larabee had been an older man (72 years old), and a few characters were cut. However, Atchison has summarized that [...] "the steps she goes through, the friends she's got, those <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> same." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of their career, the band's sound has also been {{described}} as alternative metal, sludge metal, doom metal, drone rock, hard rock, and alternative rock. Regarding the band's constant categorization by the media, Cantrell stated [...] "When we first came out we were metal. Then we started being called alternative metal. Then grunge came out and then we were hard rock. And now, since we've started doing this again I've seen us listed as: hard rock, alternative, alternative metal and just straight metal. I walked into an HMV the other day to check out the placement and see what's on and they've got us relegated back into the metal section. Right back where we started!". Drummer Sean Kinney rejects the grunge label, stating in a 2013 interview [...] "I mean, before we first came out there was no grunge, they hadn’t invented that word. Before they invented the word grunge we were alternative rock and alternative metal and metal and rock, and we didn’t give a shit whatever, we were a rock and roll band!". According to Mike Inez, they <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> metal stepchildren of the Seattle scene.|$|E
500|$|Alone {{amongst the}} Ikuntji artists, Daisy Jugadai worked at an easel. She cited the Hermannsburg School, {{a group of}} Indigenous artists {{including}} Albert Namatjira who began painting at Hermannsburg Mission in the 1930s, as an influence on her work. Memory and Five Mile Creek (1995) represents the country of her childhood. It shows the hills of the region in elevation rather than in plan, and represents the range of vegetation typical of that country. Curator Marina Strocchi notes how Daisy Jugadai's painting reflects close observation of the complex structures of the vegetation and environment, its features [...] "obsessively detailed", with the artist [...] "devotedly [...] all the bush tucker of that area", as well as choosing [...] "a time of year in which to depict her country". Vegetation would be carefully painted with a trimmed brush, while even finer detail, such as pollen, would be rendered using a matchstick. Clouds <b>were</b> <b>always</b> <b>the</b> final features to be included. Despite this devotion to detail, Daisy preferred to paint large canvasses. Memory and Five Mile Creek {{was included in the}} National Gallery of Victoria's 2004–05 exhibition [...] "Aboriginal Art Post 1984" [...] and reviewer Miriam Cosic, while noting its [...] "naive charm", also drew attention to the work's title and the implication that, like other more explicitly political painters of her era, [...] "she too is talking of violent dispossession".|$|E

2500|$|Sheridan's raid to Trevilian Station {{and back}} to the Army of the Potomac {{achieved}} mixed results. He successfully diverted Confederate attention from Grant's crossing of the James, but was unsuccessful in his objective of cutting the Virginia Central Railroad, a critical supply line to the Confederate capital and Lee's army. He also suffered relatively heavy casualties—particularly in his officer corps—and lost a large number of his horses to battle and heat exhaustion. And yet Sheridan claimed his raid was an undeniable victory.
