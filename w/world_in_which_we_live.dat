The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think.|$|E

Teiser's point, says Keischnick, is that historically and perhaps even among most Buddhists today, Buddhism was not a practical guide but a [...] "framework for understanding and negotiating a cosmos that extends far beyond the visible <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> and far beyond the present, to include future and past lives as gods, ghosts, hell beings, and animals, as well as humans." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{publication}} in 1961, Catch-22 became very popular among teenagers at the time. [...] Catch-22 seemed {{to embody the}} feelings that young people had toward the Vietnam War. A common joke was that every student who went off to college at the time took along a copy of Catch-22. The popularity of the book created a cult following, which led to more than eight million copies being sold in the United States.

2500|$|Dershowitz {{is one of}} {{a number}} of {{scholars}} at Harvard Law School who have expressed their support for limited animal rights. In his Rights from Wrongs: A Secular Theory of the Origins of Rights (2004), he writes that, in order to avoid human beings treating each other the way we treat animals, we have made what he calls the [...] "somewhat arbitrary decision" [...] to single out our own species for different and better treatment. [...] "Does this subject us to the charge of speciesism? Of course it does, and we cannot justify it, except by the fact that in the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live,</b> humans make the rules. That reality imposes on us a special responsibility to be fair and compassionate to those on whom we impose our rules. Hence the argument for animal rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over time, Qasimov's style had {{developed}} to {{include not only}} traditional Azerbaijani music and mugham, but also ashiq, a rural bardic tradition with roots in Turkey, Azerbaijan and the Azeri region of Iran. In addition, he was influenced by artists from other disciplines, placing particular importance on Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan: [...] "When I heard him in concert many doors were opened for me and many questions answered". His success {{was all the more}} impressive for he had broken from the traditional style of mugham and brought his own interpretation to the genre. He saw this as a way of showing mugham to a wider audience and making it relevant to contemporary society, saying: [...] "The <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> changes daily. Music has to lend emotional expression to this vitality. I accommodate that by seeking out new paths and interpretations". Similarly he revolutionised the strict mugham instrumentation, introducing his own improvisation and including new sounds such as the double-reeded balaban (also known as a duduk), the clarinet and the nagara, a metal-bodied drum. Additionally, he remained conscious of the need to modernise when choosing his ensemble; mixing older, experienced players with younger, more dynamic musicians.|$|E

2500|$|Kittredge's {{administrative}} power, vast erudition, prestige, and the histrionic attitude {{he assumed}} with undergraduates provoked resentment. A notable critic was his colleague, Irving Babbitt (a professor of French) and Babbitt's former student, Stuart Sherman, who together founded so-called [...] "New Humanist" [...] school of literary appreciation. In a famous article in [...] The Nation of 1913, Sherman accused Kittredge of pedantry and of squeezing {{the life out}} of his subject. Deep ideological disagreements lay at the bottom of these attacks. The New Humanists were social and cultural conservatives who conceived of literary studies as leading to moral improvement by providing a guide to conduct and [...] "humane insight" [...] through an appreciation of and reflection on of the timeless beauties of prescribed [...] "great works." [...] Babbitt bitterly opposed the introduction of elective courses for undergraduates. Deeply suspicious of democracy, he envisioned the goal of a university education as the formation of a superior individual in whom the [...] "will to restraint" [...] would counter what he saw as the degenerate modernism he traced back to pernicious ideas of social progress initiated by Rousseau and his followers. Kittredge and his students, on the other hand, situated the study of languages and literatures in their historical contexts, seeking to capture [...] "the spirit of an age" [...] and often ranging far afield of the traditional Western canon. For Kittredge, reading Chaucer illuminated the world of the Middle Ages, which Kittredge often stated had points in common with our own age and thus helped students understand the <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live.</b> Often he guided his students into newly opening fields that he had not had time to investigate, such as Finnish and Celtic studies.

60|$|Both these religions, and {{the same}} is true of many other of the {{numerous}} parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves and citizens under the earlier Roman emperors, are personal religions. They aim at personal salvation and personal immortality. The older religions were not personal like that; they were social. The older fashion of divinity was god or goddess of the city first or of the state, and only secondarily of the individual. The sacrifices were a public and not a private function. They concerned collective practical needs in this <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>live.</b> But the Greeks first and now the Romans had pushed religion out of politics. Guided by the Egyptian tradition religion had retreated to the other world.|$|E

There is the solid and fruitful earth, where man can till and build; but there is the earthquake and the flood likewise, which destroy in a moment the works of man.
