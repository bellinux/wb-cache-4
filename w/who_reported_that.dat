The proportion of ADF personnel <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> their religion was Christianity in service censuses and human relations databases decreased from around 66% in 2003 to just over 52% in 2015.

5|$|Pohlmann struck {{camp and}} {{deployed}} his infantry battalions {{in a line}} facing southwards behind the steep banks of the Kailna with his cannon arrayed directly in front. The great mass of Maratha cavalry was kept on the right flank and Berar's irregular infantry garrisoned Assaye to the rear. The only observable crossing point over the river was a small ford directly ahead of the Maratha position. Pohlmann's strategy was to funnel the British and Madras troops across the ford {{into the mouth of}} his cannon, and then on to the massed infantry and cavalry behind. Wellesley's local guides assured him that no other ford existed nearby, but he quickly discarded the option of a frontal assault as suicide. While reconnoitring he had noticed two unguarded villages, Peepulgaon and Waroor, one on each bank of the Kaitna beyond the Maratha left. On the assumption that a ford must exist between the two villages, Wellesley ordered the area to be further reconnoitred by his Chief Engineer, Captain John Johnson, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> there was indeed a ford at that spot. Thus Wellesley led his army east to the crossing in an attempt to launch an attack on Pohlmann's left flank.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [50]- 59) This {{study examined}} the relationship between aversive parental disciplinary techniques and aggressive behavior by the child. Social learning theory stresses the importance of children learning through imitating or modeling the behavior of others. Because parents are the most influential models during a child's early formative years, it is likely that parents who use aversive disciplinary techniques will have children who will display more aggressive behavior. In addition, this aggressive pattern continues to play a part in the psychological makeup of the individual child after reaching adulthood. The questionnaire used in this study was distributed at Northern Illinois University to 13 classes in education, business, and human and family resources in 1985. The questionnaire was adapted from the Conflict Tactics Scale and provided information to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis I: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they engaged in more aggressive behavior as children compared with adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. Hypothesis II: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they experienced more sibling conflict compared to adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. Hypothesis III: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> their parents used more aversive control measures select more aggressive responses to parental and interpersonal hypothetical situations compared with adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. The chi-square and Somer's d statistics were used to analyze the data. The results supported the hypotheses <b>that</b> adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they engaged in more aggressive behavior as children and experienced more sibling conflict. Also, the study provides some support for the hypothesis <b>that</b> adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> <b>that</b> their parents used more aversive control measures are more aggressive as adults. Recommendations for future studies include using a different population sample including respondents other than college students and refining the instrument to increase reliability. M. S.

25|$|There {{has been}} an {{observed}} increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. This increase in prevalence of chronic diseases {{has been attributed to}} lifestyle changes and increased urbanization. Improved access to processed foods has led to higher consumption of highly processed snacks and sugar-containing drinks in rural areas of Nicaragua, and raw sugar cane is often freely available. Complementary feeding practices involving breastfeeding paired up with supplementation of artificial snacks were frequently observed amongst 6-to 8-month-olds. These early introduction to highly processed foods leads to increased risk of infections and impaired developmental growth. In 2008, <b>WHO</b> <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> 55.5% of the population was overweight and 22.2% classified as obese, and trends reveal that obesity rates are steadily rising.|$|E
