Seeing it on the page, proving to myself that I understand the lesson, that I'm applying it to my life, and that I can move on. Ultimately it was about, you know, regardless of what happens in this relationship, I don't have to give up on loving this person, or loving myself, or give up on whatever my dreams are. Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships. For me, the true meaning exists in the bridge saying 'I don't want to be someone who walks away so easily, I'm here to stay and make a difference.' That is for all of us. We all have something that we're fighting for or that we're striving for. <b>Whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to coach our soccer team to victory or lose five pounds in a month, whatever it is, there's nothing too small worth fighting for and there's nothing too big worth going after." ...|$|E

6000|$|All {{alone in}} the harbour lay the good ship Leviathan. We jumped into the canoe, and paddled off to her. Though early in the afternoon, {{everything}} was quiet; but upon mounting the side we found four or five sailors lounging about the forecastle, under an awning. They gave us no very cordial reception; and though otherwise quite hearty in appearance, seemed to assume a look of ill-humour on purpose to honour our arrival. There was much eagerness to learn <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to [...] "ship"; and by the unpleasant accounts they gave of the vessel, they seemed desirous to prevent such a thing if possible.|$|R
5000|$|Rohmer {{made the}} film with no budget {{and out of}} order {{while he waited for}} Jean-Louis Trintignant to be {{available}} for My Night at Maud's, and this stricture possibly inspired the techniques and principles he and his cinematographer Nestor Almendros would return to in his later films: extensive rehearsal with the cast followed by very few takes; relying on natural light wherever possible, even for night scenes; [...] "spying" [...] fluid long shots to establish characters and their relationship together in a specific space. In his autobiography, A Man With A Camera, Almendros admits [...] "The film had to have a 'natural' look, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> it to or not, because we had only five photoflood lamps."

2500|$|Sex blogger Violet Blue {{has been}} mentioned, interviewed and once contributed at Boing Boing. On 23 June 2008, Blue posted on her blog, Tiny Nibbles, that all posts {{related to her}} had been deleted from Boing Boing, without explanation. The Los Angeles Times {{featured}} an interview that cast the silence {{on the part of}} Boing Boing on the matter as [...] "inexplicable", causing a controversy as Boing Boing [...] "has often presented itself as a stalwart of cultural openness".

60|$|We {{have had}} the kindest of letters from dear noble Mr. Kenyon; who, by the way, speaks of you as we like to hear him. Dickens is going to Paris for the winter, and Mrs. Butler[151] (he adds) is {{expected}} in London. Dear Mr. Kenyon calls me 'crotchety,' but Robert 'an incarnation of {{the good and the}} true,' so that I have everything to thank him for. There are noble people who take the world's side and make it seem 'for the nonce' almost respectable; but he gives up all the talk and fine schemes about money-making, and allows us to wait to see <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it or not--the money, I mean.|$|E

I don't care what people may say, and of course no one can hurt me. I suppose I have done {{a certain amount of}} harm, since I allowed myself to be tempted into action. It seemed innocent enough, but all action is bound to be harmful. It is devilish. That is why this world is evil upon the whole. But I have done with it! I shall never lift a little finger again.

6000|$|This second private {{apartment}} {{appeared to}} be about forty feet long; six immense wooden tables, painted of a ghastly yellow colour, were ranged down it side by side. Nothing was placed on any of them--they looked like dissecting-tables waiting for [...] "subjects." [...] There was yet another and a seventh table--a round one, half lost in a corner, to which we retreated for refuge--it was covered with crape and bombazine, half made up into mourning garments proper to the first and intensest stage of grief. The servant brought us one small candle to cheer the scene; and desired to be informed <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> two sheets apiece to our beds, or <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> could do with a sheet at top and a blanket at bottom, as other people did? This question cowed us at once into gloomy submission to our fate. We just hinted that we had contracted bad habits of sleeping between two sheets, and left the rest to chance; reckless how we slept, or where <b>we</b> slept, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> passed the night {{on the top of}} one of the six dissecting-tables, or with a blanket at bottom, as other people passed it. Soon the servant returned to tell us that we had got our two sheets each, and to send us to bed--snatching up the landlady's mourning garments, while she spoke, with a scared, suspicious look, as if she thought that the next outrageous luxury we should require would be a nightgown apiece of crape and bombazine.|$|R

60|$|He will, of course, {{know that}} few men are even rudely {{consistent}} in such matters, {{that the same}} man in different moods and on different occasions, is capable of referring himself in perfect good faith, not only to different, but to contradictory larger beings, and that the more important thing about an aggregatory idea from the State maker's {{point of view is}} not so much what it explicitly involves as what it implicitly repudiates. The natural man does not feel he is aggregating at all, unless he aggregates against something. He refers himself to the tribe; he is loyal to the tribe, and quite inseparably he fears or dislikes those others outside the tribe. The tribe is always at least defensively hostile and usually actively hostile to humanity beyond the aggregation. The Anti-idea, it would seem, is inseparable from the aggregatory idea; it is a necessity of the human mind. When we think of the class A as desirable, we think of Not-A as undesirable. The two things are as inevitably connected as the tendons of our hands, so that when we flatten down our little fingers on our palms, the fourth digit, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it or not, comes down halfway. All real working gods, one may remark, all gods that are worshipped emotionally, are tribal gods, and every attempt to universalise the idea of God trails dualism and the devil after it as a moral necessity.|$|E
60|$|Let us, however, {{drop the}} expert methods and handle this {{question}} rather more rudely. Do we want London rebuilt? If we do, is there, after all, {{any reason why}} we should rebuild it on its present site? London is where it is for reasons that have long ceased to be valid; it grew there, it has accumulated associations, an immense tradition, that this constant mucking about of builders and architects is destroying almost as effectually as removal to a new site. The old sort of rebuilding was a natural and picturesque process, house by house, and street by street, a thing as pleasing and almost as natural in effect as the spreading and interlacing of trees; as this new building, this clearance of areas, the piercing of avenues, becomes more comprehensive, it becomes less reasonable. If we can do such big things we may surely attempt bigger things, so that <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to plan a new capital or preserve the old, it comes at last to the same thing, that {{it is unreasonable to}} be constantly pulling down the London we have and putting it up again. Let us drain away our heavy traffic into tunnels, set up that clearing-house plan, and control the growth at the periphery, which is still so witless and ugly, and, save for the manifest tidying and preserving that is needed, begin to leave the central parts of London, which are extremely interesting even where they are not quite beautiful, in peace.|$|E
40|$|Sustainability {{is defined}} as the use of the vital {{functions}} (possible uses) of our biophysical surroundings {{in such a way that}} they remain indefinitely available.

40|$|Through an {{imaginary}} dialogue with {{a defender of}} the transhumanism – whose most significant representative is the philosopher Nick Bostrom – this paper aims to critically evaluate the ethical legitimacy of becoming a posthuman when we grow up. After a characterization of the transhumanist project and a definition of posthuman condition, the axiological reasons that underlie the desire to become a posthuman are examined. In a second momentit will be discussed the issue of <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> should <b>want</b> to be a posthuman when we grow up. A comparison is carried out between the relative strength of the arguments for {{the legitimacy of the}} transhumanist project and the possible objections, which are mainly based in an appeal to the idea of human nature, that are usually produced by the critics of transhumanism, such as Francis Fukuyama. Finally, the real possibilities of becoming a post human are outlined and, considering the uncertainty about the future and the difference between what can and what should be done, we are asked toreally think about what <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to be...|$|R
6000|$|Is {{this then}} the best {{consolation}} my mysterious mentor can offer? How vain, how false it is!--how little can reason help us! The small bird exists {{only in the}} present; there is no past, nor future, nor knowledge of death. Its every action {{is the result of}} a stimulus from outside; its [...] "bravery" [...] is but that of a dead leaf or ball of thistle-down carried away by the blast. Is there no escape, then, from this intolerable sadness--from the thought of springs that have been, the beautiful multitudinous life that has vanished? Our maker and mother mocks at our efforts--at our philosophic refuges, and sweeps them away with a wave of emotion. And yet there is deliverance, the old way of escape which is ours, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it or not. Nature herself in her own good time heals the wound she inflicts--even this most grievous in seeming when she takes away from us the faith and hope of reunion with our lost. They may be in a world of light, waiting our coming--we do not know; but in that place they are unimaginable, their state inconceivable. They were like us, beings of flesh and blood, or we should not have loved them. If we cannot grasp their hands their continued existence is nothing to us. Grief at their loss is just as great for those who have kept their faith as for those who have lost it; and on account of its very poignancy it cannot endure in either case. It fades, returning in its old intensity at ever longer intervals until it ceases. The poet of nature was wrong when he said that without his faith in the decay of his senses he would be worse than dead, echoing the apostle who said that if we had hope in this world only we should be of all men the most miserable. So, too, was the later poet wrong when he listened to the waves on Dover beach bringing the eternal notes of sadness in; when he saw in imagination the ebbing of the great sea of faith which had made the world so beautiful, in its withdrawal disclosing the deserts drear and naked shingles of the world. That desolation, as he imagined it, which made him so unutterably sad, was due to the erroneous idea that our earthly happiness comes to us from otherwhere, some region outside our planet, just as one of our modern philosophers has imagined that the principle of life on earth came originally from the stars.|$|E

(Members Of Blood; one of its former members include Sein of Ruffedge) and of course, Too Phat. The seed of the group can be traced in 1997 when a then 17-year-old Subang Jaya kid called Joe Flizzow and the then 19-year-old Muar-based Malique decided to form a creative alliance after an infamous rap battle on the Net. In November that year, after completing his A-Levels, Malique migrated to KL, and together with Joe and another guy, Doctah K (Kevin Felix), they embarked on a journey that would take them beyond their wildest imagination. It’s unclear when did the group call themselves Too Phat, but {{in an interview with the}} now-defunct TONE magazine in their April 2001 issue, both said Too Phat was the first name that came to mind after a gig organiser asked them for a group name to be included in a gig flyer. Other names that were also in consideration were Way Too Phat and Nickel and Rhymes.“We weren’t sure <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to stick with Too Phat or not,” Malique said in the interview.“Yeah.
