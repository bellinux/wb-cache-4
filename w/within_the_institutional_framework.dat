Some forms of fiscal policy co-ordination are then studied <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> of the European Community, where such policy reforms are decided by the unanimity rule.

50|$|The dictate of {{the happy}} {{end in the}} middlebrow novel {{requires}} her female protagonists to settle in matrimony. However, while such an ending may cause some dismay for readers who had hoped for a more accentuated feminist settlement one cannot ignore <b>the</b> fact that <b>within</b> Silberrad's vision of the traditional corset of marriage gender roles and their hegemonic balance are re-negotiated and thereby self-consciously re-calibrated. Modernisation takes place <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>frameworks</b> of society but does not operate against them. It follows from this that Silberrad communicates what must seem small-scale changes to an existing worldview but never opts for its radical discontinuation. This may sometimes disappoint in its calm if not cautious detachment from the radicalism of the modernist movement. However, Silberrad's writing reveals the osmotic and thus gradual domestication of modern thinking in the wider realms of British society {{in the early decades}} of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|How {{might the}} {{development}} of artist/curator practice into a philosophically-based praxis contribute to fine art critical discourse? Such questions are important in considering the role of artists <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> for legitimisation of a practice. Within the critical debate between the value of institutional decisions of what art gets shown, and the arguments pertaining to how art is shown as a legitimate concern, rests the potential of artist/curator practice to develop methodologies of self-reflection and communication. The later issues marrying with the institutional framework of legitimisation, brings the position of artist/curator into an activated role of co-arbiter with the arts institution. It is specifically this issue of communication which is of importance, and is the nexus for connecting with the institutional framework...|$|E
40|$|A {{private sector}} that now dominates {{economic}} activity {{has emerged in}} China since 1978, {{even though many of}} the essential institutions for market competition have been lacking or are under-developed. We find that {{there is no evidence that}} this upsurge of entrepreneurship is a re-birth of an earlier tradition. Instead, the dynamics of entrepreneurial emergence can be attributed to reforms and institutional changes that have occurred since 1949, both before and after the introduction of economic reforms in late 1978. We find that these institutional changes have been evolutionary, adapting to, as well as shaping, emerging forms of economic activity, including entrepreneurship. Our conclusion is that these dynamics of adaptation and evolution produce ‘rule ambiguities’ <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> that create opportunities for entrepreneurs as well as making these opportunities vulnerable to further institutional change...|$|E

In spite of these benefits, colleges and universities, as well as faculty members, do not consistently embrace a broader vision of scholarship, including SoTL. This research explored individual experiences <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> of one land-grant institution to further institutionalize SoTL practice. A qualitative methodology of individual, semi-structured interviews was used to collect data. Eighteen faculty members with ranks from assistant to full professor revealed why they became involved in SoTL and the personal and professional benefits that went beyond those that “counted ” for promotion and tenure decisions. Institutionalizing SoTL through definition and valuing in the faculty handbook and exempt review opportunities enabled SoTL work. Suggestions for strategically using SoTL to promote the university in efforts to increase recruitment and retention were offered...|$|E
40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of the imperatives for actors <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>framework</b> of energy socio-technical systems to engage with the public, the aim {{of this paper is to}} consider interdependencies between the principles and practice of engagement and the nature of the imagined publics with whom engagement is being undertaken. Based on an analysis of 19 interviews with actors in the renewable energy industry, the paper explores how publics are imagined in the construction of the rationales, functions and mechanisms for public engagement. Three main themes are identified. First, the perceived necessity of engagement - which is not contingent on public responsiveness. Second, engagement is primarily conceptualised in terms of instrumental motives of providing information and addressing public concern. Third, preferences for engagement mechanisms were often a function of the specific characteristics attributed to imagined publics. Implications of this analysis for future engagement around siting renewable energy technologies are considered...|$|E
