The collection, as {{exhibited}} at present, includes a number of copies which mimic in variously injurious ways the characters of Michael Angelo's own work; and the series, except as material for reference, can be of no practical service until these are withdrawn, and placed by themselves. It includes, besides, a number of original drawings which are indeed of value to any laborious student of Michael Angelo's life and temper; but which owe {{the greater part of}} this interest to their being executed in times of sickness or indolence, when the master, however strong, was failing in his purpose, and, however diligent, tired of his work. It will be enough to name, as an example of this class, the sheet of studies for the Medici tombs, No. 45, in which the lowest figure is, strictly speaking, neither a study nor a <b>working</b> <b>drawing,</b> but has either been scrawled in the feverish languor of exhaustion, which cannot escape its subject of thought; or, at best, in idly experimental addition of part to part, beginning with the head, and fitting muscle after muscle, and bone after bone, to it, thinking of their place only, not their proportion, till the head is only about one-twentieth part of the height of the body: finally, something between a face and a mask is blotted in the upper left-hand corner of the paper, indicative, in the weakness and frightfulness of it, simply of mental disorder from over-work; and there are several others of this kind, among even the better drawings of the collection, which ought never to be exhibited to the general public.|$|E

50|$|The {{process of}} {{producing}} plans, and {{the skill of}} producing them, {{is often referred to}} as technical drawing. A <b>working</b> <b>drawing</b> is a type of technical drawing, which is part of the documentation needed to build an engineering product or architecture. Typically in architecture these could include civil drawings, architectural drawings, structural drawings, mechanical drawings, electrical drawings, and plumbing drawings. In engineering, these drawings show all necessary data to manufacture a given object, such as dimensions and angles.|$|E

50|$|From {{this time}} he {{received}} royal commissions, at Les Invalides and at Versailles, where iconographic treatment and design were tightly controlled and the sculptor was often presented with a sketch or <b>working</b> <b>drawing</b> to follow. His free copy of the king's Roman Diana, the Diana of Versailles, was repeated in his workshop several times. His gilt-bronze Four Captive Nations (1682-85) celebrated the early victories of the armies of Louis XIV over the alliances of Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, Brandenburg and the Dutch Republic, in Louis XIV's Place des Victoires, Paris. They ornamented the socle of Desjardins' standing sculpture of Louis XIV, which was melted down at the Revolution. Today the Captifs are conserved in the Louvre, their gilding weathered away. A marble workshop copy of the Louis XIV is {{to be seen in}} the Orangerie at Versailles.|$|E

He reportedly [...] "gave special attention to the entrance to parks, the location and designe of park buildings, the layout of campgrounds, and the physical appearance of lakes and roadsides." [...] According to one account, [...] "an apparently reinvigorated Punchard inspected most of the parks, consulting and advising superintendents, providing some sketches and <b>working</b> <b>drawing,</b> and giving in some instances 'detailed instructions on the ground,' or field supervision of maintenance and construction activities." [...] He spent two-and-a-half months at Yellowstone National Park studying the buildings used by the park's concessionaires. Based on his recommendations, the camps and camp buildings were rearranged to make them [...] "more attractive and more harmonious with the environment." [...] While at Yellowstone, he also worked with representatives of the U.S. Forest Service to develop a plan for the approaches to all of the national parks in that area.|$|E

The National Gallery still describe it as [...] "probably a modello", presumably produced after work had already begun."Cartoon", named for the sturdy cartone paper on which they were generally executed, is usually used of working drawings, often at full scale, but the distinction is not a firm one, and the terms cartoon and <b>working</b> <b>drawing</b> are often used interchangeably. Modello is especially used of older Italian art and architecture from the late Middle Ages onwards; initially these were mostly drawings, perhaps with some colour from chalk or watercolour, or with colours indicated in writing. The diminutive term modeletto will always be used of small-scale versions. As an Italian word, modello may be printed in italics, or not. The French version of the word, modèle, may be used of French works, and is normally italicised.|$|E
