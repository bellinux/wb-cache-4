2500|$|The wing {{radiators}} were shallower and set {{farther back}} on the wing.

2500|$|The six prototypes {{were built}} as a single Mk.I, HM599, powered by a Sabre IV, two Mk.IIs (LA602 and LA607) {{equipped}} with the Centaurus IV, a Mk.III (LA610) with a Griffon IIB, a Mk.IV (LA614) with a Griffon 61, and a Mk.V (HM595) with the Sabre II. The Tempest Mk.I featured other new features, such as a clean single-piece sliding canopy {{in place of the}} car-door framed canopy, and it used <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> instead of the [...] "chin" [...] radiator. Due to development difficulties with the Sabre IV engine and its <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> the completion of the Mk.I prototype, HM599, was delayed, and thus it was the Mk.V prototype, HM595, that would fly first.|$|R
25|$|Early {{examples}} of the D.V featured a large headrest, which was usually removed in service because it interfered with the pilot's field of view. The headrest was deleted from the second production batch. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> {{to cope with the}} warmer climate.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the D.III's airfoil section upper <b>wing</b> <b>radiator</b> the D.VII had a car-type rectangular cross-section one mounted in the nose immediately {{in front of the}} Mercedes engine. The fuselage behind was flat sided and plywood covered, though with a rounded decking; the single open cockpit was at the wing trailing edges, both of which had cut-outs to aid the pilot's vision. In side view the fuselage of the 500 mm shorter D.VII was less slender than its predecessor. Its tailplane, placed on top of the fuselage, had a higher aspect ratio and carried a single piece elevator; its vertical tail was taller and narrower, the balanced rudder ending above the elevator. The fixed conventional undercarriage had a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts, aided by a tailskid mounted at the extreme tail.|$|E

40|$|Part 1 {{deals with}} the head {{resistance}} {{of a number of}} common types of radiator cores at different speeds in free air, as measured in the wind tunnel at the bureau of standards. This work was undertaken to determine the characteristics of various types of radiator cores, and in particular to develop the best type of radiator for airplanes. Some 25 specimens of core were tested, including practically all the general types now in use, except the flat plate type. Part 2 gives the results of wind tunnel tests of resistance on a model fuselage with a nose radiator. Part 3 presents the results of preliminary tests of head resistance of a radiator enclosed in a streamlined casing. Special attention is given to the value of <b>wing</b> <b>radiator</b> and of the radiator located in the open, especially when it is provided with a properly designed streamlined casing...|$|E

25|$|The second {{prototype}} introduced upper <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> {{in lieu of}} {{the frontal}} radiator and large cut-outs in the lower wing roots, to improve the pilot's downward vision. These features proved unsuccessful and were omitted from subsequent aircraft. The third and fourth prototypes incorporated numerous modifications to the radiator, upper fuselage decking, fin and rudder. The fourth prototype was selected as the production standard. Series production commenced in October 1917, with 121 Dolphins delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} report an {{investigation}} is {{made on a}} flat plate in a two-dimensional compressible flow {{of the effect of}} compressibility and heating on the turbulent frictional drag coefficient in the boundary layer of an airfoil or <b>wing</b> <b>radiator.</b> The analysis is based on the Prandtl-Karman theory of the turbulent boundary later and the Stodola-Crocco, theorem on the linear relation between the total energy of the flow and its velocity. Formulas are obtained for the velocity distribution and the frictional drag law in a turbulent boundary later with the compressibility effect and heat transfer taken into account. It is found that with increase of compressibility and temperature at full retardation of the flow (the temperature when the velocity of the flow at a given point is reduced to zero in case of an adiabatic process in the gas) at a constant R (sub x), the frictional drag coefficient C (sub f) decreased, both of these factors acting in the same sense...|$|E
50|$|The D.III entered {{squadron}} {{service in}} December 1916, {{and was immediately}} acclaimed by German aircrews for its maneuverability and rate of climb. Two faults with the new aircraft were soon identified. Like the D.II, early D.IIIs featured a Teves und Braun airfoil-shaped radiator {{in the center of}} the upper wing, where it tended to scald the pilot if punctured. From the 290th D.III onward, the radiator was offset to the right on production machines while others were soon moved to the right as a field modification. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> to cope with the warmer climate.|$|R

50|$|The TG183 was {{distinctive}} {{in that it}} had twin rear {{wings and}} front <b>wing</b> mounted <b>radiators.</b> Unfortunately the front wing configuration caused {{the front of the}} car to move about at high speed and was eventually replaced by a more conventional front wing set up.|$|R
25|$|Supermarine 312: This was {{the basic}} Spitfire Mk I adapted to take four 20mm Oerlikon cannon mounted in {{modified}} <b>wings.</b> The <b>radiator</b> and oil cooler were moved {{from under the}} wing to a duct under the fuselage.

2500|$|In August 1942, {{even before}} the first flight of the {{prototype}} Tempest V had been conducted, a production order for 400 Tempests was placed by the Air Ministry. This order was split, with the initial batch of 100 being Tempest V [...] "Series I"s, powered by the 2,235hp (1,491kW) Sabre IIA series engine, which had the distinctive chin radiator, while the rest were to have been produced as the Tempest I, equipped with the Sabre IV and leading-edge radiators. These 300 Tempest Is were intended to replace an order for a similar quantity of Typhoons for the Gloster Aircraft Company. As it transpired, the difficulties with the Sabre IV and the <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> led to this version never reaching production, the corresponding order was switched to 300 Tempest V [...] "Series 2"s instead.|$|R

50|$|Gabardini further {{developed}} the G.8 in the G.8bis model. The G.8bis had a 134-kilowatt (180-horsepower) Hispano-Suiza HS 34 engine driving a two-bladed propeller, and differed from the G.8 in having a longer-span lower <b>wing</b> and <b>radiators</b> attached {{to the sides of}} its fuselage over the wing leading edges instead of a frontal radiator.|$|R
50|$|Oeffag (Oesterreichische Flugzeugfabrik AG) {{also built}} the D.II under license, as the Oeffag Va.53 / Oeffag series 53, for the Luftfahrtruppen. The Austrian {{machines}} used a 138 kW (185 hp) Austro-Daimler engine, and were {{fitted with a}} Teves und Braun-style <b>wing</b> mounted <b>radiator.</b> Oeffag produced only 16 examples before production shifted to the Albatros D.III.|$|R
5000|$|The AR.1 and ARL.1 had a {{wing span}} of 13.27 m, and used frontal radiators, while the AR.2 and ARL.2 were {{slightly}} smaller aircraft, with a wingspan of 12.0 m, the wing area being only 45 square metres, and <b>wing</b> mounted <b>radiators.</b> All these types had [...] "A.2" [...] added to {{their names in}} French service, indicating that they were two-seater reconnaissance aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Bush-crickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae) {{generate}} sound using tegminal stridulation. Signalling {{effectiveness is}} affected by the widely varying acoustic parameters of temporal pattern, frequency and spectral purity (tonality). During stridulation, frequency multiplication occurs as a scraper on one wing scrapes across a file of sclerotized teeth on the other. The frequency with which these tooth–scraper interactions occur, along with radiating wing cell resonant properties, dictates both frequency and tonality in the call. Bush-cricket species produce calls ranging from resonant, tonal calls through to non-resonant, broadband signals. The differences are believed to result from differences in file tooth arrangement and <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> but a systematic test of the structural causes of broadband or tonal calls is lacking. Using phylogenetically controlled structural equation models, we show that parameters of file tooth density and file length are the best-fitting predictors of tonality across 40 bush-cricket species. Features of file morphology constrain the production of spectrally pure signals, but systematic distribution of teeth alone does not explain pure-tone sound production in this family...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide thermal {{radiation}} environments that result in adequate beat rejection, the single-phase, liquid ammonia (NH 3) heat rejection system on the International Space Station (ISS) requires that its two thermal <b>radiator</b> <b>wings</b> be dynamically rotated as the ISS travels through its orbit. This paper discusses the closed-loop, thermal radiator pointing system that is used on ISS to ensure adequate heat rejection by the radiators, while preventing freezing of the ammonia under low heat loads and cold-environmental conditions. Although initial designs used an open-loop approach for radiator pointing, concerns about performance robustness, algorithm complexity, memory requirements, and sustaining support drove {{the development of a}} more robust, simpler, closed-loop system. Hence, the challenge of the closed-loop system was to utilize existing sensors, actuators and computers to fit into the existing hardware and software architecture of the ISS. Using a proportional-integral (PI) control architecture with limited output and an anti-windup integrator, the temperature of the ammonia coming out of the radiator is measured and controlled by adjusting the <b>radiator</b> <b>wing</b> orientation. The <b>radiator</b> <b>wing</b> orientation for the local minimum environment is fed forward to the control system, and the closed-loop controller is used to generate a bias off of that local minimum environment in order to heat up the ammonia when necessary to avoid freezing. In the earth's shadow, the controller is suspended and the <b>radiator</b> <b>wing</b> is oriented to face the earth, the local maximum thermal environment which further prevents freezing of the ammonia. This control architecture is shown to provide adequate heat rejection and avoid freezing of the ammonia, even though the physical system consists of large transport delays and time-varying dynamics which change dramatically due to orbit motion and variable heat loads...|$|R
50|$|The C.X was {{essentially}} an enlarged {{development of the}} Albatros C.VII designed {{to take advantage of}} the new Mercedes D.IVa engine that became available in 1917. Unlike the C.VII that preceded it in service, the C.X utilised the top <b>wing</b> spar-mounted <b>radiator</b> that had first been tried on the C.V/17. Other important modernisation features included provision for oxygen for the crew and radio equipment.|$|R
40|$|The 'restructured' {{baseline}} of the Space Station Freedom (SSF) {{has eliminated}} {{many of the}} growth options for the Active Thermal Control System (ATCS). Modular addition of baseline technology to increase heat rejection will be extremely difficult. The system design and the available real estate no longer accommodate this type of growth. As the station matures during its thirty years of operation, a demand of up to 165 kW of heat rejection can be expected. The baseline configuration {{will be able to}} provide 82. 5 kW at Eight Manned Crew Capability (EMCC). The growth paths necessary to reach 165 kW have been identified. Doubling the heat rejection capability of SSF will require either the modification of existing <b>radiator</b> <b>wings</b> or the attachment of growth structure to the baseline truss for growth <b>radiator</b> <b>wing</b> placement. <b>Radiator</b> performance can be improved by enlarging the surface area or by boosting the operating temperature with a heat pump. The optimal solution will require both modifications. The addition of growth structure would permit the addition of a parallel ATCS using baseline technology. This growth system would simplify integration. The feasibility of incorporating these growth options to improve the heat rejection capacity of SSF is under evaluation...|$|R

40|$|A {{concept of}} {{a nuclear power plant}} to be {{assembled}} on earth and operated on the moon is presented. The two principal design objectives are reliability and high specific power. Wherever there is an incompatibility between these two objectives, the decision favors reliability. The design is {{based on the premise that}} the power plant must be designed on the basis of current technology and with a minimum amount of research and development. The principal components consist of a fast reactor in a direct cycle with a mercury-vapor turbine. The high- frequency generator, hydrogen compressor for the generator cooling system, mercury-recirculating pump, and condensate pump are on an extension of the turbine shaft. Ths mercury vapor is condensed and the hydrogen cooled in <b>wing</b> <b>radiators.</b> The reactor is of a construction quite similar to EBR-I Mark IlI for which there is a large amount of operating experience. The radiator is a vertical tube-and-fin type built in concentric cylindrical sections of increseing diameter.

25|$|Early in 1923, a {{decision}} was made to redesign the racer and in the months following, a completely new design emerged with the original landplane being converted into a floatplane.
