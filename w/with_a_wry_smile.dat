500|$|Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express {{gave the}} film 2.5 (out of 5) stars, saying [...] "watch {{this one for}} Shah Rukh, who can still do the dimpled boy wonder and the older, mature lover <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> and wounded wink and sexy nudge." [...] Sukanya Verma (also from Rediff.com) {{described}} it as an [...] "elegant, harmless entertainer for [...] most part", praising the visuals, acting and music. She criticised the screenplay, contending that the film could have been [...] "snappier", and gave it 2.5 (out of 5) stars. Piyasree Dasgupta of First Post wrote: [...] "You have seen everything Jab Tak Hai Jaan has many times before, just in other films. And probably with far better music than A.R. Rahman threw into this one." ...|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth {{was silent}} for several moments; {{then he turned to}} the other two men <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{this kind}} of thing happens often, the fellows who hold my notes will get a painful shock," [...] he thought, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> and closed his eyes.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, Wyllard turned to. Dampier <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{quite likely}} you're right," [...] and Nares {{looked at his}} comrade <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Still, after all, I'm not sure it's very material." ...|$|R
6000|$|Desmond {{looked at}} her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Miss Figuera," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I think I would gladly do a very great deal for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thought you'd like it--it's {{a pretty}} chair. We bought it and don't want it. No need {{for you to}} have it, don't be frightened,' said Birkin, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
6000|$|It was <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> {{he watched}} a man ride off towards the {{settlement}} with it. [...] "I shall not be sorry when the climax comes," [...] he said. [...] "The strain is telling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} generous." [...] The words vibrated with sincerity. [...] "Once--always--I have cruelly wronged you----" [...] but here Geoffrey {{raised his hand}} {{and looked at the}} girl <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> that had no mirth in it.|$|E
60|$|Courthorne made {{a little}} gesture that might have meant anything, and then he swung round {{abruptly}} without another look at her. When the door dosed behind him he went down the corridor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> in his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose it}} is. Some of those {{pictures}} must be pretty, or the tourists wouldn't buy them, but that doesn't go very far, after all." [...] He stopped a moment, {{and then went}} on <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "No doubt some patients require drastic treatment, and there are cases where it is necessary to use the knife." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{man looked}} down on her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "I haven't told it often, but you shall hear," [...] he said. [...] "It's a tale of a black failure." [...] He {{stretched}} out a hand {{and pointed to the}} sliding fog and ranks of tumbling seas. [...] "It was very much this kind of night, and we were lying, reefed down, off one of the Russians' beaches, when I asked for volunteers. I got them--two boats' crews of the finest seamen that ever handled oar or sealing rifle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes!" [...] said Valentine, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> in his eyes. [...] "I {{have tried}} them both, {{and that is}} one reason why I'm here. You haven't {{answered}} me; though, after all, I guess it's an unnecessary question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about these things--at least, I've forgotten," [...] said Jolyon <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> He himself had {{had to wait for}} death to grant him a divorce from the first Mrs. Jolyon. [...] "Do you wish me to see her about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Burton, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> [...] "how simple is the detective's job. Willie is a natural-born detective. He got {{everything}} wrong from A to Izzard, yet if it hadn't been for Willie {{we might not}} have cleared up the mystery so soon." ...|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill went, and {{crossing}} the hot space {{of dust and}} sand walked into the hut. Dazzled as he was by the change from the glare outside, he could see almost nothing {{for a moment or}} two. The place was also filled <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acrid haze, but by degrees he became accustomed to the dimness and made out Gavin lying against the wall. He looked up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> but Ormsgill moving nearer saw that his face was gray and drawn. There was dust on his thin duck clothing, and in two spots a small dark-colored stain.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} riot, Wainwright returns to Brixton prison and Mackay returns from his course. Mackay warns Fletcher and Godber {{that he will}} be {{enforcing}} a new regime where their lives will be made a misery. Despite this, every prisoner greets Mackay <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chorus of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, which Mackay reacts to <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry,</b> almost appreciative <b>smile.</b>|$|R
5000|$|TouchArcade's Spanner Spencer also responded positively, {{scoring the}} game 4.5 out 5, and arguing [...] "it {{is rife with}} lavish quirks, nods and winks toward {{those of us who}} grew up taking this stuff so seriously, but can now look back at it <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> and {{friendly}} <b>smile.</b> By casually lampooning itself, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe is entirely accessible to both the young and old alike." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} the young man, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Your years again protect you. But {{you have a}} son, and if by to-morrow it should come to pass {{that you have a}} son no more, you may account yourself, through this"--and again he pointed to the weal--"his murderer." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Caryll {{nodded his}} thanks. [...] "Your praise is very flattering, my lord," [...] said he, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> and then proceeded: [...] "It is because I see my {{case to be}} so very nearly desperate, that I venture to hope you will not persevere in the course you are proposing to adopt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "I think I {{should not}} have been here now if you had not taken care of me, and I'm very grateful. Still"--and he glanced down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> at his knee, which was bent a trifle--"it was unfortunate you and the doctor did not get me earlier. There are {{disadvantages}} in being--all one's life--a cripple." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{broke off}} for <b>a</b> moment <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "In my case they were serious. There {{was a woman}} of hysterical {{temperament}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> diseased imagination. I was overworked and a trifle overwrought, and had a glass of brandy too much at a certain committee lunch. Then there was a rather delicate operation in a hospital, and though I'm not sure yet that I blundered, {{it was suggested that}} I did, and the thing was complicated by what the woman said when the committee took it up. It didn't matter that the patient recovered, for when he took action against the woman, the thing made a sensation in the Eastern papers." ...|$|R
60|$|Weston said nothing, but {{lay still}} with his pipe in his hand. There was before him a task {{from which he}} shrank, but he was {{worn-out}} and could not nerve himself to undertake it yet, and in the meanwhile {{he thought of his}} dead comrade <b>with</b> <b>a</b> certain regretful tenderness. The man had had no claim on him, and there had been much that was dissimilar in their natures, but they had, after all, borne many hardships together, and that counted for a good deal. Still, in one way he could not be sorry that Grenfell had gone on, for life, as he had said, had very little to offer this outcast. It was clear that the same thing held true in his own case, and he remembered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> that Grenfell had said his share was to go to him if they found the mine. They had not found it, and there was no prospect of their doing so, for his faith in the project had vanished now that Grenfell was dead. It remained for them only {{to go back to the}} settlements, defeated.|$|R
60|$|Maxwell spoke thickly, {{but there}} was <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> on his lips {{as he watched the}} big dark-skinned alien, who, rending his cotton robe, bound a pad of wet leaves upon the injured side.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm the one {{who should}} be peeved," [...] spoke up the girl <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Brazos was my pony. He's the one you picked out for me to ride while I am here; but I am sure poor Mr. Bridge feels as badly about it as anyone, and I know that he couldn't help it. We shouldn't be too hard on him. We {{might just as well}} attempt to hold him {{responsible}} for the looting of the bank and the loss of the pay-roll money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And was smashed by the snowslide," [...] Vane went on. [...] "Then {{there was}} Tom, from the {{boundary}} country. He packed me back a league to camp the day I chopped my right foot; {{and went down}} in the lumber schooner off Flattery. Black Pete, too, who held on to you in the rapid when we were running the bridge-logs through. It was in firing a short fuse that he got his discharge," [...] He raised his free hand, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b> [...] "Gone on--with more of their kind after them; a goodly company. Why are we left prosperous? What have we done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Handily?" [...] queried Barbara Harding, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> glancing {{about the}} deck of the Halfmoon. [...] "I cannot see that we are either through it handily or through it at all. We have no masts, no canvas, no boats; and though I am not much of a sailor, I can see that there is little {{likelihood}} of our effecting a landing on the shore ahead either with or without boats---it looks most forbidding. Then the wind has gone down, and when it comes up again it is possible that it will carry us away from the land, or if it takes us toward it, dash us to pieces at the foot of those frightful cliffs." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>A</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> and <b>a</b> {{shake of}} the head was Tremayne's only answer; and then Carruthers came in fresh from Lisbon, {{where he had been}} upon {{business}} connected with the commissariat, and to Tremayne's relief the subject was perforce abandoned.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{stooped to}} examine the ground. He found that a large shrub had been torn up by the roots. Then he found {{something}} else. There was <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> {{on his face as}} he rose and turned toward the girl.|$|R
6000|$|Aylward {{shrugged his}} broad shoulders, and <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> dawned upon his rugged face. [...] "I am indeed as limp as a wetted bowstring," [...] said he. [...] "It {{is the nature}} of a man that he should be sad when he leaves the woman he loves." ...|$|R
60|$|He did {{not wait}} for {{an answer to the}} query, but plodded away; and Weston sat still a few minutes longer, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> in his eyes. He resented being over-driven, though he was more or less used to it, and now and then he found his superior's vitriolic {{comments}} upon his efforts almost intolerably galling. Still he had sense enough to realize that the remedy open to him was a somewhat hazardous one, because, while {{it would be easy to}} walk out of the construction camp, industrial activity just then was unusually slack in the Mountain Province. Besides, he was willing to admit that there were excuses for Cassidy, and there was a certain quiet tenacity in him. He was also aware that the man with little money has generally a good deal to bear, for Weston was one who could learn by experience, though that faculty was not one that hitherto had characterized the family from which he sprang.|$|E
60|$|They ate {{the half}} loaf and drank the wine; but Harper looked grave when Appleby {{took off his}} shoe. His foot seemed badly swollen, but he desisted from an attempt to remove the torn and clotted {{stocking}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and put on the}} shoe again. Then he limped out into the road and plodded painfully down it under the scorching sun all that morning without plan or purpose, though he knew that while it lay not far from Santa Marta the Insurgents had friends and sympathizers in the aldea of Arucas, which was somewhere in front of them. They met nobody. The road wound away before them empty as well as intolerably hot and dusty, though here and there a group of men at work in the fields stopped and stared at them; and they spent an hour making what Harper called a traverse round a white aldea they were not sure about. Then they lay down awhile in a ruined garden beside the carretera.|$|E
60|$|Weston sat silent awhile, {{gazing at}} the steamer's smoke trail which {{stretched}} far back, a dingy smear on the blueness, across the shining lake; and the contractor watched him with a certain sympathy which, however, he carefully refrained from expressing. There had been a {{time in his career}} when it had seemed that every man of influence in his profession and all the powers of capital had been arrayed against him. He had been tricked into taking contracts the bigger men would not touch; his accounts had been held over until long after the convenanted settling day, and he had been compelled to submit to every deduction that perverted ingenuity could suggest. He had, however, hardened his heart, and toiled the more assiduously, planning half the night and driving machine or plying shovel himself by day, whenever a few dollars could be saved by doing so. He had lived on the plainest fare, but he had, without borrowing or soliciting favors from any man, borne the shrewd blows dealt him and struggled on inch by inch uphill in spite of them. Now {{it seemed to him that}} this young Englishman was bent on doing much the same. At length Weston turned to him <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{some point}} in the past, a sign on the bridge {{informed}} travelers, [...] "In event of attack, drive off bridge," [...] New York Times columnist William Safire wrote in 2008. The [...] "somewhat macabre sign", he wrote, must have [...] "drawn <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile</b> from millions of motorists." ...|$|R
60|$|His {{lips were}} twisted into <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> {{and there was}} pain in the blue eyes that gleamed so vividly under his black brows, pain {{blending}} with the mockery of his voice. But of all this it was the mockery alone that was perceived by Miss Bishop; she resented it.|$|R
40|$|EDITOR 2 ̆ 7 S NOTE- While we {{are unable}} because of space {{limitations}} to print Dr. Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s study in its entirety, we know our readers will be interested in this excerpt regarding readability levels and the rules. Its irony may not be delightfully humorous, but it will elicit <b>a</b> <b>wry</b> <b>smile,</b> even from taxpayers...|$|R
