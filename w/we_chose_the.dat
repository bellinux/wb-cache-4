After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. [...] "Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing", Jackson said. Froese had interpolated funk sounds with Jackson’s hip-hop influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily sampled it.

2500|$|Dir En Grey was {{preceded by}} the {{independent}} rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before it ended activities. They disbanded due to leader and bassist Kisaki not wanting to debut as he {{felt that it was}} too soon, but guitarist Kaoru believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show at Nagano Live House on January 24, they decided to stay together as [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] on February 2, 1997. They released their first EP, Missa, a few months later. According to Toshiya, the name [...] "Dir En Grey" [...] was chosen because it [...] "sounded right" [...] and is composed of words from several languages so that people {{would not be able to}} attach a specific meaning to it other than the band's name itself. However, in another interview Kaoru said [...] "At the time <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn’t express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. <b>We</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn’t exist elsewhere." ...|$|E

Already knowing that in reality Pocahontas married John Rolfe, Mike Gabriel explained it was felt that [...] "the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience" [...] so instead, they would focus on Pocahontas's meeting with John Smith. The filmmakers discovered that Pocahontas was around twelve years old and Smith was [...] "not a very likeable character", and producer James Pentecost confessed that dramatic license was indeed to be taken. Likewise, when searching for an appropriate age for Pocahontas to begin her relationship with Smith, Glen Keane explained, [...] "We had the choice of being historically accurate or socially responsible, so <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> socially responsible side" [...] by increasing Pocahontas's age from a girl into a young woman.|$|E

In addition, the band confirmed that they had chosen their performance in Chile as the main basis for the release, with Harris commenting, [...] "After much consideration, <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> Santiago show as we felt it was one of our best performances of the entire tour and to play at the prestigious Estadio Nacional was a landmark moment for us." [...] Furthermore, the press release reported that the video will include the use of split screens, with director Andy Matthews later commenting that [...] "Split screens are a way of showing several pieces of action at the same time. With Maiden, you have a dramatic wide shot of the stage, as well as six bandmembers, Eddie and an amazing crowd! We used this technique as so much is going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not every {{situation}} requires the {{axiom of choice}}. For finite sets X, the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite number of) boxes, each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The number of boxes is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element <b>we</b> <b>chose,</b> <b>the</b> second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction to prove [...] "for every natural number k, every family of k nonempty sets has a choice function.") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the axiom of countable choice. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (X'i : i∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, {{but there is no}} stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no [...] "limiting" [...] choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone in 1995, Jagger stated that Taylor never {{explained}} {{why he had}} left, and surmised that [...] " [...] {{wanted to have a}} solo career. I think he found it difficult to get on with Keith." [...] In the same interview Jagger said of Taylor's contribution to the band: [...] "I think he had a big contribution. He made it very musical. He was a very fluent, melodic player, which we never had, and we don't have now. Neither Keith nor Ronnie Wood plays that kind of style. It was very good for me working with him ... Mick Taylor would play very fluid lines against my vocals. He was exciting, and he was very pretty, and it gave me something to follow, to bang off. Some people think that's the best version of the band that existed". Asked if he agreed with that assessment, Jagger said: [...] "I obviously can't say if I think Mick Taylor was the best, because it sort of trashes the period the band is in now." [...] Charlie Watts stated: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> <b>the</b> right man for the job at that time just as Ronnie was the right man for the job later on. I still think Mick is great. I haven't heard or seen him play in a few years. But certainly what came out of playing with him are musically some of the best things we've ever done". Another statement in Guitar World in October 2002 made by Richards said [...] "Mick Taylor and I worked really well together ... He had some lovely energy. Sweetly sophisticated playing, way beyond his years. Lovely sense of melody. I never understood why he left the Stones, Nor does he, I think ... I had no desire to see him go." [...] Taylor later admitted in the 2012 documentary Crossfire Hurricane that he had become addicted to heroin and hoped to protect his family from the drug culture surrounding the band by leaving.|$|E

That was built by Roger de Clifford, who suffered death with his party chief, the Earl of Lancaster, when Edward of York took the city, and it is mainly memorable as the refuge of the Jews whom the Christians had harried out of their homes. They had grown in numbers and riches, when the Jew-hate of 1190 broke out in England, as from time to time the Jew-hate breaks out in Russia now, to much the same cruel effect. They were followed and besieged in the castle, and, seeing that they must be captured, they set fire to the place, and five hundred slew themselves. Some that promised to be Christians came out and were killed by their brethren in Christ. In New York the Christians have grown milder, and now they only keep the Jews out of their clubs and their homes.|$|E
