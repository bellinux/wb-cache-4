5|$|A dance crew {{is a team}} {{of street}} dancers who come {{together}} to develop new moves and battle other crews. As hip-hop culture spread throughout New York City, the more often breaking crews got together to battle against each other. It was during this time that the different dance moves within breaking developed organically. All styles of hip-hop are rooted in battling, and {{being a part of}} a crew was the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> when these styles began because they were not taught in studios: they all started out as social dances. Forming and participating in a crew is how street dancers practiced, improved, made friends, and built relationships. In breaking in particular, battling is how b-boys/b-girls improved their skill.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other students to do their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the third book is described as {{the climax of the}} whole work. This is the exposition of the mystical passage of the Chariot found in Ezekiel (cf. Merkavah mysticism). Traditionally, Jewish law viewed this passage as extremely sensitive, and in theory, did not allow it to be taught explicitly at all. The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it properly was if a student had enough knowledge and wisdom to be able to interpret their teacher's hints by themselves, in which case the teacher was allowed to teach them indirectly. In practice, however, the mass of detailed rabbinic writings on this subject often crosses the line from hint to detailed teachings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} a multi-stage research project described through the narratives of the two authors. The research project investigated what students thought were effective (i. e., Good) and less effective (i. e., Bad) <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> English. The paper presents {{some of the main}} findings of the various components of the studies. One important finding relevant to educators working in self-access centres is that students responding to the open-ended portions of the study did not mention electronic, online or multimedia resources, or self-access learning centres (SALCs). Follow-up closed-response questionnaire findings indicated that students evaluated electronic resources and SALCs positively as good <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> outside of class. The authors suggest that a questionnaire-based list of <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> English out of class is an effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> raise students’ awareness of alternatives for learners. Subsequent diary studies showed how participants used ideas that were introduced mainly via the questionnaire for their outside class study...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the many}} values of {{dialogue}} journals is the opportunity {{for the teacher to}} provide informal counseling in a non-threatening, private context for individual students on their challenges and problems, whether about instructional or personal concerns. This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to think through issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E

25|$|Assembly {{language}} is still taught in most computer science and electronic engineering programs. Although few programmers today regularly work with assembly {{language as a}} tool, the underlying concepts remain very important. Such fundamental topics as binary arithmetic, memory allocation, stack processing, character set encoding, interrupt processing, and compiler design {{would be hard to}} study in detail without a grasp of how a computer operates at the hardware level. Since a computer's behavior is fundamentally defined by its instruction set, the logical <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> such concepts is to study an assembly language. Most modern computers have similar instruction sets. Therefore, studying a single assembly {{language is}} sufficient to learn: I) the basic concepts; II) to recognize situations where the use of assembly language might be appropriate; and III) to see how efficient executable code can be created from high-level languages. This is analogous to children needing to learn the basic arithmetic operations (e.g., long division), although calculators are widely used for all except the most trivial calculations.|$|E

Tuttle helps Sam deal with two Central Services workers, Spoor and Dowser, who return to demolish Sam's ducts and seize his apartment {{under the guise of}} fixing the air conditioning. Sam discovers that the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> about Jill is to get transferred to Information Retrieval, where he can access her classified records. He had previously turned down a promotion arranged by his mother, Ida, who is obsessed with the rejuvenating plastic surgery of cosmetic surgeon Dr. Jaffe. Sam retracts his refusal by speaking with Deputy Minister Mr. Helpmann at a party hosted by Ida. Obtaining Jill's records, Sam tracks her down before she can be arrested, then falsifies the records to fake her death, allowing her to escape pursuit. The two share a romantic night together, but are soon apprehended by the government at gunpoint. Charged with treason for abusing his new position, Sam is restrained to a chair in a large, empty cylindrical room, to be tortured by his old friend, Jack Lint. Sam learns that Jill was killed while resisting arrest.|$|E
