2500|$|During {{his early}} career, Ó Domhnaill played a dark journeyman's Guild {{dreadnought}} guitar {{on stage and}} on recordings. In 1977, he commissioned a custom-made guitar from luthier Kenny White who was based out of Portland, Oregon. During the 1990s, he played a 1975 Martin D-28, which he used on his later recordings and stage appearances. In a 1996 interview, Ó Domhnaill observed, [...] "It's gotten louder, fuller, clearer, and more bell-like. It wasn't a great instrument <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it, {{but it was a}} Martin, and I knew it would improve if I played it. I have, and it's worked." [...] Ó Domhnaill also owned a custom-made guitar by another Portland luthier Terry Demezas. He preferred medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings, and used a large triangular Fender medium flatpick when not fingerpicking. For much of his career, he performed with a small quiver of tin whistles and a pedal harmonium.|$|E

[...] "I did it all for you, Elspeth; 'Elspeth's room,' I called it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the mahogany arm-chair, 'That's Elspeth's chair,' I said to mysel'; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the bed, 'It's hers,' I said. Ay; but I was soon disannulled o' that thait, for, in spite of me, they were all got for him. Not a rissom in that room is yours or mine, Elspeth; every muhlen belongs to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honestly, if I'd {{dreamed of}} the chance {{waiting for me}} at Guvutu <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> her for less than three hundred dollars, I'd never have gone {{partners}} with you. And in that case I'd be sailing her right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ormsgill laughed. [...] "I {{want them}} to-morrow. There {{is a good}} deal to do. I have the boys Domingo stole to trace <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> the woman back from Herrero." ...|$|R

Whether it can be, that he means, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> Wegg out, to have me all to himself and to pick me clean to the bones!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may be right. I wish I {{had taken}} in the next ranch <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> Bonaventure. But, from what I gather, you have {{extended}} your operations somewhat rapidly. Is it permissible to ask how you managed in respect to capital?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly what is {{down there}} I don't know, {{and it seems}} a little {{astonishing}} now that I didn't ask Tomlinson <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the mine," [...] he said. [...] "There should be a thousand dollars, anyway. Tom, {{are you going to}} stand shares with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About a dozen," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I {{gave him}} a dollar and a half for the whole stock. I looked into his {{hen-house}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> him out, and found it all in sad condition. I have not had time {{to put it in}} order yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{when her}} sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, [...] "Oh! {{but there were}} two or three much uglier in the shop; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I {{think it will be}} very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight." ...|$|R
60|$|Real estate! That's nothing! Why {{they told}} me that fifteen years ago I could have had all sorts of things,--trunk line railways, sugar refineries, silver mines,--any of them for a song. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> heard it I was half glad I hadn't sung for the land. They told me that there was a time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> could have <b>bought</b> out the Federal Steel Co. for twenty million dollars! And I let it go.|$|R
60|$|Looking back, I always {{consider}} that {{my career as}} a dog proper really started <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>bought</b> for the sum of half a crown by the Shy Man. That event {{marked the end of}} my puppyhood. The knowledge that I was worth actual cash to somebody filled me with a sense of new responsibilities. It sobered me. Besides, it was only after that half-crown changed hands that I went out into the great world; and, however interesting life may be in an East End public-house, it is only when you go out into the world that you really broaden your mind and begin to see things.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> {{you for a}} song, [...] Years ago--Lord {{knows how}} long!-- [...] I was struck--I may be wrong-- [...] By your features, [...] And--a {{something}} in your air [...] That I couldn't quite compare [...] To my other plain or fair [...] Fellow creatures.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} of Beritania Street fell upon his knees. “For God’s sake buy it!” he cried. “You can have all my fortune in the bargain. I was mad <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it at that price. I had embezzled money at my store; I was lost else; I must have gone to jail.” ...|$|E
60|$|HORNBLOWER. Well, I've come to tell ye that I have. I wasn't {{expecting to}} have the need <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought.</b> Thought the Duke would sell me a bit down there; but devil a bit he will; and now I must have those cottages for my workmen. I've got {{important}} works, ye know.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly what}} I did," [...] John agreed, smiling. [...] "I had a {{sovereign}} {{in my pocket}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>bought</b> my ticket; {{and by the time}} I had paid for my dinner on the train, and tipped the men--well, I hadn't a great deal left to go shopping with. I stayed at the St. Pancras Hotel, and telephoned to my solicitor before I got up this morning to have him send me some money. The joke of it was," [...] he went on, joining in the girls' laughter, [...] "that Mr. Appleton has been worrying me for months to come up and talk over reinvestments, and take control of the money my uncle left me; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came at last, I arrived like a pauper. He went out himself and bought my shirt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dude, I {{swear to}} God, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw that Madvillain record, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it on vinyl. I ain't {{have a record}} player. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it on vinyl just {{to stare at the}} album. I stared at it and I just kept going, 'I {{understand}} you'.|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{piece is}} all about happy accidents. I didn’t {{know who she was}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found the recording. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it because it looked interesting. And it was very, very expensive." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} of Beritania Street fell upon his knees. [...] "For God's sake, buy it!" [...] he cried. [...] "You can have all my fortune in the bargain.

6000|$|... "All the same, {{the thing}} which scared {{you put a}} happy thought into my head, and I felt then I could solve it." [...] He lifted {{his head and looked}} around defiantly. [...] "In short, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> your stock in at ten cents on the dollar I knew it was worth par, for I had solved the process." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ahai!' said Puck. 'I {{think this}} will be a very old tale.' 'I warm myself and eat at any fire that I choose, but there is no one to light me a fire or cook my meat. I sold all that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the Magic Knife for my people. It was not right that The Beast should master man. What else could I have done?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It is {{certainly}} the jug <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> for you,” said Wilfrid, looking closely at it; “it was in my portmanteau <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got my bath-robe out this morning, before going to my bath, {{and it was not}} there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> unlocked the portmanteau on my return. Some one had taken it while I was away from the room.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] responded Julia stoutly. [...] "I don't see why I {{should be}} more afraid than you would be; I am weaker, of course, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> found I must sleep {{alone in the house}} <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a {{revolver}} wonderfully cheap, and made the man show me how to use it." ...|$|R
60|$|MITCHENER. Ive {{subscribed to}} the {{regiment}}al band all my life. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> two sarrusophones for {{it out of}} my own pocket. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> sang Tosti's Goodbye for Ever at Knightsbridge in 1880, the whole regiment wept. You are too young to remember that.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{as it were}} a Spirit 'as come to me {{and said}} that I too must give all. In short, I 'ave {{determined}} to sell out my stocks and my shares; my breweries are seven points 'igher than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> them; I knew it was a good investment. I am going to realise everything; I am going to take the money in my hand, and I am {{going to give it to}} the poor.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great Cæsar! isn't all {{speculation}} a risk? Isn't {{the fairest}} kind of shipowning to risk men's lives? And mining--how's that for risk? And {{look at the}} elevator business--there's danger if you like! Didn't I take my risk <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> her? She might have been too far gone; and where would I have been? Loudon," [...] he cried, [...] "I tell you the truth: you're too full of refinement for this world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Percy; I shall {{take your}} advice. I {{expected}} it from what I had heard <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the place; but from hearing nothing of Indians all this time, I had almost forgotten it. I will prepare for defence without {{the loss of}} a day. The house has only one vulnerable point,--the doors and shutters. I will measure them this afternoon, and will get you to take over a letter and forward it to Rosario by the first opportunity, for some sheets of thin iron to cover them with.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He wadna gie a bodle {{to save us}} frae famishing," [...] said Hobbie; [...] "and, if he did, {{the bread}} that <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> wi't would stick in my throat, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> thought {{it was part of}} the price of puir auld Scotland's crown and independence." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kadhem Sharif {{was born}} in 1952 and like his father became obsessed with motorcycles. [...] "I was 12 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> sneaked out on my father's Harley for the first time. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> my first one eight years later, a 1966 Fatboy," [...] Sharif recalls.|$|R

"Crack {{me up to}} the {{old girl}} all you can; tell her I used to write to all sorts o’ people <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got a drop of drink in me; say how {{thoughtful}} I always was of her.

6000|$|... "You were a fool," [...] said Legree; [...] "for I {{meant to}} do well by you, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> you.

Come, Tom, don't you think you'd better be reasonable?--heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire, and join my church!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it!" [...] said Uncle John. [...] "You've made me {{a quarter}} of a million that I don't want. The C.H. & D. stocks were going to pieces <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> them, and I had reason to hope I'd lose a good round sum on them. But the confounded luck turned, and the result is an {{accumulation}} of all this dreadful money. So, my dear Major, before I'm tempted to do some-other foolish thing I've determined to run away, where business can't follow me, and where by industry and perseverance I can scatter some of my ill-gotten gains." ...|$|E

5000|$|He {{also wrote}} travel guides and became travel editor of Playboy, before {{becoming}} a film producer. After producing a film adaption of his 1968 novel Only <b>When</b> <b>I</b> Larf, Deighton <b>bought</b> the film rights to Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshops stage musical Oh, What a Lovely War!. Deighton (whose father served throughout the First World War) wrote the screenplay, taking the action to Brighton’s piers, adding a star-studded prologue and creating the memorable closing sequence of seemingly unending crosses. Deighton, although uncredited, was also the producer of the film. He had his name removed because he was “angry and appalled that people should ask credit for things they had not done”, a move that he later described as [...] "stupid and infantile". That was his last involvement with the cinema.|$|R

50|$|I did run the car {{a little}} bit before I cut it up and I ended up drag racing a classmate, Melvin Hunsinger, who had a 1949 Ford. He beat me.
