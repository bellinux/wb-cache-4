5|$|In {{remembrance of}} the victims there have been erected {{numerous}} memorial sites, funded by private initiatives and public bodies on the orders of the Berlin boroughs, the Berlin House of Representatives or the federal government, which are placed over various places in Berlin. The oldest {{date back to the}} days when the Wall <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> They include monuments, crucifixes and memorial stones, and were visited by foreign politicians during state visits. Together with the border installations, there were also some memorial sites that were removed when the Wall fell. Sites for fallen border guards were especially affected by this. Until the tenth anniversary of the building of the Wall, for every victim the private Berliner Bürger-Verein ("Berlin Citizen Association") placed a white wooden cross {{at the scene of the}} event. They were aided in their effort by the senate of West-Berlin. On 13 August 1971, the memorial site Weiße Keuze ("White Crosses") was inaugurated on the east side of the Reichstag building.|$|E
5|$|The name Masoandrotsiroa (Masoandro) {{was given}} {{to a series of}} {{buildings}} on the Rova grounds. The original Masoandro {{was one of the first}} three residences built by the Rova's founder, Andrianjaka, in the early 17th century, and over time it became the house reserved for occupation by a new sovereign immediately following coronation. This same Masoandro or a restored version of it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> on the Rova grounds and occupied by one of Andrianampoinimerina's wives two hundred years later. However, historic sources offer seemingly contradictory or incomplete accounts of the fate of this historic building. A Masoandro was said to have been relocated from the Rova to Ambohimanga by RanavalonaI. Another source states that Masoandro was demolished at the Rova by RanavalonaII and replaced by a house in brick, only to be demolished again by RanavalonaIII. This last sovereign of Madagascar sought to build a new brick palace, also called Masoandro, with four square corner towers and a higher central tower modelled on the French Residence of Antananarivo. Work began in 1893 but was interrupted by war with France in 1895. The brick foundations of this unfinished Masoandro are still visible today. Still another source states that Masoandro was one of three traditional wooden houses still standing at the Rova when Madagascar was colonised by the French, with the implication that the name was applied to distinct buildings at various times.|$|E

25|$|After {{the smoke}} from the {{explosion}} cleared away it was discovered that the tough old bridge was still intact. One side of the arch was gone, but the span <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> By this time, the French artillery had succeeded in dismounting one of Mayne's cannons and silencing the rest. Victor ordered one of Lapisse's brigades to rush the bridge. When the French soldiers managed to brave the defensive fire and gain a foothold on the north bank, Mayne ordered a retreat to the Salvaterra Pass.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the recent}} fires in San Diego and the {{surrounding}} areas, Sweeney's family was forced to evacuate their home in Rancho Santa Fe and stay with his parents, who live in Ontario, California. He stated in a report on MLB.com that the few possessions that they took for safekeeping were their marriage certificate, three wedding photographs, birth certificates, and two pictures of his children with Pope Benedict, taken {{while they were in}} Rome last year. It was later reported that their house <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> although damaged by smoke and water.|$|E
25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 14th century the Castle Tower, whose {{structure}} up to the first storey has survived to this day, was built, while during the reign over Masovia by Duke Janusz I the Elder, the Curia Maior (Big Manor) was erected between 1407 and 1410. Its facade, which <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> in 1944, was knocked down by the Germans, but has been rebuilt since then. The character of the new residence and its size (47.5 m/14.5 m) decided the change of the buildings status, and from 1414 it functioned as a Prince Manor.|$|E

25|$|Company {{commander}} 2d Lt. Timmermann led an under-strength {{squad of}} {{men from the}} 27 AIB onto {{the west side of}} the bridge, despite the risk that the bridge could be destroyed with them on it. Just as the Americans approached, Corporal Faust set off the secondary explosives. Both the Germans and the Americans watched the smoke and haze clear from the explosion and were shocked to see the bridge <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> Only the charge on the southeast pier, two-thirds of the way across, had exploded, but the weak industrial explosive had failed to bring down the well-built steel bridge.|$|E
25|$|Hillel the Elder, in {{the first}} century BCE, used the rule that {{remittance}} of debts applies only to debts between Jews, to develop a device known as Prosbul in which the debt is transferred to a Beit Din (religious court). When owed to the court rather than to an individual, the debt survives the Sabbatical year. This device, formulated early in the era of Rabbinic Judaism when the Temple in Jerusalem <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> became a prototype of how Judaism was later to adapt to the destruction of the Second Temple and maintain a system based on Biblical law under very different conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1871 {{the militia}} encamped on the Point. In 1875 it was {{selected}} as the site for the new Military College, the students being housed in the Stone Frigate from 1876. A wooden commodore's house, which was shown on a plan dated 1868–70, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> when the Royal Military College of Canada opened in the 1876. By the 1860s, only the Stone Frigate storehouse and one wharf were kept in repair. The old hulks of the War of 1812 were hard aground in the mud and broken by the annual freezing and thawing of Navy Bay and Deadman Bay.|$|E

25|$|By 1990, {{the oldest}} {{building}} needed replacing. A new building next door was considered, {{but the decision}} was made to renovate and add to the Albemarle Middle School building already on that site. The old Central School building has been empty since students were moved to the renovated building next door in 2007. One proposal in 2009 was housing for the elderly, with the auditorium converted for cultural activities. As of 2011, the oldest section <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> The building and the 2-acre property was for sale. In December 2013, after several offers, the Stanly County School Board voted to sell the old building to the city for $150,000.|$|E
25|$|The {{main road}} through the {{community}} is Laurelwood Road, which windingly descends through dense tree cover {{from the top of}} the Chehalem Mountains and past the academy on its way towards Gaston. The name comes from the abundance of laurel trees above the valley that stretch to the top of Bald Peak atop the mountain to the east. By 1981, one of the trees <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> but the compiler of Oregon Geographic Names was informed that the trees were in fact Pacific Madrones. The Washington County Scenic Loop passes through the hamlet. The area also lends its name to a type of soil composed of silt loam.|$|E
25|$|This rune {{stone in}} style Pr3 {{and it is}} one of the runestones in Hagby. was {{discovered}} together with U 151 in a collapsed basement under the eastern part of the foundation of the main building of the farm Lissby. When it was discovered, it <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing</b> but it had been crushed and it crumbled into 50 pieces when it was removed from the wall. It was reassembled but the upper part had been lost and could not be retrieved. In 1931, it was raised in the garden of Hagby. The stone is dark and it is 1.23 m tall and 0.3 m wide. The inscription is damaged in several places.|$|E

25|$|During {{the evening}} of 23 May 1970 the bridge was heavily damaged when boys playing inside the bridge dropped a burning torch, setting alight the tar-coated wooden roof of the tubes. Despite {{the best efforts of}} the Caernarfonshire and Anglesey fire brigades, the bridge's height, construction, and the lack of an {{adequate}} water supply meant they were unable to control the fire, which spread all the way across from the mainland to the Anglesey side. After the fire had burned itself out the bridge <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> but the structural integrity of the iron tubes had been critically compromised by the intense heat. As a consequence the bridge, except for the original stone substructure, was completely rebuilt by Husband & Co.|$|E
25|$|At 12:56, scouts from 89th Reconnaissance Squadron {{arrived on}} a hill {{on the north side}} of Remagen {{overlooking}} the village and were astonished to see that the Ludendorff Bridge <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing.</b> It was the only one that the Germans had not yet blown up in advance of the Allied armies' advance. Lt. Timmerman and Grimball followed the scouts on the rise to see for themselves and radioed the surprising news to Task Force Commander Engemen. Arriving on the rise, Engemen could see retreating German vehicles and forces filling Remagen's streets, all heading over the bridge, which was full of soldiers, civilians, vehicles and even livestock. Previous attacks by Allied aircraft had destroyed the vessels used to ferry civilians and workers across the Rhine. All were now forced to use the bridge.|$|E
25|$|When Operations Officer of Combat Command B Maj. Ben Cothran {{arrived and}} saw that the bridge <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>standing,</b> he radioed Brig. General William M. Hoge, {{commanding}} officer of the Combat Command B, 9th Armored Division. Hoge joined them as quickly as he could. Engemen was cautiously considering his options when Hoge ordered him to immediately move into town and to capture the bridge as quickly as possible. Timmermann had been promoted only the night before to commander of Company A, and Engemen ordered him to take Co. A/14th Cavalry and a company of dismounted infantry into Remagen. Hoge had no intelligence on the number and size of German forces on the east bank. The standing bridge could have been a trap. Hoge risked losing men if the Germans allowed U.S. forces to cross before destroying it and isolating the American troops on the east bank. But the opportunity was too great to pass up.|$|E
