40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{interactions}} among government, universities and enterprises, components of Triple helix model, considering the implementation process of governmental program to foster innovation in Brazil. To do so, we conducted a qualitative exploratory research within five Centers of Support for Innovation Management (Núcleos de Apoio à Gestão de Inovação – Nagis), which are projects financed through support from federal government, in order to encourage innovation in enterprises of the country. <b>We</b> <b>analized</b> trajectory of these Nagis, their methodology and their difficulties during implantation of each center. The source of data was documents and interviews with Nagis’s managers, using a script about the operationalization of project (structure, methodology of innovation management and the experiency with this methodology). Then, <b>we</b> <b>analized</b> the role of the relationship of the component in the Triple Helix model and the development of Nagis. As a main conclusion, we identified that synergy between government, university and industry spheres is limited, which does not allow more relevant advances of this program. The evidences indicate a need to restructure the role of each "helix" aiming at changes in bilateral relations. Companies need to be sensitized more emphatically about the importance of innovation and to adopt a more proactive strategy. We recommend to academy adopts a more entrepreneurial stance and the government should take a position not only as a financier, but coordinatior and facilitator of innovative activities.   Keywords Nagi; Innovation management; Triple Helix. </p...|$|E
