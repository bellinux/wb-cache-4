25|$|Rescue, {{and where}} necessary, resuscitation, should be started {{as early as}} {{possible}} for best results. If conscious, the person should be taken out of the water as soon as possible. In-water resuscitation may increase the chances of a favourable result by a factor of about three, if there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> delay in getting the person out of the water, but the necessary skills require training. Only rescue ventilation is practicable in the water, chest compressions require a suitable platform, so in-water assessment of circulation is pointless. If the person does not respond after a few breaths, cardiac arrest may be assumed, and getting them out of the water becomes the priority.|$|E

[...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out New York gave the film three out of five stars, saying, [...] "The setup is pure Looney Tunes, and indeed, Despicable Me is at its best when trading in the anything-for-a-laugh prankery that was a specialty of the Termite Terrace crowd." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "Despicable Me is a 3D cartoon comedy of whiplash-quick laughs, funny punch lines and a wickedly gimmicky appreciation for 3D."
