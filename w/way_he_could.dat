5|$|Jennings later {{appeared}} on Millionaire in November 2014. Winning the top prize {{was the only}} <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have reclaimed the record from Rutter; however, Jennings finished with only $100,000, leaving him in second place. Jennings later {{appeared on}} the ABC prime time show 500 Questions in 2016; however, as he only lasted four questions, {{he was unable to}} add to his total.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} of the pier was started by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E

60|$|The Angel {{went to his}} {{own room}} puzzled but very depressed. Every day the world had frowned darker upon him and his angelic <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> see how the trouble {{affected}} the Vicar, yet <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not imagine how <b>he</b> <b>could</b> avert it. It was all so strange and unreasonable. Twice again, too, he had been pelted out of the village.|$|R
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing so would be the best <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him alcohol on account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} that the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. When he put this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Grummit made a retort the feebleness {{of which}} was {{somewhat}} balanced by its ferocity, and subsided into glum silence. His back still ached, but, despite that aid to intellectual effort, the only <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> imagine of making the constable look foolish contained an almost certain risk of hard labour for himself.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a sad}} {{pleasure}} to me, as to him, this revival of youthful memories, and I would have spared him if I could, but my father insisted upon having all of the jocund dances and sweet old songs. Although a man of deep feeling in many <b>ways,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not understand the tragedy of my uncle's failing skill.|$|R
5|$|Uttanka {{then saw}} two {{beautiful}} women weaving with {{white and black}} threads on a wheel fixed on the wall. The wheel had twelve spokes and was being turned by six young people. A horse with a rider stood near the wheel. Uttanka praised {{the functioning of the}} weaving process, the rider and the horse, and equated the rider to Indra. Pleased with this praise, the rider asked Uttanka to state in what <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help him. Uttanka requested that he be given the power to bring the snakes under his control. The rider then instructed Uttanka to blow {{at the back of the}} horse. Uttanka did as suggested. Then flames emerged from all parts of the horse's body and filled the realm of the serpents with fire and smoke. The terrified Takshaka came out of hiding and gave up the earrings to Uttanka.|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} is no other <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> win over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart to do whatever he wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E
25|$|Rixi's husband, Salomon Markus, {{also came}} to London. He opposed her efforts to gain {{independence}} in every <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and fought her for custody of their daughter Margo.|$|E
25|$|After {{the prison}} experiment, Zimbardo {{decided to look}} for <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use {{psychology}} to help people; {{this led to the}} founding of The Shyness Clinic in Menlo Park, California, which treats shy behavior in adults and children. Zimbardo's research on shyness resulted in several bestselling books on the topic. Other subjects he has researched include mind control and cultic behavior.|$|R
50|$|By 1951 Bradley was {{training}} under new coach Jim Muir, another successful Scottish coach and after training under McCrae and Muir, Bradley began {{thinking of his}} arm action and <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> improve it to enhance his running. Bradley's curiosity with the upper body's role in sprinting led him to research various upper body training methods and he commenced experimenting with the speedball.|$|R
50|$|In {{years to}} come Money's diligent {{preparation}} for his life's work bore fruit in <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have imagined. Many of the friends he made {{of students in the}} college and in the university later became influential men and held high office in government. It was through these friendships that religious liberty for the evangelical church was finally obtained.|$|R

6000|$|She {{told him}} timidly, {{and it was}} as she had feared. He began abusing her violently for letting spies up into her room, and turning against him, that let her have her house-room, and [...] "worriting" [...] them all with her hypocritical <b>ways.</b> <b>He</b> <b>could</b> tell her there was nothing between her and the workhouse, and all was {{interspersed}} with oaths, terrible to hear.|$|R
6000|$|... "Johannes Agricola in Meditation" [...] {{presents}} {{the doctrine of}} predestination as it appears to a devout and poetic soul whose conviction of the truth of such a doctrine has {{the strength of a}} divine revelation. Those elected for God's love can do nothing to weaken it, those not elected can do nothing to gain it, but it is not his to reason why; indeed, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not praise a god whose <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> understand or for whose love he had to bargain.|$|R
25|$|Owen's {{last two}} years of formal {{education}} saw him as a pupil-teacher at the Wyle Cop school in Shrewsbury. In 1911 he passed the matriculation exam for the University of London, but not with the first-class honours needed for a scholarship, which in his family's circumstances was the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have afforded to attend.|$|E
25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get his ugly, no-talent face {{on television and in}} the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E
25|$|Before his {{appointment}} to the court, Robertson played {{an active role in}} the Oklahoma and national Democratic parties. Robertson was a prominent and influential Democrat in Oklahoma. He offered to help any Democratic candidate in any <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> On a trip with Governor Haskell to Denver, Robertson represented the Oklahoma Democratic Party. Robertson zealously supported the Democratic nomination of William Jennings Bryan for the presidency.|$|E
60|$|Of all {{the amazing}} things which had happened, {{this seemed to}} have {{impressed}} my uncle most, and he recurred to it again and again. That a man whom {{he had come to}} regard as a machine for tying cravats and brewing chocolate should suddenly develop fiery human passions was indeed a prodigy. If his silver razor-heater had taken to evil <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have been more astounded.|$|R
50|$|After loner Dewayne Sykes (Jarrod Cuthrell) {{decides to}} give in to his irrational desire to recreationally murder a stranger, he begins his search for a random victim and finds one in “Miss Fit” (Jen Stedham), a young jogger he spies at a park. After briefly familiarizing himself with her {{neighborhood}} and schedule, he puts his plan into action and commits a murder that will haunt him in <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not anticipate.|$|R
50|$|Davis {{realized}} {{there were many}} <b>ways</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{improve the quality of}} his daily life with Parkinson’s, including through exercise. He started the Davis Phinney Foundation as a way to fund and advance research that demonstrates the benefits of exercise, speech therapy and other behavioral elements that are critical to quality of life with Parkinson’s. It has since expanded to include a variety of programming that helps people with Parkinson’s take {{a more active role in}} their own care.|$|R
25|$|He {{knew that}} another <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> share his wealth was by having biographies written that would both {{set the record}} {{straight}} on him and teach young players how to play. John McCallum spent some time with Cobb to write a combination how-to and biography titled The Tiger Wore Spikes: An Informal Biography of Ty Cobb that was published in 1956. In December 1959, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and Bright's disease.|$|E
25|$|In March 2012, New Orleans Saints {{head coach}} Sean Payton was {{suspended}} for the entire upcoming 2012 season by the NFL for not reporting a bounty system set up by his defense during 2009 and 2010. Upon his suspension, Payton asked his former mentor Parcells {{if he would be}} interested in filling the head coaching vacancy. On April 11, 2012, Parcells revealed in an interview with Mike Tirico that he had decided against joining the Saints but would help Sean Payton in any <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
