5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> {{her and her}} {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, {{some of which may}} have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E

25|$|Until the 19th century, most of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> {{historical}} sign languages {{is limited}} to the manual alphabets (fingerspelling systems) that were invented to facilitate transfer of words from a spoken language to a sign language, rather than documentation of the language itself. Pedro Ponce de León (1520–1584) is said to have developed the first manual alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's {{comprehensive}} treatise {{of mathematical}} astronomy superseded most older texts of Greek astronomy.

25|$|While {{there is}} rich archaeological and {{linguistic}} evidence of earlier Germanic religious ideas, these sources are all mute, and cannot {{be interpreted with}} much confidence. Seen in light of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the medieval survival of the Germanic religions as practiced by the Nordic nations, some educated guesses may be made. However, the presence of marked regional differences make generalization of any such reconstructed belief or practice a risky venture.|$|E
25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> {{the site}} {{is due to the}} large number of altars, {{dedication}} slabs and a milestone dedicated to emperor Gordian III found half a mile away from the fort on the path of Dere Street. Gods worshipped include traditional Roman deities such as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Silvanus and Celtic and Germanic ones such as Garmangabis. From such stones and building inscriptions we know who built the fort and eventually garrisoned it.|$|E
25|$|Along with Antisthenes and Crates of Thebes, Diogenes is {{considered}} one of the founders of Cynicism. The ideas of Diogenes, like those of most other Cynics, must be arrived at indirectly. No writings of Diogenes survive even though he is reported to have authored over ten books, a volume of letters and seven tragedies. Cynic ideas are inseparable from Cynic practice; therefore <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Diogenes is contained in anecdotes concerning his life and sayings attributed to him in a number of scattered classical sources.|$|E

Plato's own most decisive philosophical influences are usually thought to have been Socrates, Parmenides, Heraclitus and Pythagoras, although few of his predecessors' works remain extant and much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> these figures today derives from Plato himself.|$|E

25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Rogers and {{his style}} in {{business}} dealings were recorded by others. His behavior in public Court Proceedings provide {{some of the}} better examples and some insight. Rogers' business style extended to his testimony in many court settings. Before the Hepburn Commission of 1878, investigating the railroads of New York, he fine-tuned his circumlocutory, ambiguous, and haughty responses. His most intractable performance was later in a 1906 lawsuit {{by the state of}} Missouri, which claimed that two companies in that state registered as independents were actually subsidiaries of Standard Oil, a secret ownership Rogers finally acknowledged.|$|E

25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Pythagoras's life {{comes from}} Neoplatonist writers. These writers {{believed}} in the Greek gods, so many myths exist around Pythagoras. Myths about Pythagoras include: Apollo was his father, Pythagoras gleamed with a supernatural brightness, Pythagoras had a golden thigh, Abaris once flew to him on a golden arrow, and Pythagoras was seen in different places at the same time. According to Sir William Smith, {{with the exception of}} a few remarks by Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Isocrates, we are mainly dependent on Diogenes Laërtius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus for biographical details. Burkert (1972, p.109) states that Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus are the most important accounts.|$|E
25|$|Most of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Columbanus {{is based}} on Columbanus' own works (as far {{as they have been}} preserved) and Jonas of Bobbio's Vita Columbani (Life of Columbanus), which was written between 639 and 641. Jonas entered Bobbio after Columbanus' death but relied on reports of monks who still knew Columbanus. A {{description}} of miracles of Columbanus written by an anonymous monk of Bobbio is of much later date. In the second volume of his Acta Sanctorum O.S.B., Mabillon gives the life in full, together with an appendix on the miracles of the saint, written by an anonymous member of the Bobbio community.|$|E
25|$|Much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> the {{elemental}} composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments {{to measure the}} surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars {{in the form of}} meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites—the groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission.|$|E

25|$|The fleet sailed {{further and}} further south, {{avoiding}} the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and become the first to reach Tierra del Fuego {{at the tip of}} the Americas. On October 21, starting in Cape Virgenes, they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600km) long strait that Magellan named Estrecho de Todos los Santos, the modern Strait of Magellan. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named Mar Pacífico because of its apparent stillness. The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the battle of Mactan in the Philippines, leaving the Spaniard Juan Sebastián Elcano the task of completing the voyage, reaching the Spice Islands in 1521. On September 6, 1522 Victoria returned to Spain, thus completing the first circumnavigation of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the Trinidad. Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> this voyage.|$|E
