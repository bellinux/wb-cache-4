5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

He cites Justin Timberlake, Jesse McCartney, Jonas Brothers, Nick Carter, Backstreet Boys, JC Chasez, Christina Aguilera, Busted, Jojo, Lee Ryan, *NSYNC, Jay Sean, Meljohn Magno, and Melmar Magno as some of his musical influences. He also credits Bon Jovi as an influence for his showmanship when performing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the biblical}} Joseph narrative, when Joseph, having settled in Egypt, asks his {{brothers}} to bring Benjamin to him, he takes Simeon hostage {{to ensure that}} they return. According to classical rabbinical sources, Joseph chose Simeon to be the hostage because he was concerned that if Simeon wasn't separated from Levi, then Levi and Simeon might destroy Egypt together, since they had already destroyed Shechem. Another theory was that Joseph singled out Simeon due to his taking a prominent role in Joseph's betrayal, however Driscoll points out that {{there is no mention of}} this in the narrative. According to the midrashic book of Jasher, Simeon wasn't willing to become a hostage, so Joseph sent 70 strong Egyptians to take Simeon by force, but Simeon had a very powerful voice, and so was able to scare off the Egyptians simply by shouting. The text states that Simeon was eventually subdued by Manasseh, and imprisoned. The Testament of Simeon, on the other hand, declares that Simeon acknowledged that it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> him to be imprisoned, given his earlier mistreatment of Joseph, and so he went willingly.|$|E

500|$|As {{editor of}} the Cleveland Press, [...] "Seltzer vigorously {{developed}} the notion that his reporters were watchdogs for the public over political and governmental affairs". According to a 1950 profile of him in LIFE magazine, [...] "No crook in public office has slept well in Louis Seltzer's regime, although many a crook in private pursuits has doubtless slept like a baby". According to later writer James Neff, [...] "When local government did not function, the Press struck with editorial might, {{even if it meant}} using a sledgehammer to crush a gnat. Overkill could be rationalized because the cause <b>was</b> <b>just,</b> <b>for</b> the little guy. Anyone who tried to play outside these rules or who was perceived as looking down on his mostly blue-collar readers, Seltzer enjoyed taking down a peg".|$|E

[...] "I feel much safer with girls, so I felt more comfortable kissing [...] than kissing {{any of the other}} people that I had to kiss", she said. Seyfried's uneasiness in the scene caused [...] "giggling fits" [...] between takes. Seyfried said that neither of them wanted to do the kiss because they felt it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different. Something about it felt uncomfortable for me." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact that we went from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

500|$|During {{the initial}} {{planning}} stage, the team reviewed how fans and critics {{had responded to}} Awakening. While the gameplay and graphics were positively received, the story had been criticized for its quality by the main fan base, even though new players approved of it. To that end, they decided {{to write a story}} that would appeal to series veterans as well as newcomers. The concept of the story changing depending on which protagonists the main character sided with, originated from Yamagami's memories of the , which allowed for choosing different protagonists but did not change the story. Wanting to play from both sides of a conflict and show both sides as neither good nor evil, the team decided to create multiple versions of the game. Initially, the plan <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> a choice between one kingdom or the other, but Yamagami wanted a neutral path where neither side was chosen, so a third version of the game was planned. The game's Japanese title, [...] "If", came from the sheer number of choices featured for players in the game. The English title [...] "Fates" [...] referred to the concept of the main character shaping and changing their fate by choosing a side. After the creation of the three storylines, the team needed to make the decision to divide Birthright and Conquest into separate physical releases. This was because packaging them as a single release would have necessitated raising the game's price to the equivalent of a two-game bundle, which would not benefit people who wanted to play one single version. Another reason for this decision was how easy it had become to add the other versions on as cheaper downloadable content (DLC). This opened up the option for players to run through the game until the crucial decision point in Chapter 5, then buy the alternate routes as downloadable content so they had different choices. Each route was estimated to have the same amount of gameplay and story content as Awakening.|$|E
2500|$|Zheng {{started playing}} tennis {{when she was}} 10, after she saw her older sister play and thought tennis would be good exercise. At first, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> exercise. Zheng was rather small (at 5', 4.5"), {{and she and her}} parents were afraid that she would not have a career in the tennis world. (In fact, she was called [...] "xiao bu dier" [...] by her parents, which {{translates}} into {{something along the lines of}} [...] "small kid." [...] Her stature was no surprise though, for both her parents were short.) They considered her focusing more on her studies, so that if she did not make it in tennis she would be able to get a different job. However, her foreign coach saw potential in her, and told her parents and her something along the lines of, [...] "There are many people in China who read books, but there are few who are national heroes." [...] After that, her parents agreed to allow her to pursue tennis as a profession.|$|E
2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E

2500|$|Then {{they went}} away to Fårö and settled there. They couldn't support {{themselves}} in that place, so {{they went to a}} certain island off the coast of Estland, called Dagö, and settled there and built a town that can still be seen. But they couldn't support themselves there either, so they went up the river Dvina, up through Russia. They went so far that they came {{to the land of the}} Greeks (i.e. the Byzantine empire). They asked leave of the Greek king to stay there while the moon waxed and waned. The king granted that, thinking it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>for</b> one month. Then after a month, he wanted to send them away, but they answered that the moon waxed and waned for ever and always, and so they said they were allowed to stay. Word of this dispute of theirs reached the queen. She said, [...] "My lord king, you granted them permission to dwell while the moon waxed and waned; now that's for ever and always, so you can't take it off them." [...] So they settled there, and live there still, and still have something of our language.|$|E
