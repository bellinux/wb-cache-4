5|$|Earth (1 AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the largest}} and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current {{geological}} activity, and the only place <b>where</b> <b>life</b> is known to exist.

Earth's atmosphere is radically {{different from those of the}} other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.

5|$|Mirror's Edge {{takes place}} in a 'utopian' city <b>where</b> <b>life</b> is {{comfortable}} and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and totalitarian military regime which monitors all communication, controls the media, spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of smoking and alcohol. The City also operates sham trials and runs on a sham democracy. Eighteen years before the events of the game, they had opened fire on a protest against their rule, killing many civilians.|$|E

5|$|Sweet Tooth {{is a love}} story, a spy novel, and a {{book about}} {{literature}} itself. Serena and her boyfriend Haley– she a well-read but uncritical lover of literature, he a highly accomplished writer and literary scholar– have different attitudes towards literature. Serena prefers a realist approach, <b>where</b> <b>life</b> in the book reflects real life. Haley {{on the other hand}} is of a more modernist school, and enjoys experimentation in his work. McEwan plays with these differences, firstly by placing himself in the novel and blurring the line between author and character, and secondly by writing {{what appears to be a}} straight first-person narrative, only to distort this perception at the very end.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His renditions of the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, <b>where</b> <b>life</b> is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Norway has been {{influenced}} to an extraordinary degree by the terrain and {{the climate of}} the region. About 10,000 BC, following the retreat of the great inland ice sheets, the earliest inhabitants migrated north into the territory which is now Norway. They traveled steadily northwards along the coastal areas, warmed by the Gulf Stream, <b>where</b> <b>life</b> was more bearable. In order to survive they fished and hunted reindeer (and other prey). Between 5,000 BC and 4,000 BC the earliest agricultural settlements appeared around the Oslofjord. Gradually, between 1500 BC and 500 BC, these agricultural settlements spread into the southern areas of Norway - whilst {{the inhabitants of the}} northern regions continued to hunt and fish.|$|E

25|$|A debate {{took place}} at the 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in March 2006 in Houston, Texas over the {{postulate}} that carbon-rich content within the pores of the rocks consisted of the remains of living matter. Because carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the universe (after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen), the presence of shapes resembling living organisms was considered insufficient by most attendees to prove that bacteria once lived on Mars. A team concluded in 2014 that although the abiotic scenario is considered to be the most reasonable explanation for the shapes in this meteorite, it is evident that the Martian subsurface contains niche environments <b>where</b> <b>life</b> could develop.|$|E
25|$|For most {{of human}} history higher {{material}} living standards – full stomachs, access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives. This pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries, <b>where</b> <b>life</b> expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases, but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world. Americans live no longer on average (about 77 years in 2004) than Greeks (78 years) or New Zealanders (78), though the USA has a higher GDP per capita. Life expectancy in Sweden (80 years) and Japan (82) – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, {{molecular}} panspermia or quasi-panspermia) {{proposes that}} the organic molecules used for life originated {{in space and}} were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces <b>where</b> <b>life</b> then emerged (abiogenesis). From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from Chandra Wickramasinghe, who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule formaldehyde (CH2O). Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes ionized, often {{as the result of}} an interaction with cosmic rays. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower. The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.|$|E

Influenced by friends like Moses Kotane and by the Soviet Union's support for wars of national liberation, his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Zedong, eventually embracing the Marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism. Commenting on communism, he later stated that he [...] "found [...] strongly drawn to {{the idea of a}} classless society which, to [...] mind, was similar to traditional African culture <b>where</b> <b>life</b> was shared and communal." [...] In April 1952, Mandela began work at the H.M.

And seeing <b>where</b> <b>life</b> was so simple before everything went down with her." [...] Nina even fills in for one of the maids at the hotel, which makes her feel [...] "normal" [...] again. When Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) see Nina, he asks her to perform at the Erinsborough Festival's closing concert, but she turns him down. However, Lou persuades her to change her mind, believing the concert will make her feel better about her life and break up with Jack.|$|E
