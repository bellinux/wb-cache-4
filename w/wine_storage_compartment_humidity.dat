40|$|The GLUT 4 {{system in}} muscle and fat cells plays an {{important}} role in whole-body glucose homeostasis. Insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT 4 from an intracellular <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> to the cell surface. The nature of this compartment remains largely unknown. We review recent studies describing the biogenesis and molecular constituents of the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> and conclude that it is segregated from the endosomal and biosynthetic pathways. Further, we present evidence to suggest that the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> moves directly to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and, hence, is analogous to small synaptic vesicles in neurons. We propose that the GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> be referred to as GLUT 4 storage vesicles or GSVs...|$|R

40|$|An energy {{producing}} device, {{for example}} a submersible vehicle for descending or ascending to different depths within water or ocean, is disclosed. The vehicle comprises a temperature-responsive material {{to which a}} hydraulic fluid is associated. A pressurized <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> stores the fluid {{as soon as the}} temperature-responsive material changes density. The <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> is connected with a hydraulic motor, and a valve allows fluid passage from the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> to the hydraulic motor. An energy storage component, e. g. a battery, is connected with the hydraulic motor and is charged by the hydraulic motor when the hydraulic fluid passes through the hydraulic motor. Upon passage in the hydraulic motor, the fluid is stored in a further <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> and is then sent back to the area of the temperature-responsive material...|$|R

40|$|The glucose {{transporter}} isoform GLUT 4 is unique among the {{glucose transporter}} family of proteins in that, in resting cells, it is sequestered very efficiently in a <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> In insulin-sensitive cells, such as fat and muscle, insulin stimulation leads to release of GLUT 4 from this reservoir and its translocation to the plasma membrane. This process {{is crucial for}} the control of blood and tissue glucose levels. Investigations of the composition {{and structure of the}} GLUT 4 <b>storage</b> <b>compartment,</b> together with the targeting motifs that direct GLUT 4 to this compartment, have been extensive but have been controversial. Recent findings have now provided a clearer consensus of opinion on the mechanisms involved in the formation of this <b>storage</b> <b>compartment.</b> However, another controversy has now emerged, which is unresolved. This concerns the issue of whether the insulin-regulated step occurs at the level of release of GLUT 4 from the <b>storage</b> <b>compartment</b> or at the level at which released vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane...|$|R
