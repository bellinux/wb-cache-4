5|$|On July 21, {{the second}} set of <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> a {{southbound}} Q train jumped the track near Brighton Beach, constituting the system's second derailment within a month. Nine people suffered injuries due to improper maintenance of the car in question.|$|E
5|$|Razer's four-wheeled {{drive train}} used a skid-steering arrangement, whereby the <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> {{one side of}} the robot rotated faster than those on the other to turn the machine. Also, the weight of the robot was biased towards the rear so that its weapon stayed facing its {{opponent}} as Razer turned. However, the solid rubber rear wheels used in series two provided too much traction and were reluctant to 'swing' the machine. For the third series, Razer used custom-made aluminium drive wheels which incorporated rollers, reducing the amount of force required for simultaneous forward and sideways movement. These wheels were later upgraded with a stronger titanium construction, whilst the level of oversteer in the drive system was reduced through the implementation of an electronic gyroscope. For the series Robot Wars Extreme II, Razer's rubber front wheels were replaced with metal ones bearing small spiked protrusions.|$|E
5|$|Rob-B-Hood {{features}} {{a collaboration between}} Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao. The pair, along with Sammo Hung, were Peking Opera School classmates and co-starred {{in a number of}} action comedy films in the 1980s, including Project A, <b>Wheels</b> <b>on</b> Meals, and the Lucky Stars trilogy. Chan had originally intended to co-star with both Yuen and Hung, reuniting the trio {{for the first time since}} 1988 film Dragons Forever. However, Hung declined due to a scheduling conflicts. Yuen Biao plays the role of Police Inspector Steve Mok, assigned to investigate the baby's disappearance. Some of Yuen's past antics were revisited in Rob-B-Hood, including a fight in which he tried in vain to handcuff Chan's character.|$|E

5|$|The {{motorcycle}} sidecar missile used in one chase sequence {{was built}} by film staff at Pinewood and used a standard Kawasaki Z900 and a custom made sidecar outfit. The sidecar was made large enough so that a stuntman could lie flat inside. It had two 10 inch scooter <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> each side, a Suzuki 185 engine and the detached projectile was steered through a small solid rubber wheel at the front. A heavily smoked perspex nose allowed the stuntman sufficient visibility to steer the device whilst being entirely hidden from view. A pincer type lock held the sidecar in place until operated by the pilot via a solenoid switch. The sequences involving the outfit were speeded up as {{the weight of the}} sidecar made the outfit very difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September, {{the press}} {{announced}} that on 8 May 1996 NSB had agreed that Class 71's axles could receive a steel quality substandard to European standard and recommendation from the International Union of Railways. The {{reason was that}} the class would have a much higher weight than planned, and that this would cause the trains to operate more slowly and thus {{not be able to}} reach the airport in the desired 19 minutes. Class 73 inherited the same axle quality from the Class 71 order. On 11 September, Adtranz accepted responsibility for the axle problems, and stated that they would replace all axles free of charge, an operation which would cost them NOK70 million. In October, Adtranz announced that they would also replace all the <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> both classes. NSB was spending NOK1.5 million on brake discs and brake shoes per month. The parties continued to disagree on the size of compensation Adtranz should give NSB, with NOK100 million separating the two. In July, NSB replaced DNV with CorrOcean as their inspection supplier for the class. NSB stated that this halved the cost of the inspections. The same month, Bombardier Transportation, who by then had taken over Adtranz, stated {{that they were going to}} replace the bogie frames for all the Class 71 and 73, as well as Class 93 trains, as part of the compensation deal with NSB.|$|E

25|$|Quad skates are four-wheeled {{turning roller}} skates set in two {{side-by-side}} pairs. In 1863, James Leonard Plimpton of Medford, Massachusetts, invented the first four-wheeled roller skates arranged in two side-by-side pairs. Before Plimpton's invention, all <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> {{the bottom of}} roller skates were inline.|$|E

25|$|Each {{carriage}} {{has four}} <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> a fixed long-wheelbase, {{rather than the}} more usual arrangement of eight wheels attached to bogies.

25|$|T7 Combat Car was a {{prototype}} United States light tank {{design of the}} interwar period. It could run on rubber-tired <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> roads or mount tracks for cross-country use.

25|$|Modern {{electronic}} stability {{control systems}} are an {{evolution of the}} ABS concept. Here, {{a minimum of two}} additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor, and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> the inside of the curve should brake more than <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> the outside, and by how much.|$|E

50|$|The Lords of Bolanden {{stood as}} Imperial ministeriales {{in the service}} of the ecclesiastical Electorate of Mainz, whose coat of arms bore a silver <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> a red ﬁeld. As Mainz vassals, they used the same arms, but in {{different}} tinctures, with a red <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> a gold ﬁeld. Their successors, the Falkensteins and the Hohenfelses, originally bore the Bolanden wheel in their arms, but in different tinctures once again, namely a silver <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> a blue ﬁeld. Later the Hohenfelses bore gold cloverleaves. The newer line of Hohenfels-Reipoltskirchen also bore a silver <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> the helm. Only after the older Hohenfels line died out in 1415 did the local lords adopt the arms that they had borne until now as the noble family’s arms, which since 1290 had borne, instead of the wheel, an anchor “reversed” (that is, upside down to the way it usually appears in heraldry) on a green ﬁeld scattered with gold “billets”. Until the Hohenfels-Reipoltskirchens died out in 1602, the arms were quarterly with the silver <b>wheel</b> <b>on</b> blue in the ﬁrst and fourth ﬁelds and the silver anchor with the ten billets on green in the second and third ﬁelds.|$|R

25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley {{at the top of the}} hill. A 185kW 550V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. <b>Wheels</b> <b>on</b> the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite <b>wheels</b> <b>on</b> each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|E
