When the curtains flapped, grey lights puffed across her. Between the spasms of the storm, Helen made the curtain fast, shook the pillows, stretched the bed-clothes, and smoothed the hot nostrils and forehead with cold scent.|$|R

50|$|The {{side of the}} {{transformer}} {{facing the}} line, in a good quality design, will have the <b>winding</b> <b>laid</b> in two parts (often with a centre tap provided) which are carefully balanced to maintain the line balance. Line side and equipment side windings are more useful concepts than the more usual primary and secondary windings when discussing these kinds of transformers. At the sending end the line side winding is the secondary, but at the receiving end the line side winding is the primary. When discussing a two-wire circuit primary and secondary cease to have any meaning at all, since signals are flowing in both directions at once.|$|R
5000|$|Frye believed, {{and thought}} Crawford's [...] "poetic sense" [...] told her, [...] "that {{the most obvious}} {{development}} in the romantic landscape is toward the mythological"; and he saw Crawford's attempt at an indigenous Canadian myth as the intellectual equivalent of the simultaneous pioneer exploration and settlement: [...] "In the long mythopoeic passage from Isabella Crawford's Malcolm's Katie, beginning 'The South <b>Wind</b> <b>laid</b> his moccasins aside,' we see how the poet is, first, taming the landscape imaginatively, as settlement tames it physically, by animating the lifeless scene with humanized figures, and, second, integrating the literary tradition of the country by deliberately re-establishing the broken cultural link with Indian civilization." ...|$|R
60|$|Our trip {{around the}} {{reservation}} with the Agent began {{a few days}} later with an exultant drive across the prairie to the South Fork of the Canadian River. It was glorious summer here. Mocking birds were singing in each swale, and exquisite flowers starred the sod beneath our wheels. Through a land untouched by the white man's plow, we rode on a trail which carried me back to my childhood, to the Iowa Prairie over which I had ridden with my parents thirty years before. This land, this sky, this mournful, sighing <b>wind</b> <b>laid</b> hold of something very sweet, almost sacred in my brain. By great good fortune I had succeeded in overtaking the vanishing prairie.|$|R

40|$|The Pacoima area {{consists}} of Miocene (sediments and basalts) rocks underlain by a quartz diorite basement complex of Jurassic age. The stratigranhic units range from 25 feet {{to more than}} 600 feet in thickness. The lower sediments are arkosic land- <b>laid</b> <b>deposits</b> while the Modelo formation, shallow marine in origin, {{consists of}} thinly bedded sandstones, shales, volcanic ash and calcareous members. An andesitic mass, possibly a volcanic plug, outcrops near the summit {{of one of the}} hills. An anticline, and possibly an associated syncline, has been developed by compressional folding. Small scale contortion is locally exposed. Regional dip is northward, decreasing from south to north in the area. Faulting is common, most faults trending nearly north-south. Movement along these faults ranges from a few feet to several hundred feet. There are no important mineral deposits in the area. Quarrying of the basement rocks has been abandoned. ...|$|R

6000|$|As the North Wind had said, {{so did the}} King. He {{stood on}} the stairs, and when the North Wind came howling and roaring, and caught the roof and walls of the castle till they shook again, the Prince went out {{to see what was}} the matter; but as soon as he came the King took him by the neck and flung him out, and then the North <b>Wind</b> <b>laid</b> hold of him and carried him off. And when he was rid of him the King went into the castle. At first the Queen did not know him, because he had grown so thin and pale from having {{travelled}} so long and so sorrowfully; but when she saw her ring she was heartily glad, and then the rightful wedding was held, and held {{in such a way that}} it was talked about far and wide.(12) ...|$|R

60|$|How often, {{on their}} journey, did the widow {{remember}} with a grateful heart, {{that out of}} his deprivation Barnaby's cheerfulness and affection sprung! How often did she call to mind that but for that, {{he might have been}} sullen, morose, unkind, far removed from her--vicious, perhaps, and cruel! How often had she cause for comfort, in his strength, and hope, and in his simple nature! Those feeble powers of mind which rendered him so soon forgetful of the past, save in brief gleams and flashes,--even they were a comfort now. The world to him was full of happiness; in every tree, and plant, and flower, in every bird, and beast, and tiny insect whom a breath of summer <b>wind</b> <b>laid</b> low upon the ground, he had delight. His delight was hers; and where many a wise son would have made her sorrowful, this poor light-hearted idiot filled her breast with thankfulness and love.|$|R

500|$|The Southern Uplands are a {{range of}} hills almost [...] long, {{interspersed}} with broad valleys. They lie south of a second fault line running from Ballantrae towards Dunbar. The geological foundations largely comprise Silurian <b>deposits</b> <b>laid</b> down some 4-500 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|When the Exposition was finished, {{the gardens}} were {{redesigned}} into an English landscape garden; groves of trees were planted, <b>winding</b> paths <b>laid</b> out, and a stream and grotto were constructed. The gardens remained {{in place for}} the Paris Universal Exposition of 1889. For the Paris International Exposition of 1937 the palace was replaced by a modernist structure and the fountains were rebuilt, but the picturesque gardens on the hillsidewere left as they were. (See parks and gardens of the 1930s below).|$|R
50|$|All {{the rocks}} exposed {{in the area}} of Southerndown are {{sedimentary}} rocks. They were <b>laid</b> down as <b>deposits</b> of mud silt, sand and lime that, over long periods of time, were compacted and solidified into limestone, shale (compacted mud) and conglomerate (a rock comprising rounded pebbles of various sizes).|$|R
50|$|The {{rocks of}} the Caliente range are {{dominated}} by marine and terrestrial sedimentary <b>deposits</b> <b>laid</b> down over the last 30 million years. Within them are some volcanic units, prominent particularly in the foothills beginning at the Carrizo Plain. These volcanic rocks are of Tertiary age, and are mostly basalt.|$|R

Paired {{eggs are}} <b>laid</b> and <b>deposited</b> on shallow sand, mud, pebble or gravel bottoms [...] Up to 170 egg cases can be laid {{by a single}} female in a year, average {{fecundity}} around 48-74 eggs. In northwestern Europe, egg cases are laid during spring. and in the Mediterranean during winter and spring. Egg cases are oblong capsules with stiff pointed horns at the corners, each containing one embryo. Capsules are 5.0-9.0 cm long without the horns and 3.4-6.8 cm wide. Egg cases are anchored with an adhesive film.|$|R
5000|$|The three {{neighbouring}} Provinces of Asti, Cuneo, and Alessandria {{incorporate the}} Langhe and Monferrato hill {{region in the}} centre of Piedmont, limestone and sandstone <b>deposits</b> <b>laid</b> down by the retreating Adriatic some 5 million years ago, and are {{home to some of}} Italy's most known red wines, plus some white ones.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{on top of}} {{everything}} else, is a relatively thin layer of fanglomerate (alluvial fan <b>deposits)</b> <b>laid</b> down during the late Pleistocene (Bureau of Land Management 1992:31). Differential erosion of rocks of different hardness finished the job of sculpting the formations into the fantastic shapes that can be seen in Rainbow Basin today (Dibblee 1968:52).|$|R
50|$|The Interior Plains {{continued}} to receive deposits from the eroding Rocky Mountains {{to the west}} and Appalachian and Ozark/Ouachita Mountains to the east and south throughout the era.

I was trying to read by the last light that died on the lawn a long poem of the decadent period, a poem about the old gods of Babylon and Egypt, about their blazing and obscene temples, their cruel and colossal faces.|$|R
