There was a revived interest in carols at the time, and he rediscovered old carols, provided new settings for others and introduced contemporary works. Many of his harmonisations are still in use today. He published a volume Christmas Carols New and Old which was a considerable success, with thousands of copies sold. He followed this up <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> the following year to which he persuaded Arthur Sullivan to contribute. He also composed several hymn tunes, and some of these are still to be found in Anglican hymnals, with [...] "Love divine, all loves excelling" [...] being popular at wedding services. Other parish music followed with a congregational Te Deum in C which was regularly sung at Magdalen on Sundays and a verse anthem [...] "Sing a song of praise". Two more substantial anthems, intended for use in cathedrals, were [...] "Lead kindly light" [...] composed in 1868, followed by [...] "Awake, awake, put on thy strength" [...] in 1871. He also produced two evening canticles and a comprehensive set of music for morning, communion and evening services. He had also been working for a long time on his first theoretical work, A Theory of Harmony Founded on the Tempered Scale, published by Novello in 1871.|$|E

5000|$|Frithegod served Oda {{as one of}} the {{teachers}} of Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester, but he is generally known for his Latin poem Breviloquium Vitae Wilfridi, a hexameter work based on Stephen of Ripon's prose Life of St Wilfrid. The subject of both Frithegod and Stephen's works was Wilfrid, a late 7th and early 8th-century bishop and saint. Oda ordered the Breviloquium to commemorate Oda's securing of Wilfrid's relics around 950. Preceding the poem is a prose description of the actual acquisition, supposedly written by Oda, but more probably, {{on the basis of the}} writing style, written by Frithegod. The historian Michael Lapidge describes the Breviloquium as [...] "one of the most difficult Latin poems written in pre-conquest England". It is 1400 lines and its meaning is not always clear, even when compared to the Life of St Wilfrid which was its basis. The poetic word adds nothing new to historian's knowledge of Wilfrid, being mainly a poetic exercise to show off Frithegod's writing. It contains a number of neologisms and Greek words, the rarity of some of which imply that Frithegod had some knowledge of the Greek language. The Breviloquium was influenced by Biblical hermeneutics, a type of study of biblical texts. A modern edition of the Breviloquium was published in 1950 <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> appearing in the Biblioheca hagiographica latina series as number 8891.|$|E

50|$|Identification of a {{particular}} Bible as belonging to a specific edition {{is complicated by the}} flexibility of the whole production process at the time. The text, being set in movable type, could be corrected or changed {{in the middle of a}} print run; thus copies of a given edition may differ on some pages. Also, at the binding stage, a title page from one edition might be combined <b>with</b> text from <b>another</b> <b>edition.</b> The exact origins of a Bible can therefore only be determined by detailed examination of the text. Print runs for early Bibles were relatively short by present-day standards; typically perhaps 1000 to 2500 copies.|$|R
