5|$|Based on its size, the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> a folivore, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard seeds.

5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable to a former 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E

5000|$|Poor {{children}} face limited educational opportunities. According to an AWO-Study only 9% of {{the pupils}} visiting the Gymnasium are poor. Poor children <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to experience adversities beyond money. They <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> {{raised by a}} teenage-parent. They <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> to have multiple young siblings, <b>are</b> more <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> raised in crime-ridden neighbourhoods {{and more likely to}} live in substandard apartments which are often overcrowded.

5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s. The Kikuyu custom {{at the time was}} to divide boys into age groups, in which they would be initiated into manhood together. The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he <b>was</b> <b>likely</b> born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious belief, and was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock. When he was ten years old, his earlobes were pierced to mark his transition away from childhood.|$|E
30|$|These risks <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> further {{enhanced}} if {{the domain}} of investment is high-tech focus. Although, the FVCs possess high opportunity recognition potential with respect to high-tech domains, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to possess lower depth of local networks that guard them against information asymmetry risks (Wright et al., 2005). On the contrary although the DVCs <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to possess {{better understanding of the}} socio-cultural-institutional context, traditionally high-tech investing has not been their forte. Naturally, each of these VCs firm categories <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to use different strategies to negotiate the underlying risks.|$|R
30|$|Assuming {{traditional}} gender roles, it thus {{follows that}} the combined effect of CLM and education will differ {{for men and}} women. More generally, Predictions 2 and 3 regarding education depend on whether {{men and women are}} predominantly WiHo workers or employers of WiHo. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> on the employer side, the more the combined effect of education and CLM on couple formation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> negative. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> WiHo workers, the less CLM <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to affect couple formation of the college-educated.|$|R
