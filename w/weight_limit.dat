5|$|On December 17, 2010, PennDOT's District 4 downposted the bridge's <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> to four tons due to {{deterioration}} on the bridge. PennDOT {{will also}} front $350,000$500,000 to replace 70 planks on the bridge, which will then restore the weight back to seven tons. Signage has already adjusted for the demotion by both PennDOT and Sullivan County. Replacement began on April 18, 2011 of 64 stringer beams and on May 25, {{the project was}} completed, {{less than a month}} ahead of schedule. The seven-ton <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> was also restored {{as a result of the}} completed construction. The cost of the project totaled out to $493,000 (2011USD).|$|E
5|$|Hughes' next fight {{took place}} at , where he was {{scheduled}} to fight Judo practitioner Karo Parisyan. After Parysian suffered a hamstring injury and could not fight, Joe Riggs took his place. The match was originally scheduled as a title bout, but since Riggs could not meet the 170-pound <b>weight</b> <b>limit,</b> it became a non-title fight. It marked the first time for the UFC that a title fight had to be called off for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Early 20th-century weight limits were enacted {{to protect}} dirt and gravel roads from {{damage caused by}} the solid wheels of heavy trucks. As time passed, truck weight limits focused {{primarily}} on gross weight limits (which had no prescribed limits on length). By 1974, bridges received special protection from increasing truck weight limits. The bridge formula law was enacted by the U.S. Congress to limit the weight-to-length ratio of heavy trucks, and to protect roads and bridges from {{the damage caused by}} the concentrated weight of shorter trucks. The formula effectively lowers the legal <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> for shorter trucks, preventing them from causing premature deterioration of bridges and highway infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Clottey fight, {{negotiations}} began {{to pursue a}} contest against Manny Pacquiao (49-3-2, 38 KOs). Even before Pacquiao defeated Ricky Hatton, Bob Arum, who represents both Cotto and Pacquiao, stated that {{he was interested in}} this matchup. Subsequently, Pacquiao expressed interest in fighting Cotto. The fight was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> is 147 pounds, however Cotto's camp agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds to accommodate Pacquiao's smaller physique. Cotto's camp also conceded the larger share of the purse to Pacquiao, who received a 65% share of pay-per-view buys, compared to Cotto's 35% share.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} opening, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} bridge's safety. Following an inspection by John Hawkshaw and Edwin Clark in 1861, an additional support chain was added on each side. Despite the strengthening there were still concerns about its soundness, and a <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> of 5 tons was imposed. At the same time, the name was changed from Victoria Bridge to Chelsea Bridge, as the government {{was concerned about the}} reliability of suspension bridges and did not want a potential collapse {{to be associated with the}} Queen.|$|E

5|$|The Six Man Tag Team Street Fight {{between the}} team of Jay Lethal and MCMG (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin) and {{the team of}} Johnny Devine and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). The {{stipulation}}s were if Lethal and MCMG won then Team 3D {{would be forced to}} work with a <b>weight</b> <b>limit,</b> while if Devine and Team 3D won the TNA X Division would dissemble. Another added stipulation before the contest was whoever gained the pinfall would win the TNA X Division Championship. It lasted twelve minutes and thirty seconds. A Street Fight is fought under no disqualification and no count-out rules, with weapons legal and provided for the match. During the final minutes, both Sabin and Shelley were scripted to appear unconscious at ringside, which caused Lethal to have to fight off Devine and Team 3D alone. Near the end of the match Team 3D set up a table; Lethal followed by sending both out of the ring and laying Devine over the table. Lethal then stood {{on the top of a}} padded turnbuckle and jumped off to perform an elbow drop on Devine through the table to win the match. With the victory, Lethal won the TNA X Division Championship, prevented the X Division from disbanding, and forced Team 3D to work with a <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> in the company.|$|E
5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had {{captured the imagination of}} the public, and the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that it was close to the Civil Engineer's maximum <b>weight</b> <b>limit.</b> Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1870s, {{the only}} {{requirement}} {{for a dog}} to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book The Dog in Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver {{than that of the}} Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and English Springer Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.|$|E

5|$|The offset boiler {{and coal}} bunker caused the locomotive's {{centre of gravity}} to be shifted to one side. Experiments had to be {{undertaken}} to balance the locomotive by filling the linking corridor with large quantities of scrap metal, replaced in a re-design by a raised floor, covering the weighted material. These modifications resulted in the engine exceeding the total <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> of 150 tons (151 tonnes), severely limiting the design's route availability during testing. A related problem was that despite being a tall locomotive, at , the cab ceilings were relatively low. The cab at the smokebox end of the locomotive suffered from the same excessive heat as did the fireman's cab. To circumvent this problem the locomotive was used in reverse, as the rear cab was next to the water tank and coal chute and therefore away from the hot gases circulating inside the smokebox.|$|E
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the hydraulic rams which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the New York – Pennsylvania Joint Bridge Commission, a {{predecessor}} of the current Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, in the 1920s to buy out these bridges from private ownership, the tolls along the bridges of the Delaware were beginning to come to an end. The Commission offered the Bridge Company an offer of $19,542.22 (1920s USD). The company took the offer and under new ownership, the tolls were eliminated. The bridge had more activity after the elimination of tolls and business continued to prosper. With the new owners, the bridge was kept under routine maintenance, and the bridge has continued to maintain a strong structure. Even with the floods from Hurricanes Connie and Diane of 1955 and the 1960s, the bridge survived with little to no structural damage. From May to October 1986, the commission closed the bridge to do some renovations. The wooden deck was replaced, the entire bridge was painted, and new guide rails were constructed. The only thing is that the 3 ton (6000lb) <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> remained after the revamping. On November 14, 1988, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{some of the}} {{existing}} teams, Forti was able to test its chassis extensively {{prior to the start}} of the season. However, Diniz proved to be around seven seconds per lap off the pace of the leading runners in group testing at the Estoril circuit in March, indicating that the team was likely to be mired at the back of the field. Diniz finished 10th in the season-opening Brazilian GP, but was seven laps down on winner Michael Schumacher. In Argentina, this situation became worse, as, although both drivers finished, they were both nine laps down on winner Damon Hill at the end of the race (with Diniz ahead) and neither were classified, as they had failed to complete 90% of the race distance. The drivers' similar fastest laps during the race were over ten seconds slower than Schumacher's fastest race lap, and almost five seconds slower than the next slowest runner's fastest lap (Domenico Schiattarella in the Simtek). Imola was similarly poor, as both drivers finished seven laps down (with Diniz again ahead) and again failed to reach the 90% threshold for classification. Forti was already the butt of paddock jokes, and were far slower than the other (and financially poorer) backmarkers: Pacific, Simtek, and Minardi. However, the budget enabled improvements to be made to the car. During the season, its weight was reduced by a significant 60 kilograms (approximately 10% of the F1 minimum <b>weight</b> <b>limit</b> of 595kg), and a semi-automatic gearbox, an airbox and redesigns of the front wing, sidepods and monocoque were introduced. The personnel count also doubled during the course of the season. This resulted in a gradual improvement in pace throughout the year, and there were no more non-classified finishes.|$|E
