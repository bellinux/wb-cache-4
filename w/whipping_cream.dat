50|$|In Europe, where {{production}} {{and use of}} <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers originated, there are presently 3 factories involved in its production. Standard size for <b>whip</b> <b>cream</b> chargers is 8 grams of nitrous oxide per cartridge. <b>Whipped</b> <b>cream</b> chargers are intended for low-volume or occasional use, such as home kitchens, restaurants, and coffee shop applications. For very high volume commercial use, there do exist regulated tank systems for filling much larger containers and dispensing more <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> These are more desirable if volume is in excess of a production level of 10 liters per hour. <b>Whipped</b> <b>cream</b> chargers {{are designed to be}} opened with a device that punctures the thin metal seal at the narrow end of the tube; <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> dispensers have this integrated into the device's cap.|$|R

5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk fat on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of <b>whipping</b> <b>cream</b> (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy <b>whipping</b> <b>cream,</b> a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

40|$|Vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are {{nowadays}} {{a popular}} {{alternative to the}} traditional dairy <b>whipped</b> <b>creams.</b> The emulsions standing {{at the base of}} vegetable <b>whipped</b> <b>creams</b> are classified as O/W emulsions. During whipping air is incorporated and entrapped by a fat crystallize network. This is achieved by the fat droplets interaction through the partial coalescence mechanism. Hence the presence of a crystalline fat phase is imperative within the formulation of the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream.</b> In order to control the partial coalescence and stabilize both the emulsion and the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream,</b> emulsifiers are required. Therefore in such systems, proteins and LMW surfactants coexists and dictate the degree and rate of partial coalesce. This allows the tailoring of the sensorial attributes and physico-chemical properties of the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> (e. g. stability, overrun, texture). Nevertheless the impact of the components on the <b>whipped</b> <b>cream</b> properties has to be understood as a whole and not as individual effects of fats, proteins and LMW surfactants...|$|R

40|$|<b>Whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are oil-in-water {{emulsion}} which by whipping can be formed to a foam by {{the incorporation of}} air into the system. Traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are made out of milk but today imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat has gained {{a large share of}} the marked due to their many benefits compared to traditionally <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> Imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are both cheaper and more flexible than traditionally creams. By vary the characteristics of the fat system and the cream recipe the properties of the imitation creams can be adapted to fit the purpose of a specific product. The aim of this thesis was to increase the understanding of how different types of fat systems and other ingredients affect the properties of imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> based on vegetable fat. This was done by studying three vegetable fat systems with different physicochemical properties. The properties of the fat systems were characterized and the three fat systems were then used for making different imitation <b>whipping</b> <b>creams.</b> The properties of the creams were characterized and the properties of the fat systems and the creams were assessed and compared with each other. The study showed that the fat characteristics that generally seem to have the highest impact on the properties of <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> are the structure, the solid fat content and the crystallization temperature of the fat. A fat solution with a hard structure, a high crystallization temperature and a high solid fat content at a wide range of temperatures overall seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with the best properties. This as these fat properties provide the creams with a high foam stability, a high overrun and a short whipping time. This study has also shown that other ingredients than the fat systems provide the creams with diverging properties. This is best shown by the results of the freeze-thaw stability which indicate that a recipe with a high amount of sugar seem to provide the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> with good freeze-thaw stability. Other properties of the <b>whipping</b> <b>creams</b> also seem to be very much influenced by other ingredients than the fat systems but further studies are needed to provide clarity to the complexity of the interplay of the ingredients in <b>whipped</b> <b>creams...</b>|$|R
