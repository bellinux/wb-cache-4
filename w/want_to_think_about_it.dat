2500|$|Jeff Gordon scored {{his record}} 5th {{win in the}} Brickyard 400 after passing Kasey Kahne on a restart with 17 laps to go. The race was {{dominated}} {{by a variety of}} pit strategies. Kasey Kahne lead the most laps in the race with 70 as Hendrick powered cars led 127 of the 160 laps. [...] "Those emotions take over. There's nothing better, especially in a big race, coming to Victory Lane with your family here," [...] said an emotional Gordon. [...] "I was trying so hard with 10 to go not to focus on the crowd. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> too much, but you can't help it." [...] "Looking back, I should have chosen the (outside lane)," [...] Kahne said. [...] "They pretty much let Jeff control that restart. I took off and never spun a tire and the inside had been more grip throughout the race and I started on the inside and I {{thought it was a great}} decision. But I didn't spin a tire and Jeff drove right by me before we were even got to the second (restart line)." ...|$|E

60|$|GEORGE (smiling). There's no {{question}} in your mind. But you hadn't thought about it--your Federation hasn't thought about it, or doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and your employers don't want to, either.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Miss Abbeway," [...] he said, [...] "we don't need to quarrel about this. That paper I {{came across}} {{has a special}} {{interest}} for me personally. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> before I say anything to a soul in the world." ...|$|E

50|$|After Anwar plays a victim, he cannot continue.

6000|$|... "I {{know all}} you can say," [...] she wailed; [...] "I daresay {{a lot of it}} is true.

[...] In 2008, Bob Stanley of The Guardian commented on the album's failure, noting that it [...] "emerged in a far less adventurous era than the one Too-Rye-Ay was released into. New mavericks on the block such as the Smiths and the Jesus and Mary Chain were entirely ignored by Radio 1. The same happened to Dexys, though it was their own fault - no single was released from the album." ...|$|E

50|$|God is {{a metaphor}} for a mystery that {{absolutely}} transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.|$|E
5000|$|Stone {{began writing}} songs with Jonathan Shorten and Conner Reeves in Devon in early 2008. Since {{they did not}} have a studio or any musicians, she paid a visit to Mama Stone's, a music venue that her mother was {{building}} at an old house in Wellington, Somerset, using the downstairs level as a performance space and the upstairs portion as writing rooms and a recording studio. After noticing a vocal booth recently finished by construction crews, Stone was inspired to record an album. [...] "I woke up the next day and it was like, 'I want to make an album and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I don't want to collect songs. I want to make it—now!'", Stone said.|$|E
5000|$|... "Let Me Out" [...] is {{the fifth}} single from the band's album Humanz and was {{produced}} by Damon Albarn, Remi Kabaka and the album's executive producer The Twilite Tone.

The song was written by Albarn, on a train journey, when conceptualising the album, Pusha T wrote his verse upon meeting Albarn and Gorillaz co-collaborator Jamie Hewlett in London. The song tackles the subject of politics, specifically the inauguration of Donald Trump, {{in much the same}} way as their earlier song [...] "Hallelujah Money" [...] did. When speaking to Zane Lowe, who premiered the song on his Apple Music Beats 1 radio show, Pusha said [...] "When I get over there, Damon begins to tell me to conceptualize the album as a party for the end of the world, like if Trump were to win. … I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but that did give me a very colorful backdrop … I wrote from the perspective of this day … from the perspective of a Trump win." ...|$|E
