40|$|NASAs LSP {{customers}} {{and the future}} SLS program rely on observations of upper-level winds for steering, loads, and trajectory calculations for the launch vehicles flight. On the day of launch, the 45 th Weather Squadron (45 WS) Launch Weather Officers (LWOs) monitor the upper-level winds and provide forecasts to the launch team via the AMU-developed LSP Upper <b>Winds</b> <b>tool</b> for launches at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. This <b>tool</b> displays <b>wind</b> speed and direction profiles from rawinsondes released during launch operations, the 45 th Space Wing 915 -MHz Doppler Radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP, and output from numerical weather prediction models. The goal of this task was to splice the wind speed and direction profiles from the 45 th Space Wing (45 SW) 915 -MHz Doppler radar Wind Profilers (DRWPs) and KSC 50 -MHz DRWP at altitudes where the wind profiles overlap to create a smooth profile. In {{the first version of}} the LSP Upper <b>Winds</b> <b>tool,</b> the top of the 915 -MHz DRWP wind profile and the bottom of the 50 -MHz DRWP were not spliced, sometimes creating a discontinuity in the profile. The Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Natural Environments Branch (NE) created algorithms to splice the wind profiles from the two sensors to generate an archive of vertically complete wind profiles for the SLS program. The AMU worked with MSFC NE personnel to implement these algorithms in the LSP Upper <b>Winds</b> <b>tool</b> to provide a continuous spliced wind profile. The AMU transitioned the MSFC NE algorithms to interpolate and fill data gaps in the data, implement a Gaussian weighting function to produce 50 -m altitude intervals in each sensor, and splice the data together from both DRWPs. They did so by porting the MSFC NE code written with MATLAB software into Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). After testing the new algorithms in stand-alone VBA modules, the AMU replaced the existing VBA code in the LSP Upper <b>Winds</b> <b>tool</b> with the new algorithms. They then tested the code in the LSP Upper <b>Winds</b> <b>tool</b> with archived data. The tool will be delivered to the 45 WS after the 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is complete and the tool is tested with real-time data. The 50 -MHz DRWP upgrade is expected to be finished in October 2014...|$|R

40|$|One {{major source}} of {{uncertainty}} in fire behavior predictions is the spatial variation in winds blowing over mountainous terrain. Fire managers have not had access to “real time” predictions of surface wind flow. With the generous support of the JFSP and additional funding from several USDA Forest Service sources a <b>wind</b> simulation <b>tool</b> has been developed and tested. This project had three primary objectives: 1. Support wildland fire incident management teams with surface wind flow simulations. 2. Validate, improve and document the utility of gridded wind as a fire management decision support tool. 3. Produce technical documentation, including a user’s guide, help tools, and tutorials for the standalone <b>wind</b> simulation <b>tool.</b> A rapid response team was formed and supported fire management operations in the US during the 2006, 2007 and 2008 fire seasons. More than 2000 wind simulations on hundreds of fires across US have been completed. The wind models developed {{are being used to}} support research and land management focused on fire growth and intensity but also unexpected applications like flying insect pheromone dispersion, and seed dispersal. Fire managers have found the <b>wind</b> simulation <b>tools</b> to provide reliable, timely, and detailed information needed for informed fire management decisions. The tools have also provided valuable information about the conditions leading to firefighter entrapments. In the original proposal we proposed that success of the research team in meeting the stated objectives be measured by three methods: 1) the degree to which gridded wind technology is adopted and used by fire management teams (simply accounting of the number of people using it), 2) keeping a record of comments and statements from users regarding the utility of the technology as a decision support tool, 3) objective comparison of simulated and measured wind data to quantify the accuracy of the tool. By all three metrics this effort has been a success. Not one, but two <b>wind</b> simulation <b>tools</b> have been developed. One is based on a commercial software code and therefore comes with an associated license fee, but it also is more accurate due to additional included physics and is computationally more intensive. The second was developed by the research team as a free, less accurate, but computationally faster alternative. The bottom line is that there is little excuse for any fire fighting crew or fire management team not having some capability to simulate surface air flow. Our efforts have demonstrated significant advantages in terms of more accurate fire behavior predictions, increased public and firefighter safety, and more effective use of firefighting resources...|$|R

30|$|Several <b>wind</b> power {{forecasting}} <b>tools</b> {{have been}} developed across the world. A <b>Wind</b> Power Prediction <b>Tool</b> (WPPT) is developed to predict the wind power on various time scales, from {{half an hour to}} 36  h ahead. This tool is based on adaptive recursive least square estimation with exponential forgetting factor [16]. The WPPT can forecast the wind power production in relatively large geographical regions. For each individual wind farm, it uses statistical models to describe the relationship between observed power production and the weather predictions. Another tool named as the Prediktor developed at Risø mainly uses physical relations to transform the predicted wind into predicted power [17]. The Zephyr tool is the combination of the <b>Wind</b> Power Prediction <b>Tool</b> (WPPT) and Prediktor tool and its main goal is to merge Prediktor and WPPT to obtain synergy between the physical and the statistical approach [17]. The Sipreolico tool, developed by the University of Carlos III of Madrid, consists of nine adaptive nonparametric statistical models that are recursively estimated with either the recursive least squares algorithm or a Kalman filter. The tool is based on Spanish HIRLAM forecasts, taking into account hourly SCADA data from 80  % of all Spanish wind turbines [18]. The EWIND model developed by TrueWind, Inc. applies a once-and-for-all parameterization for the local effect by using the output of the ForeWind NWP model, and it uses either a multiple screening linear regression model or a Bayesian neural network to find out the systematic errors [19]. The Advanced <b>Wind</b> Power Prediction <b>tool</b> (AWPT) was developed by ISET (the institute of “Solare Energieversorgungstechnik”) and the tool uses weather forecasts coming from Lokalmodell (LM) of the Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) and predicts the wind power with artificial neural networks [20]. Ecole de Mines de Paris (ARMINES) and Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) have developed models for short-term prediction based on fuzzy-neural networks [20].|$|R

This thesis estimates and compares the annual energy production results produced employing two <b>wind</b> farm design <b>tools</b> WindPRO and WindSim for a site located in Greece. Two years of {{data are available}} from a 56 meter met mast. The data are analyzed filtered and converted to appropriate formats for usage by the <b>wind</b> farm design <b>tools.</b> Abnormalities in the wind data are observed, investigated and presented.

40|$|The {{overall view}} {{of this paper is}} to attain high speed, low power full adder cells with {{alternative}} logic cells that lead to have reduced power delay product. Two high-speed and lowpower full adder cells designed with an alternative internal logic structure and pass-transistor logic styles that lead to have a reduced power-delay product (PDP). We carried out a comparison against other full-adders reported as having a low PDP, in terms of speed, power consumption and area. All the full-adders were designed with a 0. 18 - m CMOS technology, and were tested using a comprehensive test bench that allowed to measure the current taken from the full adder inputs, besides the current provided from the power supply. Post-layout simulations show that the proposed full adders outperform its counterparts exhibiting an average PDP advantage of 80 %, with only 40 % of relative area. Adder module is the core of many arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with an alternative internal logic structure based on the multiplexing of the Boolean function.

40|$|Analysis and {{interpretation}} of observations from the MESSENGER spacecraft in orbit about Mercury require knowledge of solar wind "forcing" parameters. We have utilized the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) -ENLIL solar <b>wind</b> modeling <b>tool</b> in order to calculate the values of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength (B), solar wind velocity (V) and density (n), ram pressure (~nV 2), cross-magnetosphere electric field (VxB), Alfvén Mach number (MA), and other derived quantities of relevance for solar wind-magnetosphere interactions. We have compared upstream MESSENGER IMF and solar wind measurements {{to see how well}} the ENLIL model results compare. Such parameters as solar wind dynamic pressure are key for determining the Mercury magnetopause standoff distance, for example. We also use the relatively high-time-resolution B-field data from MESSENGER to estimate the strength of the product of the solar wind speed and southward IMF strength (Bs) at Mercury. This product VBs is the electric field that drives many magnetospheric dynamical processes and can be compared with the occurrence of energetic particle bursts within the Mercury magnetosphere. This quantity also serves as input to the global magnetohydrodynamic and kinetic magnetosphere models that are being used to explore magnetospheric and exospheric processes at Mercury. Moreover, this modeling can help assess near-real-time magnetospheric behavior for MESSENGER or other mission analysis and/or ground-based observational campaigns.
