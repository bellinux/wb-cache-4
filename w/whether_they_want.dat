25|$|Patrick Olivelle {{suggests}} that the Hindu ashrama system of life, created probably around the 4th-century BCE, {{was an attempt to}} institutionalize renunciation within the Brahmanical social structure. This system gave complete freedom to adults to choose what they want to do, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be householders or sannyasins (ascetics), the monastic tradition was a voluntary institution. This voluntary principle, states Olivelle, was the same principle found in Buddhist and Jain monastic orders at that time.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} Parliamentary hearing, Labour Party, NZ First, Green Party and Māori Party {{expressed}} {{dissatisfaction with the}} order of the questions and said that the public should first be asked <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> a change, and continue with a second referendum only if they do, or both questions compacted into one referendum, which could potentially save millions of dollars. David Seymour (ACT's representative in the Cross-Party Group) said that the planned order made sense, as the public would need to see the alternative designs before deciding on a change. Professor John Burrows, chair of the Flag Consideration Panel, agreed that familiarity with proposals is a prerequisite for a properly informed decision about them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{automatic}} smart playlists {{that are}} added to the user’s library include Top 25 Most Played, Recently Played, Recently Added, My Top Rated, Music Videos, Classical Music, Purchased, and 90’s Music. While creating Smart Playlists the user has to choose <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the playlist to be based on genre, whether or not the songs have album artwork, date added, etc. and if they want it to contain or not contain certain genres or artists. For example, a genre like country music, or songs added in a specific month or year, or an individual artist. The user can also limit the amount of songs they want in the playlist or they can leave it as unlimited. The Live Updating option will automatically update their new playlist as their library changes.|$|E
25|$|Some {{persons have}} a {{disorder}} of consciousness (DOC). This state is defined to include persons with coma, {{as well as}} persons in a vegetative state (VS) or minimally conscious state (MCS). New BCI research seeks to help persons with DOC in different ways. A key initial goal is to identify patients {{who are able to}} perform basic cognitive tasks, which would of course lead to a change in their diagnosis. That is, some persons who are diagnosed with DOC may in fact be able to process information and make important life decisions (such as whether to seek therapy, where to live, and their views on end-of-life decisions regarding them). Some persons who are diagnosed with DOC die as a result of end-of-life decisions, which may be made by family members who sincerely feel this is in the patient's best interests. Given the new prospect of allowing these patients to provide their views on this decision, there {{would seem to be a}} strong ethical pressure to develop this research direction to guarantee that DOC patients are given an opportunity to decide <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to live.|$|E

25|$|The {{electrophysiological}} {{study of}} sleep in small invertebrates is complicated. Insects go through circadian rhythms of activity and passivity but some {{do not seem}} to have a homeostatic sleep need. Insects {{do not seem to}} exhibit REM sleep. However, fruit flies appear to sleep, and systematic disturbance of that state leads to cognitive disabilities. There are several methods of measuring cognitive functions in fruit flies. A common method is to let the flies choose <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to fly through a tunnel that leads to a light source, or through a dark tunnel. Normally, flies are attracted to light. But if sugar is placed in the end of the dark tunnel, and something the flies dislike is placed in the end of the light tunnel, the flies will eventually learn to fly towards darkness rather than light. Flies deprived of sleep require a longer time to learn this and also forget it more quickly. If an arthropod is experimentally kept awake longer than it is used to, then its coming rest period will be prolonged. In cockroaches that rest period is characterized by the antennae being folded down and by a decreased sensitivity to external stimuli. Sleep has been described in crayfish, too, characterized by passivity and increased thresholds for sensory stimuli as well as changes in the EEG pattern, markedly differing from the patterns found in crayfish when they are awake.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Little X and features cameo appearances by Keri Hilson, Bria Myles, Sean Faris and Justin Timberlake. It does not follow a storyline and per Furtado's request, focuses on scenes with dancing and flirting {{because she wanted to}} recreate the song's indicative vibe, and took the opportunity to film a club video for the first time. Furtado said of the video, [...] "It's that whole dance that goes on. There's that mystery there, the fun, playful sexiness, the verbal Ping-Pong game". Furtado and Timbaland cannot decide <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to begin dating or instead flirt with others on the dance floor. Their single performances are intercut with several scenes of a dancing crowd, and the lighting changes between blue, green, red, and yellow colors.|$|E
500|$|For Angels fifth season, as with Buffys fourth, Spike {{steps in}} to replace Cordelia {{as a source}} of comedic {{dialogue}} within the series. It is also noted by critics that, in the fifth season, [...] "it doesn't take long for Illyria to become a version of Cordelia, giving everyone the cold and honest truth <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> it or not". Concerning Cordelia's last appearance in Angels fifth and final season, Joss Whedon says he used the 100th episode to reinforce the [...] "mission statement" [...] of the show, as well as assess where the characters are now compared to how they began. Whedon explains this episode presents an ideal opportunity to—through Cordelia, who was [...] "there at the beginning"—ask of Angel, [...] "Where are you now? Where were you when you started and where are you now and {{how do you feel about}} that?" [...] The return to the show's [...] "original concerns" [...] is echoed by the flashback to Doyle's first season advertisement; Sara Upstone points out aerial images of Los Angeles reappear at the same time Cordelia tells Angel [...] "You forgot who you are," [...] bringing back the show's link to the city. Buffy Summers was originally intended to appear in the 100th episode to get Angel 'back on track', but Sarah Michelle Gellar had other obligations. Writer/director David Fury explains that since [...] "we couldn't get Sarah" [...] the episode was instead written for Cordelia. He adds, [...] "This turned out to be a Godsend because Charisma was fantastic." [...] In the original script, Fury wrote a conversation between Wesley and Angel while driving to the hospital that set up Cordelia as a possible vegetable. The scene was never shot because [...] "the shock of seeing her up and around after a 9-month coma was enough. We just didn't want to tip it too soon," [...] says Fury.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{also known}} as the Period of Inquiry. [...] During this period, {{teaching}} is given to people who are interested in learning more about the Catholic Faith.

There is no obligation involved in attending these meetings—they are intended to help a person decide <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to continue learning about the Faith. [...] Attendees at this stage are known as Inquirers.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia, the Federal Assembly of Russia called an extraordinary session for 25 August 2008 to discuss recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following a unanimous resolution that was passed by both houses of the parliament calling on the Russian president to recognise independence of the breakaway republics, Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, officially recognised both on 26 August 2008. Russian recognition was condemned by NATO nations, OSCE and European Council nations due to [...] "violation of territorial integrity and international law". UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated that sovereign states have to decide themselves <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to recognise the independence of disputed regions.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Guillen, {{a former}} ABC News science editor, made an {{agreement}} with Boisselier for him to choose independent experts to test for a DNA match. [...] Clonaid refused to identify the independent experts, because if revealed too soon, others could track the baby from the testing place into the mother's house. [...] Clonaid said the parents had the final say on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to test the baby and that a Dutch lesbian couple would be {{the parents of the}} next cloned baby. Boisselier said she would hand over the evidence to show that a clone had in fact been born but was concerned that the details of Clonaid's cloning procedure might leak out. The next day, Vorilhon claimed that the baby was healthy. [...] He said those who are against cloning for ethical reasons would be dismayed if the clone baby was in good condition.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{cultures}} do {{not place}} a great emphasis on informing the patient of the diagnosis, especially when {{cancer is the}} diagnosis. [...] American culture rarely used truth-telling especially in medical cases, up until the 1970s. [...] In American medicine, the principle of informed consent now takes precedence over other ethical values, and patients are usually at least asked <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to know the diagnosis.. Additionally, The WMA International Code of Medical Ethics explicitly states, [...] "“A physician shall...report to the appropriate authorities those physicians who practice unethically or incompetently or who engage in fraud or deception." [...] There is also the conflict with physicians who are tempted to report made up incidents or make an incident worse than what it was for their own personal motives. In vice versa, a physician might be hesitant to report an incident because of a personal friendship {{he or she may}} have with his colleague.|$|E
