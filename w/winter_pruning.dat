25|$|Carignan is a late budding {{and late}} {{ripening}} variety {{that is often}} {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by <b>winter</b> <b>pruning</b> or green harvesting during the growing season. The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California.|$|E

50|$|In the Upper Mississippi Valley River AVA, viticultural {{techniques}} must {{be adapted}} {{to deal with the}} cold winters. After harvest, many wineries will take the grapevines down from their trellises. The vines are then pruned and buried under mulch. In the spring, just prior to budding, the vines are then guided back into the trellises to begin the next growing cycle However, with new hybrid varietals developed by the University of Minnesota, these newer vines may stay on the trellises during the cold <b>winters</b> and <b>pruned</b> in February and March.|$|R
40|$|Since machine {{introduction}} in {{the early}} 1970 s, much work has been expended to adapt pruners to vine trellis and physiological requirements, especially regarding the higher bud load their non-selective cuts leave compared to manual trimming. While units have successfully met the former requirement, efforts to meet the latter have been hampered by {{a broad range of}} variables depending on cultivar, machine type, environmental conditions and any manual follow-up. Several examples are instructive here. <b>Winter</b> hedge <b>pruning</b> usually delivers best results with low-to-medium basal node fruitfulness coupled with some hand finishing, two crucial factors for achieving the desired balance of crop yield and quality similar to hand pruning but at lower cost. Minimal pruning has by and large proved unsuccessful in European environments, although some of its good features like looser, less rot-susceptible clusters, earlier canopy filling, lower individual shoot vigor and higher vine capacity can be reproduced using a semi-minimal pruned hedge (SMPH) system to better control over-cropping while maintaining desired grape composition. For instance, the best option for <b>winter</b> mechanical <b>pruning</b> in Italian districts today is the single high-wire cordon managed to maintain upright canopy growth for fast and physiologically sound cutter-bar pruning with little or no manual follow-up. A more comprehensive outlook seems to presage robotics for "precision" pruning to deliver a bud load that is adjusted to vine vigor and desired crop level...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} common manners of {{classifying}} vine training systems now is based on which parts of the vines are permanent fixtures which determines which parts of the vine are removed each year as part of the <b>winter</b> <b>pruning.</b> With a cane-trained system, there are no permanent cordons or branches that are kept year after year. The vine is pruned down to the spur in winter, leaving only one strong cane which is then trained into becoming the main branch for next year's crop. Examples of cane trained systems include the Guyot and Pendelbogen. With spur-trained systems, the main branch or cordon is kept each year with only individual canes being pruned during the winter. While vines that are cane trained will often have a thin, smooth main branch, spur trained vines will often have thick, dark and gnarled cordon branches. Many old vine vineyards will often utilize spur training system. Some examples of spur-training systems include the goblet or bush vine systems, and Cordon de Royat. Some systems, like the Scott Henry and VSP Trellis, can be adapted to both spur and cane training. Vine systems that are classified as either cane or spur trained may be alternately described by the way they are pruned in the winter so systems that are described as [...] "cane-trained" [...] will be spur pruned while systems that are [...] "spur-trained" [...] will be cane-pruned.|$|E

Infectivity and recovery rates were also calculated each year. From 1999 to 2003, the average number of healthy plants decreased and the numbers of recovered plants and those with symptoms increased. Productivity of recovered vines, although lower than that of healthy ones, was always higher than that of vines with symptoms and was not influenced by the time elapsed from date of recovery.

40|$|The {{researches}} {{carried out}} during the PhD were focused {{on the effects of}} different cultural techniques on the phenolic compound of Vitis vinifera L., under the ongoing climate change scenario that has been causing negative effects on grape composition and sensory attributes of wines. In the first trial was evaluated the effectiveness of the delayed <b>winter</b> spur <b>pruning</b> after budburst to slow down sugar accumulation in cv. Merlot, with the aim to reduce the decoupling between technological and phenolic maturity. This technique, if applied in a particular period, resulted able to slow down sugar accumulation without negative effects on berry flavonoids and with acceptable loss of yield. Since the topic of the phenolic maturity became important in the evaluation of the effects that global warming and cultural techniques have on black berry varieties, in the second experiment were investigated the changes that occurs on berry flavonoids and in the properties of skin cell wall material during the last part of ripening in cv. Merlot. Total and extractable anthocyanins increased until harvest, as well as the affinity of cell wall material for the commercial seed tannin. This latter aspect might be correlated to the decrease of astringency during ripening. In the third experiment was investigated the role that sunlight incidence on clusters of cv. Grechetto gentile plays on grape composition and on the phenolic tastes of the resulting wines. Increased light incidence determined higher concentration of flavonols in grape and wine and that was correlated to the greater perception of astringency and bitterness of the wines.

5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor natural enemies, a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during <b>winter.</b> In California, <b>prune</b> trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{change of}} grape (Vitis vinifera) harvest from summer to <b>winter</b> through double <b>pruning</b> {{management}} has improved the fine wine quality in southern Brazil. High altitude, late cul-tivar and grafting combination {{all need to}} be investigated to optimize this new viticulture manage-ment. For this purpose, this study was carried out during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons in a high altitude region {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais, Brazil, using eight grafting combinations for five year old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. The stem water potential, photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance were not affected by rootstock type. The rootstocks IAC 766 and 101 - 14 induced, respectively, the highest and lowest vegetative vigor in Cabernet Sauvignon, as shown by leaf area and pruning weight. In the 2011 growing season, the leaf chlorophyll contents were increased in IAC 766, whereas vines grafted onto 101 - 14 accumulated more leaf starch, prob-ably due to reduced vegetative and reproductive growth. In general, rootstocks K 5 BB, 1045 P, SO 4 and IAC 766 had the highest yield as compared to 1103 P and 101 - 14. Berries from the grapevine with the highest yield did not differ in pH, total soluble solids and acidity. The root-stocks did not influence the anthocyanins and total phenols in both growing seasons. Quality parameters were better in the 2011 than in the 2012 growing season due to better climatic conditions, mainly less rainfall.

40|$|The {{formation}} {{and growth of}} grape berries was studied in Canterbury, New Zealand on Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Experimentation {{was set up to}} examine: changes in yield components, the development of individual flowers, and the growth and cellular makeup of seeded, seedless, and shot berries. Vine yield components were manipulated by altering vine phenology using delayed <b>winter</b> spur <b>pruning</b> and alginate gel encapsulation. Flower development was studied by tagging flowers at capfall and describing the resulting berries at véraison. The set and development of the tagged flowers was altered with girdling and leaf area removal treatments to change carbohydrate availability. Finally the growth curves and cellular makeup of the different types of berries were described from a separate sample of berries. The timing of phenological growth stages may have an important role in determining components of yield. Bunch weight increased (38 %) with delayed <b>winter</b> spur <b>pruning,</b> due to a larger average berry weight. The increase in average berry weight resulted from changes in the berry population, with the proportion of large seeded berries increasing within bunches, associated with a possible reduction in the proportion of smaller seedless berries. Treatments that delayed bud break also delayed flowering date, perhaps to a time when weather conditions were more favourable for berry development. A weak relationship between the warmth of the bud break period and yield, as well as bunch weight, was found; this may be an indirect relationship. Studying individual flowers showed that berry set and development could be altered by manipulating carbohydrate availability. Girdling changed the development of some flowers. The proportion of seeded berries that formed was unaffected by girdling, while the proportion of seedless berries increased. The response of shot berries and flowers that abscised differed between 1999 and 2000. In 1999 the proportion of shot berries decreased, while in 2000 it was the proportion of abscised flowers that decreased after girdling. Leaf area reduction on girdled shoots had an opposite effect to girdling, with extreme levels of leaf removal (75 %) reducing the proportion of shot and seeded berries that formed. The percentage of abscised flowers increases dramatically with leaf area removal, while the proportion of seedless berries was unaffected. However, a weak positive relationship between total shoot leaf area and seedless berry development exists. The data from yield components and of individual flowers suggest that the population of berries are fluid in nature. Shot berries and flowers that abscise appear to be a pool from which seedless berries can form, when carbohydrate availability allows. The antibiotic spectinomycin was applied to alter fruit set and seed development of berries, though no effect was identified. The lack of a spectinomycin effect may have been the result of incorrect timing of treatment application. The mean overall fruit set differed between the 1999 (41 %) and 2000 (71 %) seasons. The greater fruit set and different behaviour of abscised flowers (c. f. shot berries in 1999) in 2000 might be a reflection of the warmer than average flowering period compared to the cooler flowering period of 1999 : This suggests that environmental conditions at flowering may influence fruit set. Flowers were found to vary in size at capfall, but neither flower size (ovary diameter) nor the time of capfall of individual flowers had any influence on berry set and development. Flower size and environmental conditions affected the progression of capfall. Smaller flowers tend to undergo capfall after larger flowers, and the progression of flowering is disrupted when rainfall and associated low temperatures occur. Temperatures above 15 °C were found to advance capfall in the 1999 and 2001 seasons. With flowers undergoing capfall {{over an extended period of}} time (about 20 days), individual flowers will experience quite different environmental conditions. However, no strong relationships between daily assessments of temperature at capfall and berry set or berry development were found. The strong effect of carbohydrate availability on berry development (as found with girdling and leaf area removal) suggests that light intensity (due to its impact on current photoassimilate supply) may be more valid an environmental index than temperature. The extent of berry growth is determined by the seed. A strong relationship between berry size and seed content was found. A minimum level of seed development (> 0. 5 mg fresh weight at harvest) is required for double sigmoid berry growth, which occurs as a consequence of cell division and expansion. Both seeded and seedless berries exhibit double sigmoid growth curves, however when seedless berries have less than 0. 5 mg seed content they show a single sigmoid growth curve. Seedless berries grow only as a result of cell expansion. Failure of the ovules to develop mean that shot berries only show a small amount of growth immediately post-capfall then halt all growth. A model of berry formation has been proposed, where flower abscission and fruit set are considered as contrasting processes and the formation of shot and seedless berries occurs when the normal process of seeded berry development fails. Once abscission has been prevented (i. e. the flower is set), the extent to which the flower develops is determined by what stage during pollination (shot berry) and fertilisation (seedless berry) that seed formation fails...|$|R

Four pruning types (light, medium, heavy and control without pruning) were applied at four different times during Autumn at three weeks intervals. Pruning in Autumn was essential to improve {{quantity and quality of}} rose flowering in <b>Winter.</b> The light <b>pruning</b> was the best type for increasing period, quantity and quality of flowers compared to other types. Beginning of Autumn or three weeks later were the best pruning times allowing the highest flowering rate and quality compared to the other tested times. The light prunings at these times were the best treatments increasing significantly all flowering measurements. The study of economical impact of both treatments showed that the light pruning of rose shrubs three weeks after beginning of autumn, the third week of October, is the best treatment for improving flowering in short time. Under this condition, flowers number per plant, flower weight and petals weight per flower were increased by 68. 7 %, 279. 5 % and 219. 4 % respectively compared to control. Flower-stem length was improved from 18. 0 to 50. 7 cm. Flowers and petals weight per feddan 2 (0. 42 hectares or 4200 m) were also increased by 540. 4 % and 439. 0 % respectively.

Trunk circumference, <b>winter</b> and summer <b>pruning</b> weight, total number and weight of fruits per tree, and major fruit quality traits were recorded starting at the 3 rd leaf. After fruit harvest in the 5 th leaf, irrigation was withheld during the dry summer period (July-September). All IS selections reduced trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) and pruning weight compared to GF 677, with IS 5 / 23 reducing TCSA by 62 % and Castore, Polluce and IS 5 / 29 by 32 % by the 8 th leaf. Yield efficiency was inversely related to tree vigor, with IS 5 / 23 inducing the highest increase over GF 677. Trees on IS 5 / 23 exhibited 24 - 28 % reductions of crop load and yield, whereas only IS 5 / 29 increased fruit size compared to GF 677. Postharvest water deficit induced significant yield declines in GF 677, IS 5 / 29 and IS 5 / 23 in the following year. Low-vigor trees on Castore, Polluce and IS 5 / 23 were more sensitive to changes in stomatal conductance in terms of carbon fixation, performing better than trees on GF 677 and IS 5 / 29 under non-limiting water conditions. Only minor rootstock effects on fruit quality were observed, with IS 5 / 23 reducing significantly the final grower's profit. Overall, all low-vigor rootstocks performed decently, and in particular IS 5 / 29 exhibited a good compromise between growth reduction, yield and fruit size, whereas Castore and Polluce may represent valid alternatives to GF 677 for early peach production in dry Mediterranean areas...|$|R

Root restriction clearly reduced vegetative growth, however fruitfulness was less affected, resulting in improvements in crop load and the maturity of the grape berries. The proportionate bag volume effects on growth were less consistent. Grapevine cuttings were planted at ground level in porous geotextile Duon® root control bags in the spring of 1989 in Canterbury, New Zealand. Treatments consisted of four bag volumes of 10, 25, 48 and 102 litres, 'bagged' and unrestricted 'control' vines. The grapevines were spaced at 2 metre between vines and trained to a single cordon. The vines were minimally managed with <b>winter</b> short spur <b>pruning</b> and irrigation was applied uniformly across all treatments. The experiment was divided into three sections to test two hypotheses. Firstly were the bagged vines different from the non bagged vines and secondly were the bag effects proportionate. Root restriction treatments generally reduced all vegetative growth parameters including: pruning fresh weights; trunk cross sectional area; primary and lateral shoot number and length, node number (leaf number), internode length and leaf area per plant. Mean leaf size was smaller and despite the growth reductions the canopy density was improved in the bagged vines, through less leaf shading. Root restriction affected fruitfulness to a lesser extent, leading to increased harvest efficiency indices; fruit weight per unit pruning weight, leaf area per unit pruning weight and the fruit weight produced per total shoot number. Moreover, root restriction treatments affected the main fruit maturity parameters used for wine production. At harvest root restriction treatments increased the juice total soluble solids concentrations and decreased the titratable acidity concentration leading to an increased total soluble solids to titratable acidity ratio. In the final year these differences occurred from 7 weeks prior to harvest. Root restriction treatments also decreased juice potassium ion concentration. Potassium ion concentration was correlated with pH, and pH was generally lower in the bagged vines. Berry colour development at veraison was also earlier in the root restriction treatments. The {{hypothesis that}} bag volumes are proportionate to changes in vegetative growth, fruitfulness and fruit maturity is not clear. There was some evidence to suggest relationships between these parameters may exist, however, R 2 values were low. Clearly the smallest bag volumes had disproportionate growth suggesting root escapes and, or, changed root to shoot relationships which would confound results. Root escapes were confirmed by preliminary root excavation...|$|R
40|$|Dinitro-ortho-cresol (500, 1000, and 2000 ppm) and dormant oil (2. 5, 5. 0, and 10 %) {{were applied}} to Thompson Seedless and Perlette grapevines alone and in {{combination}} to enhance budbreak and fruitfulness. Applications were made immediately after pruning. Use of these materials during the <b>winter,</b> immediately after <b>pruning,</b> {{had no effect on}} either fruitfulness or budbreak in Perlette or Thompson Seedless. Thompson Seedless cuttings collected in August were exposed to six temperatures (7, 13, 18, 24, 29 and 35 C) for five time periods (2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks). After temperature treatment the cuttings were planted in the greenhouse at 24 (+OR-) 1 C. Cuttings exposed to 24, 29 and 35 C broke sooner than those exposed to 7, 13, 18 C at all time periods. The percentage of the bud openings of cuttings at 29 C for a period of 2 and 4 weeks was 95 % and 100 % respectively. The optimum temperature for budburst was 29 C. Gibberellic acid, Thiourea, dinitro-ortho-sec-butyl-phenol (DINOSEB), potassium nitrate and Endothal were used at two concentrations alone and in combination, to break rest of Thompson Seedless buds. Thiourea at 2 % and DINOSEB at 1000 ppm alone were the only treatments which gave a higher percentage of bud opening after 20 forcing days at 25 (+OR-) 1 C temperature. Similar results were obtained from cuttings taken in both winter and summer. Three times after harvest, Perlette and Thompson Seedless were defoliated using the senesce enhancer Endothal. Defoliation times (4, 8, and 12 weeks) after harvest were used. In half of the treatments, regrowth was controlled with Endothal. Gibberellic acid (1000 ppm) Thiourea (2 %) and DINOSEB (2000 ppm) were applied at the time of defoliation. The four- and twelve-week defoliation periods with new vine growth controlled for improving budbreak and fruitfulness were best. Growth regulators did not improve the defoliation treatments. The best treatments hastened budbreak by 10 days, more than doubled vine fruitfulness, and increased sugar content in berries resulting in a 10 -day earlier harvest than in the control. Results were similar in both Thompson Seedless and Perlette. Thompson Seedless and Cardinal vines grown under Arizona desert conditions were defoliated 4 weeks after harvest with 2000 ppm Endothal. Two weeks later they were pruned and treated with 1000 ppm gibberellic acid, 2 % Thiourea, and 1000 ppm DINOSEB. Cardinal and Thompson Seedless vines produced a second commercial crop in December of the same year. Thiourea (2 %) and 1000 ppm DINOSEB did not have a significant effect; however, 1000 ppm Gibberellic acid reduced the number of clusters per vine...|$|R
