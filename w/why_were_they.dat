500|$|During the 12 {{days that}} {{he watched the}} court-martial proceedings, Thurgood Marshall began to {{formulate}} an appeal campaign. Marshall had noticed {{that none of the}} men's grievances had been aired in court. Directly after the court closed the case, Marshall sent a letter to Secretary Forrestal asking why only blacks were assigned the task of loading munitions; why had they not been trained for that task; <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> forced to compete for speed; <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> not given survivor's leaves; and why had they not been allowed to rise in rank. Forrestal replied weakly, saying that a predominance of black men were stationed at Port Chicago so of course they would be working there to load munitions. Forrestal pointed out that there was no discrimination because other naval weapons stations were manned by white crews loading munitions. The Navy Secretary said that the men had not been promoted because their time at Port Chicago had been a [...] "trial period", and that they were not given 30-day leaves because he thought it best for men to get quickly back to duty to prevent them from building up mental and emotional barriers.|$|E

"Given these {{judgments}} of the Soviet future made by {{political leaders and}} journalists, the question is <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> right {{and so many of}} our Sovietological colleagues wrong. The answer again in part must be ideological. Reagan and Levin came from rightist backgrounds, and Moynihan, much like the leaders of the AFL-CIO, from a leftist anti-Stalinist social-democratic milieu, environments that disposed participants to believe the worst. Most of the Sovietologists, on the other hand, were left-liberal in their politics, an orientation that undermined their capacity to accept the view that economic statism, planning, socialist incentives, would not work. They were also for the most part ignorant of, or ignored, the basic Marxist formulation {{that it is impossible to}} build socialism in impoverished societies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Liao Hua was {{critical}} of the Shu general Jiang Wei, who continued Zhuge Liang's aggressive foreign policy against Shu's rival state, Cao Wei, by launching a series of eleven campaigns to attack Cao Wei between 240 and 262.

In 262, when Jiang Wei was about to embark on the eleventh campaign, Liao Hua remarked, [...] "'One who does not refrain from using military force will end up burning himself.' I am referring to Boyue (Jiang Wei). He is inferior to the enemy in terms of intelligence and military power, yet he keeps attacking them. How can he expect to overcome them?
