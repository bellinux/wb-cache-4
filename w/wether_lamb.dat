40|$|Mature {{pregnant}} crossbred ewes (n = 90) {{were used}} in a randomized complete block design experiment and were assigned to 1 of 3 winter-feeding systems differing in primary feed source: haylage (HL), limit-fed corn (CN), or limit-fed dried distillers grains (DDGS). Effects of these winter-feeding strategies on postweaning progeny performance were determined. Lamb progeny (n = 96) were weaned at 61 +/- 4 d of age and fed a common high-concentrate diet. Lambs were assigned to feedlot pen (n = 18) based on dam mid-gestation pen. Growth rate, DMI, and ADG were determined for the first 40 d of the finishing period. At 96 +/- 4 d of age, 1 <b>wether</b> <b>lamb</b> was randomly selected from each pen (n = 18) for a glucose tolerance test. The experiment was terminated, and lambs were slaughtered individually when they were determined to have achieved 0. 6 -cm 12 th-rib fat thickness. After a 24 -h chill, carcass data were collected and a 2. 54 -cm chop was removed from each lamb from the LM posterior to the 12 th rib for ether extract analysis. Additional carcass measurements of bone, muscle, and fat from the shoulder, rack, loin, and leg were collected on 35 carcasses. At weaning, lamb BW was not different among treatments, whereas final BW tended to be greater (P = 0. 09) for lambs from ewes fed DDGS and CN during gestation than from those fed HL. Overall lamb growth rate from birth to slaughter was not different among treatments. Lambs from ewes fed DDGS vs. CN or HL tended {{to have a greater}} initial insulin response (P = 0. 09). Dressing percent was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, but no difference (P = 0. 16) was detected in HCW among treatments. As expected, 12 th rib fat thickness was similar among treatments, whereas LM area was largest to smallest (P = 0. 05) in lambs from ewes fed CN, HL, and DDGS, respectively. Proportion of internal fat tended to be greatest to smallest (P = 0. 06) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, CN, and HL, respectively. Calculated boneless trimmed retail cuts percentage was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS than CN or HL. Loin muscle weight as a percentage of wholesale cut tended (P = 0. 10) to be greater in lambs from ewes fed CN and HL than DDGS, whereas other muscle, bone, and fat weights and proportions were similar (P > 0. 24) among treatments.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{objective}} of the thesis {{was to determine the}} effects of isolated coumestrol on the growth, carcass characteristics and certain organs of <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> The first of two trials was conducted over an eight week period with two groups of heavy <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> Trial two was conducted over an 11 week period with two groups of four light <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> Ration coumestrol contents were 112 ppm in the first trial and 145 ppm in the second trial. Due to the difficulties and expense involved in preparing a large quantity of coumestrol, only a small number of animals could be used. The treated lambs in trial one gained slightly more than the controls. In trial two, the treated lambs gained virtually the same as the controls. Statistical analysis showed that in neither case were the growth, feed conversion, carcass and organoleptic differences significant. Marked evidence of an estrogenic effect was apparent when the organ weights were compared. The liver weights of the control and treated groups within each trial were similar. Although not significant, the pituitary weights were consistently greater for the treated lambs. In trial two, the seminal vesicle weights and teat lengths of the treated lambs were significantly greater than the controls. Measurements of these organs were not taken in trial one. When compared to other studies, the increase in the weights of the seminal vesicles is greater than that which occurs when lambs are implanted with 3 mg of diethylstilbestrol. The apparent anomaly between the lack of a consistent growth response and the marked increase in seminal vesicle weight and teat length is difficult to explain. Realizing that only a limited amount of data was taken, speculation based on this data and data presented by other workers indicated that coumestrol may not necessarily affect an animal's system in the same order or at the same rate as diethytstilbestrol. Since the levels of coumestrol fed were equivalent to low levels of diethylstilbestrol (less than 0. 15 mg), one would have expected only small changes in the weights of the seminal vesicles. If coumestrol was fed at levels which approach the equivalent of 2 mg. of diethylstilbestrol, it is quite possible that an animal would be adversely affected. A rectal prolapse which occurred in the tast trial substantiates this possibility to some extent. That coumestrol at the administered levels can produce a slight growth response is probable, but the limited number of animals used precludes a conclusive statement. Past experiments at the Oregon Station, particularly the earlier ones, support this probability. In evaluating the activity of coumestrol, the influence of inhibitors, potentiators, additional estrogens, storage conditions, metabolic estrogenic changes, pathogens and a variety of unknown factors should not be overlooked. Evidence that such factors may have partially obscured the results of the trials reported herein and past experiments was covered...|$|R

The effect of photoperiod on the onset of the breeding season in large animals such as sheep has been studied, but the mechanism by which light affects their reproduction has not been elucidated. To test the hypothesis that the mechanism by which light controls reproduction in sheep is similar to the mechanism that operates in rats, an experiment was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} melatonin on reproductive phenomena in sheep. A solid-phase radioimmunoassay was developed as a means of studying the effects of melatonin on serum interstitial cell stimulating hormone (ICSH). Twenty-eight ewe, ram and <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> were divided into a control and a treatment group. Treatment consisted of daily sub-cutaneous injections of 0. 1 mg. melatonin per kilogram of body weight administered in propylene glycol. Treatment was initiated on the third day after birth and continued until autopsy just before the suspected onset of puberty. Melatonin in the doses employed caused a significant increase (P <. 05) in ovarian weight in ewe lambs and a depression (P <. 10) in castration-hypersecretion of ICSH in <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> No other significant effects were observed.

In total, 16 sires were used to generate the animals and these were selected for growth based on estimated breeding values (EBVs), apart from one group (PDm) which was selected for muscling based on EBVs. In total, 595 animals were slaughtered at 4, 8, 14 or 22 months of age.

There were significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) differences between genotypes for predicted weaning weight at 4 months of age, with a range of 10. 6 kg among the groups. The PDg × BLM were the heaviest (37. 8 ± 0. 7 kg) and the Merino the lightest (27. 3 ± 0. 8 kg). <b>Wether</b> <b>lambs</b> were 2. 0 kg heavier (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) than ewe lambs at weaning. The YWT EBV had no effect on weaning weight. There was a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) interaction between the age at slaughter and genotype for final liveweight of each age group. The PDg × BLM were the heaviest at each age and the Merinos the lightest, and for the oldest animals, the BLM were significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) heavier than PDm × M, whereas at younger ages this was not the case. The significant interaction (P 3 ̆c 0. 001) between sex and age at slaughter reflected the increasing difference in liveweight between the sexes as age at slaughter increased. There was also a significant (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) interaction between the YWT EBV and age at slaughter. The overall coefficients were – 0. 01, 0. 14, 0. 34 and 0. 65 for slaughter ages 4, 8, 14 and 22 months, respectively, indicating that in young animals there was no effect of sire YWT EBV on liveweight, but as the animals aged there was an increasing effect such that progeny of sires with high sire YWT EBV were heavier.

40|$|Under {{commercial}} {{conditions in}} Australia, lambs are often dehydrated at slaughter despite {{access to water}} at the abattoir. Dehydration results in reduced fluid content of meat, which causes liveweight and carcass weight loss. Two experiments evaluated hydration status and carcass characteristics in lambs fed increased levels of sodium chloride (salt) and/or betaine before slaughter. Both experiments were 2 × 2 factorial designs with two levels of salt added [0 and 50 g/kg dry matter (DM) ] and two levels of betaine added (0 and 6. 7 g/kg DM) to the diets. The treatment diets were introduced to sheep over a 7 – 8 -day period and then fed at 1. 5 kg/day for the following 7 days. In experiment 1, 96 Poll Dorset–Merino cross <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> (45. 9 ± 0. 17 kg) were fed in individual pens and in experiment 2, 204 Merino <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> (43. 1 ± 0. 35 kg) were fed in group pens. In the first experiment, water and feed were withheld {{from the end of}} the treatment feeding period until slaughter 48 h later. In the second experiment, feed and water were withheld for the first 24 h after treatment but water was available for the next 24 h immediately before slaughter. In both experiments, consumption of the high salt diet decreased urine specific gravity and osmolarity at the end of the feeding period and after 24 h without access to water. This indicates an improved hydration status at this time. However, the difference in hydration status related to feeding salt declined during the 48 -h lairage period and there were no significant differences in hot carcass weight or muscle DM among groups at slaughter. It could be concluded from this result that the addition of salt has little commercial value; however, this may not be the case. The lambs in experiment 2 did not behave according to industry expectations. They all drank water in the last 24 h in lairage and none of the groups showed severe dehydration. Further research is justified to determine if the lambs fed the diets with no added salt drunk in lairage as a learned response from the lambs fed salt and, if so, whether this can be developed into a commercial strategy. Feeding betaine did not result in any changes in hydration status or carcass characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Sheep {{farming in}} the UK is {{characterized}} by a crossbreeding system where ‘Longwool’ sire breeds are mated with hill dam breeds, with the crossbred (F 1) ewe lambs retained for mating to terminal sires. The F 1 wether and terminal-sire cross lambs are marketed for meat. At selection, F 1 females are typically assessed visually for type traits relevant to dam lines, and these traits could be considered as goal traits. Their offspring and their male sibs derive their value from carcass traits. This study investigated the genetic relationships between type (subjective) and carcass (objective) traits in F 1 lambs, and their potential impact on genetic improvement within this production system. Bluefaced Leicester rams were crossed with Scottish Blackface and Hardy Speckled Face ewes to produce F 1 (‘Mule’) <b>lambs.</b> The <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> (no. ¼ 2197) were selected for slaughter at a target condition (a carcass fat score of 2 / 3 L) and a number of live and carcass traits were measured. Carcass dissection data were collected on approximately one-third of these <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> The ewe lambs (no. ¼ 2423) were measured for similar live traits but at a fixed age (195 ^ 5 · 5 days). In addition, they were subjectively assessed for a number of functional and type traits. Genetic parameters among these traits were then estimated. Heritabilities for the ewe traits were generally moderate (0 · 18 to 0 · 31) and genetic correlations between the traits were variable, with some moderate to high correlations (favourable in direction) of growth/carcass traits with overall type traits. Live weight at slaughter in wethers was highly correlated to live weight at constant age in ewes (r ¼ 0 · 72). In the wethers, live, cold carcass and lean weight had moderately high heritabilities (between 0 · 26 and 0 · 46), and were positively correlated with slaughter age ($ 0 · 79). However, age at slaughter in wethers was highly negatively correlated with growth/carcass and overall type traits in ewes (between 20 · 45 and 20 · 97), perhaps reflecting differences in maturity in lambs measured at a target fatness versus age. The correlations of most other type traits in ewes with wether traits were non-significant. These results show that the subjectively assessed type traits (at least as measured in this study) will not deteriorate, and some will in fact be improved, in a selection programme aiming to improve carcass merit...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} incidence of parasite resistance to chemical anthelmintics worldwide novel approaches to manage parasite infection, such as medicinal plants and their extracts, are {{being investigated by}} the scientific community. The current study tested the effect of three rates of garlic (0. 9, 1. 8 and 3. 6 %) in a pelleted ration on Haemonchus contortus in sheep. Thirty-nine Merino <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> aged 6 months were divided into five treatment groups, including three garlic dose rates and two control groups that received no garlic. All animals were infected with 4000 L 3 H. contortus larvae 3 weeks after allocation to treatments. A positive control group was drenched with abamectin 28 days after infection. The synthetic drench was effective in controlling the parasites, {{but there was no}} reduction in either worm egg counts (WEC) or total worm count due to the garlic. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) liveweight, feed intake, body condition score and feed conversion ratio {{than any of the other}} treatment groups, suggesting that this level of garlic had a low level of anti-nutritional properties. There was an interaction between faecal WEC and voluntary feed intake overtime, with the animals with higher voluntary feed intake having lower WEC over time...|$|R
40|$|One hundred-twenty Rambouillet feeder lambs (Mean BW = 29. 5 kg) {{were used}} to compare the effects of double and single {{implanting}} with Zeranol hormonal implants on lamb performance and carcass characteristics. Lambs were randomly assigned to three treatments: no implant (treatment 1), single implant (treatment 2), and double implant (treatment 3). On d 0, lambs in treatments 2 and 3 were implanted. Lambs in treatment 3 were re-implanted on d 56. Lambs were weighed every 28 d and slaughtered at 120 lb BW. Backfat thickness, leg circumference, hot carcass weight, USDA yield and quality grades were recorded, dressing percentage and calculated yield grade (CYG) were calculated. Treatments 2 and 3 had higher (P < 0. 05) ADG than non-implanted lambs on d 28, 56, 84, and overall. Days on feed and feed to gain ratio were lower (P < 0. 05) for implanted lambs than non-implanted lambs. Treatment 3 lambs had a lower (P < 0. 05) dressing percentage and a lower (P < 0. 05) percentage of choice grade carcasses and higher (P < 0. 05) percentage of no grades.

40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Three {{experiments}} were conducted (1) {{to develop and}} characterize polyclonal antibodies against ovine adipocyte plasma membranes (APM), (2) to evaluate the effect of administering the developed antibodies to lambs on lamb growth and carcass characteristics, and (3) to investigate {{the possibility of using}} the developed antibodies to identify antigenic components on ovine APM that are tissue, species and possibly site specific. In Experiment 1, the developed antibodies showed a high rate of reactivity to APM and cross reacted with plasma membranes (PM) from liver, kidney, heart and erythrocytes. Adsorption of antisera with either liver PM or erythrocyte PM for 6 h resulted in a significant reduction in antisera cross-reactivity to liver or erythrocyte PM, respectively, with little effect on its specific reactivity to APM or cross-reactivity with PM of the other tissues tested. The antisera also reacted in different affinities to APM from sheep, pig and rat. The antisera also showed differential binding to APM isolated from different anatomical locations. In Experiment 2, five <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> were assigned to either a control or treatment group to study the effect of passive immunization with the antisera immunoglobulin (ASig) on lamb growth and carcass characteristics. Treatment with ASig resulted in a significant (P<. OS) reduction of 45...|$|R
40|$|The sheep-runs of the Ashburton County cover roughly 590, 000 {{acres of}} river-flat, foothill, and high mountainous country bounded {{on the south}} by the Rangitata River (with the {{exception}} of the Mesopotamia run of Butler’s Erewhon fame). On the northern side the boundary is formed by the Rakaia River, and a straight line from the Rangitata through Mount Somers and Staveley Townships to the Rakaia roughly demarcates the plains land from the hills on the east, while westerly the runs extend back thirty and forty miles to the main ranges of the Alps. On account of the extreme roughness of the country and the lack of suitable vegetation, the sheep do not graze on the high faces of the main range. Nevertheless, the Merino is mustered from the summer country at levels between 7, 000 ft. and 8, 000 ft., and within the shadow of the glaciers. An important feature of the hill country of this county is the abrupt commencement of the high hills and the small amount of foothill country i. e., there is very little of that type of country which is sufficiently good and free from snow to maintain a ewe flock the year round and to dispose of <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> and surplus ewes for fat-lamb production on the plains...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of inclusion of Bio-Mos in the growing ration for weaned lambs on growth rate, feed efficiency, and clinical measures of health of the lambs. Mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), when included as a supplement to the diet, have been shown to have a positive effect on immune response in several species and in turn, positively affect the growth of the animal. MOS are commercially available as BioMos?, which is a nutritional supplement manufactured by Alltech, Inc. out of Nicholasville, KY. Forty-seven weaned Suffolk ? Hampshire (n= 47) lambs were used in this trial. Of the group, twenty (n= 20) were ewe lambs and twentyseven (n= 27) were <b>wether</b> <b>lambs.</b> The lambs were placed on their assigned diets and remained on the trial for a four week period (d+ 28). All responses evaluated in this study were influenced by time (p < 0. 05) over the 28 -d trial. A GENDER ? WEEK interaction was observed for ADG and feed conversion (p < 0. 05). Control lambs tended (p = 0. 10) to have a higher intake over the 28 -d period in comparison to Bio-Mos fed lambs. There were no statistically significant differences (p < 0. 05) between control and Bio-Mos fed lambs for any of the growth parameters that were measured. There was a tendency (p = 0. 10) for GENDER ? WEEK to influence intake. Gender also tended to interacted with diet (GENDER ? DIET, p = 0. 09) to influence intake over the trial period. A GENDER ? WEEK interaction was observed (p < 0. 05) for feed conversion. Diet influenced fecal pH (p < 0. 05). This study indicates Bio-Mos had minimal influence on growth and health...|$|R

Three experiments were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} purified humic acid (HA) on rate and extent of microbial digestion of various forages in ruminants. In Exp. 1 the in vitro dry matter disappearance (DMD) of Coastal Bermuda grass hay (CBH) was evaluated in the presence of HA at concentrations of. 001,. 01,. 1, and 1 % of the substrate and, following 12, 24, 36, and 48 h fermentation periods. In vitro DMD was increased (P 001 level of HA increased (P<. 01) NDFD of alfalfa hay by 146, 148, 156, and 196 % at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h respectively. These results indicate that HA increased the initial rate of NDFD in situ. Experiment 3 consisted of a metabolism trial involving twelve crossbred <b>wether</b> <b>lambs</b> (avg. wt 41 kg) and 3 HA treatment levels used in a 3 x 3 Latin square design.
