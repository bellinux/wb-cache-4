In 1982, Mathias chaired a bipartisan Senate inquiry into the methods used by the FBI in the Abscam corruption investigation, <b>which</b> <b>found</b> that dozens of officials had been named for accepting bribes without basis.

In late August, American-Hawaiian announced that Pennsylvanian would sail on a San Francisco– Panama Canal– Boston route, sailing opposite of , Honolulan, and sister ship Washingtonian. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including Pennsylvanian, returned to the Straits of Magellan route again.|$|E

5|$|As {{the highway}} would {{pass through the}} Hamersley National Park, the Environmental Protection Authority decided in 1983 that an Environment Review and Management Program report was {{required}} for the Newman to White Springs section.

A detailed survey was carried out, which included the use of laser and infra-red measuring devices from within a helicopter, and numerous field trips to determine the final alignment and bridge sites. A comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement was then produced, and the project was approved in mid-1984.|$|E

The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations <b>which</b> <b>found</b> their way into a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on.

5|$|Cladistic {{analyses}} of tyrannosaurid phylogeny often find Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa, with Daspletosaurus more basal than either. A {{close relationship between}} Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus is supported by numerous skull features, including the pattern of sutures between certain bones, {{the presence of a}} crescent-shaped crest on the postorbital bone behind each eye, and a very deep maxilla with a noticeable downward curve on the lower edge, among others. An alternative hypothesis was presented in a 2003 study by Phil Currie and colleagues, <b>which</b> <b>found</b> weak support for Daspletosaurus as a basal member of a clade also including Tarbosaurus and Alioramus, both from Asia, based on the absence of a bony prong connecting the nasal and lacrimal bones. Alioramus was found to be the closest relative of Tarbosaurus in this study, based on a similar pattern of stress distribution in the skull.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland {{agreed with}} Blount's report, <b>which</b> <b>found</b> the populace to {{be opposed to}} annexation. Liliuokalani {{initially}} refused to grant amnesty {{as a condition of}} her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position. By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair. Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.|$|E
