Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E

Canción de Alerta contains the song [...] "Por qué cantamos," [...] {{an adaptation of}} Uruguayan writer Mario Benedetti's poem of the same name. Author Eunice Rojas cites this {{as an example of}} the group using [...] "the power of music to advance social causes." [...] The song [...] "Suelta Los Amarres" [...] from Ideas Nuevas discourages listeners from using violence to advance a political cause. However, the lyrics on La Dulzura place more emphasis on interpersonal relationships and love. Silva notes that the group refrains from writing [...] "romantic" [...] lyrics, noting that [...] "romanticism has a connotation of suffering for love. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> love that elevates and purifies your soul.

2500|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{momentum}} spectrum is continuous, and one can conclude that for energy state described by the [...] wavenumber, the momentum can, when measured, attain also other values than , although these are the most likely momentum values (the momentum wavefunction attains its greatest values at these momentum values). Hence one also sees that since the energy is [...] (since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> n:th energy eigenstate) the relation [...] does not necessarily hold; here p is the measured momentum (since the energy eigenstate [...] is not a momentum eigenstate, and actually not even a superposition of two momentum eigenstates, as one could imagine from equation (...) above, it has no well-defined momentum before measurement).|$|E
2500|$|A simpler {{statement}} of the theorem uses graph theory. The set of regions of a map can be represented more abstractly as an undirected graph that has a vertex for each region and an edge for every pair of regions that share a boundary segment. This graph is planar (it {{is important to note}} that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> graphs that have some limitations according to the map they are transformed from only): it can be drawn in the plane without crossings by placing each vertex at an arbitrarily chosen location within the region to which it corresponds, and by drawing the edges as curves that lead without crossing within each region from the vertex location to each shared boundary point of the region. Conversely any planar graph can be formed from a map in this way. In graph-theoretic terminology, the four-color theorem states that the vertices of every planar graph can be colored with at most four colors so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color, or for short, [...] "every planar graph is four-colorable" [...] ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
