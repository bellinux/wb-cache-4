40|$|Sun, Jian-QiaoThe {{implementation}} of control {{systems in the}} automotive industry enabled by electronic actuators {{is referred to as}} X-by-wire technique. The application of steerby- wire technique in agriculture machine simplifies manufacture, decreases machine costs and increases machine flexibility. Previous study of Applied Controls Laboratory focused on vehicle velocity control through electrical signals, which leads to drive-by-wire agriculture machines without tactile feedback. Current research focuses on the tactile feedback control of steer-by-wire vehicles where the research goal is to improve the steering maneuverability comparable to traditional mechanical steering systems. A DC motor is regulated according to the movement status of the steering wheel to produce a smooth feedback force to the operator. A prototype <b>windrower</b> provided by Case New Holland LLC is modulated, developed and tested for the research where a conventional steering input system is modified by being mounted with a steering input sensor and a DC geared motor. The steering input system, including the steering wheel, the steering column, the mounted sensor and the DC geared motor is mathematically modeled. The permitted angle of a steering wheel has been made up to 720 degrees in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions whose big movement range brings a nonlinearity property into the steering mechanism. Furthermore, an H-bridge circuit has been designed and added to the control unit to enable the DC geared motor to turn in both directions. To produce the desired feedback force, two cascaded controllers have been designed. The first is a hybrid controller with multiple control branches developed to regulate the DC motor to produce the desired feedback force. Each control branch is a proportional integral (PI) controller. The working ranges of each branch of the controller are decided according to the angle and angular velocity of the steering wheel. The stability of the designed closed loop controller is proved by Routh stability criterion and extensive simulations have been performed to verify the stability of the controller. The second is a current sense controller which is designed by the root locus method to regulate the electrical current of the DC geared motor that varies due to environmental changes. Verified by simulation, an accurate control of the feedback force can be achieved. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S. M. E...|$|E
50|$|With an 800000 sq ft {{factory in}} the Murray Industrial Park, the company {{employed}} 1,350 people in 2015, and sold its products worldwide. Besides selling under their own name, the company also manufactures agricultural equipment for other companies including John Deere, producing self-propelled <b>windrowers,</b> headers and pull-type mowers, sold under the John Deere brand. The president and CEO of the company is Gary Giesbrecht.|$|R
50|$|A smaller mower {{used for}} lawns and sports grounds (playing fields) {{is called a}} lawn mower or grounds mower, which is often self-powered, or may also be small enough to be pushed by the operator. Grounds mowers have reel or rotary cutters. Larger mowers or mower-conditioners are mainly used to cut grass (or other crops) for hay or silage and often place the cut {{material}} into rows, which {{are referred to as}} windrows. Swathers (or <b>windrowers)</b> are also used to cut grass (and grain crops). Prior to the invention and adoption of mechanized mowers, (and today in places where use a mower is impractical or uneconomical), grass and grain crops were cut by hand using scythes or sickles.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this descriptive-correlation {{study was to examine}} the {{variables}} associated with Northern Utah farmers’ adoption of auto-guidance technologies in alfalfa and corn silage production and determine training preferences. Participants in this study engaged in an experiential training session utilizing an auto-guidance system comparable to those available for use on their own farm. A survey was administered to identify autoguidance technology adoption and farmers’ preferences for related training. The majority of participants reported being male (f = 56, 98. 2 %). Half of the participants in this study (50. 8 %) indicated using auto-guidance technology in some form in their farming practices. Most attendees used auto-guidance technology with tractors (36. 1 %) and self-propelled <b>windrowers</b> (32. 8 %).

40|$|Evaluation of {{the noise}} {{exposure}} of agricultural machine operators requires that machine operation time and intermittancy of work patterns be determined. One method of obtaining such data is by using event activity recorders. These data are available for haying machines operated at the University of Nebraska Field Laboratory, Mead during the 1963 through 1966 seasons. Approximately 60 machine operator days per season were recorded on service recorder charts for the following machines: 1. self-propelled <b>windrowers</b> 2. self-propelled and pull-type balers 3. self-propelled and pull-type bale wagons In addition some motion-time study data are available for the newer loose hay stackers and large roll balers. One seasons data, 1965, has been analyzed for a self-propelled baler to illustrate the information already available. Machine operator time and intermittancy work patterns were determined for the 35 days of baling when activity charts were obtained. Briefly, the results are summarized as follows...|$|R
40|$|Renewable fuel {{production}} {{is essential to}} improve the energy independence of the United States. Cellulosic ethanol is renewable fuel that is gaining traction in the commercial fuels industry. This fuel {{can be made from}} agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops widely available in the Midwestern United States. The biofuels industry is already moving to meet these federal biofuels mandates and to establish sustainable biomass feedstock supply chains. Two companies have scheduled to build dedicated cellulosic ethanol refineries in Iowa. This initial phase of a biofuels supply chain is currently in its infancy and will require significant efficiency improvements and enhancement to current methods to ensure profitability. The resulting harvest costs, transportation costs and material quality all have significant impact on the cellulosic ethanol industry. The objective of the first chapter of this thesis was to determine the best method for semi-automated and large scale analysis of machinery management parameters. Electronic data logging of GPS position and CAN messages provides the timing and operational status needed for calculation of machinery management terms. Additional information like fuel rate, engine speed, hydraulic flow, or specific implement parameters can also be captured. This data enables detailed performance evaluation. GIS software was used to query the dataset. Appropriate spatial selections and parameter filters were defined for each performance parameter. This ensured measurement of productivity terms in conformance to ASABE Machinery Management Standards. The objective of the second chapter was to quantify and provide detailed information on the performance of corn stover collection equipment during industrial scale harvest operations. Current equipment developed for the hay and forage industry can be used to harvest corn stover. Understanding the performance characteristics of this repurposed forage equipment is critically important for the continued development of the cellulosic ethanol industry. Two <b>windrowers,</b> two square balers, and a bale collection system were evaluated as part of a 2010 partial corn stover residue harvest. An examination of machine operation allows researchers to calculate management parameters like field capacity, field efficiency, and fuel consumption. The combined methods and results developed and reported in these articles can be used to aid with equipment selection, develop economic models, and help managers estimate operating costs associated with process scale up. With accurate performance data on specific equipment, modelers can evaluate the impact of different harvesting scenarios. This can help certify that the prescribed and implement methods are practical, achievable, and sustainable...|$|R
