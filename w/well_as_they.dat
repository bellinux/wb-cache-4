5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{were seeking}} {{to emulate the}} success of rivals Blackburn Olympic, who were the current holders of the trophy, and the team that Queen's Park {{defeated}} in the semi-final. Rovers had previously reached the FA Cup final, in 1882, where they were defeated by Old Etonians. Blackburn trained during the week prior to the game by conducting practise games and going for walks. They departed for the London area by train {{on the day before}} the final; a large crowd of local supporters gathered at the train station in Blackburn to wish them <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> left. The team stayed in Richmond the night before the match and made their way into the city at lunchtime on the Saturday.|$|E
5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax â€“ all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E
5|$|While {{some small}} teeth have been found, few fossilized skeletons of manta rays have been discovered. Their {{cartilaginous}} skeletons do not preserve <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> lack the calcification of the bony fish. Only three sedimentary beds bearing manta ray fossils are known, {{one from the}} Oligocene in South Carolina and two from the Miocene and Pliocene in North Carolina. Remains of an extinct species {{have been found in}} the Chandler Bridge Formation of South Carolina. These were originally described as Manta fragilis but were later reclassified as Paramobula fragilis.|$|E
50|$|The nomads move {{frequently}} between <b>wells,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> {{are prone}} to dry up or grow salty when overused.|$|R
5000|$|The {{practice}} of tying pieces of cloth to a wish tree is often directly associated with nearby clootie <b>wells,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are known in Scotland and Ireland, or [...] "cloutie" [...] or [...] "cloughtie" [...] in Cornwall.|$|R
5000|$|Iron-oxidizing {{bacteria}} can pose {{an issue for}} the management of water-supply <b>wells,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> can produce insoluble ferric oxide, which appears as brown gelatinous slime that will stain plumbing fixtures, and clothing or utensils washed with the water carrying it.|$|R
5|$|The {{difficulty}} of deploying artillery in New Guinea {{led to a}} need for a gun which could be broken down into light parts and transported by aircraft or jeeps. The Army had {{only a small number of}} British 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers, and Australia's request for United States M116 75mm pack howitzers was not immediately filled. In September 1942, the Army's Director of Artillery, Brigadier John O'Brien, suggested that a variant of the 25-pounder be developed to meet this requirement. This proposal was agreed to, and all development work was conducted in Australia by the Army, the Ordnance Production Directorate and Charles Ruwolt Pty Ltd. The process of designing the gun began in September 1942, and an acceptable weapon was ready by January the next year. The three agencies cooperated <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were strongly motivated to provide the Army with a useful light artillery piece as quickly as possible. During this period, the Army received thirty-eight 75mm pack howitzers, and deployed some of these guns to New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|The {{lower leg}} and ankle {{need to keep}} {{exercised}} and moving <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are {{the base of the}} whole body. The lower extremities must be strong in order to balance the weight {{of the rest of the}} body, and the gastrocnemius muscles take part in much of the blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|The 2/14th {{reached an}} unoccupied Wampun at 14:00. Honner {{found that the}} native porters {{accompanying}} his battalion had no water, and were therefore not only thirsty, but hungry as <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> could not cook their rice rations. If no water {{could be found in}} the vicinity, he would have to arrange for water to be sent by jeep from Kaigulan II, or else move the whole battalion on to the next day's objective.|$|E
25|$|His most {{prolific}} year came in 1979, {{when he made}} 1,222 runs at a batting average of 42.13. It was a memorable year for Somerset as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> won the Gillette Cup and Sunday League under Rose's captaincy. Denning was a good limited overs player having the ability to run quick singles. The following year, in partnership with Ian Botham, he added 310 for the fourth wicket against Gloucestershire at Taunton in 1980, which remains a record for Somerset.|$|E

25|$|Feijenoord's again won a {{division}} title {{with a national}} championship in 1940, their fifth Dutch title. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, play continued in Dutch football leagues, though the 1945 championship was cancelled as the war came to its conclusion. During this period, Feijenoord's only trophy was {{a division}}al championship in 1943. After the war, Feijenoord did not perform as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had in previous decades, not seriously challenging in their division and so missing the national playoff rounds.|$|E
25|$|Worcestershire won the toss at Chester-le-Street {{and chose}} to bat first. Stephen Peters and Stephen Moore started them off <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> moved to 75 without loss. Then Mark Davies, who is {{fighting}} for his first-team place, took six wickets to reduce them to 120, before Steve Harmison (3 wickets) and Paul Collingwood (1 wicket) finished off the tail to reduce Worcestershire to 171 all out. Collingwood then returned with the bat and got to 88 not out, to leave Durham well-placed on 139 for 2 at close.|$|E
25|$|Due to the devadasi being equated to prostitutes, {{they also}} became {{associated}} with the spreading of venereal disease in India. During the British Colonial period, many British soldiers were exposed to venereal disease in the various brothels being operated at that time. As such, devadasis were misunderstood {{to be responsible for}} this. In efforts to control the spread of venereal disease, the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves, with devadasis being forced to do this as <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.|$|E

25|$|Overall a {{majority}} of military brats report having developed a kind of extra-adaptability and assimilate into new situations quickly and <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have done with each {{move to a new}} military base, town or country. Yet paradoxically, long-term feelings of being an outsider in relation to civilian (non-military) culture are common to {{a majority}} of military brats. For example, one major study shows that 32% of military brats feel as if they are only spectators on U.S. life, and another 48% do not feel as if they are central to any group.|$|E
25|$|Mermaids- Stubborn, yet {{loyal and}} true to their word, mermaids have amazing voices that can hypnotize giants and humans. They {{are not easy}} to strike a deal with, as they {{frequently}} want something in return and usually take people as hostages to ensure the deal is kept. They {{seem to be able to}} do some magic as <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the Fiesta Cup, the team was running <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> won three {{straight}} games and four of their first five including a win over powerhouse team the San Miguel Beermen. But after a great start, the Tigers then lost their last seven games. They ended their losing streak by winning against the Barako Bull Energy Boosters. They finished the eliminations with an 8-10 record and advanced to the Wildcard round. They won their knockout match against Sta. Lucia but got eliminated again by Rain or Shine {{at the conclusion of the}} wildcards.|$|E

25|$|Vicky (Sally Ann Marsh) - Mrs Dribelle's niece. She was {{supposed}} to have been an accountant, but Vicky had dreams of being part of a band. She moves into the upstairs flat in after Alec Smart is thrown out. She is supposed to work for her auntie, but she is always secretly auditioning for jobs as a drummer. She hides her drum kit in the bath when Mrs Dribelle visits as she disapproves of it. Vicky and Badger got on very <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> both love mashed potato. She ended up going on tour with a travelling band as a drummer. Vicky only appeared in Series 7.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2008, Marshall and Jones {{left the}} band to pursue other careers. Charlie Griffiths, the guitarist {{for the band}} Linear Sphere and Anchorhead became a {{full-time}} member of the band. Griffiths parted ways with Linear Sphere {{because he wanted to}} go in a different direction musically. Mexican keyboardist Diego Tejeida auditioned and eventually joined the band in late 2008 as <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> began to tour more, even opening a few UK shows for King's X, Sensory Records recognized them and offered them a record deal. They began recording for their debut album, Aquarius, soon after, and it was released in March 2010.|$|E
