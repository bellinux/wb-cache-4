5|$|Best {{passed the}} eleven plus exam at Blackmoor Park primary school in West Derby, and was {{studying}} at the Liverpool Collegiate Grammar School in Shaw Street {{when he decided}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a music group.

Chas Newby and Bill Barlow joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after {{he had left the}} Quarrymen.

Chas Newby joined the group, as did Ken Brown, but only after he had left The Quarrymen. The reason for Brown's exit from the group was that he turned up on the seventh Saturday night of The Quarrymen residency at The Casbah with the flu, so Mona ordered him upstairs to the Best's living room to rest. This caused a massive quarrel {{with the rest of}} the group when Mona came to pay them, as they wanted Brown's money to be shared amongst the three of them, as Brown had not played. Mona refused, so The Quarrymen angrily cancelled their residency and stormed out.|$|E

5|$|Houston offered Bowie a {{commission}} {{as an officer}} on his staff, but Bowie rejected the opportunity, explaining that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst of the}} fighting. Instead, Bowie enlisted in the army as a private under Fannin. He distinguished himself again in the Grass Fight on November 26. Cós had sent approximately 187men to cut grass for his horses. As they returned to San Antonio, Bowie took 60mounted men to intercept the party, which they believed carried valuable cargo.

At the end of the fight, the Texians had two wounded men, but had captured many horses and mules.|$|E
5|$|This film is {{important}} for being the debut of Marguerite Snow, who {{would become one of}} the most important actresses for the company. In an interview by Johnson Briscoe, Snow said that her career as an actress was an accidental one. A girl friend of hers suggested she come to the studio to see how motion pictures are made. There at the studio, Edwin Thanhouser asked her if she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the film. Snow accepted and she took part in the production until the director asked them to go outside to shoot another scene. Snow then protested about going outside in such a costume and in winter and proceeded home. A week later she received a phone call and ended up working for six more months before temporarily returning to the stage. Another baseball related film would be released later that year by the Thanhouser Company, The Baseball Bug.|$|E

Other groups like The Searchers and Gerry & The Pacemakers later played in the club. The Black Jacks became the resident group at The Casbah, although The Quarrymen occasionally played there again and often visited. It was in The Casbah Club that Lennon and McCartney convinced Sutcliffe to buy a Hofner president bass guitar and join The Quarrymen.|$|E

25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and set it up right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that {{we were in a}} great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E

Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E

25|$|Loerzer was out {{of contact}} with Reichenau's command post for three days, while Richthofen was soon {{complaining}} to Löhr about the former's ignorance.

His claims were not always believed, and these personal operations were {{a waste of time and}} needlessly exposed him to danger. Indeed, Major Spielvogel was shot down over Warsaw in his Storch on 9 September, and killed. While the operational situation was not good, Löhr took command of Fliegerführer z.b.V., giving the unit virtual autonomy and allowing Richthofen to build a personal empire of six Gruppen (Groups).|$|E

500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person you need to be to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E
