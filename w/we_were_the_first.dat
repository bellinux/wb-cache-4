Criminology professor David Wilson commented on the resonance of the murder case with the national news media: [...] "The British public loves a whodunnit ... It's a particularly British thing. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> nation to use murder stories to sell newspapers and that culture is more ingrained here than elsewhere." [...] Wilson called Yeates, a white female professional, an [...] "ideal victim" [...] for the media. On 1 January, Yeates' boyfriend Greg Reardon commented on the media coverage surrounding the arrest of Jefferies: [...] "Jo's life was cut short tragically but the finger-pointing and character assassination by social and news media of an as yet innocent men has been shameful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Super Mario Bros., the {{successor}} to the 1983 arcade title Mario Bros., was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka, both of whom belonged to Nintendo's former Entertainment Analysis and Development division at the time. Though not originally using any particular character, the very deliberate creative process of what would become their next game was motivated by their technical knowledge from previous games like Excitebike and Kung Fu, {{by a desire to}} give the ROM cartridge format [...] "a final exclamation point" [...] in light of the forthcoming Famicom Disk System which was expected to become the dominant new game delivery medium, and by continuing their legacy of [...] "athletic games" [...] with a character running and jumping with many obstacles. Miyamoto explained, [...] "We felt strongly about how <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to come up with that genre, and it was a goal of ours to keep pushing it." [...] Development was aimed at simplicity, {{in order to have a}} new game available for the end-of-year shopping season.|$|E

I had the control panel in front of me, it's old hat now but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to do it. There were pieces of rubber with silver paper on the back with a silver coil that moved up and down inside a magnet that produced a signal, so it was touch sensitive. I had 5 snares across the top and then ten tom-toms and then a whole octave of bass drums underneath my feet and then four lots of 16 sequencers, two on each side. There was a gap — to play a space — a tambourine, ebony stick, snare and three tom-toms. This was pre-chip days, back then you did it all with transistors. So it had something like 500 transistors. The electronic drums inside looked something like spaghetti. When it worked it was superb, but it was before its day, because it was so sensitive..." ...|$|E

It was a long run, but, as we were to the north of the islands, we had the more sea-room; so we steered east half a point, one way or other, for the Manillas, or Philippine Islands, which was the true design of our voyage; and, perhaps, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> ship that ever came to those islands, freighted from Europe, since the Portuguese lost their footing there.|$|E
