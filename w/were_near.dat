5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy found several factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A.

Badajocenses Christians from the earliest centuries towards the end of 19th century buried their dead in or near churches.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars <b>were</b> <b>near</b> {{the end of}} their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E

The La Jolla home proved beneficial in location and climate for Ann Romney's multiple sclerosis therapies and for recovering from her late 2008 diagnosis of mammary ductal carcinoma in situ and subsequent lumpectomy. Both it and the New Hampshire location <b>were</b> <b>near</b> some of their grandchildren. Romney maintained his voting registration in Massachusetts, however, and bought a smaller condominium in Belmont during 2010.|$|E
5|$|In June 1874, {{the whole}} of Northumberland House was {{purchased}} by the Metropolitan Board of Works and demolished to form Northumberland Avenue, which would accommodate hotels. Contemporary planning permissions forbade hotels to be taller than {{the width of the}} road they were on; consequently Northumberland Avenue was built with a wide carriageway. Part of the parallel Northumberland Street was demolished in order {{to make way for the}} avenue's eastern end. The street was open by 1876. The hotels were popular for American visitors as they <b>were</b> <b>near</b> to the West End, government buildings on Whitehall and all the mainline stations.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mountains}} northeast of Waegwan, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer North Korean attacks throughout mid-August. North Korean pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long. US planners believed the main North Korean attack {{would come from}} the west, and so it massed its forces {{to the west of}} Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 North Korean troops <b>were</b> <b>near</b> Taegu. This number was above the actual troop numbers for North Korea, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter.|$|E

5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding {{stated that}} they <b>were</b> <b>near</b> a bankruptcy, and that they {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company {{stated that they}} might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball stated that they had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E
5|$|September 25, 1939: The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm made landfall near Long Beach. Winds <b>were</b> <b>near</b> 80km/h (50mph) and rain was near 12inches (300mm). At sea, 48people were killed. On land, 45 {{were killed in}} flooding, although these deaths may be partially attributable to a nasty thunderstorm immediately preceding the {{tropical storm}}. This is the only known landfall in California by a tropical cyclone at tropical storm strength, during the twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-120 {{like all}} other components of the Michigan state trunkline highway system. As part of these responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes along the highway. MDOT uses a metric called average annual daily traffic, which is a calculation of the traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In 2009, the highest traffic levels <b>were</b> <b>near</b> the southern terminus at 26,736vehicles each day. The lowest levels MDOT calculated were in Holton at 5,936vehicles daily. The section between the south end and US31, M-120 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The remainder of the highway has not been listed.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} a dry line, which {{separates}} the drier {{air from the}} more moist and humid air, formed ahead of the cold front across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and tracked eastward. The high humidity levels with dew points in the 70s°F (low 20s°C), temperatures that in many areas <b>were</b> <b>near</b> 80°F (27°C), strong wind shear {{and the presence of}} the dry line helped develop the instability to produce severe thunderstorms across the Midwest and Southern Plains on October 17.|$|E
5|$|The {{observation}} {{of a total}} solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, helped to confirm Einstein's theory of general relativity. By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus, with and without the Sun between them, Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed. The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality since the stars are then visible. Though Eddington's observations <b>were</b> <b>near</b> the experimental limits of accuracy at the time, work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results.|$|E
5|$|There was {{resistance}} from the air, though. As the fifth wave of seven LCIs was coming in to Red Beach, they were attacked by six Zeke fighters and three Betty bombers that dropped twelve bombs. One hit the deck of USS LCI-339 forward of the conning tower; another two <b>were</b> <b>near</b> misses. Badly damaged and riddled by bullets and fragments, the ship caught fire. LCI-339 remained on the beach, where she served as a landmark for Japanese aircraft. She was eventually towed off the beach, but then drifted onto a reef and became a total loss. USS LCI-341 suffered a near miss that tore a huge hole in its side. Eight Australians were killed, including Lieutenant Colonel R. E. Wall, the commanding officer of the 2/23rd Infantry Battalion, and 45 were wounded.|$|E

5|$|While Japanese {{submarines}} sank 17 {{ships in}} Australian waters in 1942 (14 of which <b>were</b> <b>near</b> the Australian coast) the submarine offensive {{did not have}} a serious impact on the Allied war effort in the South West Pacific or the Australian economy. Nevertheless, by forcing ships sailing along the east coast to travel in convoy the Japanese submarines were successful in reducing the efficiency of Australian coastal shipping. This lower efficiency translated into between 7.5% and 22% less tonnage being transported between Australian ports each month (no accurate figures are available and the estimated figure varied between months). These convoys were effective, however, with no ship travelling as part of a convoy being sunk in Australian waters during 1942.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 65 ABC affiliates—28% of the network—did not clear the {{available}} timeslot for the film, {{even with the}} offer of The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent, to pay all fines for language to the Federal Communications Commission. In the end, however, no complaints were lodged against ABC affiliates who showed Ryan, perhaps because even conservative watchdogs like the Parents Television Council supported the unedited rebroadcast of the film. Additionally, some ABC affiliates in other markets that <b>were</b> <b>near</b> affected markets, such as Youngstown, Ohio, ABC affiliate WYTV (which is viewable {{in parts of the}} Columbus, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh markets, none of which aired the film) and Gainesville, Florida, ABC affiliate WCJB-TV (which is viewable in parts of the Orlando and Tampa markets), still aired the film and gave those nearby markets the option of viewing the film. TNT and Turner Classic Movies have also broadcast the film.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they <b>were</b> <b>near</b> Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
