500|$|Nevertheless, some reviewers found Jawss {{description}} of the shark attacks entertaining. John Spurling of the New Statesman asserted that while the [...] "characterisation of the humans is fairly rudimentary", the shark [...] "is done with exhilarating and alarming skill, and every scene in which it appears is imagined at a special pitch of intensity." [...] Christopher Lehmann-Haupt praised the novel in a short review for The New York Times, highlighting the [...] "strong plot" [...] and [...] "rich thematic substructure." [...] The Washington Posts Robert F. Jones described Jaws as [...] "much more than a gripping fish story. It is a tightly written, tautly paced study," [...] which [...] "forged and touched a metaphor that still makes us tingle whenever we enter the water." [...] New York Magazine reviewer Eliot Fremont-Smith found the novel [...] "immensely readable" [...] {{despite the lack of}} [...] "memorable characters or much plot surprise or originality"; Fremont-Smith wrote that Benchley [...] "fulfills all expectations, provides just enough civics and ecology to make us feel good, and tops it off <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> terrific and grisly battle scene".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum.

Scripts written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a [...] "John Gillnitz"—a portmanteau of the three writers' names. According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] {{was supposed to come}} before the episode. Vince Gilligan explained, [...] " [...] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before , and we knew {{the best way to do}} that would be <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> creepy stand-alone monster story." [...] Thus, the air date of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was flipped with [...] "Never Again" [...] in order to ensure that the former episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl. Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently in [...] "Never Again"—which featured Scully acting notably out of character—had she been aware that Scully would get cancer at the time, as Scully only discovers this at the end of [...] "Leonard Betts".|$|E

500|$|Impressed by {{his work}} on Memento, Steven Soderbergh {{recruited}} Nolan to direct the psychological thriller Insomnia (2002), starring Academy Award winners Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Warner Bros. initially wanted a more seasoned director, but Soderbergh and his Section Eight Productions fought for Nolan, {{as well as his}} choice of cinematographer (Wally Pfister) and editor (Dody Dorn). [...] With a $46 million budget, it was described as [...] "a much more conventional Hollywood film than anything the director has done before". A remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name, Insomnia is about two Los Angeles detectives sent to a northern Alaskan town to investigate the methodical murder of a local teenager. It received positive reviews from critics and performed well at the box office, earning $113 million worldwide. Film critic Roger Ebert praised the film for introducing new perspectives and ideas on the issues of morality and guilt. [...] "Unlike most remakes, the Nolan Insomnia is not a pale retread, but a re-examination of the material, like a new production of a good play." [...] Erik Skjoldbjærg, the director of the original film, was satisfied with Nolan's version, calling it a [...] "well crafted, smart film ... <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good director handling it". Richard Schickel of Time deemed Insomnia a [...] "worthy successor" [...] to Memento, and [...] "a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery." ...|$|E
500|$|Carla Day of TV Fanatic gave a more {{positive}} review, rating the episode 4.5 out of 5, and praising Penny's response to Howard's apology and claiming that it [...] "provided a nice chuckle." [...] Jill Mader of Inside Pulse also gave the episode a {{more positive}} review, praising [...] "that the episode ended <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> sweet moment for Howard as, after all, he is a character who doesn't often get to be sweet" [...] and claimed that it was [...] "definitely about people changing and moving forward, and The Big Bang Theory {{has done a great}} job of emotionally maturing many of their characters over the past couple seasons". Despite this, she said that [...] "the episode wasn't as [...] as [...] hoped it would be" [...] and [...] "felt like there was more potential in Howard's bachelor party than just revealing some unflattering secrets to Bernadette." [...] Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode as 56 out of 100, describing Howard's [...] "little speech" [...] as [...] "very well written and performed". However, he considered most of the comedy [...] "generic", especially in regards to the jokes about Jewish stereotypes and Penny's dismissal of Leonard. Overall, Pierson said it [...] "wasn't the strongest episode of comedy" [...] and [...] "wasn't a particularly interesting episode until the end".|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} negative. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said the {{flashback}} storyline [...] "wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned, and also disliked Michael's on-Island storyline, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes". Jensen however complimented the Hatch scenes, considering that Terry O'Quinn's performance and his interaction with Henry Ian Cusick were [...] "salvaging the first mediocre episode of the season". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it thought that revealing the Hatch events through different perspectives a [...] "fresh narrative approach", but complained about the lack of plot advancement, and considered the raft storyline [...] "three times as long as needed, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> fake shark attack to boot". IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, praising Perrineau's performance and the flashback, but the website later ranked [...] "Adrift" [...] 80th out of the 115 Lost episodes, jokingly saying that the shark should have eaten Michael [...] "and save us a lot of 'Waaaaaalt!' and 'They took him. From my hands!' shout fests". A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the fourth worst of the series, describing it as [...] "boring". New York magazine listed [...] "Adrift" [...] in its [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost", complaining about [...] "grinding the story to a halt" [...] and the [...] "plodding" [...] flashback, and saying that the episode would have been improved if Sawyer and Michael reached land faster.|$|E

2500|$|In the November 1932 {{election}} the Nazis lost seats, but Papen {{was still}} unable to get a Reichstag that would not pass a vote of no-confidence {{like the one that}} brought down his first government. Papen then decided to try to negotiate with Hitler, but Hitler's reply contained so many conditions that Papen gave up all hope of reaching agreement. Hitler wanted a presidential government, but Hindenburg stated that he would allow Hitler a parliamentary government. On 24 November 1932, during the course of another Hitler–Hindenburg meeting, Hindenburg stated his fears that [...] "a presidential cabinet led by Hitler would necessarily develop into a party dictatorship with all its consequences for an extreme aggravation of the conflicts within the German people".Soon afterward, under pressure from Schleicher, Papen resigned on 17 November, and formed a caretaker government. In November 1932, Paul Dinichert, the Swiss ambassador to Germany reported: [...] "I left Herr von Papen with the impression of having spoken <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> glib man who cannot be blamed if one gets bored in his presence. Whether this should be the principal trait of the man who today governs Germany is, to be sure, another question."

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{were again}} without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, {{a friend of the}} band, {{suggested}} Chad Smith, claiming he was the best drummer she had ever seen. The band agreed to audition Smith, but he was late and the last drummer to audition. Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking down the street <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis was not about to argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E

However, in an interview before her 2012 Australian Open semifinal, Sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis {{for as long as she}} enjoyed playing the game.

2500|$|When the qin is played, {{a number}} of {{aesthetic}} elements are involved. The first is musicality. In the second section of [...] "Pingsha Luoyan", for example, the initial few bars contain a nao vibrato followed by a phase of sliding {{up and down the}} string, even when the sound has already become inaudible [...] The average person trained in music may question whether this is really [...] "music". Normally, some players would pluck the string very lightly to create a very quiet sound. For some players, this plucking isn't necessary. Instead of trying to force a sound out of the string one should allow the natural sounds emit from the strings. Some players say that the sliding on the string even when the sound has disappeared is a distinctive feature in qin music. It creates a [...] "space" [...] or [...] "void" [...] in a piece, playing without playing, sound without sound. In fact, when the viewer looks at the player sliding on the string without sounds, the viewer automatically [...] "fills in the notes" [...] with their minds. This creates a connection between player, instrument and listener. This, of course, cannot happen when listening to a recording, as one cannot see the performer. It can also be seen as impractical in recording, as the player would want to convey sound as much as possible towards a third audience. But in fact, there is sound, the sound coming from the fingers sliding on the string. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> good qin, silk strings, and a perfectly quiet environment, all the tones can be sounded. Since the music is more player oriented than listener oriented, and the player knows the music, he/she can hear it even if the sound is not there. With silk strings, the sliding sound might be called the qi or [...] "life force" [...] of the music. The really empty sounds are the pauses between notes. However, if one cannot create a sound that can be heard when sliding on a string, it is generally acceptable to lightly pluck the string to create a very quiet sound.|$|E
