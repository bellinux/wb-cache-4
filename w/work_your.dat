"Let's All Chant" [...] is a disco song {{driven by}} a {{repetitive}} bassline, handclaps and numerous vocal hooks (such as [...] "Ah-ah, eh-eh, let's all chant" [...] and [...] "Your body, my body, everybody <b>work</b> <b>your</b> body"). These typical disco lyrics are about dancing and working one's body. The song's instrumentation also includes Afro-Cuban drums, a [...] "rollicking" [...] piano line and an ensemble of wind instruments, marked by a piccolo trumpet solo which sounds [...] "like it's {{straight out of the}} Dynasty opening theme song". The song's tempo is 121 bpm and is very close to the average tempo of a standard disco song (120 bpm). According to AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson, the combination of the [...] "European-influenced, oddly baroque" [...] feeling with a [...] "catchy disco/funk beat" [...] grabs the attention of the listener and encourages him to discover the rest of the eponymous LP.|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you <b>work</b> <b>your</b> way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E
500|$|Phips and Increase Mather reached Boston in {{separate}} ships on May 14, 1692. [...] This was a Saturday afternoon, meaning all activity was [...] to cease at sundown {{according to the}} old Puritan laws regarding the sabbath. Unlike his arrival in [...] HMS Rose in 1683, when Phips showed little regard for the sabbath, on this occasion Phips was highly deferential toward the theocracy. Phips' elaborate swearing-in ceremony at the meeting house was halted at sundown and delayed until the following Monday. According to one letter writer, Phips presented himself as having no intentions to oppose the ancient laws and customs of Puritan Boston. He promised to rule as a weak governor, according to the tradition of his predecessors. The speech itself had likely been crafted with the care and attention of Increase Mather as they crossed the Atlantic. They seemed to have come to an agreement—you <b>work</b> <b>your</b> {{side of the street}} and I'll work mine—whereby Phips would tend to the frontier while Increase Mather and his slate of cohorts would see to domestic affairs.|$|E

30|$|This passage also {{implies that}} if you want to be a {{positive}} and influential leader in the world, first you must get your own life in order. Ground yourself in the universal principle so that your behaviour is wholesome and effective. If you do that, you will earn trust and respect, and be a powerful influence. Your behaviour influences others through a ripple effect. Everyone influences everyone else, powerful people are powerful influences. For perspective of Laozi’s wisdom, we understand if <b>your</b> life <b>works,</b> you influence <b>your</b> organization; if <b>your</b> organization <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> organization influences the community; if <b>your</b> community <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> community influences the nation; if <b>your</b> nation <b>works,</b> <b>your</b> nation influences the world, and if <b>your</b> world <b>works,</b> the ripple effect spreads through the cosmos. Your influence begins with you and ripples outward. So be sure that your influence is both potent and wholesome.|$|R

500|$|The first {{war ended}} in 1851, but would resume in 1864. During this interlude, Ernest fervently opposed the {{marriage}} of his nephew Albert Edward, Prince of Wales ('Bertie') to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark (and therefore {{an enemy of the}} German states). He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests. Albert replied angrily [...] "What has {{that got to do with}} you?... Vicky has racked her brains to help us to find someone, but in vain...We have no [...] choice". Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match, but as he could find no alternative bride, he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter (and outside the realm of government) was [...] "the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands, impose the conditions that we think necessary, and as far as we can, take off its political edge". Albert also warned his son of Ernest's endeavors to interfere with the match, commenting, [...] "Your uncle...will try his hand at this <b>work.</b> <b>Your</b> best defence will be not to enter on the subject, should he broach it".|$|E

2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, in 1961, NBC hired Joe Garagiola to {{be their}} Major League Baseball color commentator. The following year, Bob Wolff began working play-by-play. [...] "You <b>work</b> <b>your</b> {{side of the street}} [...] ", said Garagiola to Wolff [...] "and I'll work mine." [...] Wolff liked Garagiola's pizazz as he would say things like [...] "the guy stapled him to the bag" [...] or that a runner is [...] "smilin' like he swallowed a banana peel." [...] Also in 1962, NBC broadcast the National League tie-breaker series between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Bob Wolff and George Kell were the announcers for the playoff series. Wolff also hosted the pre-game shows for NBC's World Series coverage from 1962 to 1965.|$|E
