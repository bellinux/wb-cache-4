Here we present the more detailed {{theory of the}} amplitude and phase fluctuations approach {{in the framework of}} a fermionic pairing model. New experimental comparisons are presented for the specific heat of the curprate LSCO confirming the generality of this phenomenological approach. The strong decrease of amplitude fluctuations near optimal doping induces the illusion of a "quantum critical point", which in fact does not exist since the pseudogap energy scale is always different from zero even in the overdoped regime.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the basis of}} classification system named as excavation rock mass rating system (ERMR). The purpose for system development {{comes from the fact}} that in all civil engineering or minning projects, one of the key problems is <b>to</b> <b>addopt</b> technology of excavation on the characterisstics of natural environment, and to chosse and adequate equipement for excavation. Methodology for establishing of ERMR system is based on ranking and scoring of careffuly choosen classification parameters. The parameters for classification and the range of parameters in each class is explained briefly. The system is correlated with some known rating rock mass systems. The classification is developed on the bases of numerous investigations for different civil engineering and mining projects, as well as laboratory testings of rock mass parameters. The case histories used in developing of the ERMR system are noted. For each rock mass class, an adequate technology of excavation is suggested, and the excavation classes are corelated with unit price of excavation in different media. The practical aplication of ERMR system is undelined...|$|R

40|$|To clarify {{whether a}} single {{oncogene}} can transform primary cells in culture, {{we compared the}} transforming effect of a recombinant retrovirus (ZSV) containing the v-src gene in rat embryo fibroblasts (<b>REFs)</b> <b>to</b> that in the rat cell line 3 Y 1. In the focus assay, <b>REFs</b> exhibited resistance <b>to</b> transformation as only six foci were observed in the primary cultures as opposed to 98 in 3 Y 1 cells. After G 418 selection, efficiency of transformation was again somewhat lower with <b>REFs</b> compared <b>to</b> that with 3 Y 1 cells, {{but the number of}} G 418 -resistant REF colonies was much greater than the number of foci in REF cultures. Furthermore, while 98 % of G 418 -resistant colonies of ZSV-infected REFs were morphologically transformed, only 25 % were converted to anchorage- independent growth, as opposed to 100 % conversion seen in ZSV-infected 3 Y 1 cells. The poor susceptibility of <b>REFs</b> <b>to</b> anchorage-independent transformation did not involve differences in expression and subcellular distribution of p 60 v-src, or its kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. It rather reflected a property of the primary cultures, as cloning of REFs before ZSV infection demonstrated that only 2 out of 6 REF clones tested were permissive for anchorage-independent growth. The nonpermissive phenotype was dominant over the permissive one in somatic hybrid cells, and associated with organized actin filament bundles and a lower growth rate, both before and after ZSV infection. These results indicate that the poor susceptibility of <b>REFs</b> <b>to</b> anchorage-independent transformation by p 60 v-src reflects the heterogeneity of the primary cultures. REFs can be morphologically transformed by p 60 v-src with high efficiency but only a small fraction is convertible to anchorage- independent growth. <b>REF</b> resistance seems <b>to</b> involve the presence of a suppressor factor which may emerge from REF differentiation during embryonic development...|$|R
