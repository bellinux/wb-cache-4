50|$|The {{efficacy}} of weatherstripping can be significantly increased by specialty coatings during manufacture. Coatings for weatherstripping must adhere {{to all of}} these <b>weatherstrip</b> materials. Like other paints and coatings, a large variety of <b>weatherstrip</b> coatings are commonly available, with a large variety of coating performances. Silicone is the most difficult to adhere to, but at least one coating is commercially available. After bonding to the <b>weatherstrip,</b> these coatings provide chemical and ultraviolet resistance, decrease the static coefficient of friction (thereby reducing the force required to open or close doors), and reduce or eliminate noise. In vehicles without coated weatherstripping, the weatherstripping is much more likely to cause the above-mentioned issues along with others such as rust following premature failure of the paint. That some cars have non-coated weatherstripping is surprising, given that the cost of the coating is less than US$1 to US$3 per vehicle, whereas the rubber and steel is tens of dollars; an entire car set of weatherstripping may be worth US$100 to US$300 in the total cost of the vehicle, which includes all labor and costs of the manufacturing equipment.|$|E
25|$|Door <b>weatherstripping</b> is {{particularly}} important for energy efficiency. German-made Passive House doors use multiple <b>weatherstrips,</b> including magnetic strips, to meet higher standards. These <b>weatherstrips</b> are critical to reduce to a minimum energy losses due to air leakage.|$|R
50|$|Low-energy {{buildings}} {{require special}} doors with special <b>weatherstripping</b> standards, {{based on the}} alignment of the threshold and jamb gasketing, multiple <b>weatherstripping,</b> and special seals - including special silicone or synthetic rubber seals, but also compression and steel magnetic <b>weatherstrips.</b>|$|R
50|$|Every {{exterior}} door, or door to an uninsulated room {{such as an}} attic, must be <b>weatherstripped</b> {{as required}} by building codes in various jurisdictions. The materials used in door <b>weatherstripping</b> are thresholds, a piece of material (either a sweep or a J-hook) to match {{the door to the}} threshold, and the actual <b>weatherstripping</b> itself. Doors can usually be divided into private homes and commercial properties. Some of these doors receive custom <b>weatherstripping</b> at the factory.|$|R
50|$|Automobile flex when {{going over}} bumps, and {{vibrations}} cause relative motions between the relatively fixed body and movable parts like doors, windows, and sunroofs. This movement could allow {{water in the}} vehicle so the <b>weatherstrip</b> must compensate by filling the gap. Furthermore, this relative movement can cause noises such as squeaks, rattles, and creaks to be heard within the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Each mast of the Viaduct is {{equipped}} with a monoaxial layer of eleven pairs of cable-stays; laid face to face. Depending on their length, the cable stays were made of 55 to 91 high tensile steel cables, or strands, themselves formed of seven strands of steel (a central strand with six intertwined strands). Each strand has triple protection against corrosion (galvanisation, a coating of petroleum wax, and an extruded polyethylene sheath). The exterior envelope of the stays is itself coated along its entire length with a double helical <b>weatherstrip.</b> The idea is to avoid running water which, in high winds, could cause vibration in the stays and compromise the stability of the viaduct.|$|E

50|$|<b>Weatherstripping</b> is {{the process}} of sealing {{openings}} such as doors, windows, and trunks from the elements. The term can also refer to the materials used to carry out such sealing processes. The goal of <b>weatherstripping</b> is to prevent rain and water from entering entirely or partially and accomplishes this by either returning or rerouting water. A secondary goal of <b>weatherstripping</b> is to keep interior air in, thus saving energy on heating and air conditioning.|$|R

Polyurethane binder was successfully synthesized from poly(butyladiphate) diol (PBAD), poly(tetramethylene) glycol (PTMG) and isocyanate as starting materials. Then, polyurethane coating agents were prepared by using various additives. To investigate effects of segment types on the abrasion resistance of polyurethane coating agents, thin films based on polyurethane coating materials were fabricated. With {{increasing the amount of}} hard segment in the coating agent, abrasion resistance, modulus and tensile strength of the coating films were improved, but the elongation of the coating films was decreased...|$|E

40|$|Conservation is {{recognized}} as one important was Americans can lower their energy use and save money. The purpose {{of this research was}} to determine the energy and economic savings which 50 low and moderate income level homeowners in Delaware Count could generate by implementing nine conservation measures. The conservation measures included: 1. In the winter turn down the thermostat during the day and night if the present setting is greater than 68 ° F. 2. Reduce the hot water heater setting to 100 °- 120 °F. 3. Caulk and <b>weatherstrip</b> where needed. 4. Insulate the hot water pipes and the furnace heat ducts. 5. Install shower flow controllers. 6. Insulate and <b>weatherstrip</b> the attic recess. 7. Turn off the furnace pilot light during the summer. 8. Insulate the hot water heater if in an unheated basement or garage. 9. Seal the chimney in the winter when not used. The nine conservation measures were recommended by the researcher on a house-by-house basis. The researcher found that the type of heating fuel used in the home, {{the presence or absence of}} certain appliances in the home, the past involvement (if any) of the homeowner in other conservation programs, and the lifestyle practices of the household determined which of the nine conservation measures could be implemented in the home. The researcher estimated the amount of energy (BTU’s) and money which could be saved by implementing the conservation measures which were recommended for each homeowner and supplied this information to the study group. This investigation revealed that all 50 homeowners would have payback periods of less than one year if the conservation measures were implemented with short-lived material requiring annual replacement with the average savings being approximately $ 97. 00. When longer-lived materials which would last five years or more were employed, only 27 of the homeowners would have payback periods shorter than one year unless homeowners for whom a furnace thermostat setback had been recommended did so by more than one degree Fahrenheit. The investigation revealed that when the thermostat was turned down three degrees Fahrenheit 40 homeowners would have payback periods less than one year and that 43 would have payback period of shorter than one year if a six degree Fahrenheit setback was employed.

40|$|A {{numerical}} two-phase approach {{based on}} experimental scorch curve data fitting, {{to predict the}} optimal exposure time and cure temperature of extruded thick items is applied {{for the study of}} a real weather-strip. In the first phase, an existing single equation kinetic model is used to predict the crosslinking density under sulfur vulcanization at variable temperatures. The model requires the calibration of only three kinetic constants. The variation with respect to temperature of such parameters is then evaluated by means of two experimental cure curves performed at two different temperatures. In the second phase, kinetic reaction parameters are implemented in finite element software, to perform thermal analyses on an extruded <b>weatherstrip.</b> Once evaluated the final mechanical properties of the item point by point, a set of compression tests is numerically simulated, assuming that the rubber behaves as a Mooney–Rivlin material under the large deformations. Elastic properties of the item are evaluated {{as a function of the}} vulcanization degree evaluated in the second phase. It is found that suboptimal vulcanizations result into lower elastic moduli and hence great deformability, sometimes incompatible with real scale engineering applications...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{low cost}} {{products}} with similar or better properties {{is vital to}} its sustainability in the competitive global market. This research embarks on compositional analysis of the hard part of a <b>weatherstrip</b> seal product that surpassed customer's specification and {{development of a new}} formulation which incorporated ground calcium carbonate (GCC) as a secondary filler for cost reduction. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the conformable rubber product were carried out using soxhlet extraction for extraction of the additives; and characterization techniques which include spectroscopic, chromatographic, X-ray diffraction and several thermal techniques. Test pieces from 8 new formulations were tested for their mechanical performance. Thermal analysis confirmed the presence of EPDM and carbon black in the compound. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) and chromatographic analysis confirmed the processing oil in the compound to be of paraffinic origin. Presence of talc filler was proven by elemental analysis using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX). Reformulation of the compounding ingredient with the incorporation of GCC were varied from 0 to 140 phr. At higher loading of GCC (40 to 140 phr), it shows an increase of hardness with the decrease of tensile strength, elongation at break and tear strength. Nevertheless, the mechanical properties of the new formulated vulcanizates (40 to 140 phr) were varied within customer's specification. It was also determined that the minimum amount of EPDM and CB allowed for significant contribution to the tensile and tear strength properties are 28. 2 % each (equiv. to 100 phr GCC). Beyond this composition the effect is diluted by GCC. Estimation of product cost shows that an overall material cost reduction of 23. 9 % are achievable at 35. 5 wt % incorporation of GCC to the compound...|$|E

40|$|This guide {{discusses}} {{the practice of}} weatherizing your home through <b>weatherstripping.</b> Selection of materials, types of <b>weatherstripping</b> and buying and installing these products are discussed. Insulation is {{not the whole story}} for energy conservation! Even if your home is well-insulated, energy may be wasted through air infiltration. Air can leak around doors and windows, foundations, chimneys, exterior plumbing, etc. In the winter, air heated by your furnace is lost to the outside; in summer, hot outdoor air puts an extra load on your air conditioner. If your home is typical, one-half to three-quarters of your fuel bill is the result of air infiltration. Weatherizing your home by caulking and <b>weatherstripping</b> can effectively reduce energy waste. In fact, the cost of caulking and <b>weatherstripping</b> can usually be paid back in energy savings in less than one year.
