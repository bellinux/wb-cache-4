40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction of}} inflation with the tax code and its contribution to aggregate fluctuations. We find significant effects operating through the tax on realized <b>nominal</b> <b>capital</b> gains. A tax on nominal bond income magnifies these effects. Our innovation is to combine monetary policy shocks with non-indexed taxes in a model where the central bank implements policy using an interest rate rule. Monetary policy had important effects {{on the behavior of}} the business cycle before 1980 because policymakers did not exert effective control over inflation. Monetary policy reform around 1980 led to better control, and with more stable inflation, the effect of the interaction between monetary policy and the <b>nominal</b> <b>capital</b> gains tax has become negligible.

40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general equilibrium stochastic growth {{model of a}} multi-sector economy subject to i. i. d. taste shocks. Each sector produces one good, and each firm has a linear production technology and faces a quadratic capital adjustment cost. The model contains a standard intertemporal capital asset pricing theory of consumption and portfolio demands with dynamically complete and frictionless markets and a standard q-theory of investment under uncertainty. We show that the equilibrium stochastic investment opportunity set {{is driven by the}} relative shares of firms' <b>nominal</b> <b>capital</b> stocks, and the equilibrium dynamics of the state vector is driven by firms' relative investment intensities. Key implications of the model includes (i) the expected equity returns are endogenously predictable both over time and in the cross-section; and (ii) the "value anomaly" arises in a rational expectations equilibrium due to a negative (positive) hedging demand for value (growth) stocks against the risk of cross-sectional dispersion of firms' <b>nominal</b> <b>capital</b> stocks. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} a {{model in}} which persistent fluctuations in expected consumption growth, expected inflation, and their time-varying volatility determine asset price variation. The model features Epstein-Zin recursive preferences, which determine the market price of macro risk factors. The analysis of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>nominal</b> term structure data from 1953 to 2006 shows that agents dislike high uncertainty and demand compensation for volatility risks. And the time variation of the term premium {{is driven by the}} compensation for inflation volatility risk that is distinct from consumption volatility risk. The central role of inflation volatility risk in explaining the time-varying term premium is consistent with other empirical evidence including survey data. In contrast, the existing long-run risks literature emphasizes consumption volatility risk and ignores inflation-specific time-varying volatility. The estimation results of this paper suggest that inflation-specific volatility risk is essential for fitting the time series of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>nominal</b> term structure data...|$|R

The purpose of my thesis is to analyse contemporary shares legislation and compare the attitude to this area of law of the Czech legislator with the German law. The thesis is composed of nine chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of shares legislation. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: shares, <b>nominal</b> <b>capital,</b> security etc. The chapter deals {{with the history of}} legislation of corporations and new tendencies in this branch of law as well. Chapter Two describes the connection between shares and a <b>nominal</b> <b>capital</b> of corporation. This chapter focuses especially on the issue of nominal value of shares and premium (agio). Chapter Three explains an issue of a share as a set of rights of a shareholder. Chapter Four deals with the relation between the term of share {{on the one hand and}} the term of security on the other. Chapter Five concentrates on problems resulting from the principal of inseparability of shares. Chapter Six, Seven and Eight deal with aspects of emission of shares, dematerialized shares and related legal issues. These chapter focuses then on the differences between shares in connection with a way of their legal transfer. Chapter Nine [...] ...|$|R
