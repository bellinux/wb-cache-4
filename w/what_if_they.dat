25|$|An {{oversight}} in {{the application}} of the no-hair theorem is the assumption that the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? Actually, this is what is realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and {{can be seen as a}} consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries of the horizon which are consistent with the area, , of the black hole and the topology of the horizon (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.|$|E
500|$|Perry has a {{theme song}} {{tentatively}} entitled [...] "Perry," [...] performed by Randy Crenshaw and Laura Dickinson, and written by Povenmire and Marsh, who write {{the majority of}} songs in the series. The song, along with the number [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" [...] from the episode [...] "Flop Starz," [...] was the first musical composition Povenmire and Marsh pitched to The Walt Disney Company. They were nervous doing so, because, as Povenmire explained, [...] "Disney has a big history of music -- <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> hate it?" [...] Their reaction, however, was considerably positive and the pair was asked to write a song for each episode, which they vehemently agreed to. The opening lyrics for the song describe Perry as a standard textbook definition of a platypus: [...] "He's a semi-aquatic egg-laying mammal of action." ...|$|E
500|$|The music used in {{the segment}} of the episode where Squidward's marching band is playing while coming down the street was from Nick Carr, the series' music editor. He found a piece of marching band music that was a band {{intentionally}} playing poorly, but sound designer Jeff Hutchins said, [...] "You could still discern the tune." [...] Hutchins thought [...] "Well, let's take this one step further. <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> couldn't even play their instruments, let alone a tune?" [...] He brought his portable DAT recorder to a musical instrument retail store and met two men who worked on its loading dock, packaging and shipping the instruments. Hutchins made the two men play most of the instruments terribly. He said, [...] "I got these two guys to squeak, blast, and squawk {{on most of the}} instruments they sold." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Andy and April's Fancy Party" [...] {{was written}} by Katie Dippold and {{directed}} by Michael Trim. It is referred to simply as [...] "Fancy Party" [...] in some publications. During a break between {{the development of the}} first six episodes of the season and the remaining episodes, the writing staff was contemplating what direction they should take with the romantic relationship between Andy and April. Parks co-creator Michael Schur said they wanted to avoid the [...] "standard-issue TV romance plots: fights, other men/women driving them apart, and so on". They decided the two should get married after dating for only a short time because it was funny, it made sense with the characters' personalities, and it raised the stakes for future stories involving the two. Schur said: [...] "We just thought about who they were [...] two impulsive goofballs who don’t approach their lives in a responsible, adult manner [...] and decided, what the hell? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> just make a rash decision and get hitched?" ...|$|E
500|$|Soon, {{the marching}} men idea blooms with workers coming {{together}} and marching {{to and from}} work in the evenings. Becoming nervous over newspaper reports and rumors of the worker gatherings, several [...] "men of affairs" [...] discuss the matter. David Ormsby volunteers to dissuade to McGregor from further organizing but cannot communicate his point to the impassive McGregor. The marching men movement peaks during a demonstration on Labor Day, climaxing with a speech by McGregor. Riding in a carriage with her father at the fringe of the demonstration, Margaret Ormsby is overcome by McGregor's oration, but later professes her allegiance to her father. The book ends that same night with a solitary David Ormsby, a foil to the stereotype of the ruthless businessman, at his window overlooking the city, meditating on his life choices: [...] "What if McGregor and his woman knew both roads? <b>What</b> <b>if</b> <b>they,</b> after looking deliberately along the road toward beauty and success in life, went, without regret, along the road to failure? What if McGregor and not myself knew the road to beauty?" ...|$|E

[...] The Chamberlain just has time to prepare Ondine for her reception with the king. Ondine is particularly advised not to mention the wart on the king's nose. [...] Ondine tactlessly mentions that the Chamberlain's hand is damp and constantly interrupts him to talk to Bertram with whom she immediately establishes a rapport. [...] At the king's reception Ondine cannot take her eyes off Bertha. [...] She accuses Bertha of trying to steal Hans from her. [...] The King says, “Bertha only wants to be your friend.” [...] Ondine replies, “You are entirely mistaken! [...] Bertha is a hypocrite. [...] She flatters you constantly. [...] Has she ever dared to speak to you about...the wart on your nose?” [...] In panic, the Chamberlain clears the room. [...] Ondine is alone with the king. [...] The king asks, “Who are you, Ondine?” [...] Ondine explains everything and says that she weeps because “they are trying to take Hans away from me.” [...] But <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> did, the king asks. [...] “would that be such a misfortune?” [...] Ondine answers, “Oh yes. [...] If he deceives me, he will die.” [...] The king says, “Men have been known to survive such things.” [...] “Not this one,” Ondine replies.|$|E
