60|$|The idea amused Jo, {{who liked}} to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances. The plan of 'going over' was not forgotten.

5000|$|Sherwood {{expressed}} unconcern {{in taking}} the place of an actress {{who took part in}} creating the popular Daniel and Lily romance. [...] "It's okay, because she Khalil wanted to leave," [...] she said, [...] "she was ready to move on, which is always a good thing. I haven't gotten any Lily versus Lily, or Christel verses Davetta mail." [...] Daniel and Lily's popularity continued with Sherwood in the role. The way Sherwood portrayed the character was with more feistiness, though the character was never written as timid. Sherwood's take on the part brought on comparison's to the character's mother, Drucilla. That new [...] "fire" [...] was brought into the Daniel and Lily relationship. [...] "Dru can be a little dramatic," [...] Sherwood said. [...] "And I think sometimes when Lily is facing issue with Daniel, she's not going to remain calm. <b>She's</b> going to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her mother do." [...] The actress praised the couple's story for not focusing on the differing races of the characters.|$|R
60|$|The mother, being thus entreated, {{could no}} longer delay to look forth from the window. The sun was now gone out of the sky, leaving, however, a rich {{inheritance}} of his brightness among those purple and golden clouds which make the sunsets of winter so magnificent. But there was not the slightest gleam or dazzle, either on the window or on the snow; so that the good lady could look all over the garden, and see every thing and everybody in it. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> there? Violet and Peony, of course, her own two darling children. Ah, but whom or <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>she</b> besides? Why, if you will believe me, {{there was a small}} figure of a girl, dressed all in white, with rose-tinged cheeks and ringlets of golden hue, playing about the garden with the two children! A stranger though she was, the child seemed to be on as familiar terms with Violet and Peony, and they with her, as if all the three had been playmates during the whole of their little lives. The mother thought to herself that it must certainly be the daughter of one of the neighbors, and that, seeing Violet and Peony in the garden, the child had run across the street to play with them. So this kind lady went to the door, intending to invite the little runaway into her comfortable parlor; for, now that the sunshine was withdrawn, the atmosphere, out of doors, was already growing very cold.|$|R
5000|$|One of Lily's first storylines {{centered}} around her manipulation by internet predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), who {{gives her the}} sexually-transmitted disease chlamydia. Khalil taped public service announcements related to the story, and considered the plot one of her favorites: [...] "How many soaps have really covered that? The meeting on the Internet, getting an STD, it was really great stuff." [...] Lily was next involved in a Romeo and Juliet-inspired romance (attracting a significant fan following) with Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), Kevin's friend. Lily {{was said to have}} brought out a new side to Daniel's character, [...] "taming" [...] him. When Khalil left the show, former head writer John F. Smith promised the character's recast would [...] "bring an entirely new level" [...] to Lily and Daniel's romance. They fell in love and were married; the pair's popularity continued with Sherwood in the role. Sherwood gave Lily more feistiness, although the character was never written as timid. Sherwood's interpretation drew comparisons to Lily's mother, Drucilla; that [...] "fire" [...] was brought into Daniel and Lily's relationship. Sherwood said that [...] "Dru can be a little dramatic", and when Lily faces an issue with Daniel [...] "she's not going to remain calm, <b>she's</b> going to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her mother do". The actress praised the pair's storyline for not focusing on the different races of the characters. Khalil was surprised by the advancement of Lily and Daniel's storyline when she returned, particularly the characters' marriage. The plot ended with a social issue: Daniel's addiction to pornography. Graziadei said, [...] "My initial conflict was that Daniel has had so many problems with his wife that I couldn't figure out why he'd be doing this", and was concerned that Daniel might be seen as [...] "lecherous and creepy". The pair tried to work through Daniel's addiction, but it ended their marriage.|$|R
5000|$|The SS-Helferinnen {{were trained}} at the Reichsschule-SS at Oberehnheim in Elsass. The Reichsschule-SS (in full, the Reichsschule für SS Helferinnen Oberenheim) was the {{training}} centre for the SS, reserved for women, and opened in Obernai in May 1942 upon the order of Heinrich Himmler. The training was more difficult than that for women enrolled in the German Army. They had to meet certain physical criteria determined by the regime: they must be aged 17 to 30 years and measure more than 1.65 m tall, while over the long term, the enrollment criteria were relaxed (the age limit was raised to 40 years and minimum height dropped to 1.58 metres); they even accepted 15 Muslim students. Having been in a privileged status, war widows were favoured before the admissions were opened up to other social classes. Women enrolled at the Reichsschule-SS came from various economic, class and educational backgrounds and included {{a member of the}} aristocracy in the ranks, Princess Ingeborg Alix. [...] The Reichsshule-SS appealed to female Nazi ideologues who foresaw the possibility of social ascent by becoming an SS-Helferin, and candidates were often from families with other SS and NSDAP members. [...] In her review of Jutta Muhlenberg's book, Das SS-Helferinnenkorps: Ausbildung, Einsatz und Entnazifizierung der weiblichen Angehörigen der Waffen-SS 1942-1949, Rachel Century writes: [...] Mühlenberg is very careful not to generalise and tar all the SS-Helferinnen with the same brush. Although all these women were a part of the bureaucratic staff, and were ‘Mittäterinnen, Zuschauerinnen und zum Teil - auch Zeuginnen von Gewalttätigkeiten’ spectators and sometimes even witnesses of violence(p. 416), she notes that each woman still had individual responsibility over <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>saw</b> and knew, and {{it would be very difficult}} to identify the individual responsibilities of each SS-Helferin. Mühlenberg focuses on de-Nazification in the American sector, although the British zone is also discussed. A detailed report was drawn up by the Americans about the school, indicating how the women of the school should be dealt with; they were to be automatically detained... Mühlenberg concludes that the guilt of the former SS-Helferinnen lies in their voluntary participation in the bureaucratic apparatus of the SS. Rachel Century, review of Das SS-Helferinnenkorps: Ausbildung, Einsatz und Entnazifizierung der weiblichen Angehörigen der Waffen-SS 1942-1949, (IHR review no. 1183). [...] The school closed in 1944 due to the advance of the Allies.|$|R
6000|$|Little Meta having {{told her}} story, and {{received}} plenty of sympathy, proceeded to dress, and, while her maid braided her hair, a musing fit fell upon her. [...] "I have seen something of life to-day," [...] thought she. [...] "I {{had thought of}} the great difference {{between us and the}} poor, but I did not know ladies lived in such different ways. I should be very miserable without Bellairs, or without a fire in my room. I don't know <b>what</b> I should <b>do</b> if I had to live in that cold, shabby den, and do my own hair, yet they think nothing of it, and they are cultivated and ladylike! Is it all fancy, and being brought up to it? I wonder if it is right? Yet dear papa likes me to have these things, and can afford them. I never knew I was luxurious before, and yet I think I must be! One thing I do wish, and that is, that I was of as much use as those girls. I ought to be. I am a motherless girl like them, and I ought to be everything to papa, just as Miss May is, even lying on the sofa there, and only two years older than I am. I don't think I am of any use at all; he is fond of me, of course, dear papa; and if I died, I don't know what would become of him; but that's only because I am his daughter--he has only George besides to care for. But, really and truly, he would get on as well without me. I never do anything for him, but now and then playing to him in the evening, and that not always, I am afraid, when I want to be about anything else. He is always petting me, and giving me all I want, but I never do anything but my lessons, and going to the school, and the poor people, and that is all pleasure. I have so much that I never miss what I give away. I wonder whether it is all right! Leonora and Agatha have not so much money to do as they please with--they are not so idolised. George said, when he was angry, that papa idolises me; but they have all these comforts and luxuries, and never think of anything but <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> they like. They never made me consider as these Mays do. I should like to know them more. I do so much want a friend of my own age. It is the only want I have. I have tried to make a friend of Leonora, but I cannot; she never cares for <b>what</b> I <b>do.</b> If <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> these Mays <b>she</b> would look down on them. Dear Mrs. Larpent is better than any one, but then she is so much older. Flora May shall be my friend. I'll make her call me Meta as soon as she comes. When will it be? The day after tomorrow?" ...|$|R
