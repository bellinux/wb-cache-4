5|$|From {{his base}} in Tel Aviv, Holocaust {{survivor}} Emmanuel Lieber directs {{a group of}} Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler. Lieber believes that the former Führer is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> swamps in the Amazon jungle, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|Timid and skittish, the {{blacktip reef shark}} is {{difficult}} to approach and seldom poses a danger to humans unless roused by food. However, people <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> shallow water {{are at risk of}} having their legs mistakenly bitten. This shark is used for its meat, fins, and liver oil, but is not considered to be a commercially significant species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the blacktip reef shark as Near Threatened. Although the species as a whole remains widespread and relatively common, overfishing of this slow-reproducing shark has led to its decline at a number of locales.|$|E

5|$|Under most circumstances, the {{blacktip reef shark}} has a timid {{demeanor}} and is easily frightened away by swimmers. However, its inshore habitat preferences bring it into frequent contact with humans, and thus it is regarded as potentially dangerous. As of early 2009, 11 unprovoked attacks and 21 attacks total (none fatal) were listed on the International Shark Attack File that are attributable to the blacktip reef shark. Most attacks involve sharks biting the legs or feet of waders, apparently mistaking them for their natural prey, and do not result in serious injury. In the Marshall Islands, native islanders avoid blacktip reef shark attacks by swimming rather than <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> shallow water, {{and a way of}} discouraging these sharks is to submerge one's body. The blacktip reef shark has also been known to become aggressive in the presence of bait, and may pose a threat while attempting to steal the catches of spear fishers.|$|E
5|$|On October 19, the Martin Company {{was about}} 110 miles (177 km) further east, making its last {{crossing}} of the North Platte River near present-day Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after completing the crossing, the blizzard struck. Many members of the company suffered from hypothermia or frostbite after <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> the frigid river. They set up camp at Red Bluffs, unable to continue forward through the snow. Meanwhile, the original scouting party continued eastward until it reached a small vacant fort at Devil's Gate, {{where they had been}} instructed to wait {{for the rest of the}} rescue party if they had not found the Martin Company. When the main rescue party rejoined them, another scouting party consisting of Joseph Young, Abel Garr, and Daniel Webster Jones was sent forward. The Martin company remained in their camp at Red Bluffs for nine days until the three scouts finally arrived on October 28. By the time the scouts arrived, 56 members of the company had died. The scouts urged the emigrants to begin moving again. Three days later the main rescue party met the Martin Company and the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies and helped them on to Devil's Gate.|$|E
25|$|Feeding often occurs nocturnally, {{but they}} can be {{encountered}} eating at any hour of the day. Black-bellied whistling ducks ingest a wide variety of plant material, but also consume arthropods and aquatic invertebrates when available. They often feed on submerged vegetation by <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> shallow water. As its Latin name (autumnalis) implies, it is commonly seen gleaning recently harvested fields for leftover seeds and invertebrates brought up by the harvesters disturbing the soil.|$|E

25|$|The night before, {{a terrific}} storm lashed {{the entire area}} badly. Prior to the battle, General Hill, seeing the rough terrain of the area as a hazard, had his men place a white cloth around their hats as a {{precaution}} {{to serve as a}} battle-badge.

25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on 9 February, the troops clambered into boats, {{and they were}} rowed across the Boca Grande Channel to a beach on the {{southern}} end of La Caleta. A few hours later of the next day almost 1,000 English soldiers and sailors were landed safely after Spanish sentries were surprised and killed. They also avoided the poisoned tip stakes which the Spanish had put up. The English troops formed themselves up into attack columns and by <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> the surf as the tide was out they were able to bypass the outer defences; Drake meanwhile organized a naval diversion.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{during a}} search in AO Wondai on the {{afternoon}} of 14 February, C Company 9 RAR contacted a strong Viet Cong force in a large bunker system. Despite being supported by a helicopter light fire team and artillery the Australians were unable to advance, and they subsequently broke contact in order to allow the use of medium artillery after having lost one killed and four wounded. The following day A Company was deployed with tanks to assist a further assault by C Company in the bunker system, which was again found to have been abandoned by the Viet Cong after having suffered a number of casualties. Meanwhile, a series of minor contacts occurred as communist forces began returning to the area. In AO Tiki, D Company 4 RAR/NZ mounted a series of ambushes on the creeks which flowed into the Rung Sat. The Viet Cong had been using these watercourses extensively for logistic resupply and {{to gain access to the}} villages in the area. On 15 February 10 Platoon D Company had deployed to southern end of the battalion AO in order to mount a night ambush on a high bank on a sharp bend in the Suoi Cau river. The infantry were reinforced by 90mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the Tracker Platoon, which were placed on the flanks. At 21:03 six sampans carrying around 15 Viet Cong entered the engagement area moving from west to east and the ambush was initiated by splintex rounds from the RCLs as well as M60 machine-guns and small arms. At least two sampans were sunk and six Viet Cong killed before they were able to withdraw to the southern bank and engage the Australians with small arms and RPGs. At first light the next morning the Australians swept the area, <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> the shallow river at low tide, subsequently locating another damaged sampan, an AK-47, an RPG-2 and two RPG rounds.|$|E

500|$|The museum {{contains}} the medieval sandstone statue of Saint Christopher, {{which is considered}} to be [...] "a work of national and even international importance". Saint Christopher was associated with the abbey because of its proximity to the River Mersey and the dangers associated with crossing the river. The statue shows the saint <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> fish-filled water carrying the Christ-child on his shoulder. It has been dated to about 1390, it is [...] tall, and was once painted in bright colours.

500|$|As Ichiki's troops regrouped {{east of the}} creek, Japanese mortars bombarded the Marine lines. [...] The Marines {{answered}} with 75mm artillery barrages and mortar fire into the areas east of the creek. At about 05:00, another wave of Japanese troops attacked, this time attempting to flank the Marine positions by <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> the ocean surf and attacking up the beach into the west bank area of the creek bed. The Marines responded with heavy machine gun and artillery fire along the beachfront area, again causing heavy casualties among Ichiki's attacking troops and causing them to abandon their attack and withdraw back to the east bank of the creek. [...] For {{the next couple of}} hours, the two sides exchanged rifle, machine gun, and artillery fire at close range across the sandbar and creek.|$|E
500|$|The initial assault battalions {{were quickly}} {{followed}} by 28 DD tanks and several waves of engineer and demolition teams to remove beach obstacles and clear the area {{directly behind the}} beach of obstacles and mines. Gaps were blown in the sea wall to allow quicker access for troops and tanks. Combat teams began to exit the beach at around 09:00, with some infantry <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> the flooded fields rather than travelling on the single road. They skirmished throughout the day with elements of the 919th Grenadier Regiment, who were armed with antitank guns and rifles. The main strongpoint {{in the area and}} another [...] to the south were disabled by noon. The 4th Infantry Division did not meet all of their D-Day objectives at Utah Beach, partly because they had arrived too far to the south, but they landed 21,000 troops at the cost of only 197 casualties.|$|E
500|$|The {{muffled sound}} of the album's {{production}} has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged the lack of character in Ginn's bass-playing on [...] "My War" [...] {{when compared to the}} 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass.

[...] Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it [...] "more a test than an album", and saying, [...] "independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it". [...] John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album [...] "quite good", but described the B-side as [...] "self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about as much fun as <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> a tar pit".

[...] This was likely near {{the confluence of the}} [...] Alazán, Apache, and San Pedro Creeks. [...] Bowie's men charged the Mexican party, scattering the mules. The mounted forces briefly exchanged fire, and then both sides dismounted and took cover in dry streambeds. [...] The Mexican forces counterattacked but were repulsed. [...] In Béxar, General Cos saw the battle begin and sent 50infantry and 1cannon to provide cover so the cavalry could retreat to town. [...] The Texian infantry also heard the initial shots and rushed toward the battle, at one point <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> waist-deep water. [...] They approached the battlefield during a lull. The lack of noise made {{it difficult for them to}} ascertain where the Mexican troops were, and the Texians were surprised to find themselves between the Mexican cavalry and infantry. [...] As the Mexican troops began firing, the Texian infantry troops dropped to the ground. [...] Colonel Thomas Rusk led a group of 15 in an attack on the nearest Mexican cavalry; as those cavalrymen fled the Texian infantry was able to scramble to cover.|$|E

[...] His small boat then became mired in mud by the receding tide, and was not freed until 3 am the next morning. [...] Captain Langle then proposed to Major Rostaing, the commander of the troops, that they cross the muddy shallows on foot. [...] This was agreed, and the troops then set out across the shallows. [...] Unknown to them, conditions improved only marginally once land was reached, and they spent the next two days <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> bogs and muck to reach the fort. [...] Meanwhile, La Pérouse returned to the fleet because bad weather was threatening its safety.

500|$|The Japanese {{offensive}} continued {{after the}} Christmas Day attack.

On 28December part of the 112thCavalry Regiment's [...] "B"Troop set out from the MLR in an attempt to reach Umtingalu, but withdrew after encountering snipers and some light mortar fire. A platoon from [...] "C"Troop also made an unsuccessful patrol from the western end of the MLR during which it suffered six casualties from Japanese machine gun and rifle fire. The same day, Komori dispatched a force of between 20 and 30 soldiers to destroy the American mortar positions. The Japanese soldiers infiltrated the American positions by <b>wading</b> <b>through</b> swamps at the western end of the MLR, but were detected before they could reach dry land. The Director Task Force mounted a strong response, which included a counterattack by elements of three cavalry troops and a platoon from the 158thInfantry Regiment supported by mortars.
