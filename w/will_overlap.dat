25|$|A bypass door is a door {{unit that}} has {{two or more}} sections. The doors can slide in either {{direction}} along one axis on parallel overhead tracks, sliding past each other. They are most commonly used in closets, in order to access {{one side of the}} closet at a time. The doors in a bypass unit <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> slightly when viewed from the front, in order not to have a visible gap between them.|$|E
25|$|Firefighters {{work closely}} with other {{emergency}} response agencies, most particularly the police and emergency medical service, and their role may overlap with both. Fire investigators or fire marshals usually work for a fire department to investigate {{the cause of a}} fire. If the fire was caused by arson or negligence, this means that their work <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> with law enforcement. In fact, some fire marshals in the United States have powers of arrest. Firefighters also frequently provide some degree of emergency medical service, in addition to working with full-time paramedics.|$|E

25|$|The Takembeng women {{provide a}} unique {{political}} {{organization in the}} restrictive political environment of Cameroon. In order to avoid being stopped by security forces as they walk from rural areas to urban centers they wear better clothing on the trip. However, when they march, the state responds with less violent measures than they do with other protesters (although at times, Takembeng women are also placed under house arrest, beaten, and killed by the government). As {{a result of this}} greater tolerance, Takembeng women provide some key support to the opposition party, the Social Democratic Front (SDF). In 1998, Takembeng women provided a protective caravan for John Fru Ndi, SDF Chairman, to leave the country and make a political trip to France and the United States. Although they are related closely with the SDF, the members of the Takembeng are clear in interviews that they are not a branch or tool of the party; instead, they support the ideals of the party {{and as long as the}} SDF holds to those values, their protests <b>will</b> <b>overlap.</b> During the disorder of the early 1990s, Takembeng women were recorded disrupting troops from elsewhere in Cameroon by stripping in front of them.|$|E
500|$|Because the Silverthrone {{region is}} {{in a remote}} and {{exceptionally}} rugged part of the Coast Mountains, danger from lava flows would be low to moderate. Magma with high to intermediate levels of silica (as in andesite, dacite or rhyolite) commonly move slowly and typically cover small areas to form steep-sided mounds called lava domes. Lava domes often grow by the extrusion of many individual flows less than [...] thick {{over a period of}} several months or years. Such flows <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> one another and typically move less than a few meters per hour. But lava eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera can be more intense than those at other Cascade volcanoes. Lava flows with high to intermediate levels of silica rarely extend more than [...] from their source while Silverthrone has produced a [...] long andesitic lava flow in the Pashleth Creek and Machmell River valleys. There is also evidence lava flows may have once partly blocked or at least altered the course of the Machmell River. Renewed activity in this area could disrupt the course of the river and have a serious impact on people living or working downstream.|$|E
2500|$|Whether {{a certain}} cycloaddition would proceed {{depends on the}} {{electronic}} orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [...] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [...] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light. Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the Woodwardâ€“Hoffmann rules.|$|E

2500|$|Schooling {{behaviour}} confuses {{the lateral}} line organ (LLO) {{as well as}} the electrosensory system (ESS) of predators. Fin movements of a single fish act as a point-shaped wave source, emitting a gradient by which predators might localize it. Since fields of many fish <b>will</b> <b>overlap,</b> schooling should obscure this gradient, perhaps mimicking pressure waves of a larger animal, and more likely confuse the lateral line perception. The LLO is essential {{in the final stages of}} a predator attack. Electro-receptive animals may localize a field source by using spatial non-uniformities. In order to produce separate signals, individual prey must be about five body widths apart. If objects are too close together to be distinguished, they will form a blurred image. Based on this it was suggested that [...] schooling may confuse the ESS of predators ...|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the many}} forms {{taken by the}} Arethusan leaf, one of the commonest is long and {{gradually}} tapering,--much broader at the base than the point. We will take such an one for examination, and suppose that it is growing {{on the ground as}} in Fig. 20, with a root to its every fibre. Cut out a piece of strong paper roughly into the shape of this Arethusan leaf, a, Fig. 21. Now suppose the next young leaf has to spring out of the front of this one, at about the middle of its height. Give it two nicks with the scissors at b b; then roll up the lower part into a cylinder, (it <b>will</b> <b>overlap</b> a good deal at the bottom,) and tie it fast with a fine thread: so, you will get the form at c. Then bend the top of it back, so that, seen sideways, it appears as at d, and you see you have made quite a little flower-pot to plant your {158} new leaf in, and perhaps it may occur to you that you have seen something like this before. Now make another, a little less wide, but with the part for the cylinder twice as long, roll it up in the same way, and slip it inside the other, with the flat part turned the other way, e. Surely this reminds you now of something you have seen? Or must I draw the something (Fig. 22)? ...|$|E

In late July 1987, Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen, commander of the Middle East Force, requested Naval Special Warfare assets. Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two Navy SEAL platoons in August. The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil service barges, Hercules and Wimbrown VII, into mobile sea bases. These were moored in the northern Persian Gulf, allowing special operations forces to thwart clandestine Iranian mining and small boat attacks.|$|R
50|$|In electronics, a self-aligned gate is a {{transistor}} manufacturing feature whereby a refractory {{gate electrode}} region of a MOSFET transistor {{is used as}} a mask for the doping of the source and drain regions.
