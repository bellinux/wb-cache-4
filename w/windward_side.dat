5|$|On the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the mountain, {{stream erosion}} driven by trade winds has {{accelerated}} erosion {{in a manner}} similar to that on older Kohala.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of a {{land mass}} {{experiences}} more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
25|$|Climates vary {{considerably}} on each island; {{they can be}} divided into windward and leeward (koolau and kona, respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains. <b>Windward</b> <b>sides</b> face cloud cover.|$|R
50|$|Amphicyclotulus dominicensis {{is smaller}} than the Amphicyclotulus amethystinus. Amphicyclotulus dominicensis is more {{coarsely}} sculptured and has a higher spire. It has been found on the leeward and <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the island of Dominica, at low elevations only.|$|R
50|$|On their {{breeding}} islands, Gibson's albatrosses nest on moss terraces and in tussock grassland {{on or near}} ridges, {{slopes and}} plateaus where an exposed, windy position helps them take off. They often form loose colonies on the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the islands.|$|R
5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the {{flowering}} period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (<b>windward)</b> <b>side</b> of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing {{play a significant role in}} shaping the landscape.|$|E
5|$|Sand dunes are accumulations of {{windblown sand}} {{piled up in}} mounds or ridges. They form {{downwind}} of copious sources of dry, loose sand and occur when topographic and climatic conditions cause airborne particles to settle. As the wind blows, saltation and creep {{take place on the}} <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the dune and individual grains of sand move uphill. When they reach the crest, they cascade down the far side. The upwind slope typically has a gradient of 10° to 20° while the lee slope is around 32°, the angle at which loose dry sand will slip. As this wind-induced movement of sand grains takes place, the dune moves slowly {{across the surface of the}} ground. Dunes are sometimes solitary, but they are more often grouped together in dune fields. When these are extensive, they are known as sand seas or ergs.|$|E
5000|$|King Kamehameha II {{had a brief}} {{correspondent}} with Mahine Tehei'ura, King of Huahine, one of {{the three}} independent kingdoms in the <b>windward</b> <b>sided</b> of the Society Islands, which was linguistically and culturally tied with Tahiti. Here is a translation of one of the first Hawaiian letters ever written: ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the islands}} of Hispaniola, Cuba and Jamaica, the southwestern sides are in the rain shadow of the trade winds and can receive as little as 400 mm per year as against over 2000 mm on the northeastern, <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> and over 5000 mm over some {{highland}} areas.|$|R
25|$|Leeward side lower {{mountain}} slopes – Rainfall {{is higher}} than on the adjacent leeward lowlands, but much less than at similar altitudes on the windward side; however, maximum rainfall usually occurs leeward of the crests of lower mountains. Temperatures are higher than on the rainy slopes of the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of mountains; cloud cover is almost as extensive.|$|R
5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the <b>windward</b> <b>side,</b> young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E
5|$|The <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the Kohala {{mountains}} is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, {{cutting into}} the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged {{in what is}} known as dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened by the collapse. As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E
5|$|After the {{unsuccessful}} {{action the}} Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg, where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to refuse combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. After the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May, the allied fleet soon came in contact with it and began pursuing the Swedes. By this time the allies had been reinforced by a small squadron and now totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large or medium ships of the line. The reinforcements also brought with them a new commander, Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the ablest naval tacticians of his time. Tromp, who also was a Lieutenant-Admiral in the Dutch navy, was made Admiral-General of the Danish navy on 8 May 1676. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The rough winds were hard on the Swedish ships. Many lost masts and spars. The Swedes, forming a barely cohesive battle line, tried to sail ahead of Tromp's ships, hoping to get between them and the shore, thus putting themselves on the allied fleet's <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> and gaining the tactical advantage of holding the weather gage. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail closer to the wind and faster {{than the rest of the}} force, and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, snatching the weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed on each other, and were soon within firing range.|$|E
50|$|The United Arab Emirates Pavilion, {{created by}} British {{architect}} Lord Norman Foster, {{was designed to}} resemble a sand dune. The building, which was constructed of gold-colored glass, was curved to imitate the natural formations of the leeward and <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the sand dunes found in the U.A.E. Foster's design also {{drew attention to the}} country's traditional Bedouin culture.|$|R
50|$|Leeward side lower {{mountain}} slopes - Rainfall {{is higher}} than on the adjacent leeward lowlands, but much less than at similar altitudes on the windward side; however, maximum rainfall usually occurs leeward of the crests of lower mountains. Temperatures are higher than on the rainy slopes of the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of mountains; cloud cover is almost as extensive.|$|R
50|$|The most {{extensive}} and well-developed coral reef complexes in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines occur on shallow shelves around the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of Mayreau and Union Islands and the Cays themselves. In addition, principal vegetation types include beach vegetation and dry forest. With {{the exception of}} a small mangrove in Petit Rameau and salt pond in Mayreau, there are no wetlands in the Cays.|$|R
25|$|<b>Windward</b> <b>side</b> {{includes}} the North Shore (Paia and Haiku) and East Maui (Keanae, Hana and Kipahulu). Located in the prevailing, northeast trade winds, these areas have heavier rainfall levels, which increase considerably at higher elevations.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, one of {{the causes}} of rain must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is {{primarily}} orographic, due to the presence of highlands {{in the path of the}} winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the highlands because of adiabatic cooling and condensation of the moist rising air.|$|E
25|$|From June to September, the {{south-west}} monsoon {{brings in}} heavy rains as Kochi {{lies on the}} <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the Western Ghats. From October to December, Kochi receives lighter (yet significant) rain from the northeast monsoon, as it lies on the leeward side. Average annual rainfall is , with an annual average of 125 rainy days.|$|E

Univariate and multivariate analyses detected significant variation in benthic communities among depths and locations, {{as well as between}} leeward and <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the island. Mean percentage cover of scleractinian corals ranged between 0. 2...|$|R
25|$|The Pacific Northwest {{experiences}} {{a wide variety}} of climates. An oceanic climate ("marine west coast climate") occurs in most coastal areas, typically between the ocean and high mountain ranges. An Alpine climate dominates in the high mountains. Semi-arid and arid climates are found east of the higher mountains, especially in rainshadow areas. The Harney Basin of Oregon is an example of arid climate in the Pacific Northwest. Humid continental climates occur inland on <b>windward</b> <b>sides,</b> in places such as Revelstoke, British Columbia. A subarctic climate can be found farther north, especially in Yukon and Alaska.|$|R
40|$|Compared with {{front engine}} vehicle, the <b>windward</b> <b>side’s</b> flow field in cooling model of rear engine bus is {{complicated}} and it can’t be calculated {{by means of}} 1 D model. For this problem, this paper has used Star-CCM to build a 3 D simulation model of cooling system, engine compartment and complete vehicle. Then, it had a 1 D/ 3 D coupling calculation on cooling system with Kuli software. It could be helpful in the optimization design of the flow field of rear engine compartment and op-timization match of cooling system...|$|R
25|$|Quite often, {{when the}} Pacific Northwest coast is being drenched by rain, the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of the Rockies is being {{hammered}} by snow (as the air loses its moisture), and the leeward {{side of the}} Rockies in Alberta is basking in a föhn Chinook. The three different weather conditions are all caused by the same flow of air, hence the confusion {{over the use of}} the name “Chinook wind”.|$|E
25|$|Causeways were {{constructed}} to link all villages {{on the main}} islet making transportation easy. The island resembles an incomplete “G” letter, with two reef passages; one is located in between Abatiku and Tabiang village at the north-western end. The other is between Biike and Kenna, the latter being the southernmost end of the main islet. The island is surrounded with an exposed reef at the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> and submerged reef at the leeward side where Biike and Abatiku are situated. Most of the important food crops in Kiribati such as coconut, giant taro, pandanus and breadfruit grow well in Abemama.|$|E
25|$|The Patkai, or Purvanchal, are {{situated}} near India's eastern border with Burma. They {{were created by}} the same tectonic processes {{which led to the}} formation of the Himalayas. The physical features of the Patkai mountains are conical peaks, steep slopes and deep valleys. The Patkai ranges are not as rugged or tall as the Himalayas. There are three hill ranges that come under the Patkai: the Patkai–Bum, the Garo–Khasi–Jaintia and the Lushai hills. The Garo–Khasi range lies in Meghalaya. Mawsynram, a village near Cherrapunji lying on the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> of these hills, has the distinction of being the wettest place in the world, receiving the highest annual rainfall.|$|E

50|$|Scalesia pedunculata Hook.f. is {{a member}} of the Daisy family or Asteraceae, growing to a slender tree (20m tall, DBH 20 cm), and found in dense stands on the humid {{windward}} coasts of the islands of Santa Cruz, San Cristobal, Santiago and Floreana in the Galapagos Islands. The Galapagos archipelago lies in the southeast trade wind zone, so that climate and weather are dominated by the moisture-bearing trade winds and the topography of the islands. In general, the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the islands have a much higher precipitation than the leeward sides.|$|R
500|$|Darby was {{the second}} {{tropical}} storm to make landfall in Hawaii in two years. Before landfall, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for all of Hawaii, and were only discontinued after Darby weakened to a tropical depression on July25. Over the period of July23 to July25, Darby brought heavy rain and widespread flash floods to the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the Hawaiian Islands, with storm rainfall totals exceeding [...] on the Big Island and [...] in Oahu. This resulted in some road closures, sewage spills, numerous flight cancellations, and minor property damage. Overall, no fatalities occurred during the passage of Darby.|$|R
25|$|The {{north and}} south of Tenerife {{similarly}} have different climatic characteristics. The windward northwestern side of the island receives 73 percent of all precipitation on the island, and the relative humidity of the air is superior and the insolation inferior. The pluviometric maximums are registered on the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> at an average altitude of between , almost exclusively in the La Orotava mountain range. However, although climatic differences in rainfall and sunshine on the island exist, overall annual precipitation is low and the summer months from May to September are normally completely dry. Rainfall, similarly to that of Southern California, can also be extremely erratic from one year to another.|$|E
25|$|The Bruce foil is a foil that {{provides}} a lateral resistance with zero heeling moment by placing the foil to either {{or both of the}} leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the <b>windward</b> <b>side,</b> a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting.|$|E
25|$|On June 24, the Métis burned Fort Douglas and the colony's mill, stables {{and most}} of the empty houses. This was done by cutting open the <b>windward</b> <b>side</b> to allow the breeze to spread the flames. The goods and horses {{belonging}} to the colony were given to the Métis as gifts. The fleeing settlers stopped at Jack River House. While there they were met by Colin Robertson and his brigade bent for the Athabasca district. Robertson was convinced to stay and help re-establish the Red River Colony and dispatched a party of 100 men under John Clark to Athabasca to carry out his mission there. Robertson with the displaced settlers and around 20 HBC employees arrived at the ruins of Fort Douglas on August 19 and began rebuilding the fort.|$|E
500|$|In Hawaii, Mount Waiʻaleʻale, on {{the island}} of Kauai, is notable for its extreme {{rainfall}}, as it has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, with [...] Systems known as Kona storms affect the state with heavy rains between October and April. Local climates vary considerably on each island due to their topography, divisible into windward (Koolau) and leeward (Kona) regions based upon location relative to the higher mountains. <b>Windward</b> <b>sides</b> face the east to northeast trade winds and receive much more rainfall; leeward sides are drier and sunnier, with less rain and less cloud cover.|$|R
40|$|A 20 -yr {{simulation}} with a fine-resolution regional {{atmospheric model}} for projected late twenty-first-century conditions in Hawaii is presented. The pseudo-global-warming method is employed, and the boundary conditions {{are based on}} a multimodel mean of projections made with global coupled models run with a moderate greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Results show that surface air temperature over land increases ~ 2 °– 4 °C with the greatest warming at the highest topographic heights. A modest tendency for the warming to be larger on the leeward sides of the major islands is also apparent. Climatological rainfall is projected to change up to ~ 25 % at many locations. The currently wet <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the major islands will have more clouds and receive more rainfall, while the currently dry leeward sides will generally have even less clouds and rainfall. The average trade wind inversion–base height and the mean marine boundary layer cloud heights are projected to exhibit only small changes. However, the frequency of days with clearly defined trade wind inversions is predicted to increase substantially (~ 83 % to ~ 91 %). The extreme rainfall events are projected to increase significantly. An analysis of the model’s moisture budget in the lower troposphere shows that the increased mean rainfall on the <b>windward</b> <b>sides</b> of the islands is largely attributable to increased boundary layer moisture in the warmer climate. Rainfall changes attributable to mean low-level circulation changes are modest in comparison...|$|R
