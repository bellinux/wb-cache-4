5|$|Until 2008, Kosovo did {{not have}} a flag of its own. However, during {{different}} periods of history, different flags <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> in Kosovo. Before 1969, the only flags that could legally fly over Kosovo (then an autonomous province) were those of SFR Yugoslavia and SR Serbia. If a nationalist flag <b>were</b> <b>flown,</b> such as Albanian, Serbian or Croatian, a person could go to prison for doing it.|$|E
5|$|After the war, two {{surviving}} N-3PBs (c/n 306, 322) aircraft <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> to Norway, {{sold for}} salvage, with c/n 306 being scrapped in 1949 and c/n 322 scrapped in 1956.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 2014, 3,100 American {{ground troops}} were {{committed}} to the conflict and 16,000 sorties <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> over the battlefield, primarily by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots.|$|E
50|$|If {{more than}} one flag <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> on a half-mast day, they must all <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> at half-mast, or not at all. The flag of a foreign nation must never <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> at half-mast on UK soil unless that country has {{declared}} mourning.|$|R
50|$|Commissioned {{ships and}} {{submarines}} wear the White Ensign at the stern whilst alongside during daylight hours {{and at the}} main-mast whilst under way. When alongside, the Union Jack <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> from the jackstaff at the bow, but can only <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> underway on special circumstances i.e.: when dressed with masthead flags (when it <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> at the jackstaff), to signal a court-martial is in progress (when it <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> from the starboard yardarm) or to indicate {{the presence of an}} Admiral of the Fleet,including the Lord High Admiral or the Monarch (when it <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> from the highest hoist).|$|R
50|$|The flag of India <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> {{at half-mast}} {{for the death}} of a President, Vice-President, or Prime Minister, all over India. For the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of The Supreme Court of India, it <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> in Delhi and for a Union Cabinet Minister it <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> in Delhi and the state capitals, from where he or she came.

5|$|Glorious {{returned}} on 18 May {{with six}} Supermarine Walrus amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF. The Walruses <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> off to Harstad, but the airfield at Skånland {{was not yet}} ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when Glorious returned to Scapa on 21 May. Glorious {{came back to the}} Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> off.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to take great personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, smoke jumpers <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|SAS Commuter was {{established}} in 1988 and started operations in Northern Norway in May 1990, making Alta its central hub for Finnmark. This involved a change to the operations so that all DC-9 services from Alta to Oslo <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> non-stop. Conversely, all services to airports in Northern Norway <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> using the smaller Fokker 50. Thus SAS was able to reduce costs by no longer operating local routes with the DC-9/MD-80 and instead {{increased the number of}} flights. The change made Alta the only airport in Finnmark with direct services to Oslo. From 1989 to 1990, the number of annual aircraft movements at Alta hiked from 7,711 to 10,035.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the flag}} <b>is</b> <b>flown</b> at half-mast, {{it should be}} recognisably at half-mast, for example, {{a third of the}} way down from the top of the pole. The Australian Flag should never <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> half mast at night. Flags <b>are</b> <b>flown</b> at half-mast on {{government}} buildings: ...|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{aircraft}} are functional and able to be flown; Weeks has stated that every aircraft in his collection has <b>been</b> <b>flown</b> by him, <b>is</b> being <b>flown</b> currently or will <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> in the future.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} law {{stated in}} its seventh article that another law {{would be set}} regarding official flag days {{and the time of}} day that the flag may <b>be</b> <b>flown,</b> but such a law was not put into effect until almost 50 years later in 1991. This law states that the flag shall not <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> until 7 o'clock in the morning, that it should preferably not <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> beyond sunset but that it must not <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> beyond midnight. However, if the flag is raised at an outdoor assembly, an official gathering, funeral or a memorial the flag may <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> as long as the event lasts, though never beyond midnight.|$|R
5|$|The gross {{underestimation}} of Fighter Command's strength {{issued to}} Luftwaffe units meant the British reaction was {{much stronger than}} expected. During the 24-hour period, Fighter Command flew 927 sorties, slightly fewer than the Germans. Only 41 of these sorties <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> by night, 28 on 17/18 August and 13 on 18/19 August. The remaining 886 sorties <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> by day, a number almost exactly equal to the 861 serviceable Spitfire, Hurricane, Defiant and Gladiator day fighters available to squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Robbins medallions {{were also}} struck, in very small numbers, in 14k gold. These medallions were {{generally}} {{ordered by the}} mission crew as a personal memento of their flight and were often taken to the lunar surface in the Landing Module. For {{the duration of the}} Apollo program, Robbins medallions (3–7 gold and 80–450 silver per mission) <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> into space.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{missions}} <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> by the 509th Composite Group on 20, 23, 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945, {{using the}} bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities. A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets, one bomb was jettisoned into the ocean, {{and two were}} aboard aircraft that aborted their missions.|$|E

50|$|To raise a flag in this position, {{the flag}} must <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> {{to the top}} of the pole first, then brought down halfway before the flag is secured for flying. When such {{mourning}} occurs, all flags should <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> at that position or not <b>be</b> <b>flown</b> at all, with the exception of flags permanently attached to poles.|$|R
5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that day, so {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not take any part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|During the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian athletes {{wore a black}} armband in {{remembrance of}} the victims.

5|$|The {{offensive}} {{began at}} 05:00 with {{the advance of}} ground forces from their assembly areas surrounding their assigned operational areas. About 06:35, five squadrons of Luftwaffe bombers, including Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers, began bombing targets within Drvar and Bosanski Petrovac. A total of 440 sorties <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> on 25 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|About 20 minutes later, Bariko {{launched}} a helicopter {{to check on}} the cable winch which was to collect samples. It also lowered boats to test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft <b>were</b> <b>flown</b> through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E
