5|$|Unusual for a 13th-century Gothic cathedral, {{most of the}} <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> {{of clear}} glass.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{southern}} facade, that of {{the original}} 1883 room, features three windows. The same room has two rear windows of the same style. The <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> all double hung and of four-over-four design.|$|E
50|$|The church's <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{clear glass}} at consecration in 1877, with one exception, but soon major <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> added. Four <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> designed by Edward Burne-Jones and executed by William Morris. Another four <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> exceptional commissions by John La Farge, and revolutionized window glass with their layering of opalescent glass. The suter <b>window</b> <b>was</b> painted by Charles Mills.|$|R

5|$|An oratory, {{originally}} {{fitted to}} the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained glass windows. Ten of these <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute's Bedroom, the servants' hall and the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|During the growth, {{the chamber}} {{materials}} are etched {{off by the}} plasma and can incorporate into the growing diamond. In particular, CVD diamond is often contaminated by silicon originating from the silica windows of the growth chamber or from the silicon substrate. Therefore, silica <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> either avoided or {{moved away from the}} substrate. Boron-containing species in the chamber, even at very low trace levels, also make it unsuitable for the growth of pure diamond.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone wall on the Danube side, four sets of double-arched <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E
50|$|The Tree of Jesse east <b>window</b> <b>is</b> by Heaton, Butler and Bayne of Nottingham {{and dates}} from 1875. The west <b>window</b> <b>is</b> a Te Deum by Hardman and Powell dating from 1907. A new <b>window</b> <b>was</b> {{inserted}} in 1996 as a Memorial to William Newton (1750-1830), the Minstel of the Peak. This <b>window</b> <b>is</b> by Alfred Fisher of Chapel Studio.|$|R
50|$|The Engadin <b>window</b> <b>is</b> not {{the only}} place where penninic units are exposed within the austroalpine. The Tauern <b>window</b> <b>is</b> the largest one and lies east of the Engadin window. The Gargellen <b>window</b> in Vorarlberg <b>is</b> the {{smallest}} one. The Rechnitzer <b>window</b> <b>is</b> the easternmost tectonic window.|$|R
50|$|Double-hung sash <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> {{traditionally}} often {{fitted with}} shutters. Sash <b>windows</b> can <b>be</b> fitted with simplex hinges that let the <b>window</b> <b>be</b> locked into hinges on one side, while the rope {{on the other}} side <b>is</b> detached—so the <b>window</b> can <b>be</b> opened for fire escape or cleaning.|$|R
5|$|The barn {{features}} extensive windows, somewhat unusual {{outside of}} dairy barns, {{with a total}} of 14 eight-paned, double-hung windows dispersed over three sides of the rectangular structure, north, south and east. On the west side, facing the house, are seven smaller single-pane windows. The double-hung <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> topped with segmented arches constructed from a double row of bricks; the north and south main entrances are also topped with segmented brick arches, each of three rows of bricks.|$|E
5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> all asymmetrical in nature, {{a hallmark of the}} Arts and Crafts style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to the Arts and Crafts movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral {{is built}} of, primarily, yellow, but also {{black and red}} {{polished}} tuff. It has three entrances. The main one is on the western side. The entrances on {{the northern and southern}} sides, though secondary, are richly decorated. Its <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> narrow and long, with ornamented frames.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{a stained}} glass <b>window</b> <b>was</b> {{uncovered}} in the abbey vaults. The design around the <b>window</b> <b>is</b> by William Burges.|$|R
25|$|The first trading <b>window</b> <b>was</b> open in December 2016 {{while the}} second trading <b>window</b> <b>was</b> open from 13 to 20 January 2017.|$|R

5|$|The {{courthouse}} is elaborately windowed. Some windows, {{mostly on}} the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most of the <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New doors were installed in both entrances in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> built into the layers of slate {{to give the impression}} of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E

50|$|A Stained glass <b>window</b> <b>is</b> a <b>window</b> {{composed}} {{of pieces of}} colored glass, transparent, translucent or opaque, frequently portraying persons or scenes. Typically the glass in these <b>windows</b> <b>is</b> separated by lead glazing bars. Stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> popular in Victorian houses and some Wrightian houses, and are especially common in churches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} east <b>window</b> <b>was</b> blocked later, and two lancet <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> {{inserted in}} {{its place in the}} 13th century. [...] Similar <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> added to the north and south walls at the same time. The 12th-century entrance in the north wall was also bricked up, but its stone jambs are still visible.|$|R
5|$|The front façade of {{the house}} faces a hill to the southwest. It is five bays wide, with the front {{entrance}} at the first floor's center bay. Wide double-hung sash <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> uniformly placed on the house's front façade, with four nine-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six-over-six double-hung wooden sashes on the second. Each window is surrounded by green-painted wooden shutters and white-painted wooden lintels and sills.|$|E
5|$|The main façade (south elevation) of Literary Hall {{is divided}} into three bays, and its west and east {{elevations}} are divided into five bays. Each of the building's bays consists of a double-hung sash wooden window, with nine panes of glass within each sash. The <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> symmetrically placed within recessed brick panels that are defined at the first and second stories of the building with elementary brick ribs, or pseudo-pilasters, that form the outer surface of the building's exterior walls and provide separation of the three bays of the main façade and the five bays of the west and east elevations. The <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> framed by white wooden louvered window shutters. The building's brick is laid in an American bond pattern, with five courses of stretchers between every course of headers.|$|E
5|$|The west-facing {{front of}} the {{original}} building consists of three bays with a central door. Above the door is an oculus window that originally had glazing bars, with other windows on both sides that have segmented arched heads and timber sills. The original upper floor windows have been replaced in the 19th or 20th century while the ground floor <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> modern but within the original openings.|$|E

50|$|The Chapel of the Resurrection {{project was}} {{completed}} in phases spanning over a half-decade. The Meier <b>window</b> <b>was</b> dedicated {{on the same day}} as the chapel itself, September 27, 1959. The center Munderloh <b>window</b> <b>was</b> dedicated on February 5, 1961. The two flanking Munderloh <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> finally dedicated several years later, on January 10, 1965.|$|R
5|$|A slender chancel arch existed {{until the}} mid-19th century and might have been pre-Conquest, but the {{earliest}} visible extant part {{of the church is}} the 13th-century north arcade, which may have been added to an earlier, now-lost, nave. The spire and tower date {{to the middle of the}} next century, roughly when the nave was rebuilt. Many of the <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> reticulated in a fashion popular during the early 14th century. Several medieval bequests are known: Olivia, wife of John Rossen of Quarrington, left 12 pence to the rector and church each in 1412; a donation of wool was made by another parishioner, Joan, wife of William Ward, around the same time. Later, 8 pence was left to the churchwardens by an unknown resident.|$|E
5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} {{land for a}} school in the market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E
5|$|Every {{window in}} the church {{contains}} coloured glass (except the two tiny windows in the chapel of St Padarn). The <b>windows</b> <b>are</b> mostly narrow single lancets, and {{at the ends of}} the transepts and at the west end are arranged one and two. Some are possibly mediaeval, in the same eroded yellow stone as the quoins. The west and south gables have three windows, spaced two below and one above. The north has two only window. There are four lancets to the nave on the north, with three and the porch to the south. The transepts also have single lancet windows east and west. The north transept has a nineteenth century two-light east window with the relieving arch of an older window well above.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{attraction}} of the Cathedral are its stained glass windows depicting different scenes from Christ’s life - Ascension behind the altar, Nativity in the west transept, and Crucifixion in the east transept. The <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> designed by Sir. O. Salisbury of England. The stained glass <b>windows</b> <b>were</b> installed at different periods. The chancel window depicting the ascension was installed in 1927, {{two years after the}} cathedral was built. The nativity <b>window</b> <b>was</b> installed in 1947 and the crucifixion <b>window</b> <b>was</b> installed in 1958.|$|R

25|$|The Hostienmühle <b>window</b> <b>was</b> built between 1448–1453 and {{was funded}} by the city of Bern. The Three Kings <b>window</b> <b>was</b> built between 1447 and 1455 for Rudolf von Ringoltingen, {{possibly}} in Constance or the Oberrhein region. The Bible scenes <b>window</b> <b>was</b> originally supposed to be just of the young Christ, but was changed after 1447. It was built between 1448 and 1451 and {{was funded by}} three members of the Gesellschaft zum Mittellöwen. The Passion <b>window</b> <b>was</b> built between 1438 and 1441. Only 21 panels of the original <b>window</b> remain. It <b>was</b> built for the city through the Schultheiß by Hans Acker in Ulm. The Ten thousand martyrs <b>window</b> <b>was</b> originally supposed to be of the Resurrection of Jesus, but that was changed after 1447. It was built between 1447 and 1449 and was funded by donations from the citizens of Bern. It was built by Master Painter Bernhart and glazier Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Ten thousand martyrs <b>window</b> <b>was</b> replaced in 1868 by the Christ window. The Stephanus window replaced an earlier window in 1868. The theme of the original <b>window</b> <b>is</b> unknown but it was built in 1449–1451 for Kaspar von Scharnachtal, probably by Niklaus Magerfritz in Bern. The Coat of Arms <b>window</b> <b>was</b> built in 1820–30 to replace an earlier, unknown window.|$|R
