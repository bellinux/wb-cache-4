5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{started to}} affect New Caledonia on 5January, before it passed over Grand Terre Island later that day. Rewa dumped over 300mm (12in) of rain on {{parts of the}} archipelago, which made {{all of the major}} rivers {{overflow}} and burst their banks. Several landslides and a death were recorded within New Caledonia, while on the Loyalty Island of Mare, waves from Rewa partially destroyed the harbour <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> Tadine's port.|$|E
5|$|Frome is {{reputed to}} have one or more systems of tunnels beneath {{the streets of the}} older parts of the town. Some entrances are visible above ground; for example in the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> the top of Stony Street, with other entrances in the cellars of shops and houses. Their purpose and full extent remain unknown but they have been {{investigated}} in recent years by at least one local group and a documentary has been made.|$|E

5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> {{the south end of the}} present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, on October 2, 1925, the 95th Street subway station, {{which was}} built mainly in {{anticipation}} for the Staten Island Tunnel, was opened. The station was built with a false <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> its south end, intended for either a planned extension to 100th or 101st Streets or a line leading to a future Fort Hamilton-based tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} August 2011 in Louisiana. On November 22, 2011, {{a crew member}} died in an accident at a New Orleans warehouse that was serving as a soundstage for the production. The incident happened while crew members were changing out a set. The battle on the Himalayas was shot in a New Orleans warehouse previously used to build NASA rockets, that had been fitted with a green screen <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> a very steep angle {{with a lot of}} rigging above to swing the stunt people through.|$|E

5|$|The main {{building}} material is Kentish rag-stone, although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide {{details in the}} Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17thand 18thcenturies. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18thcentury, only two original– albeit restored– examples remain, in the south <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> the gallery level.|$|E
5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave interference pattern {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shenboo Atlas of 1933, in the 1930s {{most people}} lived within the {{perimeter}} of the Xi'an Wall but still {{there were a lot of}} unoccupied open areas. Among the visitors who came to see the Xian Wall were American captain (later general) Stilwell in 1922 and the Czech sinologist Jaroslav Průšek (1906–1980) in 1933. In 1983, the administration of the Xi'an municipality carried out more renovations and additions to the <b>wall.</b> <b>At</b> that time, the Yangmacheng tower, the Zhalou sluice tower, the Kuixinglou dipper tower, the Jiaolou corner tower and the Dilou defense tower were all refurbished; the crumbling parts of the rampart were changed into gates; and the moat was restored. In May 2005, all of Xi'an's ramparts were inter-connected.|$|E

5|$|Adenhart's number 21 jersey was retired by the Cedar Rapids Kernels, the Angels' Class A affiliate, on June 20, 2010. The Kernels, the Kernels Foundation, and the Adenhart {{family also}} {{established}} the Nick Adenhart Memorial Scholarship, a yearly $1,000 scholarship. The Orem Owlz, for whom Adenhart briefly played in 2005, have worn special jerseys, which bear {{the likeness of}} a screen-printed picture of Adenhart, along with his number 34. The Little League Baseball field where Adenhart played in Halfway, Maryland, was rededicated as the Nicholas James Adenhart Memorial Field. The Hagerstown Suns, the Minor League Baseball affiliate in Hagerstown, Maryland, held a fundraiser for the Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund and added Adenhart to their Wall of Fame at Municipal Stadium. The city of Manhattan Beach, Wilhite's home town, erected the Pearson-Wilhite-Stewart-Adenhart Commemorative <b>Wall</b> <b>at</b> Marine Avenue Park honoring all four victims of the crash.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in the western <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Davidson {{missed out}} on the second session of qualifying, putting his Super Aguri in 17th position, 3 places behind his {{teammate}} Sato. Ralf Schumacher and his team were disappointed with qualifying in 18th. Heikki Kovalainen crashed into the <b>wall</b> <b>at</b> turn 5, damaging his rear suspension and losing his rear wing, resulting in the session being stopped temporarily. Once the debris had been cleared, Kovalainen in his repaired car managed one impressive lap that put him in 13th, after which six drivers outqualified him. Kovalainen then had to make an engine change due to an engine failure and was demoted {{to the back of}} the grid. Wurz, Sutil and Albers qualified in 19th, 20th and 21st respectively after being pushed up a place by Kovalainen's engine change.|$|E
