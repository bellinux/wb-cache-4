5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, <b>which</b> <b>comes</b> from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, <b>which</b> <b>comes</b> from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, <b>which</b> <b>comes</b> from hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant {{is separated from}} its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of Narcissus is complex, {{and still not}} fully resolved.

Although frequently mentioned in Mediaeval and Renaisance texts it was not formally described till the work of Linnaeus in 1753.

5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database <b>which</b> <b>comes</b> together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's test result, to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

5|$|Quatermass deduces that {{an alien}} {{life-form}} <b>which</b> <b>comes</b> {{from one of}} the moons of Saturn, which lives on ammonia, hydrogen and methane, but to which oxygen is a deadly poison, travels to earth in the meteorites, and in the few seconds they spend out of their shells before dying they possess human minds, and transmit knowledge to each other in a collective consciousness. From this, they assume that it was the population of Winnderden Flats itself who demolished the village and built the plant. Quatermass decides that they can use the remaining Quatermass II rocket like a nuclear bomb and destroy the asteroid, much to Leo's protest at the rocket being unsafe to fly. Fowler tries to steal information about the other plants from the ministry, but is overcome and possessed by a makeshift meteorite hidden inside a filing cabinet.|$|E
