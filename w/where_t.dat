25|$|The Rao–Blackwell theorem {{states that}} if g(X) is {{any kind of}} {{estimator}} of a parameter θ, then the conditional expectation of g(X) given T(X), <b>where</b> <b>T</b> is a sufficient statistic, is typically a better estimator of θ, and is never worse.

25|$|This {{calculus}} can {{be extended}} to a broad class of symbols, but the simplest corresponds to convolution by a class of functions or distributions that all have the form T + S <b>where</b> <b>T</b> is a distribution of compact with singular support concentrated at 0 and where S is a Schwartz function.

25|$|The {{first term}} is a {{constant}} contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in t. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of t by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted t that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in t at any finite λ is finite, but near the transition t is very small. The fractional change in t is very large, and in units <b>where</b> <b>t</b> is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E

25|$|Consensus {{panels in}} America (AJCC) and Europe (UICC) have {{established}} staging systems for {{head and neck}} squamous-cell cancers. These staging systems attempt to standardize clinical trial criteria for research studies, and attempt to define prognostic categories of disease. Squamous cell cancers {{of the head and}} neck are staged according to the TNM classification system, <b>where</b> <b>T</b> is the size and configuration of the tumor, N is the presence or absence of lymph node metastases, and M is the presence or absence of distant metastases. The T, N, and M characteristics are combined to produce a “stage” of the cancer, from I to IVB.|$|E
25|$|Tourmalines have a {{very complex}} {{chemistry}} that can be described by a general formula XY3Z6(BO3)3T6O18V3W. The T6O18 is the basic ring structure, <b>where</b> <b>T</b> is usually Si4+, but substitutable by Al3+ or B3+. Tourmalines can be subgrouped by the occupancy of the X site, and from there further subdivided by the chemistry of the W site. The Y and Z sites can accommodate a variety of cations, especially various transition metals; this variability in structural transition metal content gives the tourmaline group greater variability in colour. Other cyclosilicates include beryl, Al2Be3Si6O18, whose varieties include the gemstones emerald (green) and aquamarine (bluish). Cordierite is structurally similar to beryl, and is a common metamorphic mineral.|$|E
25|$|Cellular automata {{are often}} {{simulated}} on a finite grid {{rather than an}} infinite one. In two dimensions, the universe would be a rectangle instead of an infinite plane. The obvious problem with finite grids is {{how to handle the}} cells on the edges. How they are handled will affect the values of all the cells in the grid. One possible method is to allow the values in those cells to remain constant. Another method is to define neighborhoods differently for these cells. One could say that they have fewer neighbors, but then one would also have to define new rules for the cells located on the edges. These cells are usually handled with a toroidal arrangement: when one goes off the top, one comes in at the corresponding position on the bottom, and when one goes off the left, one comes in on the right. (This essentially simulates an infinite periodic tiling, and in the field of partial differential equations is sometimes referred to as periodic boundary conditions.) This can be visualized as taping the left and right edges of the rectangle to form a tube, then taping the top and bottom edges of the tube to form a torus (doughnut shape). Universes of other dimensions are handled similarly. This solves boundary problems with neighborhoods, but another advantage is that it is easily programmable using modular arithmetic functions. For example, in a 1-dimensional cellular automaton like the examples below, the neighborhood of a cell xit is {x'i−1t−1, x'i't−1, x'i+1t−1}, <b>where</b> <b>t</b> is the time step (vertical), and i is the index (horizontal) in one generation.|$|E
