25|$|The {{passage of}} the Railways Bill was {{controversial}} and there was much lobbying against the Bill. The Labour Party was opposed to it and promised to renationalise the railways <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> into office as and when resources allowed - though this was not achieved during their period in government between 1997 and 2010. The Railways Bill became the Railways Act 1993 on 5 November 1993 and the organisational structure dictated by it came into effect on 1 April 1994.|$|E

25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} off the hook. The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to get inside the Ava king's quarters. But the plan was foiled when a concubine of Minkhaung saw them and screamed. She was killed but the king escaped. Lagun Ein and his men took Minkhaung's ruby-studded royal sword and gold-plated betel nut chest. They barely escaped. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> Saw Pyei Chantha, Minkhaung's daughter who had been captured in early 1408 and put in Razadarit's harem, identified that the sword and the chest were her father's. Although the second attempt did not succeed, Razadarit forgave Lagun Ein, and let him live.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of 6 October 1965, Hindley drove Brady to Manchester Central railway station, where she waited outside in the car while he {{selected}} their victim. After a few minutes Brady reappeared {{in the company of}} Edward Evans, to whom he introduced Hindley as his sister. After they had driven back home and relaxed over a bottle of wine, Brady sent Hindley to fetch her brother-in-law. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the house Hindley told Smith to wait outside for her signal, a flashing light. When the signal came, Smith knocked on the door and was met by Brady, who asked if he had come for [...] "the miniature wine bottles". Brady led Smith into the kitchen and left him there, saying {{that he was going to}} collect the wine. A few minutes later, Smith heard a scream, followed by Hindley shouting loudly for him to come and help. Smith entered the living room to find Brady repeatedly striking Evans with the flat of an axe, and watched as he then throttled Evans with a length of electrical cord. Evans's body was too heavy for Smith to carry to the car on his own—Brady had sprained his ankle in the struggle—so they wrapped it in plastic sheeting and put it in the spare bedroom.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} also subject to less {{favorable}} reviews from critics who were {{disappointed with the}} gaps in Michael and Walt's story. Steve Heisler of Time Out [...] "wasn't all-too-pleased", citing the story's predictability. TMZ's Daniel called [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] "solid, but not spectacular" [...] {{and gave it a}} grade of a [...] "C+", writing that [...] "this episode fell a little short … I feel like we were kind of robbed of half of the 'What Happened to Michael?' story. It was interesting to see how far into depression he sunk … And they did give him a pretty good reason for working for Ben … But I can't shake the feeling that we missed a good opportunity". He further commented that [...] "Tom would make a great football coach—his motivational speeches are awesome." [...] TV Squad's Erin Martell was unsatisfied with Michael's flashback and the lack of Walt, asking [...] "What was their cover story <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the mainland? … they couldn't do a genuine flashback scene because of … Kelley's growth spurt, but they could have worked around that." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV ranked it as the second worst episode of the season; his colleague John Kubicek was also critical, and commented that the flashback [...] "essentially tells us things we already know without telling us much more." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1967, Stephen Gaskin {{began to}} develop a {{philosophy}} of hippie [...] perspectives at San Francisco State College, where he taught English, creative writing, and General Semantics.

In 1970, Gaskin and his wife, Ina May Gaskin, led a caravan of 60 buses, vans and trucks on a cross country speaking tour. [...] Along the way, they checked out various places that might be suitable for settlement.

Dan abetted her, and said that they must cross in June. Mrs. Pasmer said that she thought June was a good month.

He knew the soul singer John Boutté of the band ¡Cubanismo! during their stop at Mackinaw Island, and soon got a first-hand immersion into the local music scene, often busking on the street and playing with various bands and musicians - like [...] "Washboard Chaz" [...] Leary, George Porter, Jr., Paul Sanchez's [...] "Nine Lives" [...] project, Roberto Luti, The Loose Marbles Jazz Band - in the city. He often plays at local New Orleans clubs like Three Muses and DBA on Frenchmen Street in the 7th Ward.|$|R
60|$|After {{looking through}} the glass {{partition}} at this great company of readers and students until their curiosity was satisfied, the children turned away, and Mr. George conducted them back through the long ranges of rooms {{by the same way}} that <b>they</b> came. <b>When,</b> at length, <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to the staircase where they had come up, Mr. George, instead of going out where he had come in, descended by another way, through new corridors and passages, until he came to a room where a considerable number of people were sitting at tables, looking at books of engravings. The sides of this room, and of several others opening into it, were filled with bound volumes of prints and engravings, some plain and some colored, but very beautiful. Many of the volumes were very large; but however large they might be, it was very easy to turn over the leaves and see the pictures, for the tables, or rather, desks, {{in the middle of the}} room, were so contrived that a book, placed upon them, was held at precisely the right slope to be seen to advantage by persons sitting before it. Mr. George told the children, in a whisper, that any one might ask for any book there was there, and the attendants would place it on one of the tables for him, where he might sit and look at the prints in it as long as he pleased.|$|R
