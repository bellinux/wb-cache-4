Founded in 1914 by major leaders of the Progressive Movement, it attempted to find a balance between a progressivism focused on humanitarianism and moral passion, {{and on the other}} hand sought a basis in scientific analysis of social issues. It supported American entry into World War One, but discarded much of its faith in the possibility of a scientific liberalism. After the 1980s it incorporated elements of conservatism. [...] In 2014, two years after Chris Hughes purchased the magazine, he ousted its editor and attempted to remake its format and operations, provoking the resignation of the majority of its editors and writers. In early 2016, Hughes announced he was putting the magazine up for sale, indicating the need for [...] "new vision and leadership". It was sold in February 2016 to Win McCormack.|$|E
50|$|The Visigothic {{kings of}} Toulouse, {{one of the}} foederati (allies) of the Roman Empire in the West and limited to Aquitania and Toulouse, soon began {{encroaching}} on neighboring territories. As Roman allies the Visigoths helped defeat Germanic invaders in Spain (notably the Suebi), taking advantage of their position to expand their territory south of the Pyrenees. They tried to conquer the Mediterranean coast of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, but were opposed by Rome. In 439 the Roman general Litorius defeated the Visigoths at Narbonne, driving them back to Toulouse. Although he besieged the city, he was defeated and taken prisoner. Avitus, the praetorian prefect of Gaul <b>with</b> <b>influence</b> <b>on</b> King Theodoric I of the Visigoths, was then sent to Toulouse and concluded a peace. In 451, threatened by an invasion of the Huns in Gaul, he negotiated a treaty between Rome and the Visigoths and they defeated the Huns. In 455 Avitus, magister militum (senior military officer of the Empire) on a diplomatic mission to King Theodoric II of the Visigoths, was proclaimed the new Roman emperor in Toulouse by his Visigothic friends amid news that the Vandals had sacked Rome and Emperor Petronius Maximus had been murdered. Avitus' reign in Rome was brief, and he was defeated by his enemies in 456. This antagonized the Visigoths, who warred with the new Roman leaders, and a weaker Rome gave way. The Narbonne region was conquered by the Visigoths in 462.|$|E
