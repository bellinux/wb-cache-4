5|$|In August 1999, {{our mother}} had {{died of cancer in}} tragic {{circumstances}} while <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> enjoying ourselves at my eldest son's wedding. For my brother, her death was a catastrophe. He adored her. She had been his protector and greatest admirer since the death of our father in 1947, when Anthony was eight and I was six. When our mother died, it was as though my brother had become an orphan at age 61. Without her, he felt emotionally bereft. He lost his grip on reality. At one point, he had bought a flat in Versailles, and had entirely recreated two rooms from our late mother's house. He had used all the furniture, books and knick-knacks of our childhood in Paris. It was a bit much.|$|E

25|$|At {{times we}} were forty prisoners {{in a cell}} built to {{accommodate}} two people. There were two benches, each capable of seating three persons, and the floor to sleep on. For our private needs, {{there were only three}} chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us {{in a constant state of}} dysentery. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> in a deplorable state.

500|$|In 1975, {{school friends}} and {{neighbours}} from Wandsworth, South London, Kim McAuliffe (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Dinah Enid Williams (bass, vocals) formed an all-girl rock cover band called Painted Lady, together with Tina Gayle on drums. Deirdre Cartwright joined the new band on lead guitar, Val Lloyd replaced Gayle on drums {{and they started}} playing the local pub scene. [...] "The reason <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> girls was we couldn’t find any blokes who wanted to play with us! This was the natural thing to do", McAuliffe explained to Gary Graff in 1997 about the all-female composition of the band.|$|E

Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with that stuff. He was very influential.

Bob became a successful manager, guiding Dundee to victory in the Scottish championship in 1962 and the semi-finals of the European Cup the following year. Their maternal uncles, Robert and William Blyth were also professional players and both became club directors at Portsmouth and Carlisle United respectively.|$|E

McKagan was confirmed as a permanent member of the group, in April, performing at shows in the United States and Europe. His tenure with the band only lasted five months, with his departure from the group announced on September 6. In a statement, the band commented: [...] "We wanted to thank Duff for helping us write songs for our new record. We love the songs we worked on with him — and the gigs were a blast — but musically <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> headed in different directions. From here Duff is off {{to work on his}} own stuff so we wish him all the best".|$|E

500|$|Wolters was perturbed by an {{interview}} with Speer published in Der Spiegel in November 1966, in which Speer, while again taking responsibility for crimes of the Nazi era, blamed Hitler, rather than Germany, for starting World War II. Wolters wrote to Speer on November 30, describing Speer's assignment of blame as a [...] "dangerous oversimplification made entirely from today's perspective... You will surely remember that in 1939 <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> {{of the opinion that}} Hitler was Germany. Although we were certainly depressed rather than enthusiastic about the war in Poland, we surely considered that the responsibility for it was {{to be found in the}} provocative conduct by the Poles, and it was the British who made of it a world war." [...] Wolters asked Speer to [...] "concentrate wholly on what really happened, leaving aside what the world thinks of it now".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost {{four months to}} record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared {{the first day of}} recording as [...] "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, [...] "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> very apprehensive." [...] The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience [...] "scary", while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought I had done a terrible job", the singer recalled.|$|E

[...] In an interview with MTV News, regarding the collaboration with Usher, Steve Angello commented, [...] "We met Usher couple of years ago, we did the AMA's together and then we came to hang-out in Ibiza. We were in Atlanta and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> working together for five days. He has always been a great artist and he always knows what he wants so it is a good collaboration all in all.
