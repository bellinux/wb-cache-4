40|$|Background Despite being {{extensively}} {{studied in}} adults, investigation of <b>worry</b> and it's associated cognitive variables remains {{in its infancy}} in paediatric samples. Aims This study aimed to investigate 1) whether the child cognitive variables of intolerance of uncertainty (IU), positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> (PBW), negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> (NBW), negative problem orientation (NPO) and cognitive avoidance (CA) were associated with child <b>worry,</b> 2) whether parental <b>worry</b> and cognitive variables were associated with child <b>worry,</b> 3) whether the relationship between child and parent <b>worry</b> was mediated by child cognitive variables and 4) whether the relationships between specific parent cognitive factors and child <b>worry</b> were mediated by specific child cognitive factors. Method Participants were 114 children plus one of their parents. Parents and children completed questionnaires assessing {{each of the five}} cognitive variables and <b>worry.</b> Results When examined together, child NBW and CA significantly predicted child <b>worry.</b> Parent <b>worry,</b> IU and CA were significantly and positively related to child <b>worry.</b> The relationship between parent <b>worry</b> and child <b>worry</b> was mediated by child NBW and CA. The relationship between parent IU, NPO and CA and child <b>worry</b> was mediated by child IU, NPO and CA respectively. Conclusions Child NBW and CA may be particularly important to child <b>worry</b> and may represent potential treatment targets. Parental <b>worry</b> and cognitive variables {{may play a role in}} the development and / or maintenance of child <b>worry.</b> Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that <b>worry</b> is associated with distressing paranoia. Therefore, the aim was to target <b>worry</b> in a therapeutic intervention for individuals with delusions. It was predicted that a <b>worry</b> intervention would reduce levels of <b>worry</b> and paranoia distress. Twenty-four individuals with persistent persecutory delusions and high levels of <b>worry</b> were randomly assigned to receive a four session cognitive-behavioural <b>worry</b> intervention (W-CBT) or treatment as usual (TAU). The <b>worry</b> intervention was specifically designed not to target the content of delusions. In this open-label evaluation, assessments of <b>worry</b> and paranoia were conducted at baseline, at one month (end of treatment) and at two months. The <b>worry</b> intervention achieved a statistically significant reduction in <b>worry</b> which was maintained at two month follow up. A significant reduction in delusional distress was also reported. There was an indication that the <b>worry</b> intervention may also reduce the frequency of paranoid thoughts but this was not statistically significant. In the first trial specifically for persecutory delusions, a brief <b>worry</b> intervention was shown to have benefits. The results support a causal role for <b>worry</b> in paranoid experience...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{features}} that differentiate <b>worry</b> from somatic anxiety and depression.

Moreover, previous research has linked procrastination and perfectionism mainly to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the relationship among <b>worry,</b> procrastination, and dimensions of perfectionism was investigated irt a sample of 180 students, controlling for anxiety and depression. Results show that <b>worry</b> had substantial correlations with procrastination and perfectionism, particularly with perfectionist concern over mistakes and doubts. Moreover, <b>worry</b> was related to parental criticism and expectations, but unrelated to excessively high personal standards. instead high-worriers reported to lower standards under stress.

40|$|Worry-prone {{individuals}} have less residual working memory capacity during <b>worry</b> compared to low-worriers (Hayes, Hirsch, & Mathews, 2008).

The findings could not be accounted for by general attentional control, amount of negatively-valenced thought, or appraisals participants made about <b>worry</b> topics.

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that people perceive women as experiencing more fear than men (Brody & Hall, 1993) and research {{also shows that}} <b>worry</b> is related to fear (Borkovec, Robinson, Pruzinsky, & Depree). The purpose of this Study 1 was to explore how people perceive {{men and women to}} <b>worry</b> overall as well as in specific domains. Three hundred and one Concordia University students completed two <b>worry</b> questionnaires to measure overall amount of <b>worry</b> and <b>worry</b> in specific domains. The results showed that people perceive women as experiencing more <b>worry</b> than men and men as experiencing more <b>worry</b> about achievement, finances, and incompetence. A second objective was to compare people's perceptions of men and women's <b>worry</b> to their perceptions of high and low-status individuals' <b>worry</b> to determine if a status model is a viable option for explaining the gender stereotypes of <b>worry</b> that emerged in Study 1. Women generally have lower status than men (Rhoodie, 1989), which leads to the hypothesis that people perceive low-status individuals as <b>worrying</b> more overall as well as <b>worrying</b> more about relationships. In contrast, people perceive high-status individuals as <b>worrying</b> more about achievement, finances and incompetence. Sixty-two Concordia University students listened to a tape describing a culture that consists of high and low-status individuals. Participants completed modified versions of the <b>worry</b> questionnaires used in Study 1 to measure their perceptions of low and high-status individuals' <b>worry.</b> The findings suggest that status is a viable model for explaining the stereotype of overall <b>worry</b> that emerged from Study 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective This study {{aimed to}} explore {{cross-sectional}} and longitudinal associations between pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue in a working population. Methods In employees with very low or very high fatigue levels, psychometrics of the Penn State <b>Worry</b> Questionnaire (PSWQ; measuring pathological <b>worry)</b> and the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS; measuring fatigue) were examined and their cross-sectional and longitudinal associations were explored. Results Pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue can be measured as different constructs. However, pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue were also associated on a cross-sectional level. Pathological <b>worry</b> predicted fatigue level 10 months later, but this association disappeared after adjustment for the cross-sectional association between pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue. Conclusion Although they can be measured as different constructs, pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue seem to be associated. When studying longitudinal relations between pathological <b>worry</b> and fatigue, their cross-sectional association {{should be taken into}} account.

40|$|Although <b>worry</b> {{is common}} in children, {{little is known about}} its {{development}} and maintenance. The current study reviews several areas of the literature to inform a comprehensive cognitive model of clinical <b>worry</b> in children. Parental influences on child anxiety broadly are reviewed, followed by a discussion of empirically supported cognitive models of <b>worry</b> in adult samples. Next, the potential impact of cognitive development on childhood <b>worry</b> is presented. A cognitive model is then proposed, and empirical support for the model is reviewed. Finally, a portion of the model is identified and tested empirically. Specifically, this study tests the hypothesis that cognitive development will predict the cognitive variables of threat interpretation, beliefs about <b>worry,</b> negative problem orientation, and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). It is also hypothesized that the cognitive variables will predict <b>worry</b> and that this association will be moderated by child development, such that the predictive power of the cognitive variables increases with child development. It was also hypothesized that female children will score higher than male children on the four cognitive variables and on measures of <b>worry.</b> Finally, it was predicted that scores on the cognitive variables will discriminate children with clinical levels of <b>worry</b> from those with nonclinical levels of <b>worry.</b> Children were recruited from public and private schools. A total of 80 {{children between the ages of}} 8 and 12 years completed the study. Overall, hypotheses were partially supported. Cognitive development, as measured by child age, explained variance in intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, and negative beliefs about <b>worry.</b> Intolerance of uncertainty, negative problem orientation, and negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> significantly predicted <b>worry,</b> and negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> emerged as the strongest predictor. Threat interpretation and positive beliefs about <b>worry</b> were not correlated with <b>worry.</b> Female children reported higher levels of negative beliefs about <b>worry</b> and negative problem orientation, but not <b>worry.</b> Finally, intolerance of uncertainty, negative beliefs about <b>worry,</b> and negative problem orientation discriminated clinical from nonclinical levels of <b>worry.</b> Exploratory analyses examined potential developmental trends in associations between the cognitive variables and <b>worry.</b> Findings are discussed in terms of theoretical and clinical implications and suggestions for future research are offered...|$|R

The final objective of this study was to assist in generating a comprehensive model of <b>worry</b> that incorporated unique predictors of GAD. Results indicated that unique variables, such as ‘as many as can’ stop rules and beliefs about <b>worry,</b> were weak predictors of perseveration, but were significant predictors of <b>worry</b> and GAD symptoms. Therefore, these variables may still contribute to the processes inherent in perseverative <b>worry.</b> Results also indicated that the catastrophic interview was an overall weak predictor of <b>worry</b> and GAD symptoms, suggesting that the catastrophic interview might not be the most suitable measure of perseverative <b>worry.</b> In summary, the current study provides mixed support for the mood-as-input model of perseverative <b>worrying.</b> Future research should further examine the relationship of the catastrophic interview and perseverative <b>worry.</b> In addition, future studies should include measures of GAD symptoms as an outcome variable when studying the mood-as-input model.

40|$|Researchers have {{described}} 2 types of worriers, normal and pathological, who {{differ in the}} frequency, intensity, and controllability of their <b>worry</b> experiences. Although normal and pathological <b>worry</b> are generally treated as separate though related phenomena, no study has tested for separateness against the alternative hypothesis that all <b>worry</b> exists along a single dimension. In the present study, <b>worry</b> ratings of 1, 588 college students were submitted to taxometric procedures designed to evaluate latent structure. Results provided evidence for the dimensionality of <b>worry.</b> These findings suggest that generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), whose central feature is <b>worry,</b> may also be quantitatively rather than qualita-tively different from normal functioning.

40|$|Excessive and {{uncontrollable}} <b>worry</b> is {{a defining}} feature of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). An important endeavour {{in the treatment}} of pathological <b>worry</b> is to understand why some people are unable to stop <b>worrying</b> once they have started. <b>Worry</b> perseveration is associated with a tendency to deploy goal-directed <b>worry</b> rules (known as “as many as can” <b>worry</b> rules; AMA). These require attention to the goal of the <b>worry</b> task and continuation of <b>worry</b> until the aims of the “worry bout” are achieved. This study examined the association between the tendency to use AMA <b>worry</b> rules and neural and autonomic responses to a perseverative cognition induction. To differentiate processes underlying the AMA <b>worry</b> rule use from trait <b>worry,</b> we also examined the relationship between scores on the Penn State <b>Worry</b> Questionnaire (PSWQ) and neural and autonomic responses following the same induction. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance brain imaging (fMRI) while measuring emotional bodily arousal from heart rate variability (where decreased HRV indicates stress-related parasympathetic withdrawal) in 19 patients with GAD and 21 control participants. Seed-based analyses were conducted to quantify brain changes in functional connectivity (FC) with the amygdala. The tendency to adopt an AMA <b>worry</b> rule was associated with validated measures of <b>worry,</b> anxiety, depression and rumination. AMA <b>worry</b> rule endorsement predicted a stronger decrease in HRV and was positively associated with increased connectivity between right amygdala and locus coeruleus (LC), a brainstem noradrenergic projection nucleus. Higher AMA scores were also associated with increased connectivity between amygdala and rostral superior frontal gyrus. Higher PSWQ scores amplified decreases in FC between right amygdala and subcallosal cortex, bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and areas of parietal cortex. Our results identify neural mechanisms underlying the deployment of AMA <b>worry</b> rules. We propose that the relationship between AMA <b>worry</b> rules and increased connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents attempts by high worriers to maintain arousal and distress levels in order to feel prepared for future threats. Furthermore, we suggest that neural mechanisms associated with the PSWQ represent effortful inhibitory control during <b>worry.</b> These findings provide unique information about the neurobiological processes that underpin <b>worry</b> perseveration...|$|R
