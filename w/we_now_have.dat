5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have.</b> The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is one of a group of recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
5|$|The census {{report of}} 2010 Zambian census was {{released}} {{during the first}} week of March 2013 by Fredson Yamba, Secretary to the Treasury of the Government of Zambia. He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update the data from the Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Shakespeare's Hamlet {{was derived from}} the legend of Amleth, {{preserved}} by 13th-century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum, as subsequently retold by 16th-century scholar François de Belleforest. Shakespeare may also have drawn on an earlier (hypothetical) Elizabethan play known today as the Ur-Hamlet, though some scholars believe he himself wrote the Ur-Hamlet, later revising it to create the version of Hamlet <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have.</b> He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor, Richard Burbage, the leading tragedian of Shakespeare's time. In the 400 years since its inception, the role has been performed by numerous highly acclaimed actors in each successive century.|$|E

25|$|The {{interactions}} of neurons {{in a small}} network can be often reduced to simple models such as the Ising model. The statistical mechanics of such simple systems are well-characterized theoretically. There has been some recent evidence that suggests that dynamics of arbitrary neuronal networks {{can be reduced to}} pairwise interactions. It is not known, however, whether such descriptive dynamics impart any important computational function. With the emergence of two-photon microscopy and calcium imaging, <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> powerful experimental methods with which to test the new theories regarding neuronal networks.|$|E
25|$|An Apollonian gasket can be {{constructed}} as follows. Start with three circles C1, C2 and C3, each {{one of which is}} tangent to the other two (in the general construction, these three circles can be any size, {{as long as they have}} common tangents). Apollonius discovered that there are two other non-intersecting circles, C4 and C5, which have the property that they are tangent to all three of the original circles– these are called Apollonian circles (see Descartes' theorem). Adding the two Apollonian circles to the original three, <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> five circles.|$|E
25|$|Apart from EST and genome sequences, {{several other}} tools like PCR, yeast two-hybrid system, microarrays, RNA Interference, SAGE, QTL mapping etc. permit the rapid study of plant {{developmental}} patterns. Recently, cross-species hybridization {{has begun to}} be employed on microarray chips, to study the conservation and divergence in mRNA expression patterns between closely related species. Techniques for analyzing this kind of data have also progressed over the past decade. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> better models for molecular evolution, more refined analysis algorithms and better computing power as a result of advances in computer sciences.|$|E
60|$|I slowly {{walked toward}} the tramp-tree, {{revolving}} various matters in my mind. We had not spent much money on the place during the winter, and <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> a small sum which we intended to use for {{the advantage of the}} farm, but had not yet decided what to do with it.

25|$|The {{fear of the}} end of {{life and}} its {{existence}} is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> in the present. These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing {{at the same time that}} social formation was changing. One can say that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.|$|E
25|$|Plotinus {{wrote the}} essays {{that became the}} Enneads {{over a period of}} several years from ca. 253 until a few months before his death {{seventeen}} years later. Porphyry makes note that the Enneads, before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have.</b>|$|E

500|$|The United Kingdom did {{not have}} the {{manpower}} or resources of the United States, and despite its early and promising start, Tube Alloys fell behind its American counterpart and was dwarfed by it.

500|$|Gehry {{publicly}} blamed Dworsky: [...] "The executive architect {{was incapable}} of doing drawings that had this complexity. We helped select that firm. I went to Daniel, supposedly a friend, and I said, 'This is going to fail and <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> the capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'" [...] Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: [...] "We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop."" [...] Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he [...] "no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: [...] "He (Dworsky) {{made a lot of}} money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} David Scarpa started writing {{a draft of}} the script in 2005, Thomas Rothman was in charge of Fox and felt a {{responsibility}} to remake the film.

[...] Scarpa noted the recent events of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 informed his mindset when writing the screenplay. He scrapped Klaatu's speech {{at the conclusion of the}} story because [...] "audiences today are willing to tolerate that. People don't want to be preached to about the environment.

500|$|This disastrously {{affected}} British {{efforts as}} they lacked manpower, facilities, equipment and materials. Tube Alloys therefore fell {{behind in the}} race with the Manhattan Project. On 30 July 1942, Anderson advised Churchill that: [...] "We must {{face the fact that}} ... pioneering work ... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. <b>We</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> a real contribution to make to a 'merger'. Soon we shall have little or none". By the time Great Britain realised it, the position had worsened; Bush decided that outside help for the Manhattan Project was no longer needed. The Military Policy Committee (MPC) supported Bush's arguments and restricted access to the classified information which Britain could utilise to develop its atomic weapons programme, even if it slowed down the American efforts.|$|E
500|$|University of Alberta {{professor}} Stephen A. Kent {{weighed in}} on the issue, and said [...] "I think these disruptions probably are illegal.

[...] Kent stated that [...] "The hacker community has been angry at Scientology for (their) attempts to block free speech on the Internet." [...] Reaction to the denial of service attack on the Church of Scientology websites was mixed in message board forums for PC World. Some readers praised the actions of Anonymous, while others commented that the DDoS attacks bring more attention to Scientology. The Economist likened the DDoS attacks used by Project Chanology to [...] "cyberwarfare techniques normally associated with extortionists, spies and terrorists", and referred to Anonymous as [...] "internet activists".|$|E
500|$|Rain {{threatened}} {{during the}} second part. Although it did not materialise, all the drivers posted quick laps early on {{to avoid having to}} set a time on a wet track. Alonso was again fastest with a 1:34.057. Hamilton, both Ferraris, BMW Saubers, and Toyotas, as well as Rosberg (Williams) and Webber (Red Bull) also passed through to the final part. Kovalainen (Renault), Fisichella (Renault), Coulthard (Red Bull), Sato (Super Aguri), Button (Honda) and Liuzzi (STR) were eliminated. 2006 champions Renault failed to get either car into the final part. Team engineering director Pat Symonds noted that [...] "...the overall level of performance is disappointing, but <b>we</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> to knuckle down and {{make the most of the}} situation we find ourselves in."
