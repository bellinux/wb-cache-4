5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two <b>wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E

5|$|This highway was {{intended}} {{to be part of a}} longer highway, State Route 278, that was to scale the canyon walls between Moab and Dead Horse Point State Park. Only the connection to the potash mine was constructed before the project was cancelled. Although the highway was constructed to aid the mining industry of southeastern Utah, the road is popular with tourists and four <b>wheel</b> <b>drive</b> enthusiasts. The jeep trails beginning where SR-279 ends are used to access Canyonlands National Park and Dead Horse Point.|$|E
