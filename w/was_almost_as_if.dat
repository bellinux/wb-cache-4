Mike Ragogna with The Huffington Post wrote that Astral Weeks influenced Springsteen's 1973 first album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. {{and two of}} the songs from his second. Steven Van Zandt, from Springsteen's E Street Band, has said: [...] "Astral Weeks was like a religion to us." [...] According to writer Steve Turner, the album also became popular with travelers of the hippie trail, [...] "from Europe through to Kathmandu and there were even reports of vans painted in psychedelic colours being renamed 'the Van Morrison'." [...] In his 1975 book, Ritchie Yorke wrote [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Van Morrison, elusive at any time, had deliberately created an album of music which would indefinitely withstand the vulgarity of music industry image-making. Later they might say that other albums were reminiscent of Astral Weeks, but they could never claim that Astral Weeks was like anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal criticized most of {{the musical}} {{performances}} in the episode, calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] the highlight of an otherwise [...] "slow, forced show". Flandez opined of [...] "Ice Ice Baby": [...] "Will, kicking it old school, doesn't cut it with his '80s-flashback moves because a.) he takes himself too seriously and b.) he looks like he's in a J.Crew mag, not part of 2 Live Crew." [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times wrote that he hated the episode, similarly calling [...] "Run Joey Run" [...] his favorite song, but noting that that was [...] "not hard considering the songbook that was offered". Kennedy deemed the [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] performance his least favourite moment of the entire series thus far. He concluded: [...] "Each of the musical numbers felt about two minutes longer than they should have been. I love Newton-John’s walk-on cameo, but I don’t want them {{to fall into the}} habit of re-creating music videos frame by frame: It was cute - once. It sounds harsh, but I could have completely done without the episode. It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they needed filler just to showcase the [...] "Physical" [...] video." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{originated}} when Al Jean commented to Mike Reiss, [...] "We {{had a lot}} of {{luck with}} Homer stealing cable, which was based on the eighth commandment, so maybe we could look to other commandments. So we thought, 'Honor the Sabbath' would be a good one. So the 'Homer doesn't go to church' storyline was given to George Meyer." [...] Reiss and Jean thought that as a lapsed Catholic, Meyer would [...] "bring the proper degree of rage" [...] to the episode. Meyer {{had a lot of}} fun making the episode, thinking that most people could relate to the bliss of staying home from church. One of the main problems Meyer had writing this episode is that whenever Homer saw God, he had to have fallen asleep so that it appeared to be a dream. Meyer did not want to show that God was literally appearing to Homer. This resulted in him falling asleep so many times during the first draft of the episode that it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Homer had narcolepsy. This was also the first episode from season four that was read to the production team. Although first reads on previous seasons had not been well received by the production team, [...] "Homer the Heretic" [...] read very well, particularly some of the visuals in the third act, such as the house on fire and Homer being rescued by Flanders.|$|E

2500|$|According to Brake, the {{departure}} {{of two of the}} soap's most popular characters, Den and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled. In addition, several other long-running characters left the show that year including Sue and Ali Osman (Sandy Ratcliff and Nejdet Salih) and their family; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler); Carmel Jackson (Judith Jacob) and Colin Russell (Michael Cashman). Brake indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Walford itself was making a fresh start".|$|E
2500|$|As {{captain of}} the {{national}} side, Wessels was similarly criticised for playing too conservatively in South Africa's first test series since readmission into international cricket. Although South Africa won the home series against India by 1–0, fans and critics sharpened their pencils and attacked the captain mercilessly for his team's apparent lack of passion and ambition. The fourth test in Cape Town, in particular, was condemned across the cricketing world. The two teams scored a total of 795 runs in 433.4 overs, {{at an average of}} only 1.83 runs per over and ended in a draw. Wessels commented on the criticism in his biography, saying: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they thought we should win every series 4–0. They simply don't understand that modern Test cricket is tough and competitive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five Alpine White Dodge Challenger R/Ts were lent to the {{production}} by Chrysler for promotional consideration and were returned upon completion of filming. Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four-speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic. No special equipment was added or modifications made to the cars, except for heavier-duty shock absorbers for the car that jumped over No Name Creek. The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for Bullitt (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown. Loftin remembers that parts were taken out of one car to repair another because they [...] "really ruined {{a couple of those}} cars" [...] while jumping ramps between highways and over creeks. Newman remembers that the 440 engines in the cars were so powerful that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there was too much power for the body. You'd put it in first and it would almost rear back!" [...] The Challengers appear in the film with Colorado plates OA-5599.|$|E

2500|$|As the Guardians summary shows, {{even after}} the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO {{continued}} to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in British Guiana in the 1950s and 1960s, though Richard Drayton, Rhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London, said this was simply not credible: [...] "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO {{that they had been}} destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of'." [...] Elkins agreed that it was [...] "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s. Warning bells should be going off." [...] Drayton also noted that the FCO [...] "refuses to make public the full inventory of the Hanslope Park archive. While we have full confidence in Professor Badger, many historians now wonder if he was not handed an archive which, once again, had been screened and culled." [...] Drayton further mused that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the material now made public had also been screened according to the same criteria applied c.1960—preventing potential prosecutions, protecting collaborators, and protecting the reputation of Britain." ...|$|E
