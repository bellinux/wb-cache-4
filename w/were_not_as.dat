5|$|Arturo Acevedo Vallarino was the {{producer}} {{and director of}} a theatre company in Antioquia {{and one of the}} pioneers of Colombian cinema. After the introduction of foreign films into Colombia, theatres <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> profitable, leading Acevedo to create a production house in 1920, Acevedo e Hijos (Acevedo and Son), originally known as Casa Cinematogr√°fica Colombia. Acevedo wrote and directed the film.|$|E

During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed by both sides began to surface.|$|E

5|$|During his lifetime, the Irish schools <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{successful}} as Smith had anticipated.

5|$|The {{reception}} for Degrassi: The Next Generations first season was mixed. It had earned itself 365,000 Canadian viewers aged 18 to 49, while its accompanying website was attracting 28 million hits per month, but press reviews <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> complimentary. The season picked up nominations at the Directors Guild of Canada Awards, the Gemini Awards and the Young Artist Awards.|$|E
5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, {{but they were}} unable to resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E

5|$|This was {{followed}} in 1936 by How to be a Detective. The early success of How to Sleep prompted MGM to rush two more short films featuring Benchley, How to Train a Dog, a spoof of dog-training techniques, and How to Behave, which lampooned etiquette norms. How to Sleep was named Best Short Subject at the 1935 Academy Awards, {{while the latter}} two shorts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> well received.|$|E
5|$|Viewing {{figures for}} season seven <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> high as {{previous}} seasons; by the twelfth episode, figures {{were down to}} 314,000 viewers, a 46% decrease from the season premiere which was watched by 585,000 viewers. Despite the decrease in viewers, however, reviews for the season were of praise, rather than criticism.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, peafowl, quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and peafowl were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|Although France had not {{completely}} defeated Austria, the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, nevertheless imposed a heavy political {{toll on the}} Austrians. As {{a result of the}} treaty, France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to the Poles, the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians, and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20% of her total population. Emperor Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition to Napoleon's brother Joseph as the King of Spain, and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions.. The Austrian defeat {{paved the way for the}} marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise. Dangerously, Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria as a future threat, but the Habsburgs <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought.|$|E
