In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{him that he had}} named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.|$|E

Even though the leaks on the dummy torpedoes were detected, the rubber seals were not inspected before the exercise. The crew was also supposed to follow a very strict procedure while preparing the practice HTP torpedo for firing.|$|E

25|$|One main {{theme of}} Greek New Comedy is the father–son relationship. For example, in Menander's Dis Exapaton {{there is a}} focus on the {{betrayal}} between age groups and friends. The father-son relationship is very strong and the son remains loyal to the father. The relationship is always a focus, even if it's not the focus of every action taken by the main characters. In Plautus, on the other hand, the focus is still on the relationship between father and son, but we see betrayal between the two men that wasn't seen in Menander. There is {{a focus on the}} proper conduct between a father and son that, apparently, <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Roman society at the time of Plautus.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{has been}} an {{important}} economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians traveled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques {{played an important role in}} the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus' discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the history and development of Massachusetts, the state's House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.|$|E
500|$|In 1855, an Ohioan, David Christy, {{published}} Cotton Is King: or Slavery in the Light of Political Economy.

This became known as the [...] "King Cotton" [...] theory, to which Davis was an enthusiastic subscriber. Benjamin also spoke in favor of the theory, though Butler suspected he may have [...] "known better", based on his firsthand knowledge of Europe.|$|E

500|$|Cardinal Bellarmine {{had written}} in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without [...] "a true {{physical}} demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun". Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of {{the motion of the}} earth. This theory <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> him that he originally intended to entitle his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea. The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineering}} of the masts {{was complicated}} because stability <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the overall design {{success of the}} suspension structure. [...] Mast displacements could significantly alter cable length and tension and redistribute loads through the superstructure contrary to design. [...] The key to successful design was control of the foundation settlement. [...] The sites natural underlying subsurface conditions were stiff silty clay below a medium dense sand layer, which {{was determined to be}} too accommodating to settlement to host the structure. [...] Ground improvement, consisting of triple-fluid jet grouting, was performed to reduce the compressibility of the silty clay, stiffen the sand deposit and provide a desirable shallow foundation system. [...] This site marked the first time that these geotechnical ground improvement techniques were employed.|$|E

When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them."

500|$|The {{genesis of}} Edward Scissorhands {{came from a}} drawing by then-teenaged {{director}} Tim Burton, which reflected his feelings of isolation and being unable to communicate to people around him in suburban Burbank. The drawing depicted a thin, solemn man with long, sharp blades for fingers. Burton stated that he was often alone and had trouble retaining friendships. [...] "I get the feeling people just got this urge to want {{to leave me alone}} for some reason, I don't know exactly why." [...] During pre-production of Beetlejuice, Burton hired Caroline Thompson, then a young novelist, to write the Edward Scissorhands screenplay as a spec script. Burton was impressed with her short novel, First Born, which was [...] "about an abortion that came back to life". Burton felt First Born had the same psychological elements he wanted to showcase in Edward Scissorhands. [...] "Every detail <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Tim because it was so personal", Thompson remarked. She wrote Scissorhands as a [...] "love poem" [...] to Burton, calling him [...] "the most articulate person I know, but couldn't put a single sentence together".|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} puzzlement {{expressed}} by several reviewers, including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta, {{as to why}} Finn would think Sam {{had been such a}} great performer to begin with that it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bring him back. Despite that, Votta was pleased by Sam's return as was Bell, who thought {{it was one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the episode. Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was glad it was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on—West enjoyed it, but said she had been hoping for more.|$|E

[...] Benioff continued, [...] "Every kid that grows up in Westeros, they all hear about this legendary sword fight that took place twenty years ago, and as far as Bran knew, it was just his father beat this legendary guy." [...] Weiss also stated [...] "Honor <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> Ned Stark that it was worth losing his own life for, but he was completely ready to let go of that honor and excellence to do something that he really felt was more important. It could make a very, very strong defense for Ned doing what he did, and it certainly does puncture the mythology of Ned Stark that's running through this world, especially after his death." ...|$|E

500|$|Garrow's first {{judicial}} appointment came in 1814, when he {{was made}} Chief Justice of Chester. This was opposed by Sir Samuel Romilly, who argued that the positions of Chief Justice and Attorney General were incompatible, saying [...] "to appoint a gentleman holding a lucrative office at the sole pleasure of the Crown to a high judicial situation, was extremely inconsistent with that independence of the judicial character which it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> preserve inviolate". On 6 May 1817, Garrow was made a Baron of the Exchequer and Serjeant-at-Law, succeeding Richard Richards, and resigning his seat in Parliament and his position as Attorney General. He was not a particularly distinguished judge in the Exchequer, mainly {{due to a lack}} of knowledge of the finer points of law. Practising on the Assize Circuits, however, was a different matter; dealing with his more familiar criminal law rather than the commercial law of the Exchequer, Garrow performed far better. Braby indicates that he regularly amazed both barristers and defendants with his knowledge of the intricacies of crime. Garrow retired on 22 February 1832, replaced by John Gurney, and was made a Privy Councillor on retirement as a measure of the Government's respect for him. He died at home on 14 September 1840, aged 80.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. It {{had nothing to do with}} Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' and everything to do with buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E
