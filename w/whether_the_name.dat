5|$|The Kylfings (Old Norse Kylfingar; Finnic Kylfingid; Hungarian Kölpények; Old East Slavic Колбяги, Kolbiagi; Byzantine Greek Κουλπίγγοι, Koulpingoi; Arabic al-Kilabiyya) were {{a people}} of {{uncertain}} origin active in Northern Europe during the Viking Age, roughly {{from the late}} ninth century to the early twelfth century. They {{could be found in}} areas of Lapland, Russia, and the Byzantine Empire that were frequented by Scandinavian traders, raiders and mercenaries. Scholars differ on whether the Kylfings were ethnically Finnic or Norse. Also disputed is their geographic origin, with Denmark, Sweden and the Eastern Baltic all put forward as candidates. <b>Whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Kylfing denotes a particular tribal, socio-political, or economic grouping is also a matter of much debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} is <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> should be Leopoldia. In 1819 Herbert had {{proposed}} Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium (provisional name) {{for the same}} taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821. Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated (i.e. became the correct name), this was overlooked, and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia {{was used for the}} genus of New World amaryllids. Following Filippo Parlatore in 1845, the name Leopoldia was used for a genus of grape hyacinth species, allied to Muscari. In order to preserve the widespread usage of both Hippeastrum and Leopoldia, Fabio Garbari and Werner Greuter proposed in 1970 that Herbert's Hippeastrum and Parlatore's Leopoldia should be conserved and Herbert's Leopoldia rejected. This was accepted and Hippeastrum Herb. is now a nomen conservandum (conserved name), i.e. the correct name regardless {{of the fact that it}} does not have priority over Leopoldia.|$|E
25|$|There is {{uncertainty}} about <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Canaan {{refers to a}} specific Semitic-speaking ethnic group wherever they live, the homeland of this ethnic group, or a region {{under the control of}} this ethnic group, or perhaps any combination of the three.|$|E

500|$|There is {{confusion}} about <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{of the horse}} was [...] "Old Bob" [...] or [...] "Old Robin", though [...] "Old Bob" [...] is the name most widely used.

500|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} is complicated. The first issue is <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> should more properly be Amaryllis L.. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus created the name Amaryllis belladonna, [...] the type species of the genus Amaryllis, in his Species Plantarum along with eight other Amaryllis species. Linnaeus had earlier worked on the Estate of George Clifford near Haarlem between 1735 and 1737 describing the plants growing there in his Hortus Cliffortianus in 1738. It is to this work that he refers in his Species Plantarum. This {{was assumed to be}} the South African Cape Belladonna, although not precisely known. Clifford's herbarium is now preserved at the Natural History Museum in London.|$|E
500|$|The {{legend of}} Wade {{and his wife}} are {{reflected}} in alternative names for the structure that include [...] "Old Wife's Trod", [...] "Auld Wife's Trod" [...] and [...] "Wade's Wife's Causey". The folklore of Wade was still common locally in the early nineteenth century. There is some confusion as to <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Bel or Bell relates to Wade's wife, or to his cow. Bulmer refers in 1890 to [...] " [...] wife, Bell" [...] and Young also assigns the name to Wade's wife in 1817. Hayes (1964) accepts this attribution but antiquarian Hilda Ellis Davidson believes that the folkloric Bel refers to Wade's cow and reflects an earlier tradition of the [...] "fairy" [...] or bountiful cow. The earliest published source of the legend, from 1779, is ambiguous and refers to [...] "Bell Wade's cow".|$|E

50|$|Turgesius (died 845) (also called Turgeis, Tuirgeis, Turges, and Thorgest) was a Viking chief {{active in}} Ireland during the 9th-century.

It {{is not at all}} clear <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> in <b>the</b> Irish annals represent the Old Norse Thurgestr or Old Danish Thorgísl.

5000|$|Both {{names are}} widely attested in place-names and church dedications, [...] "Mawgan" [...] in Cornwall and Brittany and [...] "Meugan" [...] in Wales, {{but it is}} {{uncertain}} <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> refer to {{one and the same}} person. The parishes of St Mawgan and Mawgan-in-Meneage in Cornwall derive their names from St Mauganus. There is also a St Machan in West Lothian (Scotland), as shown by the place-name Ecclesmachan, but again this may be a distinct figure.|$|R

50|$|The {{apocryphal}} Protevangelium of James (probably of the 2nd century) {{tells of}} the miraculous birth of Mary to her parents, Joachim and Anne. It further relates that Joseph, before his marriage to Mary, was an elderly widower with children of his own. Joachim and Anne are named {{in a number of}} other early sources as Mary's parents, but this apocryphal text, which was not incorporated into the biblical canon, was so widely influential that it is not clear <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>names</b> rest on any other independent tradition.|$|R

2500|$|The {{fourth century}} Ammianus Marcellinus (xxvi. 6. 32) {{identifies}} Zoroaster's patron with another Vishtaspa, {{better known as}} Hystaspes in English, the (late-6th century BCE) father of Darius I. [...] The sixth century Agathias was more ambivalent, observing that it wasn't clear to him <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of Zoroaster's patron referred to the father of Darius or to another Hystaspes (ii. 24). As with the medieval Zoroastrian chronology that identifies Vishtaspa with [...] "Ardashir" [...] (see above), Ammianus' identification was once considered to substantiate the [...] "traditional date" [...] of Zoroaster.|$|E

2500|$|As stated above, it {{is unknown}} <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> Kipchak {{referred}} only to the Kipchaks proper, or to the Cumans as well.

[...] This confederation and their living together may have made it difficult for historians to write exclusively about either nation.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was named}} for her mother's brother Claud. During her infancy, her nursemaid, Alice Tittle, {{said that she was}} as [...] "purty as a {{ladybird}}". Opinions differ about <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> refers to a bird or a ladybird beetle, the latter of which is commonly referred to as a [...] "ladybug" [...] in North America. The nickname virtually replaced her first name {{for the rest of her}} life. Her father and siblings called her Lady, and her husband called her Bird—the name she used on her marriage license. During her teenage years, some classmates would call her Bird to provoke her, since she reportedly was not fond of the name.|$|E
2500|$|It is disputed whether Christopher existed, {{and if so}} <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> {{applied to}} a {{specific}} person or was a general title meaning [...] "Christ-bearer" [...] which was applied to several different real or legendary people.
