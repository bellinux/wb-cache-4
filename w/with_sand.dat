5|$|A {{supply of}} 929 M249 SAWs was issued to {{personnel}} from the U.S. Army and Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War. Although exposure to combat was scarce, M249 gunners {{who were involved}} in fighting mainly used their weapons to provide cover fire for friendly maneuvering troops from fixed positions, rather than maneuvering with them. There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
5|$|At its peak, around 1917, Thistle {{had about}} 600 residents. The town's {{railroad}} infrastructure included a five-stall roundhouse, depot, machine shop, and structures to restock passing trains <b>with</b> <b>sand,</b> coal and water. Non-railroad infrastructure included general stores, a post office, barber shop, saloon, pool hall, bakeries and restaurants. The largest building was a two-story schoolhouse, built in 1911.|$|E
5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E

5|$|The {{open air}} burn pits were located {{east of the}} new gas {{chambers}} and refuelled from 4a.m. (or after 5a.m. depending on work-load) to 6p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals. The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them. It is constructed from melted basalt and has a concrete foundation. It is a symbolic grave, as the Nazis spread the actual human ashes, mixed <b>with</b> <b>sand,</b> over 22,000 square metres (237,000 square feet).|$|E
5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track. The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> to reduce this noise.|$|E

5|$|Alexander {{suggested}} that the barrow was constructed before the chamber, {{and that it was}} used as a ramp on which to drag the large stones into position. He {{suggested that}} these megaliths were covered <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> until the capstones were placed atop the chamber, at which the sand was then cleared. In 1950, it was stated that fourteen of the stones currently survive, although following full excavation it was revealed that eighteen large sarsen boulders were extant, alongside four smaller sarsen stones used in the drystone wall and pavement of the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Her Battle for Existence is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The fictional drama follows Susan Dale, a young woman used to luxury. She chooses between two suitors, but her fiancé breaks the engagement off after Susan's father loses his money and life. Susan now tries to support herself, but fails in the role and decides to kill herself. Her other suitor rushes in and stops her suicide and they get married. Little {{is known about the}} production of the film, but it was released as a split reel <b>with</b> <b>Sand</b> Man's Cure on April 22, 1910. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to obtain the basic {{knowledge}} on acoustic emission (AE) characteristics in wood sanding process. In sanding parallel and perpendicular to the grain, the AE event count rate decreased <b>with</b> increasing <b>sanding</b> time and this tendency was similar to the variation of stock removal rate <b>with</b> <b>sanding</b> time. The amplitude distribution of AE signal showed a tendency that the AE event count rates were greater for lower threshold voltage and they decreased with increasing threshold voltage. Although the AE event count rates were greater in lower threshold voltage for finer grit size, they decreased <b>with</b> increasing <b>sanding</b> time at each threshold voltage. Both the AE event count rate and the amplitude distribution of AE signal in sanding perpendicular to the grain were greater and wider than these values in sanding parallel to the grain, respectively. It was found that the AEs with low amplitude were greater for finer grit size and the AEs with high amplitude were greater for coarser grit size. It was suggested that the form of amplitude distribution or AE signal <b>with</b> <b>sanding</b> time does not change although the AE event count rate decrease <b>with</b> increasing <b>sanding</b> time...|$|R

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, noodles, and pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E
5|$|On the Reinanzaka House, the labourers were {{skilled in}} the use of wood, and helped Raymond engrain the texture of cedar onto the concrete.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} the compressive behaviors of concrete <b>with</b> artificial <b>sand</b> that mixed <b>with</b> different content of stone powder (SP). Forty-five cubic specimens were prepared with two strength grades and five SP-content. Including 15 specimens (C 35) of recycled coarse aggregate (RA) concrete <b>with</b> artificial <b>sand</b> (RCC 35), 15 specimens (C 45) of recycled coarse aggregate concrete <b>with</b> artificial <b>sand</b> (RCC 45) and 15 specimens (C 35) of natural aggregate concrete <b>with</b> artificial <b>sand</b> (NC 35). The workability of concrete mixture and the compressive strength of the cubic specimens were tested. The {{results showed that the}} slump of concrete mixture decreased with the SP-content increased, and the coagulability and water retentivity of the concrete mixture were improved by using stone powder. The compressive strength of the concrete <b>with</b> artificial <b>sand</b> were increased by incorporating stone powder.

5|$|There {{are local}} names for winds {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust {{during the winter}} into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere {{for days at a}} time across the Persian Gulf states.|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or <b>with</b> <b>sand</b> martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E

Final nematode population densities were lowest in plots <b>with</b> greatest <b>sand</b> content. Soybean infection by SCN, as determined by the number of cysts 30 days after planting, was not consistently related to soil texture over 2 years. Initial nematode population density was positively related to soybean yield the first year and negatively related to soybean yield the second, probably a result of greater yield suppression by H. glycines in plots <b>with</b> greater <b>sand</b> content...|$|R
5|$|Footprints {{from the}} Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003, when Currie and colleagues {{described}} several {{examples from the}} Nemegt locality. Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids (probably Saurolophus), while two have been left by a large theropod (probably Tarbosaurus) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod. The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia, which showed a matching hind foot morphology. The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym, making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another, similar titanosaur. The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up <b>with</b> <b>sand.</b> Today only the sand infill remains, with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away.|$|E
5|$|In Florida, {{waves of}} over 10feet (3m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two {{occupants}} were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat {{that had previously}} been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall <b>with</b> <b>sand.</b> One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77inches (20mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Edouard {{produced}} strong {{waves and}} storm tides {{of one to}} twoft (0.3 to 0.6m), causing overwash along southern Long Island due to high tide. Coastal flooding occurred, including in Hampton Bays where the waves flooded one road and covered another <b>with</b> <b>sand.</b> The flooding trapped six cars, while the strong waves forced several beaches to close. Because the hurricane moved through the New York Shipping Channel, numerous ships reported winds of over hurricane status, though winds remained below tropical storm force on land. A boat capsized {{off the coast of}} Jones Beach Island, though its passengers were not injured. A Celebrity Cruises cruise ship, the MV_Zenith suffered damage from 30 to 50ft (nine to 15m) waves, injuring several passengers and crew members. Rainfall was minimal, peaking at less than a half of an inch in eastern Long Island.|$|E
