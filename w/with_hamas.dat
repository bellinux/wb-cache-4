5000|$|... : Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad [...] "welcomed" [...] the attack, {{but neither}} claimed responsibility. In an {{official}} press release, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said the bombing was a [...] "response to {{the crimes of}} the occupation." [...] In an interview <b>with</b> <b>Hamas's</b> Al Aqsa TV, senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad operative Ahmed Almadalel stated, [...] "there are many operations such as this - carried out by lone individuals or organizations - and it only stresses {{the fact that the}} conflict with the Zionist enemy is far from over.

5000|$|Immediately {{following}} Hamas' {{victory in}} the elections, Rice attempted to garner international support in demanding that Hamas recognize Israel's right to exist. By April, Hamas officials appeared to publicly state {{that they are willing}} to work toward recognizing Israel. Under their terms, Israel would have to fully withdraw from occupied territories, [...] including Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Many saw this as a positive starting point for negotiations that would allow the [...] "roadmap" [...] process to continue. The statement was verified by Hamas leaders such as Mohammed Ghazal, a Hamas militia official, who stated that Hamas may be willing to amend its charter to recognize Israel, saying, [...] "The charter is not the Quran." [...] Ghazal went on to state that while he agreed <b>with</b> <b>Hamas's</b> positions, [...] "we’re talking now about reality, about political solutions ... The realities are different." ...|$|R
25|$|Saudi Arabia and Egypt {{supported}} {{reconciliation and}} a new unity government and pressed Abbas to start talks <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> Abbas had always conditioned this on Hamas returning control of the Gaza Strip to the Palestinian Authority. Hamas visited a number of countries, including Russia, and the EU member states. Opposition parties and politicians called for a dialogue <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> {{as well as an}} end to the economic sanctions.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 2007, the European Union {{promised to}} resume direct {{aid to the}} Palestinian Authority, and Abbas {{dissolved}} the National Security Council, a sticking point in the defunct unity government <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> That same day, the United States decided to end its fifteen-month embargo on the Palestinian Authority and resume aid, attempting to strengthen Abbas's West Bank government. A day later, the Fatah Central Committee cut off all ties and dialogue <b>with</b> <b>Hamas,</b> pending the return of Gaza.|$|E

2500|$|Abdullah Issa, Palestinian {{publisher}} {{and editor of}} the on-line magazine Donia al Watan was detained in July 2006 by the Palestinian Authority for publishing a story about the theft of $400,000 from PA Foreign Minister Mahmoud Zahar while visiting Kuwait. The story cast aspersions on Hamas for having large amounts of cash while the Palestinian people were suffering from poverty. [...] This story had appeared elsewhere in the Arabic media. [...] Issa, accused Zahar and Hamas of interfering with freedom of the press in the Palestinian territories and expressed disappointment <b>with</b> <b>Hamas's</b> failure to reign in corruption as promised in their election platform: [...] "Our {{people have the right to}} hold Hamas accountable for the deterioration in their living conditions,...We were hoping that the Hamas government would start chasing and arresting all the murderers and thugs who continue to roam the streets of the Gaza Strip and to open all the cases of financial corruption."

40|$|<b>With</b> <b>Hamas’s</b> {{takeover}} of the Gaza strip, a radical Islamic entity was established practicing terrorism to achieve its goals, having tight connections with the “Muslim Brotherhood” in Egypt (whose Palestinian branch is Hamas), and with Iran, the radical Islamic Shiite state. Hamas is challenging and threatening the Palestinian secular nationalistic territorial achievements and striving to implement its Pan - Islamic religious as an Arab-Muslim definition with its territorial dimensions according {{to the idea of}} the Islamic “Ummah”(the borderless nation of Islam). This entity has found itself immediately to be in a violent conflict with Abu Mazen, chairman of the “Palestinian Authority” representing the national-secular Fatah movement and due to this, Abu Mazen and official Palestinian and Egyptian media used terms such as “Islamic Emirate” when describing the new entity that has been established in the Gaza strip. Following Hamas’s {{takeover of}} the Gaza strip in mid June 2007,a radical Islamic political entity was created, with the markings of a sovereign country. This entity controlled by Hamas, a movement with a radical Islamic ideology, aspires to apply it on the general Palestinian population. Under Hamas’s rule in Gaza, organizations characterized as global Jihad began appearing and started carrying out attacks against western entities present and operating in the Gaza strip. This radical entity bearing the Arabic Islamic name “Jaljalat”(Rolling thunder, peal) [1] is new pro Al Qaeda and global Jihad oriented compilation, operating in Gaza strip without any interference of the Hamas government, as a spearhead committed to maintain the “flame” of Jihad against Israel and to “purify” the Palestinian society from western presence and influence. Hamas activities are evident that the strategic objective of Hamas within the Palestinian arena is to take over and replace the PLO in the leadership of the National Palestinian Movement...|$|R
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{considers the}} changing {{fortunes of the}} Palestinian movement, HAMAS, and the recent outcomes of Israeli strategies aimed against this group and Palestinian nationalism external to the Fatah faction of the Palestinian Authority. The example of HAMAS challenges much of the current wisdom on "insurgencies" and their containment. As the author, Dr. Sherifa Zuhur, demonstrates, efforts {{have been made to}} separate HAMAS from its popular support and network of social and charitable organizations. These have not been effective in destroying the organization, nor in eradicating the will to resist among a fairly large segment of the Palestinian population. It is important to consider this Islamist movement {{in the context of a}} region-wide phenomenon of similar movements with local goals, which can be persuaded to relinquish violence, or which could move in the opposite direction, becoming more violent. Certainly an orientation to HAMAS and its base must be factored into new and more practical and effective approaches to peacemaking. At the same time, HAMAS offers a fascinating instance of the dynamics of strategic reactions, and the modification of Israeli impulses towards aggressive deterrence, as well as evolution in the Islamist movements' planning and operations. As well, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict bears similarities to a long-standing civil conflict, even as it has sparked inter-Palestinian hostilities in its most recent phase.

25|$|In 2007 in Gaza, gunmen {{allegedly}} affiliated <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> {{killed a}} Fatah supporter by defenestration, an act repeated {{the next day}} when a Hamas supporter was defenestrated by alleged supporters of Fatah.|$|E
25|$|In November 2011 J Street {{board member}} Kathleen Peratis visited <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> in the Gaza Strip. The meeting was {{controversial}} in the pro-Israel community. J Street opposed it {{ahead of time}} and condemned it afterward.|$|E
25|$|The war {{finally ended}} on 18 January 2009. A day before, Israeli {{officials}} announced a unilateral ceasefire, without an agreement <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> In a press conference, Israeli Prime Minister Olmert declared the ceasefire effective that night, at 00:00 GMT on 18 January.|$|E
25|$|Islamic Jihad is {{the second}} largest militant Islamic group in Gaza with 8,000 fighters present in the Gaza strip. In June 2013, the Islamic Jihad broke ties <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> leaders after Hamas police fatally shot the {{commander}} of Islamic Jihad's military wing.|$|E
25|$|In September 2006, Egyptian {{mediators}} {{received a}} letter in which Shalit wrote that he was alive and well. The handwriting was confirmed {{to be that of}} Shalit. In October, Egypt was also reported to be negotiating <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> on behalf of Israel for Shalit's release.|$|E
25|$|Both Hamas and the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine {{initially}} claimed responsibility, <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> {{saying that}} the attack {{was in response to}} Israel's assassination ten days earlier in Nablus of the two leading Hamas commanders Jamal Mansour and Omar Mansour as well as six civilians including two children.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, when DWRC {{organized}} the Federation of Independent and Democratic Trade Unions & Workers' Committees in Palestine representing 50,000 workers {{outside of the}} PGFTU, the PGFTU retaliated by informing on the Gaza head of DWRC and the independent trade union coalition to Palestinian internal security, claiming that they were affiliated <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Morsi's {{government}} {{condemned the}} Operation Pillar of Defense {{and called for}} a ceasefire. Morsi sent Prime Minister Hesham Qandil to Gaza to express solidarity with Gaza and Hamas, a stark contrast to Hosni Mubarak's treatment of Hamas as an enemy in the 2008–09 Gaza War. Egypt, along with the United States mediated the ceasefire <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> and Israel.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Ya'alon, Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs, accused Turkey of {{cooperating}} <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> and Iran.

25|$|On 18 October 2011, Gilad Shalit was {{returned}} to Israel {{as part of the}} agreement <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> Hamas militants during the exchange wore suicide belts in the event that Israel tried to change the terms at the last minute.

25|$|During {{at least}} two meetings, Olmert made a secret promise to Abbas: Once a {{prisoner}} exchange deal for captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was finalized <b>with</b> <b>Hamas,</b> Israel would bolster Abbas' government by releasing Fatah prisoners. After a prisoner exchange deal was agreed upon in 2011 under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Olmert's successor, Palestinian officials demanded that Netanyahu live up to Olmert's promise and release Fatah prisoners.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} has clashed <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> {{on a number}} of occasions. In 2009, a Salafist leader, Abdul Latif Moussa, declared an Islamic emirate in the town of Rafah, on Gaza's southern border. Moussa and 19 other people were killed when Hamas forces stormed his mosque and house. In 2011, Salafists abducted and murdered a pro-Palestinian Italian activist, Vittorio Arrigoni. Following this Hamas again took action to crush the Salafist groups.|$|E
25|$|On 17 January 2007, {{one of the}} captor groups, the Army of Islam {{headed by}} Mumtaz Dormush, claimed that Shalit was being held {{exclusively}} by Hamas. On 8 March 2007, Jerusalem Post reported that an agreement had been reached <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> over the number of prisoners Israel would release in return for Shalit. Israel and Hamas were still negotiating specific prisoners who Hamas wanted freed in return for Shalit.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, Hamas began attacking posts held {{by their}} Fatah faction rivals. Hundreds of Hamas fighters {{had moved on}} the {{positions}} after giving their occupants two hours to leave. A major Fatah base in the northern town of Jabaliya fell to Hamas fighters, witnesses told AFP news agency. Heavy fighting also raged around the main Fatah headquarters in Gaza City, <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> militants attacking with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons.|$|E
25|$|The semi-constitutional and semi-presidential Basic Law gave President and Government {{a shared}} {{political}} power. Fatah {{refused to cooperate}} <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> The powerful Fatah-backed President Abbas {{was supported by the}} international community and more or less tolerated by Israel. The Hamas-dominated Palestinian Authority and the parliament on the other hand were boycotted, and international financial aid was rendered via Abbas, bypassing the Palestinian Government. Because Fatah and Hamas did not co-operate, the parliament became dysfunctional and the PA suffered financial distress.|$|E
25|$|Most Western {{nations and}} {{international}} organizations did not give the Hamas lead government official recognition and responded by cutting off funds and imposing other sanctions. Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President and head of Fatah, met with Khaled Meshal, the exiled head of Hamas, in Syria, {{in an effort to}} resolve differences over the direction of the Palestinian Authority and negotiations with Israel and to try to form a unity government <b>with</b> <b>Hamas.</b> The two parties did not reach a resolution.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{was among}} the first {{national}} governments to set up an official blog. Under David Saranga, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs became active in adopting Web 2.0 initiatives, including an official video blog and a political blog. The Foreign Ministry also held a microblogging press conference via Twitter about its war <b>with</b> <b>Hamas,</b> with Saranga answering questions from the public in common text-messaging abbreviations during a live worldwide press conference. The questions and answers were later posted on IsraelPolitik, the country's official political blog.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007 a Fatah–Hamas {{conflict}} broke out, which eventually led Hamas {{taking control of the}} Gaza strip, which in practice divided the Palestinian Authority into two. Various forces affiliated with Fatah engaged in combat <b>with</b> <b>Hamas,</b> in numerous gun battles. Most Fatah leaders escaped to Egypt and the West Bank, while some were captured and killed. Fatah remained in control of the West Bank, and President Abbas formed a new governing coalition, which some critics of Fatah said subverts the Palestinian Constitution and excludes the majority government of Hamas.|$|E
25|$|On 12 November, a large {{demonstration}} {{dedicated to}} the memory of late Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was organized by Fatah in Gaza City. With over 200,000 participants, this was the largest Fatah demonstration in the Gaza Strip since the Hamas takeover. The demonstration was forcibly dispersed by Hamas gunmen, who fired into the crowd. At least six civilians were killed and over 80 people were injured, some from being trampled in the resulting stampede. The smaller militant group Islamic Jihad, whose members have clashed <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> several times, condemned the shootings.|$|E
25|$|Popular Resistance Committees is a {{coalition}} {{of a number of}} armed Palestinian groups opposed to what they regard as the conciliatory approach of the Palestinian Authority and Fatah towards Israel. The PRC is especially active in the Gaza Strip, through its military wing, the Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades. The PRC is said to have an extreme Islamic worldview and operates <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> and the Islamic Jihad movement. The PRC has carried out several attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers including hundreds of shooting attacks and other rocket and bombing attacks.|$|E
25|$|A {{day before}} the {{outbreak}} of the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Oz signed a statement supporting military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Two weeks later he advocated a ceasefire <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> and called attention to the harsh conditions there. He was quoted in the Italian paper Corriere della Sera as saying Hamas was responsible for the outbreak of violence, but {{the time had come to}} seek a cease-fire. Oz also said that if innocent citizens were indeed killed in Gaza, it should be treated as a war crime, although he doubted that bombing UN structures was intentional.|$|E
25|$|From its {{inception}} in 2002, the Initiative deeply divided the organization. As stated before, members of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas' military wing, committed the Passover Massacre on same day as the peace Initiative's adoption. At that time, Hamas rejected not only peace with Israel but even negotiations with it. The official administration of Hamas never recognized the Initiative, which alienated it {{from members of the}} Arab League, especially Jordan and Egypt. One of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas' conditions of forming a national coalition government <b>with</b> <b>Hamas</b> after the 2006 election was that Hamas had to recognize the Initiative, but he was unsuccessful.|$|E
