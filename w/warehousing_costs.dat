50|$|Scott Bizar, {{dissatisfied}} with TSR's Dungeons & Dragons (1974) and Warriors of Mars (1984), founded his own company, Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU). The company's first two products were Hugh McGowan's Gladiators (1975), a man-to-man miniatures combat system, and Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age (1975), a first-of-its kind wargame {{set in the}} world of Conan, was co-designed by Bizar's roommate, Lin Carter. At Gen Con IX in 1976, Edward E. Simbalist and Wilf K. Backhaus met Bizar, who was interested in their role-playing game Chevalier they had brought with them but decided not to sell to TSR; Bizar and helped guide the game to print over the next year as Chivalry & Sorcery, the first RPG from FGU. In the late 1970s, Bizar was looking for a new science-fiction roleplaying game to act as one of FGU's flagships, and contacted Simbalist and Phil McGregor to produce the game, which was published in 1980 as Space Opera. During the process, Bizar never met Simbalist or McGregor, or A. Mark Ratner, and the project was completed over more than two years entirely by correspondence. In the early 1980s, Bizar started picking up product lines from defunct publishers, which brought Bushido and Aftermath! to FGU in 1981. FGU purchased the rights to Swordbearer (1982), and also bought Heritage's old stock, something that Bizar felt was a necessary part of such a deal; FGU published their own edition in 1985. In 1987, Bizar was considering new locations for FGU that could offer him reduced <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs,</b> and decided on Arizona, the home of friend Rick Loomis and his gaming company, Flying Buffalo. Bizar rented office space and warehouse in Tempe, but since FGU was having difficulties Bizar took jobs as first a car salesman and then a school teacher. Bizar was intent on staying in the hobbyist industry, and founded a game shop in Gilbert, Arizona called Waterloo, using stock from his parents, who were running their own Waterloo game stores in New York; the FGU offices and warehouse were soon moved to this new location. After founding a second store in Phoenix, Arizona, Bizar was hit by massive fraud at the Gilbert store, when an employee took out credit cards in Bizar's name, opened fake bank accounts, and fraudulently offered up Bizar's stores as collateral; Bizar lost money due to the fraud and was also forced to fight lawsuits over the next years originating from it, and eventually had to close down the Phoenix store in 1996. Bizar had been getting some older FGU books back into print, while preparing new books for publication, but the fraud put an end to all that.|$|E

This condition is very influenced by the selling price and the cost of fertilizer distribution. The use of distribution channels and pricing are very important, because it can affect the sales volume, the level of capital gains, risks, and the benefits. The general objective of each industry is certain to make a profit, and it will be achieved if the sales activities can be carried out successfully as planned.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of inventory and warehouse costs for Thai traditional wholesale businesses in consumer products. The wholesale businesses of consumer products consist of a few hundred of suppliers and almost fifty thousand Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), which inventory and warehousing are not only costly but also hard to manage. This study's main objectives are to know the source of the high inventory and <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs,</b> and to find ways on reducing them. The study involves shop owners as respondents and uses observational study and interview for data gathering. This research also applies the concept of basic mathematical model for integrating all segments by applying Excel program in single window of purchasing, inventory, sales and marketing segments, which is decision maker. The data were then interpreted with the help of statistical tools. This research reveals that most of Thai traditional wholesale businesses lack knowledge and methodology for executing business by separating management of procurement and purchasing, inventory and warehouse, and sales segments. The result also shows that Thai traditional purchasing is decided more by feeling rather than facts. The high inventory and <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs</b> have occurred by purchasing, so sales and marketing can help to reduce inventory and warehouse costs. Therefore, if the integration of all segments is a single window management, then it becomes the best way for executing business...|$|E

40|$|Warehouse Location is a nonconvex {{programming}} problem {{involving the}} geographic placing and sizing of intermediate facilities in distribution studies. The nonconvexities {{are caused by}} economies of scale associated {{with the cost of}} building and operating the facilities. A heuristic program has been developed for solving warehouse location problems when these economies are representable by continuous concave functions. The paper discusses the heuristics used and computational experience with the program on "practical" problems. On the basis of two numerical examples for which an optimal solution was obtained through a special purpose experimental mixed integer programming code, it is conjectured (1) that near optimal solutions can be achieved using the heuristic program and (2) that optimal sizing and locating of facilities are very sensitive to the shapes of the <b>warehousing</b> <b>cost</b> functions. ...|$|R

In many warehousing environments order picking processes are organized according to the pick&pack principle. Pickers must build stabile loads during the picking process under strict time constrains. A genetic algorithm with Pareto elitist-based selection has been developed for this multi-criteria optimization problem. The resulting order pick lists are the input of the scheduling module. Starting times of the lists are determined with simulation optimization techniques considering time constrain, labor and earliness/tardiness penalty costs, and utilization grades. Costs of order picking can reach as high as fifty percent of all <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs.</b> Travel times consume almost half of a complete order picking tour.

As a result, companies face shortages or bloated inventories, run-away transportation and <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs</b> and major production adjustment costs. In this article we analyze a {{major cause of}} the bullwhip effect and suggest a remedy. We focus on a unique replenishment rule that is able to reduce the bullwhip effect.

The centrally-controlled system operates in a periodic-review base-stock replenishment environment required to attain a pre-specified customer service-level. Each of the N non-identical retailers supply normally distributed demand and is served directly from the supplier or {{through one of the}} W distribution points. ^ Inventory costs are assessed on the safety stock and in-transit inventories. Transportation costs are assessed as a function of distance and total shipment weight. The per-unit transportation cost is a decreasing function of shipment weight. A constant per-unit cost is assessed for goods processed by any distribution point. Transit time, a surrogate for inventory leadtime, is a function of distance and also shipment weight. ^ A primary objective of this research is to demonstrate the dependency between the inventory model decisions and the transportation and warehousing model decisions and the effect of this dependency on the total system expected cost of a distribution system. More specifically, it is desired to demonstrate that the optimization of a distribution system with respect to only the inventory costs without taking into account the effect of inventory routing decisions on the transportation and <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs</b> as well as the transit times (i. e., leadtimes) resulting from the routing decisions, will, in most cases, lead to a sub-optimal solution. Similarly, optimization with respect to only the transportation and <b>warehousing</b> <b>costs</b> while ignoring the impact of the transportation decisions on the inventory costs may also lead to a sub-optimal solution. ^ The information gained from the examination of both the source and the magnitude of the dependency between the inventory, transportation, and warehousing considerations will be valuable in attaining another primary objective of this research which is the identification of the distribution system that minimizes the total expected cost per order cycle. In order to attain the second objective, a multi-phased heuristic is developed and tested. The results of the tests demonstrating the value of the heuristic and the insights provided by these tests are presented. ...|$|E
