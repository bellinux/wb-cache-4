Limantour, who broadly agreed with Estañol, had the support of the Mexican financiers, who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest, {{as well as that of}} the large landowners who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings.|$|E

5|$|In January 1448, {{the terms}} of the {{previous}} Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the Guelphs rose to political prominence. Being especially adverse to Sforza, they entered peace negotiations with Venice, which, also threatened by Sforza's growing power, was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms, albeit dictated by herself. Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against the Guelphs in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo. The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the Adda River. However Sforza's plans were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging Lodi directly. While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of Cremona. However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until her husband relieved the city. The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army. Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthodox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships. This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy himself with the Ghiarad'adda region while Lodi and Caravaggio were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.|$|E

25|$|There was no {{shortage}} of people <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Texas. The United States was still struggling with {{the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819, and soaring land prices within the United States made the Mexican land policy seem very generous. In 1827 Austin received a second grant allowing him to settle 100families along the Old San Antonio Road to Nacogdoches, near what is now Bastrop. The location was chosen {{at the behest of the}} Tejanos, who hoped that colonists in that area could help defend against Comanche raids. Austin was later granted permission to resettle 800other families in Texas. Twenty-three other empresarios also brought immigrants to Texas. Of these, only one of the empresarios, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States. Many of the Anglo settlers owned slaves. All colonists were expected to become naturalized Mexican citizens, and they were also supposed to follow the state religion. In Austin's colony, the local priest formally converted new arrivals but then allowed them to worship as they pleased.|$|E

Upon hearing of Pyrrhus' intention to conquer Sparta, Antigonus Gonatas had dispatched his general, [...] Ameinias the Phocian, from Corinth with a group of mercenaries to relieve the Lacedaimonians. Shortly after this, the defenders' numbers of the defenders were further augmented by the arrival of Areus with 2,000 men from Crete. The arrival of these reinforcements greatly reduced the strain on the Spartans, with women and those who were not of military age being able to withdraw from the front line.|$|E

[...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed.

2500|$|Some Parliamentarians {{had argued}} that all the Irish should be {{deported}} to west of the Shannon and replaced with English settlers.

The ruling was inopportune: [...] President Truman had called steelmakers and the union to the White House that morning to reach an agreement. At roughly 3:00p.m., after Sawyer, Fairless and Murray had bargained for five hours, a tentative agreement had been reached. [...] But word of the high court's acceptance of the case led the steel executives {{to back out of}} the deal.

2500|$|In late 1458, however, Niccolò Gattilusio, who {{had found}} refuge on Lesbos, deposed and strangled his older brother, usurping rule over the island.

In {{preparation}} for the upcoming campaign, the Sultan began an expansion of his fleet, and initiated extensive works around Constantinople and the Dardanelles, to secure an impregnable base of operations for his navy. Niccolò Gattilusio sent several envoys to seek aid from Genoa, the Papacy, and other European states, but to little avail.
