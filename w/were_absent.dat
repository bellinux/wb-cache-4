5|$|Bulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev, {{the former}} due to {{monetary}} disputes, {{and the latter}} because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned. At one point, the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> from the 2015 European Team Chess Championship), as was Greece.|$|E
5|$|Coandă and his 1910 {{aircraft}} <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> {{from much}} of aviation {{literature of the}} day. None of the annual issues of Jane's All the World's Aircraft ever mentioned the Coandă-1910 or its turbo-propulseur powerplant. The Soviet engineer Nikolai Rynin {{made no mention of}} Coandă in his exhaustive nine-volume encyclopaedia on jet and rocket engines, written in the late 1920s and early '30s.|$|E
5|$|Structure 9 {{is a large}} mound on the {{northwest}} side of Plaza 1. The last phase of construction shows evidence of the interruption of construction by the Spanish Conquest. Terraces <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> on three sides of the structure with only the lowest level having been built on the fourth. Early Classic ceramic caches were discovered under Structure 9.|$|E

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, 256 Operation Mallard gliders {{carrying}} the remaining men and equipment of the 6th Airborne Division took off. Fifteen squadrons of fighter aircraft were deployed by the RAF to escort the gliders and towing aircraft. The force crossed the English channel unhindered, and arrived in Normandy at 21:00. As {{it was still}} daylight, previous navigation problems that had affected the earlier operations <b>were</b> <b>absent.</b> As the gliders approached the two landing areas they met with anti-aircraft fire from German defenders on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec extermination camp {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E

5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an unusual and uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments <b>were</b> <b>absent.</b> The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E
5|$|Najm-ul-Hassan {{was also}} Devika's co-star in the studio's next venture, Jeevan Naiya. The two co-stars {{developed}} a romantic relationship, {{and during the}} shooting schedule of Jeevan Naiya, Devika eloped with Hassan. Himanshu was both enraged and distraught. Since the leading pair <b>were</b> <b>absent,</b> production was stalled. A {{significant portion of the}} movie had been shot and a large sum of money, which had been taken as credit from financers, had been spent. The studio therefore suffered severe financial losses and a loss of credit among bankers in the city while the runaway couple made merry.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet also {{mentioned}} that the parrots ate {{the seeds of the}} Fernelia buxifolia shrub ("bois de buis"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit.

5|$|The IOC {{awarded the}} 1960 Olympics to Squaw Valley, United States. Since the village had no facilities, {{there was a}} rush to {{construct}} infrastructure and sports facilities including an ice arena, speed-skating track, and a ski-jump hill. The opening and closing ceremonies were produced by Walt Disney. The Squaw Valley Olympics was the first winter Olympics to have a dedicated athletes' village, {{the first to use}} a computer (courtesy of IBM) to tabulate results, and the first to feature female speed skating events. The bobsleigh events <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> for the only time due to the cost of building a bobsleigh run.|$|E
5|$|This was Arsenal's 16th Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's 20th. Arsenal was without several {{of their first}} choice players in midfield, who <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> through injury; this prompted a shuffle in the team which saw striker Sylvain Wiltord positioned on the left wing. For Liverpool, defender Markus Babbel was named as a substitute ater a lengthy period {{out of the side}} through illness. New signing El Hadji Diouf started in a creative role, behind strikers Michael Owen and Emile Heskey to begin with.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> there.|$|E

5|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Joseph E. Peterson and colleagues {{identified}} lesions in skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs, which were interpreted as infections caused by trauma. Lesions {{were found on}} 22% of sampled pachycephalosaur skulls (a frequency consistent across genera), but <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> from flat-headed specimens (which have been interpreted as juveniles or females), {{which is consistent with}} use in intra-specific combat (for territory or mates). The distribution of lesions in these animals tended to concentrate {{at the top of the}} dome, which supports head-butting behaviour. Flank-butting would probably result in fewer injuries, which would instead be concentrated on the sides of the dome. These observations were made while comparing the lesions with those on the skulls and flanks of modern sheep skeletons. The researchers noted that modern head-butting animals use their weapons for both combat and display, and that pachycephalosaurs could therefore also have used their domes for both. Displaying a weapon and willingness to use it can be enough to settle disputes in some animals.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{the retreat}} of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} {{than in most}} other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E
5|$|Gordon Brown was {{reportedly}} unhappy over Blair's comments about him, while David Runciman of The London Review of Books suggested there were episodes from Blair's troubled {{relationship with his}} Chancellor that <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> from A Journey. Labour politician Alistair Darling said the book demonstrates how the country can be {{changed for the better}} when a government has a clear purpose, while the New Zealand Listener suggested Blair and his contemporaries had helped to write New Labour's epitaph. Some families of servicemen and women who were killed in Iraq reacted angrily, with one antiwar commentator dismissing Blair's regrets over the loss of life. Shortly after the release of A Journey, the screenwriter of the 2006 film The Queen, which depicts Blair's first months in office, accused Blair of plagiarising a conversation with Elizabeth II from him.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Kilburn entered Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, {{with a state}} scholarship, {{a county}} major scholarship, and a minor open scholarship, where he studied mathematics. Although many {{university}} dons <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> performing war work at places like Bletchley Park, and the University of Cambridge maintained a vigorous mathematical community, and Kilburn became the Sidney Sussex College representative in the New Pythagoreans, a clique with the Cambridge University Mathematical Society that also numbered Gordon Welchman and Geoff Tootill among its members. Due to {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, courses were compressed to two years, and he graduated in 1942 with First Class Honours in Part I of the Mathematical Tripos and preliminary examinations for Part II.|$|E
5|$|Mark Cavendish and Daniele Bennati, stage {{winners in}} the past two editions of the Giro, <b>were</b> <b>absent</b> from this race, but several top sprinters took the start in Amsterdam.

Former Tour de France points classification winner Óscar Freire intended to make his Giro debut in this race, but he pulled out due to sinusitis shortly before the race started. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton included Robbie McEwen, Freire's teammate Graeme Brown, Baden Cooke, Leonardo Duque, Sebastian Haedo, Wouter Weylandt, and Greg Henderson.|$|E

Disciplinary problems persisted; the company ordered to lead the move was unable to deploy as most of its men <b>were</b> <b>absent,</b> and the remainder mostly drunk. By the time {{the battalion}} managed to move, one of its officers had shot a man—and been shot himself—while trying to restore order among his company, and in a separate incident a sergeant had been assaulted {{by one of his}} own men and, defending himself, accidentally shot a bystander.|$|E
