5|$|Two {{recordings}} of Bax as a pianist {{were made in}} 1929. With Lionel Tertis he recorded his own Viola Sonata for Columbia, and with May Harrison he recorded Delius's Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival HMV label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and Mater ora Filium were recorded {{under the auspices of}} the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on 78 rpm discs. Of the tone poems, Eugene Goossens conducted the first recording of Tintagel, in 1928; twenty years later a set of The Garden of Fand with Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that The Record Guide listed only Tintagel, the Coronation March, the unaccompanied choral work <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> Like to be Young and Fair? and the solo piano piece Paean.|$|E

25|$|Glover {{made his}} directorial debut with 2005's <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>It?,</b> a surreal film {{featuring}} {{a cast of}} actors with Down syndrome. It premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. With a budget of only $150,000, it took almost a decade to complete, and was originally {{intended to be a}} short film. Most of the primary footage was shot in 12 days, stretched over a two-and-a-half-year period. Production was mostly funded by Glover's roles in Willard and the Charlie's Angels films.|$|E
25|$|Just <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> {{that makes}} today's homes so different, so appealing? {{was created in}} 1956 for the {{catalogue}} of the This Is Tomorrow exhibition in London, England {{in which it was}} reproduced in black and white. In addition, the piece was used in posters for the exhibit. Richard Hamilton has subsequently created several works in which he reworked the subject and composition of the pop art collage, including a 1992 version featuring a female bodybuilder. Many artists have created derivative works of Hamilton's collage. P. C. Helm made a year 2000 interpretation.|$|E

He played a German-speaking clairvoyant during World War I in the Polish-language film Hiszpanka, and an unwitting employee in service of Robert De Niro's character in The Bag Man. In the late 1980s, Glover started his company, Volcanic Eruptions, which publishes his books and also serves as the production company for Glover's films, <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>It?</b> and It Is Fine! Everything Is Fine. He currently stars in the Starz television series American Gods as Mr. World, the god of globalization.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin, {{complaining}} of back pains and other discomfort.

[...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss," [...] replied Macklin. A few moments later, at 2:50a.m. on 5 January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.|$|E

[...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to be critical of what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war.

500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} critics had taken notice as well. After January 1989, the month that Vulture would 24 years later find to be the movies' worst January ever, New York Times critic Janet Maslin had had enough. Her idea of [...] "movie hell" [...] she said, {{included}} among other indignities having to watch only January releases. [...] "It's well known that January films have a character that is, let us say, distinctive ... <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> that leads film distributors to regard January as just the right resting place for so many flukes, black sheep, wild cards and also-rans?" [...] She allowed that recent years had allowed some good films, such as Radio Days and El Norte, to get attention they might note have in other months of the year. However, that January had had as one its major releases The January Man, a thriller she characterized as aptly titled, despite not even being the worst the month had to offer (that dubious honor went to Deepstar Six).|$|E
500|$|Charlie Cox {{explained}} that with Wilson Fisk imprisoned following the first season, season two picks up with [...] "the crime rate [...] plummeted. Things {{have returned to}} normal, if not better than normal", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes Matt Murdock [...] "question everything. Matt has to reevaluate [...] and what he does". Jeph Loeb, head of Marvel Television, said that [...] "if season one was really about Matt’s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> to be a hero." [...] By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to [...] "push and pull" [...] on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies—the Punisher seeing [...] "justice in a very black-and-white kind of way", and Elektra living [...] "more in the gray". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said {{that she has a}} very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and [...] "quest for justice. Who are you doing this for? Why are you doing this? What’s the end goal that you’re trying to achieve?" ...|$|E
500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled <b>What</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E

The story is suggested for use in curriculum to teach children about food, in books Humanics National Preschool Assessment Handbook, and The Complete Daily Curriculum for Early Childhood. Mildred R. Donoghue writes in Language Arts: Integrating Skills for Classroom Teaching that the story should be utilised {{in the course of}} primary education. In their work Success in Reading and Writing, authors Barbara J. Blackford, Helen Cappleman and Betty Cramer suggest the book be read aloud to children in kindergarten, and the teacher should subsequently quiz members of the class {{to see if they can}} recall items from the boy's shopping list. Authors Diane Stirling, Linda McKay, Georgia Archibald and Shelley Berg recommend the story in their book Character Education Connections: For School, Home and Community, in order to teach children the character trait of responsibility: [...] "A willingness to be accountable for your own actions without blaming others." ...|$|E
500|$|The storyline {{was first}} {{conceived}} when EastEnders series consultant Simon Ashdown viewed {{a documentary about}} homelessness, featuring a mother and child {{at a bus stop}} with nowhere to go. Ashdown questioned what might happen if a child sex offender were to befriend the mother in order to grow closer to the child, and related the scenario to Bianca's return to the soap. BBC Head of Drama John Yorke explained that the idea when presented [...] "drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for." [...] Final approval for the storyline was sought from BBC Head of Fiction Jane Tranter on 2 June 2008. Tranter explained that: [...] "I thought it was a fantastically good idea. The big moments in EastEnders, those iconic pieces of television history, tend to be the things that are incredibly near the knuckle, and are actually quite difficult subjects to raise {{in the context of a}} family sitting room. [...] Soaps are meant to hold up a mirror to our lives, and sometimes that mirror will show ugly bits, difficult bits, taboo bits.

500|$|On 4 January 1922, South Georgia was sighted, {{and late}} that morning Quest {{anchored}} at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton {{returned to the}} ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary. [...] "The old smell of dead whale permeates everything", he wrote. [...] "It is a strange and curious place....A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay." [...] Later he slept, and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 2a.m. {{on the morning of}} 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: [...] "You're always wanting me to give up things, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> I ought to give up?" [...] Macklin replied [...] "Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you." [...] Immediately afterwards Shackleton [...] "had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died".|$|E
