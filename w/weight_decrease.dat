40|$|Few {{studies have}} focused on the {{relationship}} between the trajectories of long-term changes in body mass index (BMI; weight (kg) /height (m) 2) and all-cause mortality in old age, particularly in non-Western populations. We eval-uated this association by applying group-basedmixture models to data derived from the National Survey of the Jap-anese Elderly, which included 4, 869 adults aged 60 or more years, with up to 7 repeated observations between 1987 and 2006. Four distinct BMI trajectories were identified: “low-normal <b>weight,</b> <b>decreasing</b> ” (baseline BMI = 18. 7; 23. 8 % of sample); “mid-normal <b>weight,</b> <b>decreasing</b> ” (baseline BMI = 21. 9; 44. 6 % of sample); “high-normal <b>weight,</b> <b>decreasing</b> ” (baseline BMI = 24. 8; 26. 5 % of sample); and “overweight, stable ” (baseline BMI = 28. 7; 5. 2 % of sam-ple). Survival analysis with an average follow-up of 13. 8 years showed that trajectories of higher BMI were associ-ated with lower mortality. In particular, relative to those with a mid-normal <b>weight,</b> <b>decreasing</b> BMI trajectory, those with an overweight, stable BMI trajectory had the lowest mortality, and those with a low-normal, decreasing BMI trajectory had the highest mortality. In sharp contrast with prior observations from Western populations, BMI changes lie primarily within the normal-weight range, and virtually no older Japanese are obese. The association between BMI trajectories and mortality varies according to the distribution of BMI within the population. body mass index; Japan; mortality; older adults; trajectories Abbreviations: ADL, activity of daily living; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval...|$|R
5000|$|During cocoon formation, the larva uses saliva to {{encompass}} the fecal material and cell. The anterior part of the cocoon is composed of a domed collar and a central, domed nipple region, and the larva weaves salivary [...] "silk" [...] threads in a circular pattern in this region. The larva also uses its digestive contents to form smears on the cocoon, leading to hardening of the cocoon and a color change to a dark, red-brown. In this stage, in which the organism becomes classified as an imago, the metabolic rate of the imago declines because it must have enough food to survive the winter.

50|$|In 2009, {{the same}} Korean {{researchers}} published a further {{study on the}} anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects of DOM in obese mice. The control group received tap water and the experimental group received DOM of hardness 1000 for 84 days. The DOM fed group compared to control group reported a 7% body <b>weight</b> <b>decrease,</b> reduced plasma glucose levels by 35.4% and significant increase of glucose disposal after 84 days.

Taken together, these results provide a possibility that continuous intake of DOM can be of dietary therapeutic value for treatment of obesity and diabetes. In 2013, a further diabetes induced mice study was conducted to establish dosage regimes. The researchers concluded that DOM provided a novel activator for glucose uptake.|$|E
