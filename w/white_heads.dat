500|$|A town mob {{searches}} for {{a mass grave}} {{in the woods and}} finds a bag belonging to the town pediatrician filled with bones, which Spitz mistakenly assumes belonged to a child. The angry mob goes to see the doctor, who claims the bag was sold. The bones end up belonging to [...] "Mr. Tippy", a dog that belonged to Terri. Scully gets upset over a joke Mulder makes and tells him she's returning to Washington. Margi and Terri celebrate their birthday and Brenda uses a Ouija board to know who she will marry; everyone thinks it's Scott before the planchette veers away from the C and spells out Satan. Upset, Brenda rushes to the bathroom where Margi and Terri are chanting [...] "Bloody Mary" [...] and is locked in, killed by glass from a shattered mirror. Detective <b>White</b> <b>heads</b> to Mulder's hotel room because she found a box which inside had her cat's collar, and then she attempts to seduce Mulder but they are interrupted by Scully who informs them about Brenda's death. Terri and Margi try to console Scott, who tells them off. Turned down, Terri is mad at him but Margi still likes him and leaves.|$|E
2500|$|Loyalists {{fleeing the}} United States {{during and after}} the American Revolution settled on various Bahama Islands {{including}} Andros, bringing their slaves with them. In addition, Andros was the destination of many families who were squeezed out of the Belize logwood industry following the relocation of Mosquito Coast settlers to British Honduras in 1787. By 1788 the population of all the Bahamas was reported as 3,000 whites and 8,000 blacks. The 1788 census for Andros reported 22 <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> of families, with a total of 132 slaves; they cultivated [...] of land.|$|E

60|$|Thereupon the {{professor}} followed by Renouard joined {{the circle of}} all the inmates of the house assembled {{at the other end}} of the terrace about a tea-table; three <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> and that resplendent vision of woman’s glory, the sight of which had the power to flutter his heart like a reminder of the mortality of his frame.|$|E

60|$|The {{wind was}} blowing fresh now, and the sea was getting up. Not a cloud was {{to be seen in}} the sky, and the sun shone brightly on the <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> which were {{beginning}} to show on the water. The lugger was tearing along, occasionally throwing a cloud of spray over her bows, and leaving a track of white water behind her.|$|E
60|$|It was as Peter said. The {{clouds were}} rising fast behind the island, the waves were {{breaking}} with a short, sharp sound upon the beach, <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> {{were beginning to}} show themselves out at sea, the fishing craft were running in towards Portsmouth under reefed sails, the men-of-war at Spithead could be seen sending down their topmasts, and everything betokened {{that it would be}} a nasty night.|$|E
60|$|Ivie it was, sure enough. And presently, when we drew {{a little}} closer, he gave one big shout and whipped off the hat from his head; and off, too, came the caps from the <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> of Scipio and Chess and Johnson behind him. Our oars were tossed, Ivie caught our bows, and reached {{his hand to}} Dorothy. It was fitting {{that she should be}} the first to land at Carvel Hall.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren, {{her eyes}} twinkling, [...] "I wouldn't {{advise you to}} run across the Green Meadows in sight of King Eagle. I am told he is very fond of Rabbit.

He is so swift of wing that even {{the members of the}} Duck family fear him, for he is especially fond of fat Duck. Even Honker the Goose is not safe from him. King he may he, but he rules only through fear. He is a white-headed old robber. The best thing I can say of him is that he takes a mate for life and is loyal and true to her as long as she lives, and that is a great many years. By the way, Peter, did you know that she is bigger than he is, and that the young during the first year after leaving their nest, are bigger than their parents and do not have <b>white</b> <b>heads?</b> By the time they get <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> they are the same size as their parents." ...|$|E
60|$|She was all {{the more}} {{inclined}} to snap at Hall because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no means assured about him in her own mind. In {{the middle of the night}} she woke up dreaming of huge <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> like turnips, that came trailing after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes. But being a sensible woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and went to sleep again.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Crops {{belonging}} to the Brassica genus are widely grown in Turkey. Cabbages {{are one of the}} most important Brassica vegetable crops in Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine similarities and differences regarding morphological variation of <b>white</b> <b>head</b> cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata subvar. alba) genetic resources collected from different eco-geographical regions of Turkey. Data from field experiments conducted between 1999 and 2001 were analysed by multiple variance analysis. Cluster analysis based on 12 quantitative and 10 qualitative variables identified 10 groups. The dendogram was prepared to evaluate morphological similarity between the <b>white</b> <b>head</b> cabbage geno-types. Morphological variability is high among the <b>white</b> <b>head</b> cabbage genotypes of Turkey. As a con-clusion, the genotypes evaluated in this study dis-play a wide diversity of characters for selection and combination of interesting genotypes for important characters to obtain improved varieties.

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the sails were got ready, but for the present there was nothing for it but to hang on to the wreckage. The shore was some miles away, but in spite of the {{floating}} anchor the drift was great. The crew of the Furious had now time to breathe, but it was pitch dark and nothing could be seen save the <b>white</b> <b>heads</b> of the waves which now every moment threatened to overwhelm them. Not a trace of the frigate which had so hotly pursued them could be seen.|$|E
60|$|The {{water was}} rather brackish, but not {{sufficiently}} so {{to be of}} consequence. All night the boat was tossed heavily on the waves. Vincent dozed off at times, rousing himself occasionally and baling out the water, which came {{in the shape of}} spray and rain. The prospect in the morning was not cheering. Gray clouds covered the sky and seemed to come down almost on to the water, the angry sea was crested with <b>white</b> <b>heads,</b> and it seemed to Vincent wonderful that the boat should live in such a sea.|$|E
60|$|After {{getting out}} some provisions, the cooking utensils, {{and a couple}} of the candles, Godfrey {{returned}} to the boat. Then he made another journey for some more skins and the two sails. By this time the wind was blowing so fiercely that he could scarcely stagger along with his load. The sea was covered with <b>white</b> <b>heads,</b> and the waves were breaking noisily against the rocks. Luka had already brought up plenty of firewood, and had thrown a large skin over the furs containing the frozen fish, and piled stones on it to prevent its being blown away.|$|E
