5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 all-rounder Trent Johnston became Ireland's first ODI captain.

William Porterfield succeeded Johnston as Ireland's {{full-time}} captain in April 2008. On occasions when Porterfield has been unavailable, sometimes due to commitments with his county side, Kyle McCallan and Kevin O'Brien have filled the role of captain.|$|E

5|$|The Holy Bible is {{the third}} studio album by Welsh {{alternative}} rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 29 August 1994 by record label Epic. At the time the album was written and recorded, lyricist and rhythm guitarist Richey Edwards <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> severe depression, alcohol abuse, self-harm and anorexia nervosa, and its contents are considered by many sources to reflect his mental state. The songs focus on themes relating to politics and human suffering. The Holy Bible was the band's last album released before Edwards' disappearance on 1 February 1995.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} {{in the latter}} half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run football operations for the first time in several decades. The Giants on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the hiring. In 1990, Jack Mara's son, Tim, who <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> cancer at the time, sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch. This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died. His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{finished}} {{the regular season}} with 16 goals and 30 points over 62 games. Having never qualified for the playoffs with the Panthers previously in his career, Booth made his post-season debut in 2012. Playing against the Los Angeles Kings, he recorded one assist over five games as the first-seeded Canucks were eliminated in the first round. Booth told reporters prior to the playoffs that he <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> his diminished role with the Canucks, in comparison to his time with the Panthers, alluding to his ice time. The previous year, he was averaging nearly 19 minutes per game, which dropped to 15 minutes as a Canuck.|$|E

He {{felt he had}} become a {{journeyman}} footballer and lost motivation as he believed that apart from Moore, Geoff Hurst, Billy Bonds and Pop Robson, few of his teammates could play good football. Towards {{the end of his career}} with West Ham Greaves began to drink more and more alcohol, often going straight from training in Chadwell Heath to a pub in Romford, where he would remain until closing time. He later admitted that he was in the early stages of alcoholism. His final game came on 1 May 1971 in a 1–0 home defeat to Huddersfield Town. Greaves scored 13 goals in 40 games in all competitions for West Ham.|$|E
5|$|Kuntz {{was out of}} {{baseball}} in 1986, working for the United Parcel Service. He worked as a coach in the Houston Astros organization during the 1987 and 1988 seasons, then moved to the Seattle Mariners. With Seattle, {{he served as a}} first-base coach between 1989 and 1992. Kuntz joined the Florida Marlins organization in 1993 as a minor league baserunning and outfield coach. He became the team's first-base coach after the 1994 season. In 1997, Kuntz moved into a role as roving instructor with the Marlins organization. In August of that year he worked on defensive skills with Gary Sheffield when the major league slugger <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> injuries.|$|E
5|$|Pick had {{not been}} well for some years.

He died at his home, 15 Wildwood Road, Golders Green, on 7 November 1941 from a cerebral haemorrhage. His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 11 November 1941 and a memorial service was held at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square on 13 November 1941.|$|E

Navy and Marine Corps fighters, reaping the benefits of their TOPGUN program, immediately enjoyed considerable success. In contrast by June, as Olds had predicted, the Air Force's fighter community <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> a nearly 1:1kill-loss ratio. To the new Inspector General, Lt Gen , Olds offered to take a voluntary reduction in rank to colonel so he could return to operational command and straighten out the situation. Olds decided to leave the Air Force when the offer was refused (he was offered another inspection tour instead) and he retired on June 1, 1973.|$|E
5|$|At mid-season, Zürich {{newspaper}} Sport {{ranked the}} top 15 European players, and listed Cochet first (Borotra second, Brugnon ninth). At that time Cochet <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> a shoulder injury. For the 50th {{anniversary of the}} Wiener Park Club of Vienna a tournament was organized with an international line-up. The two biggest contenders Cochet and Roderich Menzel met in the final, Cochet made a comeback from one set down to lift the trophy. He then toured Europe to give exhibitions in Cluj-Napoca, Budapest and Prague. Because of fever and a sore throat Cochet missed the French Championships. He did not recover from his illness before the second Italian International Championships but this did not prevent Cochet from signing up for the competition. With titleholder Tilden having turned professional and Cochet's condition, the championships went easily to George Patrick Hughes. Cochet entered the finals of the doubles too, but his partner André Merlin couldn't make up for Cochet's bad shape and they lost to Alberto Del Bono and singles victor Hughes.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} {{event of the}} 2016/17 season in Ruka, Finland, Prevc, who was leading after the first series, fell upon landing in the second series and {{finished}} third. His brother Domen scored his first World Cup victory at that occasion. Throughout December, Prevc <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> his jumps, fell again upon landing at the first event in Engelberg and did not reach the final round at the second event. After the Four Hill Tournament, where he finished 14th, Prevc skipped the events in Wisla. Following the break, his results started to improve again. Prevc was the best individual of the team event in Zakopane, where Slovenian team finished third. The team event in Willingen saw, for the first time, all three Prevc brothers representing Slovenia, together with Tepeš; they finished fourth. On 11 February, he won in Sapporo for the fourth year in a row. It was a double win with Maciej Kot.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham {{also had}} doubts over their selection. Captain Len Boyd had {{for some time}} been {{suffering}} from a debilitating back problem, and relied on injections to keep him playing. He missed five of the last seven games of the season, but was passed fit on the Wednesday before the game. Fellow wing half Roy Warhurst had injured his thigh in the sixth-round match and played no further part in the season, while Badham, who damaged an ankle {{three weeks before the}} final, travelled on the Thursday {{with the rest of the}} team to their base in Twyford, Berkshire. Jeff Hall <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> a virus. When manager Turner announced his team on the eve of the match, Boyd took Warhurst's position at left-half, Badham, who had proved an able deputy in the semi-final, was omitted, and the inexperienced 22-year-old Johnny Newman came in on the right.|$|E
5|$|During the 1987–88 season, Sampson (who <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> knee {{injuries}} {{that would eventually}} end his career prematurely) {{was traded to the}} Golden State Warriors. The 1988–89 season was Olajuwon's first full season as the Rockets' undisputed leader. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37, and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. This performance was consistent with his averages of 24.8 points and 3.4 blocks. Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150). Nevertheless, the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics, 3 games to 1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid to}} late 3rd century, {{the army}} was afflicted by a {{combination}} of military disasters and of pestilence, the so-called Crisis of the Third Century. In 251–271 Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were simultaneously overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians respectively. At the same time, the Roman army <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> the effects of a devastating pandemic, probably of smallpox: the Plague of Cyprian which began in 251 and was still raging in 270, when it claimed the life of emperor Claudius II Gothicus. The evidence for an earlier pandemic, the Antonine Plague (also smallpox) indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. The armies would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire. This probably led to a steep decline in military numbers, which only recovered {{at the end of the}} century under Diocletian (r. 284–305).|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1972, Marvin Gaye was {{suffering}} from writer's block. Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point, What's Going On (1971), and the soundtrack album to the blaxploitation film Trouble Man (1972), Gaye had struggled {{to come up with}} new material after Motown Records had renegotiated a new contract with him. The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings. The deal was worth $1 million, making him the highest-earning soul artist, as well as the highest-earning black artist, at the time. He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles, following Motown-CEO Berry Gordy's move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit-based Hitsville U.S.A. (Motown Studio A) recording studio with the Hitsville West studio in Los Angeles. Amid relocation and his lack of material, Gaye <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> his conscience, as well as dealing with expectations from his wife, Gordy's sister Anna. Gaye's separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally. During this time, he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood.|$|E
5|$|Kenyon's next rise {{came about}} {{as a result of}} his {{introduction}} to the Duke of Richmond, who <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> Sir James Lowther for the control of several Parliamentary constituencies. Kenyon went with Richmond to Carlisle and Cockermouth as his lawyer, and secured the constituencies for Richmond; as a result, Richmond chose to employ Kenyon as his lawyer from then onwards. In 1780 he successfully defended Lord George Gordon for high treason, assisted by Thomas Erskine, and the resulting fame was enough to propel him further up the ranks of his profession and within the political sphere. At the same time he became friends with Lord Thurlow, and when the holder of the Chief Justiceship of Chester died that year, Thurlow ensured that it was given to Kenyon. The rise of Kenyon's work in the Court of Chancery was also attributed to his friendship with Thurlow, who as Lord Chancellor was the head of the Court.|$|E
5|$|The mid-3rd century saw {{the empire}} {{plunged into a}} {{military}} and economic crisis which almost resulted in its disintegration. It consisted {{of a series of}} military catastrophes in 251–271 when Gaul, the Alpine regions and Italy, the Balkans and the East were overrun by Alamanni, Sarmatians, Goths and Persians. At the same time, the Roman army <b>was</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>with</b> the effects of a devastating pandemic, now thought to have been smallpox, the Plague of Cyprian which began in 251 and was still raging in 270, when it claimed the life of Emperor Claudius II Gothicus (268–70). The evidence for the earlier Antonine pandemic of the late 2nd century, probably also smallpox, indicates a mortality of 15–30% in the empire as a whole. Zosimus describes the Cyprianic outbreak as even worse. The armies and, by extension, the frontier provinces where they were based (and mainly recruited), would likely have suffered deaths at the top end of the range, due to their close concentration of individuals and frequent movements across the empire.|$|E
