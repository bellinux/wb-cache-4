5|$|August 7, 1980- Hurricane Allen passes about 310miles (500km) {{south of}} Key West, Florida. The {{threat of the}} large {{hurricane}} prompts the National Hurricane Center to issue gale warnings for the Florida Keys.

5|$|The German army's rapid {{manoeuvres}} {{during the}} invasion had forced the tactical withdrawal of Yugoslav forces facing Hungarian army units and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> fighting {{between the two}} armies. The Hungarian forces advanced south to the Danube between Vukovar and the confluence with the Tisza without any real military resistance. Serb Chetnik irregulars fought isolated engagements, and the Hungarian General Staff considered irregular resistance forces to be their only significant opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates {{that there are some}} other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were (I) to determine the relationship of teacher temperament to effectiveness in the classroom and (2) to determine the relationship of the teacher's temperament to the teacher's sex, to the grade level taught, to the area taught (special education or regular education), and to the subject taught. It was hypothesized that (I) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the teacher's temperament and his effectiveness in the classroom, (2) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the teacher's temperament and sex, (3) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the teacher's temperament and the grade level he teaches (elementary or secondary), (4) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> relationship in the teacher's temperament and the area he teaches (special education or regular education), and (5) there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> relationship between the teacher's temperament and the subject he teaches...|$|R
5|$|The {{pillars of}} the {{economic}} plan were trade and fiscal budget surpluses and a high exchange rate for the United States dollar. The surplus was increased by taxes levied during de la Rúa's presidency and the devaluation which occurred during the Duhalde administration. Kirchner sought to rebuild the Argentine industrial base, public works and public services, renegotiating the operation of public services privatized by Carlos Menem and owned by foreign companies. His policies were accompanied by a nationalist rhetoric sympathetic to the poor. However, despite of the financial prosperity, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> {{decrease in the number}} of people living in poverty, which was 8 to 10 million people, or almost 25% of the country.|$|E
5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, {{more than in}} previous elections that the party had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better {{in the south of}} England.|$|E
5|$|When {{creating}} {{the music for}} the film, Snow {{had a couple of}} months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked {{the first time in the}} history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.|$|E

The study was also concerned with the effect that the use of the composition materials had on the basic typewriting skills of the students. Four null-hypotheses were tested: 1. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> difference in the basic typewriting skills between the experimental and control groups. 2. There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> difference in typewriter composition quality between the experimental and control groups. 3.

5|$|In August 2013, Yelp {{launched}} {{a series of}} town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities {{in an effort to}} address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues. A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews. The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014, most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise. According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.|$|E
5|$|In Paynes Prairie, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> {{difference}} in rate of infection {{between males and}} females, but only 4% of juveniles were infected, compared to 52% of adults. Most species of Capillaria occur in multiple hosts, but A.forresteri has been found only in the marsh rice rat, even though several other small mammals (the round-tailed muskrat, Neofiber alleni; cotton mouse, Peromyscus gossypinus; hispid cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus; and marsh rabbit, Sylvilagus palustris) occur in Paynes Prairie. The rice rat eats more animal food than any of those, and perhaps A.forresteri has an intermediate host that is not eaten by the other species. A.forresteri is markedly more prevalent in the wet season (spring) than the dry season (autumn), perhaps because rainfall patterns influence the habits of the rice rat in some way. One possibility is that the intermediate host is an earthworm or other oligochaete worm that moves to the surface when it rains.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{this part}} of Borneo, this area was once {{under the control of the}} Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence of a settlement by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, the Sultan married his son to the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an area controlled by the Sultan of Sulu.|$|E
