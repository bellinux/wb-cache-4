40|$|By {{means of}} car 2 x {{communication}} technologies (car 2 x) driver warnings can {{be presented to}} drivers quite early. However, due to their early timing they could be misunderstood by drivers, distract or even disturb them. These problems arise if, {{at the moment of}} the warning, the safety-critical situation is not yet perceivable or critical. In order to examine, when drivers want to receive early warnings {{as a function of the}} situation criticality, a driving simulator study was conducted using the two early <b>warning</b> <b>stages</b> of a multi <b>stage</b> collision <b>warning</b> system (first stage: informing the driver; second stage: prewarning the driver). The optimum timing to activate these two early <b>warning</b> <b>stages</b> was derived by examining the drivers' evaluation of these timings concerning their appropriateness and usefulness. As situational variation, drivers traveling at about 100 km/h were confronted with slow moving traffic either driving at 25 km/h or 50 km/h at the end of a rural road. In total, 24 participants were tested in a within-subjects design (12 female, 12 male; M = 26. 6 years, SD = 7. 2 years). For both stages, drivers preferred an earlier timing when approaching slow moving traffic traveling at 25 km/h (first stage: 447 m, second stage: 249 m ahead of the lead vehicle) compared to 50 km/h (first stage: 338 m, second stage: 186 m ahead of the lead vehicle). The drivers' usefulness rating also varied with the timing, spanning a range of 8 s for driver-accepted timing variations and showed correspondence to the drivers' appropriateness ratings. Based on these results and those of a previous study, a timing function for each of the two early <b>warning</b> <b>stages</b> depending on the speed difference between the safety-critical object and the host vehicle is presented. Indirectly, similar adaptations are already implemented in current collision warning systems, which use the time-to-collision to give drivers acute warnings in a later stage, when an immediate reaction of the driver may still prevent a collision. However, this study showed that drivers also favor this kind of adaptation for earlier <b>warning</b> <b>stages</b> (information and prewarning). Thus, adapting the timing according to the drivers' preferences will contribute to a better acceptance of these collision warning systems...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{evacuation}} {{models of}} buildings, neighborhoods, areas, cities and countries important psychological parameters are not frequently used. In this paper {{the relevance of}} some important variables from disaster psychology will be discussed. Modeling psychological variables will enhance prediction of human behavior during evacuations. John Leach’s Dynamic Disaster Model describes three phases and five stages: A Pre-impact phase (Threat Stage and <b>Warning</b> <b>Stage),</b> an Impact phase, and a Post-impact phase (Recoil Stage, Rescue Stage and Post-traumatic Stage). In each phase and stage specific human behavior has been {{supposed to be a}} psychological response to a disaster. These responses are remarkably consistent and transferable across kinds of disasters. Evacuation happens during Pre-impact phase, Impact phase and Post-impact phase (Recoil Stage and, or Rescue Stage). People’s cognitive and emotional states and overt behavior will be very different across the phases. During the Pre-impact phase risk estimation is very low, so evacuation is not seen as an inevitable action. Heavy stress and denial of life-threatening events during the Impact phase will hinder effective evacuation. Inactivity, apathy and childlike dependency on other people during the Recoil Stage will restrain survivors from active evacuation. Evacuation models will be more effective if phases and accompanying human behavior are taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The Pacific Ocean is the {{location}} where two-thirds of tsunamis have occurred, {{resulting in a}} great number of casualties. Once information on an earthquake has been issued, {{it is important to understand}} if there is a tsunami generation risk in relation with a specific earthquake magnitude or focal depth. This study proposes a Tsunamigenic Ratio (TR) that is defined as the ratio between the number of earthquake-generated tsunamis and the total number of earthquakes. Earthquake and tsunami data used in this study were selected from a database containing tsunamigenic earthquakes from prior 1900 to 2011. The TR is calculated from earthquake events with a magnitude greater than 5. 0, a focal depth shallower than 200 km and a sea depth less than 7 km. The results suggest that a great earthquake magnitude and a shallow focal depth have a high potential to generate tsunamis with a large tsunami height. The average TR in the Pacific Ocean is 0. 4, whereas the TR for specific regions of the Pacific Ocean varies from 0. 3 to 0. 7. The TR calculated for each region shows the relationship between three influential parameters: earthquake magnitude, focal depth and sea depth. The three parameters were combined and proposed as a dimensionless parameter called the Tsunami Index (TI). TI can express better relationship with the TR and with maximum tsunami height, while the three parameters mentioned above cannot. The results show that recent submarine earthquakes had a higher potential to generate a tsunami with a larger tsunami height than during the last century. A tsunami is definitely generated if the TI is larger than 7. 0. The proposed TR and TI will help ascertain the tsunami generation risk of each earthquake event based on a statistical analysis of the historical data and could be an important decision support tool during the early tsunami <b>warning</b> <b>stage...</b>|$|E

40|$|In the United Kingdom the {{evacuation}} of cities {{has not been a}} recent concern although incidents such as floods or acts of terrorism have meant that cities have had to be partially evacuated. Whether the area to be evacuated is a city district, a whole city or even a city region the way in which people behave and how they choose to share and receive information is paramount. In the pre and <b>warning</b> <b>stages</b> of an evacuation people will behave in different ways. Some individuals might have access to rumours that a crisis is about to occur (we call these weak signals) and start evacuating before the official order to do so. Others might have no access to information, may decide to act only when others do, or even ignore official warnings and remain in their homes (as was the case with Hurricane Katrina). During {{the evacuation}} there will also be communication between the authorities and emergency services and even between evacuees who might communicate through mobile telephones or social networks (such as twitter). Even {{at the end of the}} evacuation individuals will be making decisions about what to do (to stay in the evacuation zone or return to the city) and will stay in touch with others. In this project we consider that the ways in which individuals might behave in evacuations can be described using mathematical models and theories. One way of describing how people act as a collective is through agent based models, where individuals influence others information and behaviour, and another is game theory, where individual's decisions are strategic. By combining these we can predict how individuals might behave in an evacuation and determine the ways in which the emergency services and local responders might influence social networks and communication to help individuals and businesses evacuate safely and effectively. Of course, we anticipate that individuals might have access to new technologies in terms of communication so part of the project will look at how this may change the dynamics of evacuation. The project is informed throughout by current practice and will inform policy. Three cities (London, Birmingham and Carlisle) are chosen as case studies of how real evacuations might be assisted by the project. We will look at the evacuation plans in each of these cities, conduct focus groups and expert interviews with relevant parties, and analyse the use of social networks in actual evacuation or crisis events. Stakeholder groups will comment on the models which we produce and feedback as to how they can be adapted to work in practice. The results of the project will feed into how real evacuations work and inform the strategies and technologies used. We will produce both an interim and final report from the project and our impact plan will make sure that relevant parties are informed about the project and its results. One example of how the project might be useful is in terms of informing emergency planners and services in cities. If these planners know how social networks and mobile communications are used in an evacuation then they can tailor their messages accordingly. If, for example, there are two roads out of a city and analysis of social networks and traffic flow shows that individuals are intending to use the first road which would cause congestion then they can decide what sort of message would best direct people towards the second road, how long it would take to propagate and what effect it might have. In another example, road signs do not often give real time information about what is happening, which might be crucial during an evacuation. By using electronic and ambient signage not only can a message be sent but the effect of the message can be judged...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{opportunities and}} challenges {{that are associated with}} using sensors in civil engineering and proposes strategies for interpretation of sensor data. Opportunities include increased decision support and better modeling possibilities. Such opportunities have the potential to lead to safer, longer-lasting and innovative civil systems. Challenges include appropriate characterization of sensors, development of systematic methodologies for design of sensor systems, data interpretation and decision support. Meeting these challenges successfully requires consideration of the measurement context. Four contextual categories for sensor utilization are defined as follows: support during construction <b>stages,</b> <b>warning</b> of extreme events, system identification and experimental research. Regardless of the context, advances in model-based diagnosis have created the potential for reliable and robust computer support in many situations. A new methodology for sensor system design using entropy is presented and a model based approach for structural diagnosis is used to illustrate the potential of multi-model reasoning. Use of multiple models and consideration of contextual parameters are important for making the most of the opportunities that are available. The final conclusion of the paper is derived using an analogy of the paper title with the film “Sex, lies and videotape ” It is necessary to go beyond being dazzled by the technology of sensors (sex) and the misuse of engineering models (lies) so that the interpretations we derive from combining the two (videotape) are as useful as possible...|$|R

The project goal is to develop a system that can issue <b>warnings</b> at different <b>stages</b> of criticality - from an early informative message to an imminent hazard warning shortly before a crash. Two experiments have already been carried out and published that describe elements of an innovative audio-visual HMI including new features like visual attractors distributed in the drivers field of view and acoustic hybricons (a fusion of earcons and auditory icons). This paper focuses on a third experiment that has been carried out in a driving simulator with 24 participants in December 2009 in order to evaluate the complete audio-visual SAFESPOT HMI. Comfort, Safety and Critical warnings where applied in three scenarios as Frontal Collision Warnings and Road Condition Status Warnings. The results show that Comfort warnings cause no sudden reactions like braking or lane change, however they lead to a speed reduction in uncertain environments like fog or slippery roads. Driving with warnings show clear advantages in terms of earlier speed reduction and fewer collisions for warned drivers. Subjective ratings are overall positive in terms of acceptance.
