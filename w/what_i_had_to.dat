500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have to hear this stuff'. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E

Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say."

500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Essence magazine, Beyoncé explained that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is [...] "broad" [...] and different from her previous releases {{because it is not}} a traditional R song. She added, [...] "I had to try it, because I remember Aretha Franklin said a great singer can sing anything and make it her own." [...] Beyoncé was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer. While preparing her third solo album, Beyoncé wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people to hear my voice and hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say." ...|$|E

Physically, of course, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task.

2500|$|In May 1896, the English {{translation}} of Der Judenstaat appeared in London as The Jewish State.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety.

But it'd been growing in me for several years, so <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do then was just sit and write everything down," [...] he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier [...] "Oblomov's Dream", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.|$|E

2500|$|Rivera earned {{straight}} A's {{in school}} until her sophomore year, when at 15 {{she became pregnant}} with the first of her five children, Janney [...] "Chiquis" [...] Marín-Rivera. She supported {{the two of them}} by selling CDs at flea markets, while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian. Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, but my counselors told me there was no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise." [...] She attended California State University, Long Beach, and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before going to work for her father's record label.|$|E
2500|$|... "Through some slip-up in the {{apparatus}} in Moscow, {{which was supposed}} to be bureaucratically airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{everything}} about the performance or the play was considered convincing. The supporting players were conceded to be weak. The large number of corpses on the stage in the final scene was found {{by many to be}} laughable. But Hamlet's interaction with the ghost of his father, the play-within-the-play, Hamlet's conflict with his mother, Ophelia's mad scene, and the scene with the gravediggers were all found to be amazing and powerful. The moment in the Play Scene when Claudius rises up and interrupts the proceedings, then rushes from the stage, provoked a long and enthusiastic ovation. The journal Pandore wrote about [...] "that English candour which allows everything to be expressed and everything to be depicted, and for which nothing in nature is unworthy of imitation by drama". Dumas felt the play and the performances provided him [...] "what I was searching for, what I lacked, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find [...] actors forgetting they were on stage [...] actual speech and gesture such as made actors creatures of God, with their own virtues, passions and weaknesses, not wooden, impossible heroes booming sonorous platitudes".|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, {{her talent}} {{led to a}} {{contract}} with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who gave {{her work as a}} backing vocalist for their R boy band Immature, and arranged the production of a demo tape. In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood's parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for the company's director of A Darryl Williams. To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I felt bad for everybody else but me. It was a good thing, because I could do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do, because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player. [...] "I've spent 11½ years in the minor leagues, I have a mortgage and two kids to feed", he told the Sporting News in 1995. [...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I {{had to take care of}} my family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible. [...] To put myself in the same shoes with guys off the street made me sick.

2500|$|In May 2007, Cashis {{released}} the eight-track The County Hound EP {{in an attempt}} to have people [...] "fiend" [...] for his music, or garner interest in it. The album was released as a limited edition EP. September saw the release of 50 Cent's third album with the label, Curtis, which was involved in a well publicized competition with rapper Kanye West, who had his third album, Graduation set for release on the same day. In June 2008, Obie Trice departed from the label. A misunderstanding was made where it was believed he was attacking the label and Eminem on a single titled [...] "The Giant" [...] but they were quickly dismissed. In a statement, Paul Rosenberg stated [...] "Shady Records has agreed to allow Obie Trice to pursue his craft in a different forum free from the constraints of the current major label model [...] Eminem will continue to support and work with Obie on many levels of his career [...] He remains a close friend and member of the Shady family." [...] In a 2012 interview, Obie opened up on the topic, admitting having issues with Interscope Records chairman Jimmy Iovine, which was Trice's fault, clarifying [...] "I was kind of reckless, not on time, certain things and [...] didn't want to further the project with me so we tried to work it out but it just didn’t come to a head so I had to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] before going on to note that his relationship with the label is great, and he continues to work with Eminem, notably on Bottoms Up, which was to be released originally on Shady Records.|$|E
