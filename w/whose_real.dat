Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, <b>whose</b> <b>real</b> identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the possible {{complexity of the}} set of reals belonging to an inner model M of set theory.

On the other hand, {{it is possible to}} have an inner model M <b>whose</b> <b>reals</b> are an uncountable Fσ set and which does not have all reals. A similar construction shows that there can be an inner model M which computes correctly ℵ 1, contains a perfect set of reals as a subset and yet not all reals are in M.
