5|$|The Cologne War, 1583–1589, was {{triggered}} by the 1582 conversion of the Archbishop-Prince Elector of Cologne, Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, to Calvinism, and his subsequent marriage to Agnes of Mansfeld-Eisleben in 1583. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to relinquish the Electorate, a faction of clerics in the Cologne Cathedral chapter elected another archbishop, Ernst of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach.|$|E

Thomas also attended the trial for rebellion of the Bishop of Durham, William de St-Calais, Thomas' sole suffragan, or bishop subordinate to York. During William II's reign Thomas once more {{became involved in the}} dispute with Canterbury over the primacy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to consecrate the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm, if Anselm was named the Primate of England in the consecration service. After William II's sudden death in 1100, Thomas arrived too late to crown King HenryI, and died soon after the coronation.|$|E
5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led {{a boycott}} of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black or Asian drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October, Maruyama's forces {{struggled}} {{through the jungle}} to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused,</b> Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shoji, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that {{the left and right}} wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October.

5|$|Oswaldo Payá {{was born}} on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, {{he was sentenced to}} three years of hard labor on Isla de Pinos <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service. While there, he discovered a locked Catholic church, Nuestra Señora de Dolores, that received permission from the Bishop of Havana to reopen as a mission, giving religious talks and caring for the sick.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Anjouan (code-named Operation Democracy in Comoros), on March 25, 2008, was an amphibious assault {{led by the}} Comoros, backed by African Union (AU) forces, including troops from Sudan, Tanzania, Senegal, along with logistical support from Libya and France. The objective of the invasion was to topple Colonel Mohamed Bacar's leadership in Anjouan, an island part of the Union of Comoros, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to step down after a disputed 2007 election, {{in defiance of the}} federal government and the AU. The Comoros archipelago in the Indian Ocean has had a fractious history since independence from France in 1975, experiencing more than 20 coups or attempted coups.|$|E
5|$|Upon Andronikos's death, two factions emerged at court: the {{supporters}} of Kantakouzenos, chiefly provincial magnates from Macedonia and Thrace, and those opposed to him, led mainly by the Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, who obtained the support of Andronikos's widow, Anna of Savoy. Kantakouzenos did not claim the throne for himself, but demanded the regency, based on his close association with the deceased emperor, and {{with the support of}} the capital's troops secured it. His position, however, was weakened by the adherence of Apokaukos to the Patriarch's camp; Kantakouzenos, in his own account, relates that Apokaukos had urged him to seize the throne in hopes of his own advancement, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused,</b> the powerful chancellor switched over to his opponents' camp.|$|E

After the wedding, the pasha offers the narrator his freedom under the condition that he convert to Islam. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>refuses,</b> a mock execution is staged to pressure him. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>refuses</b> even then, the pasha commends him and ridicules him for his stubbornness, before turning him over to Hoja’s custody.|$|R
5|$|Gadret rode {{both the}} Giro and the Tour in 2010, an {{arrangement}} {{which resulted in}} some controversy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to grant Roche, the squad's leader for the race, his wheel after the Irishman had punctured at a particularly inopportune time. This coupled with Gadret's recuperation after the extremely difficult Giro, and his admission that he prefers the Italian Grand Tour in any event, led to speculation {{as to whether the}} two would both be named to the squad. He claimed he would ride only to support Roche, if he rode at all. Lavenu stated that Gadret's impressive Giro had grown his standing with the team, and that the feud between him and Roche had been forgotten, so he hoped Gadret would ride the Tour. Confident of his recovery abilities, Gadret did indeed start the Tour.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E
5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running roughshod over judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E

5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They {{asked if he was}} gay, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the furtherance of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|John {{was deeply}} {{suspicious}} of the barons, particularly those with sufficient power and wealth to potentially challenge the king. Numerous barons were subjected to John's malevolentia, even including William Marshal, a famous knight and baron normally held up {{as a model of}} utter loyalty. The most infamous case, which went beyond anything considered acceptable at the time, was that of William de Braose, a powerful marcher lord with lands in Ireland. De Braose was subjected to punitive demands for money, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to pay a huge sum of 40,000 marks (equivalent to £26,666 at the time), his wife and one of his sons were imprisoned by John, which resulted in their deaths. De Braose died in exile in 1211, and his grandsons remained in prison until 1218. John's suspicions and jealousies meant that he rarely enjoyed good relationships with even the leading loyalist barons.|$|E
5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>refused</b> to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident. Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
