5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul never said one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him.|$|E

25|$|Kazuma is a 16-year-old game-obsessed shut-in, {{becoming}} one after having his heart broken by his childhood friend in middle school. While {{returning home from}} buying a video game, he attempted to save a classmate from being hit by what he believed was a truck (which {{turned out to be}} a tractor that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> beforehand), but went through acute stress reaction and died. As a result, he is sent to the parallel reality and becomes a role-playing game character. He has average stats in crucial categories, but above average intelligence and extremely high luck, neither of which are important for adventurers. Regardless, he becomes one and learns basic skills such as stealing, archery, monster detection, and magic.|$|E
500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, she told a male interviewer that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> giving interviews to female reporters because, in her own words, [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time". What {{has been seen as}} a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
500|$|Ralf Schumacher said, [...] "I'm {{more than}} happy; {{we have been}} strong here the whole weekend and my car behaved perfectly. I had a little moment of worry about six laps from the end when the {{throttle}} didn't seem to pick up properly and I thought the engine <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> but it came back and all was well." [...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous". Verstappen said that he struggled with his car's balance, which resulted in oversteer. He was [...] "happy to go home", because [...] "it's not been a good weekend." [...] Frentzen said that although {{he was happy to}} score points, he had hoped for a better finish.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Isobel, [...] "that's {{always the}} way; one is never left at leisure to follow one's own fancies in this world. To-morrow, for instance, {{my father and}} all his horrible friends--I don't know any of them, except one, but from past {{experience}} I presume them to be horrible--are coming down <b>to</b> lunch, and <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> for three days' partridge shooting. Their female belongings <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> also, or some of them are, which means that I shall have to look after them." ...|$|R

The team was unsure if the USAir 737 <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> before it collided with their plane. [...] The Canucks were shaken by the experience and lost to the Kings by a score of 9–1, their worst loss of the 1990–91 season.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Cutler {{explained}} {{his decision to}} use the Angels. [...] "I was talking with them, because I {{was interested in the}} security of my band—everyone's security, for that matter. In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. They were the only people who were strong and together. [...] because it was descending into absolute chaos. [...] Who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> it?" [...] Grateful Dead manager Rock Scully said that if the Angels hadn't been on the stage, [...] "that whole crowd could have easily passed out, and rolled down onto the stage. There was no barrier." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{travelers}} {{described what}} they saw during the attack to reporters. One man stated, [...] "We came right to international departures and saw the man randomly shooting. He was just firing at anyone coming in front of him. He was wearing all black. His face was not masked. I was 50 meters away from him." [...] He continued, [...] "We ducked behind a ticket counter but I stood up and watched him. Two explosions went off shortly after one another. By that time he had stopped shooting." [...] Lastly he said [...] "He turned around and started coming towards us. He was holding his gun inside his jacket. He looked around anxiously {{to see if anyone}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> him and then went down the escalator ... We heard some more gunfire and then another explosion, and then it was over." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Friedkin {{cited by}} Kachmar, his artistic {{intent was to}} shoot the entire film without [...] "sentiment" [...] or [...] "melodrama", {{rendering}} it completely devoid of [...] "heartfelt moments". [...] Friedkin's oeuvre has been frequently noted by critics for its lack of [...] "clear-cut heroes or villains", and the director himself admitted that he believes in neither. Thus, he envisioned all four principal characters to be anti-heroes and [...] "hard to 'root for'". Friedkin felt very confident about himself at the time, thinking he was [...] "bulletproof [...] nothing <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> [...] ", and felt he [...] "could take an audience through this with not the most likable people on Earth." [...] The director also stated that the line [...] "action is character" [...] from F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby served as an inspiration for him in all the movies he made, including Sorcerer.|$|E
2500|$|The series' {{stunt man}} and stunt {{arranger}} Ray Austin expressed {{the opinion that}} the show's violence ultimately harmed its popular success in the United States. There The Avengers was given a late timeslot due to its violence. [...] "They did that with the first Avengers here , with Diana Rigg. They put us on at 11:30 pm on CBS , {{because it was too}} violent." [...] Austin goes on to explain that U.S. television follows a [...] "different code". Austin said that on The Avengers [...] "we were determined to do the show our way, the English way, and no one <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> us! And, indeed, no one did stop us. We never, never got to prime time. And it was our own faults, because we would not comply to the Midwest. That's where the money comes from in this country, nowhere else. Forget Los Angeles, forget New York—you have to aim for the Midwest. If the Midwest watches your show, you've made it." [...] In fact the first and second series of Emma Peel episodes mainly aired at 10:00 pm on ABC. The final Rigg episodes and all the Linda Thorson episodes mainly ran at 7:30 pm, also on ABC.|$|E
2500|$|Stalin did {{not know}} that Hitler had been {{secretly}} discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since summer 1940, [...] and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the East regardless of the parties talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis Power. [...] He had ignored German economic naysayers, and told Hermann Göring [...] "that everyone on all sides was always raising economic misgivings against a threatening war with Russia. From now onwards he wasn't going to listen to any more of that kind of talk and from now on he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> up his ears in order to get his peace of mind." [...] This was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had been preparing reports on the negative economic consequences of a Soviet invasion—that it would be a net economic drain unless it was captured intact. Given Hitler's latest demands regarding negative advice, Thomas revised his report. [...] Reich Finance Minister Schwerin-Krosigk also opposed an invasion, arguing that Germany would lose grain because of Soviet scorched-earth policies, lack of effective Soviet transport and the loss of production labor with a German attack in the East. [...] Schnurre agreed with the economic loss assessment.|$|E
