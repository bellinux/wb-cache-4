5|$|In August 1938, Lewis {{quit his}} job at the Ottawa law firm of Smart and Biggar to work {{full-time}} as the CCF National Secretary. His starting salary was $1,200 per year, a low sum of money, even at that time, for a job <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> responsibility.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1913 he {{was posted}} to No. 3 Squadron RFC. He managed a flight in a Blériot {{aircraft}} while there and gradually won {{a reputation as}} a first-rate mechanic. By Christmas his frequent requests for trips in the aircraft had met <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> success that McCudden had logged nearly 30 hours, mostly in the Blériot monoplanes. On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to Air Mechanic First Class.|$|E

But me think it hath a fault, whiche is, that a man may be to couning at it, for who ever will be {{excellent}} in the playe of chestes, I beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it, and applie it <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> study, that a man may assoone learne some noble scyence, or compase any other matter of importaunce, and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure, he knoweth no more but a game.

5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became what to do <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> extra money. Teamster Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year {{at a time when}} members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is as dangerous as looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E

5|$|While the C9 {{project was}} well advanced, PSA {{already had a}} crowded lineup in the large vehicle segment, {{including}} the legendary Citroën CX, the slow-selling Peugeot 604 and the newly launched Peugeot 505. But <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> having already been invested in the project, PSA decided to press ahead and complete the development of C9, albeit with modifications to allow the use of shared parts with other PSA models. The Simca {{double wishbone front suspension}} gave way to MacPherson struts adopted from the Peugeot 505 and 604, and the rear axle was replaced with that of the 505, much narrower than the one originally planned, as it was designed with respect to the 505 body width. The C9 front end was extended to accommodate the optional PRV engine: now that the model belonged to PSA, using the PRV presented no problems.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, you have to deal <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, at a Draffenville, Kentucky tournament {{game against}} Oak Hill Academy, Alexander scored 26 of his teams 39 points on 12–14 field goal {{shooting}} in a 72–39 defeat. On December 29, Curie again faced Parker and Simeon in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament (this {{time in the}} semifinals). Alexander posted 21 points on 9–10 field goal shooting, but Simeon still prevailed 62–57. Notably, Parker assumed Alexander as a defensive assignment after Alexander gave Curie a 48–47 lead with 4:58 time remaining and Alexander went scoreless {{the rest of the}} game. Despite 11 points, 9 rebounds and 8 blocked shots from Alexander, Curie was eliminated from the CPL playoffs in a February 11 quarterfinals 60–58 loss to the Billy Garrett, Jr.-led Morgan Park High School that went on to become 2013 IHSA Class 3A state champion. On February 26, the Associated Press Illinois Class 4A basketball rankings showed Whitney Young at number 1, and it was also expected that Young's road to the sectional finals would include a March 6 meeting with Curie. According to Henricksen, the March 6 state playoff meeting between Young and Curie was anticipated because it would pit Okafor against Alexander, making it the most highly touted IHSA playoff matchup of centers since 1988 when LaPhonso Ellis led East Saint Louis' Lincoln High School against Eric Anderson's St. Francis de Sales High School. Mike Helfgot of the Chicago Tribune said that there have not been many matchups between big men this good <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at stake. On March 2, Alexander attended Senior night at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign's Assembly Hall. The February 2013 Great Plains blizzard caused controversial postponements of several IHSA games including the March 6 Young-Curie game, which was delayed one day. Young defeated Curie 62–58 as the supporting cast made up for Alexander's 14–13 scoring edge over Okafor.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{silicone}} hydrogels became available. These {{materials have}} both the extremely high oxygen permeability of silicone and the comfort and clinical {{performance of the}} conventional hydrogels.

Lenses have now been developed <b>with</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> oxygen permeability that they are approved for overnight wear (extended wear). Lenses approved for daily wear are also available in silicone hydrogel materials.|$|E
