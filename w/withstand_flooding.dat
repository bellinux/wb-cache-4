25|$|Due to {{concerns}} about the original dam capacity to <b>withstand</b> <b>floods</b> and a projected increase in demand for water by the agricultural industry in the region, Wyangala Dam was upgraded and enlarged from 1961 to 1971. Housing for the workers and their families was provided in temporary demountable dwellings within the village. At this time and also during the 1935 dam build, utilitarian construction prevailed, giving Wyangala no dwellings of historical note.|$|R

50|$|Iowa was {{the state}} most {{affected}} by the Flood of 1851. Flooding in Iowa was probably exacerbated because the Des Moines River basin, where {{the worst of the}} flooding occurred, had been settled for less than 10 years. Residents had never previously experienced a major flood, and river towns lacked levees and substantial bridges that could <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding.</b>|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Netherlands is a low-lying {{country which}} has to protect itself against {{flooding}} from the sea and its rivers. Reliable flood defenses are essential {{for the safety of}} the country. The sea dikes are designed to <b>withstand</b> <b>floods</b> with a height of once every 10, 000 years. This height is used to be calculated using statistics on sea levels measured along the Dutch coast since 1880. In this paper new calculations will be presented taking account of known sea floods in the period before 1880. A Bayesian framework has been developed for this. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inundation {{effects on}} terrestrially hibernating Bufo bufo and B. calamita are reported.

In a floodplain eight telemetrically monitored B. bufo <b>withstood</b> <b>flooding</b> {{during a period of}} 25 - 35 days without leaving their hibernation sites. After this period the emerging toads suffered mortality by floating down the river depending on the water level at the moment of emerging.

5000|$|The lower {{three levels}} of the tower served as the living {{quarters}} for the keepers and his assistants complete with kitchen, living room and bedrooms. The tower was designed to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding</b> from storm surges that accompany strong hurricanes by making {{the entrance to the}} tower on the third floor, accessible by an outdoor stairway (the ground level door was later added in the 1930s). [...] This was tested in 1871 when a strong storm submerged the station. The lighthouse and its keepers survived but the lamp oil and their drinking water were spoiled by the flood.|$|E
5000|$|Cement, lime or bitumen {{stabilization}} {{can allow}} clay soil to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding</b> or allow sands {{to be used}} in traditional bags with a non-structural plaster skin. Because earthbag walls are usually 38 cm (15") thick a large amount of stabilizer is needed. Thermal insulating properties are important for climates that experience temperature extremes. The thermal insulating value of a material is directly related to both the porosity of the material and the thickness of the wall. Crushed volcanic rock, pumice or rice hulls yield higher insulation value than clay or sand. Untreated organic materials that could decay should not be used as part of a structural wall, although they can be used as infill.|$|E
50|$|The Sadliers Crossing Railway Bridge, {{opened in}} 1902, is {{important}} in demonstrating {{the evolution of the}} railway network in Queensland. This rail network, established in the 1860s, was vital {{for the development of the}} colony through opening land for closer settlement and freighting produce and resources to Queensland's ports. From the 1890s the preferred design of large metal rail bridges to cross major waterways underwent several changes, to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding</b> and to meet increased load requirements. Early bridges and track on the Main Line from Brisbane to the Darling Downs, which was one of Queensland's most important lines, were upgraded to accommodate heavier, more powerful engines as freight traffic and tonnage increased from the 1890s. Sadliers Crossing Bridge, replacing an 1875 bridge, was built as part of this upgrading.|$|E

5000|$|Bonneville Lock and Dam [...] {{consists}} of several run-of-the-river dam structures that together complete {{a span of}} the Columbia River between the U.S. states of Oregon and Washington at River Mile 146.1. The dam is located 40 mi east of Portland, Oregon, in the Columbia River Gorge. The primary functions of Bonneville Lock and Dam are electrical power generation and river navigation. The dam was built and is managed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. At {{the time of its}} construction in the 1930s it was the largest water impoundment project of its type in the nation, able to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding</b> on an unprecendented scale. Electrical power generated at Bonneville is distributed by the Bonneville Power Administration. Bonneville Lock and Dam is named for Army Capt. Benjamin Bonneville, an early explorer credited with charting much of the Oregon Trail. The Bonneville Dam Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987.|$|E

If the female has already mated or does not want to mate, she will vibrate her wings and then the male will leave. [...] Females lay their eggs singly on the {{underside}} of host plant leaves a few inches above the bog surface.

40|$|Bulk {{carriers}} {{are subject to}} SOLAS regulations concerning the structural integrity of hold No. 1. SOLAS Chapter XII Regulation 6 mandates that the transverse watertight bulkhead between the two foremost holds and double bottom of the foremost hold shall have sufficient strength to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding</b> of the first hold. This regulation applies to all single-skin bulk carriers of 150 m in length and upwards constructed before 1 July 1999. IACS provides rules {{for the construction of}} these areas of such vessels in order to comply with SOLAS Chapter XII. This paper presents a methodology for modelling hold No. 1 of bulk carriers using finite elements in order to assess the structural integrity of these areas under the loads prescribed by IACS. Results from respective nonlinear analyses using IACS loads are also presented. Â© 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Climate Change (CC) {{increasingly}} affects {{cities in}} low-elevation coastal zones, and households in low-income areas in particular. This {{article focuses on}} local CC adaptation and governance in Trinidad and Tobago. First, it investigates the capacity of a poor urban community to adapt to CC, by examining the local impacts of and responses to flooding. Second, {{based on interviews with}} a selection of local stakeholders, the article sheds light on the institutional barriers preventing {{the development and implementation of}} effective CC adaptation strategies. The data show that households in the case study community experience the impacts of changing climatic conditions, in particular flooding. Households implement a wide range of adaptive measures before, during and after floods. It was revealed that the case study community receives very limited institutional support to <b>withstand</b> <b>flooding.</b> Looking at the different levels of CC adaptation governance in Trinidad and Tobago it can be concluded that although the institutional architecture to support local CC adaptation seems to cover all governance levels, vertical linkages between the various levels have to be strengthened to bridge the gap between community-based and national-level adaptation planning. The main institutional challenges are the lack of coordination and communication between the relevant actors...|$|E
