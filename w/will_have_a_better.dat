The summer and spring seasons are the most popular with tourists, keeping many of town's residents employed directly and indirectly. The town—earlier an important trade post between India and Tibet—hopes to boost its economy after the reopening of the Nathu La (pass) in April 2006.

25|$|These new {{developments}} mark {{a milestone in}} expanding {{the role of the}} government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E

500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A., English (Literature)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. Despite {{her early}} {{experiments}} with the epistolary form, none of Jane Austen???s published novels {{are in the}} epistolary form. However, all of Austen???s novels contain letters, {{many of which are}} crucial {{to the development of the}} story. This paper will explore the role and function of letters in Austen's novels. Looking closely at each letter, we will see how Austen uses letters to reveal character and advance plot. We will also see how writing letters gives Austen???s characters a rhetorical voice, and how letters forge communication when it is otherwise impossible (not only physically, but socially and emotionally as well). Finally, we will explore how letters can lead characters to self-knowledge. By looking at how letters function in Austen???s novels, we <b>will</b> not only <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of her characters, but we <b>will</b> also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the role and significance of letters in Austen???s time.
