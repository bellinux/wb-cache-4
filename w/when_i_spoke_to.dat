2500|$|On September 27, 1912, Scott {{was promised}} {{a ride in}} one of Flying Field's {{airplanes}} by [...] First Lieutenant Lewis C. Rockwell. [...] Retired Captain Bernard Rome spoke with Corporal Scott the same day and noted that [...] "He was in high spirits <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him," [...] and that, with regards to his flight the next day, [...] "...Scott jokingly referred to himself as 'ballast'." [...] Corporal Scott had secured the ride on the aircraft {{as opposed to what}} would normally be an officer's position because of his low weight — having never fully recovered from his illness of 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his solo {{success and}} {{previous}} issues with band members, Morrissey still {{expressed interest in}} a Smiths reunion. On 22 December 1988, Morrissey, Andy Rourke, Mike Joyce and Craig Gannon performed to a sold out Wolverhampton Civic Hall. This would serve as his first solo show, and also the last Smiths live show ever. Many of those in attendance had waited for days to gain admission. After Viva Hate, Morrissey put out two new singles; [...] "The Last of the Famous International Playboys" [...] was about the Kray twins, gangsters who operated in London's East End, and reached number 6 on the UK singles chart. This was followed by [...] "Interesting Drug", which reached number 9. After his songwriting partnership with Street ended {{and was replaced by}} Alan Winstanley and Clive Langer, he recorded [...] "Ouija Board, Ouija Board", released as a single in November 1989; it reached number 18. Christian spokespeople and tabloid newspapers condemned the song, claiming that it promoted occultism, to which Morrissey responded that [...] "the only contact I ever made with the dead was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> a journalist from The Sun." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What matter, Holy One?--but {{remember}} {{it is only}} for a night or two. Remember, I can change swiftly. It will all be as it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> thee under Zam-Zammah the great gun--' ...|$|R
60|$|I had not {{lifted my}} veil <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the woman, {{which was at}} the moment of our going in. The boy {{staggered}} up instantly and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror.|$|R

2500|$|Rowling {{herself was}} {{supportive}} of Watson {{after her first}} screen test. When asked if she thought actors suited the characters, Rowling said, [...] "Yes, I did. Emma Watson in particular was very, very like Hermione <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her, <b>I</b> knew she was perfect from that first phone call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say," [...] I replied, still endeavouring to be prudent, {{though my}} heart was on fire and my words <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> seemed <b>to</b> choke me. [...] "But, Dolores, if you would shed your blood to win one strong arm, will you think it too much to bestow the favour <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of {{in the hope of}} winning an arm?" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{am writing}} to {{apologize}} to The New Yorker and Stacy Schiff, and to give some follow-up concerning Ryan Jordan (Editors' Note, March 5). <b>When</b> <b>I</b> last <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> The New Yorker {{about the fact that}} a prominent Wikipedia community member had lied about his credentials, I misjudged the issue. It was not O.K. for Mr. Jordan, or Essjay, to lie to a reporter, even to protect his identity.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts, {{in spite}} of Campbell's dumb-show inciting him to fiction: [...] "I--I--if you will kindly step apart here, I can explain. I was very {{confused}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. McIlheny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I, Runkoor, but I am disguised. I {{was like}} this <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you through the window a {{fortnight}} since, but you could not then see my figure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Woe's me!" [...] said Jeanie, [...] "she {{never spoke}} {{to me on the}} subject, but grat sorely <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her about her altered looks, and the change on her spirits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said he, [...] "I {{have been}} aware that his majesty {{has not been the}} same to me {{for more than a week}} past. If it was about the princess, pray tell his majesty that I meant nothing ill <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of her <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have just}} {{returned}} from his bedside, after telling him of the rescue of Penrose. He desires to see you. There is no positive suffering--he is sinking under a complete prostration of the forces of life. That is what the doctors tell me. They said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of writing <b>to</b> you, 'Send a telegram; {{there is no time}} to lose.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You were {{starting}} {{out for a}} fortnight's golf somewhere," [...] Tavernake continued, [...] "and you promised {{to look into the}} affair <b>when</b> you returned. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you again but you declared that you were far too busy to go into the matter at all for the present, you didn't care about this side of London, you considered that we had enough on hand--in fact, you threw cold water upon the idea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{should always}} be conceiving worse than the truth--each as to the other's thoughts. Now, some time ago, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you about your {{sister-in-law}} and Ludovic--I dare say you remember--" ...|$|E
60|$|At length {{she came}} forth, and seeing {{me in the}} way, would have slipped back into hiding; for, {{in spite of her}} boldness on the {{previous}} day, she now seemed shyer than ever <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] added Morris, [...] "and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{him about}} my windows, as got blown in, he said `cottages were no end of expense, and we hadn't treated them so as they would wish to come back nohow.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{certainly}} has known her. Though he lied, {{as he always}} lies, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him, <b>I</b> brought him {{to admit that he}} and she had been friends down in Suffolk. Of course we know what such friendship means. But I do not think that she came to London at his instance. Of course he would lie about that. He would lie about anything. If his horse cost him a hundred pounds, he would tell one man that he gave fifty, and another two hundred. But he has not lived long enough yet to be able to lie and tell the truth with the same eye. When he is as old as I am he'll be perfect.' ...|$|R
60|$|Ah, me! {{the end of}} that quiet, {{pleasant}} {{life was}} near. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> lightly <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the odd stranger of the expiring trade of the town, I never expected that my employer's trade was expiring too. The speculation {{had turned out to be}} a losing one; and all his savings had been embarked in it. He could no longer remain at Sandwich, or afford to keep a governess. His wife broke the sad news to me. I was so fond of the children, I proposed to her to give up my salary. Her husband refused even to consider the proposal. It was the old story of poor humanity over again. We cried, we kissed, we parted.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have kept}} your word and served my turn, Lord-from-the-Sea, {{therefore}} I will keep mine and serve yours {{when the time}} comes. Yet be warned by me and say nothing of a certain lady to the prince Kari, since <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> a word <b>to</b> him on the matter, hinting that her surrender to her father Huaracha would make peace with him more easy and lasting, he answered that first would he fight Huaracha, and the Yuncas as well, to the last man in Cuzco.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't an idea," [...] Littleson {{answered}} truthfully. [...] "To {{be frank}} with you, {{she was not}} particularly amiable <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her on the steamer. She evidently wanted to have very little to say to me, so I thought it best to leave her alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{the name}} of the hotel where you will stay to-night," [...] said she, [...] "it is the Cheltenham. I forgot it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you before. I do not believe, really, it is more than three miles beyond the other little place where you thought of stopping." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{leader and}} {{principal}} worker {{of the men}} who were about to give a series of spiritual manifestations in our town was Mr. Corbridge, a man of middle-age with a large head and earnest visage. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him of Amos Kilbright he was very much annoyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, monsieur, it {{was very}} sad (merci, monsieur, merci; thirty pipes, if you please), and I {{thought at the time}} that I should give up my voyageur life, and remain {{altogether}} in the settlement with my old woman. Mais, monsieur, that was not possible. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of it <b>to</b> my old woman, she called me an old woman; and you know, monsieur, that two old women never could live together in peace for twelve months under the same roof. So here I am, you see, ready again for the voyage." ...|$|R
60|$|Taking a {{key from}} her pocket, {{she was about}} to open the door of the cottage, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{advanced}} and <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her. As far from recognizing her as ever, I found myself nevertheless thinking of an odd outspoken child, living at the mill in past years, who had been one of my poor mother's favorites at our village school. I ran the risk of offending her, by bluntly expressing the thought which was then in my mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Given it up. Never,--never! Does a man {{give up his}} joy,--the {{pride of}} his life,--the one only delight on which his heart has set itself! No, my darling, I have not given it up. Because {{you would not have}} it as <b>I</b> wished <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you, <b>I</b> have not gone on troubling you. I thought I would wait till you were used again to the look of me, and to my voice. I shall never give it up, Ayala. When you came into the room that night with your new frock on--" [...] Then he paused, and she glanced round upon him, and saw that a tear again was in his eye. [...] "When you came in and curtseyed to Sir Harry I could hardly keep within myself because I thought you were so beautiful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It were fifteen {{year after}} the beginnin' of the century," [...] cried a younger woman, who had stood leaning against the wall, with a smile of {{superior}} knowledge upon her face. [...] "My Bill was a-saying so last Sabbath, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him o' old Daddy Brewster, here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has to ask}} her father, and he's all right. He did say, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> {{him this}} morning, that his {{permission}} would go for nothing, {{as he was about}} to be led away and deposited. Of course I told him that all that would amount to nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{drew him}} aside, whispering, [...] "Shaynor seemed going off {{into some sort}} of fit <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> you just now.

5000|$|In June 2014, Eighth Doctor Paul McGann {{revealed}} that production had begun on {{a sequel to}} the special. No release date, plot or cast details were offered. However, in July 2014, Sixth Doctor Colin Baker contradicted McGann's earlier statement by telling Flicks and the City that [...] "All <b>I</b> know is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> last <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Peter Davison the reaction to Five-ish Doctors has been so positive that we discussed {{whether it was a}} good idea to do another one and we agreed that we didn’t want to do one that was a pale imitation of the first. That would be anti-climactic," [...] and that, [...] "We have to come up with a really good idea first. There’s a couple of possibilities floating around, but nothing is set in stone. Clearly doing one about the 51st anniversary isn’t going to be interesting. It’s got to be about something else." ...|$|R
40|$|Dedicated to {{my beloved}} parents ii Acknowledgments I {{would like to}} express my deep-felt {{gratitude}} towards my advisor, Professor Peter Sturm, PERCEPTION Project at INRIA-Rhône Alpes, who advised, encouraged and supported my ideas {{right from the beginning}} of my masters. My research work in the area of transparency burgeoned after I hit myself against a glass door unknowingly while appraoching a girl at Alliance Française de Bangalore. This amusing incident, although quite painful, kept me thinking about how I missed noticing the glass door. Apparently on the same day after narrating the incident to my friends Ishrat and Reetika, who later had asked me whether it is possible to detect transparent objects in an image, I promptly answered saying it is impossible, although I ended up saying that nothing is impossible. My thanks to Ishrat and Reetika as the idea got stuck in my unconscious mind. The idea took a re-birth <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> my guide, Peter Sturm, with whom I shared my motivationa...|$|R
5000|$|Goldwyn Jnr had budgeted {{the project}} at $1.6 million but had trouble {{securing}} finance over $1 million.
