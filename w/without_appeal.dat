25|$|The {{substitution}} rule demonstrates several common {{aspects of}} rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; {{one can tell}} whether it was correctly applied <b>without</b> <b>appeal</b> to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, {{as is often the}} case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.|$|E

Modeling indicates that seeps of groundwater could occur on the surface even under modern conditions, but will freeze very quickly. However, under this suggestion ice cover could insulate the water flowing beneath it well enough to allow long distance transport (and associated erosion), much like a lava tube insulates the molten lava inside it.|$|E

His own vanity played into their hands. On Prairial 7 (26 May 1797) Babeuf and Darthé were condemned to death; some of the prisoners, including Buonarroti, were deported; the rest, including Vadier and his fellow-conventionals, were acquitted. Drouet managed to escape, according to Paul Barras, with the connivance of the Directory. Babeuf and Darthé were guillotined the next day at Vendôme, Prairial 8 (27 May 1797), <b>without</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although the {{standard}} suspension {{for a first}} offense under MLB's drug policy was, at that time, 50 games, Braun was suspended an additional 15 games for his actions during and after his appeal of the 2011 test. [...] According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, MLB officials were particularly angered by a speech Braun made during 2012 spring training in which he attacked Laurenzi's integrity {{and the integrity of}} the drug program as a whole. [...] MLB considered Braun's speech, as well as his earlier attacks on Laurenzi, to be conduct detrimental to baseball—an offense punishable under the collective bargaining agreement, not the drug policy. Braun accepted the additional suspension <b>without</b> <b>appeal</b> because of overwhelming evidence in the Biogenesis case. On August 22, Braun released a statement in which he apologized for using PEDs. He admitted he used PED's during the later part of the 2011 season to nurse a nagging injury. The products he used were a cream and a lozenge that would expedite his rehabilitation.|$|E

25|$|Neo-creationism is a pseudoscientific {{movement}} {{which aims}} to restate creationism in terms {{more likely to be}} well received by the public, by policy makers, by educators and by the scientific community.

2500|$|After the {{partition}} of Ireland in 1921, the Northern Ireland Government's policy tended to favour Protestant and unionist parades. From 1922 to 1950, almost 100 parades and meetings were banned under the Special Powers Act – nearly all were Irish nationalist or republican. Although violence died down during this period, there were clashes at the 1931 and 1950 Drumcree parades. The Public Order Act 1951 exempted [...] "traditional" [...] parades from having to ask police permission, but [...] "non-traditional" [...] parades could be banned or re-routed <b>without</b> <b>appeal.</b> Again, the legislation tended to benefit Protestant parades.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was found}} that set theory could be {{formulated}} as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of completeness, but nothing so bad as Russell's paradox), and this was done (see Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory), as sets are vital for mathematics. [...] Arithmetic, mereology, {{and a variety of}} other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically <b>without</b> <b>appeal</b> to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with Gödel and Skolem's adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.|$|E

The proposed suspension would include a global lock clause, which would also prevent him from [...] playing in other known leagues, such as Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korea Baseball Championship for example, as the leagues in those nations honor any suspensions imposed by MLB.
