Methodology: this is about a research from qualitative approach, performed in a Baby Friendly Hospital, in Recife city, Pernambuco, and had as participants nine mothers who were with their six-months-old babies. Data had been collected through half-structuralized interview and after, we analyzed them according to the techniques of thematic analysis. This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Agamenon Magalhães Hospital in Recife city (protocol number 149 / 05).

40|$|Do <b>we</b> really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> {{more about}} globalization? Like it or not, we will: both Left and Right justifiably {{see it as}} the early twenty-first century’s locus of {{political}} alignment. The multinational corporations and international agencies that organize global trade and investment have replaced the bourgeoisie as the objects of anticapitalist derision; contempt for free traders is emerging as the dominant feeling on the young and restless left. On the right, disdain for the “hypocrisy ” of antiglobal protestors—who smash the windows of Starbucks while clad in clothing by the Gap—has replaced revulsion against Communists who, during the Cold War, used the freedoms of the West to undermine democratic capitalism. And then there are the economistic supporters of globalization, so confident that “quicksilver capital ” and the logic of gains from trade make globalization inevitable that they see resistance as futile and the debate over globalization as irrelevant. This issue of Critical Review deals first with the inevitabilist thesis. It is striking that, as public-choice theory has gained ground on the right, it has served to keep alive the deterministic spirit of none other than Karl Marx. Like Marx, public-choice theorists reduce politics to economics; and in that spirit, it is now a right-wing commonplace that the progress of global capitalism is unstoppable.

30|$|When written {{language}} is spoken aloud, as is likely for scriptura continua, {{there is no}} difference between written and spoken language in a language that uses tone to realise Information Structure, because the tonic foot within a tone unit must be realised in speech. When reading becomes silent, however, the role and realisation of information structure becomes unclear. If a unit of information is realised by a tone unit, and New information is realised by the tonic foot, we must consider what happens in languages such as English when intonation is neither articulated nor coded in the written form.

40|$|Assessment for Learning is a {{pedagogical}} {{practice with}} anticipated gains of increased student motivation, mastery and autonomy as learners develop {{their capacity to}} monitor and plan their own learning progress. Assessment for Learning (AfL) differs from Assessment of learning in its timing, occurring within the regular flow of learning rather than end point, in its purpose of improving student learning rather than summative grading and in the ownership of the learning where the student voice is heard in judging quality. Since Black and Wiliam (1998) highlighted the achievement gains that AfL practices seem to bring to all learners in classrooms, it {{has become part of}} current educational policy discourse in Australia, yet teacher adoption of the practices is not a straightforward implementation of techniques within an existing classroom repertoire.

Beyoncé then tells the story about the group's first single [...] "No, No, No Part 2" [...] and continues performing the song. [...] "Bootylicious", [...] "Jumpin' Jumpin'", [...] "Say My Name", [...] "Independent Women Part I", [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] and [...] "Survivor" [...] are performed afterwards as part of the medley. She introduces the next song [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] saying that she wrote it for all the ladies, [...] "I thought it was something <b>we</b> all <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> When <b>we</b> get in these relationships they don't work out. Sometimes we blame the man, we blame another girl, we blame ourselves. But I think we should take every experience and learn a lesson out of it, even the bad experiences and I want all the ladies to know that we will never disappoint ourselves. You'll always have yourself." [...] She introduces the next song [...] "Summertime" [...] as one of her favorite songs asking from the crowd to dance further performing a step dance while footage of flowers was projected on the screen. The lights go out again and Beyoncé appears wearing a grey, sparkly dress for an extended performance of [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] surrounded by smoke. After the word [...] "Beyoncé" [...] is written on the screen several times, she appears on a staircase wearing a long shirt as the opening lines of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] start and the song's music video is projected on the screen. Beyoncé then continues singing the song and performing its choreography with her female background dancers and confetti are dropped on stage during the end of the performance.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, Dr. Alden Thompson, of Walla Walla College's Department of Theology, noted this {{practice}} of avoiding the direct naming {{of individuals and}} expressed the wish that the church could be more open and still respect those who differ:"...George Knight has given me permission to use his recent book on the atonement, My Gripe With God (Review and Herald,1990) to illustrate my point. Knight and I agree that naming names would be good. But we probably don't {{see eye to eye}} on the atonement — a topic on which two people could likely never agree! Knight argues that the (objective) substitutionary view of the atonement is the foundation for all other views. In the process, he critiques the subjective view of the atonement as articulated among Adventists by Maxwell and Jack Provonsha. But Knight does not mention Maxwell and Provonsha by name. I wish he had. I wish it were safe to do so — without jeopardizing the status of Knight, Maxwell, or Provonsha as faithful and committed Adventists. Knight looks to Paul for support (especially Romans and Galatians); Maxwell and Provonsha appeal to John (especially John 14-17). The perspectives are different; both are biblical; we should expect both in the church. But a tug-of-war view of truth tempts us to homogenize John and Paul, making them say the same thing, namely, what <b>we</b> want or <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> Then <b>we</b> can't hear our brothers and sisters, or listen <b>to</b> their <b>needs,</b> letting them hear Paul or John as needed, so that they, too, can worship God with all their hearts and love their neighbors as themselves..." ...|$|R
