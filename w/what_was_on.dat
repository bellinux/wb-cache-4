25|$|AMD {{designed}} the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities {{than that of}} K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use. The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced compared to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> board the K6. Deeper pipelining with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained. Whereas the AMD K6-III+ topped out at 570MHz due to its short pipeline, even when built on the 180nm process, the Athlon was capable of clocking much higher.|$|E
25|$|The cathedral {{was damaged}} in the French Revolution when a mob began {{to destroy the}} {{sculpture}} on the north porch. This {{is one of the}} few occasions on which the anti-religious fervour was stopped by the townfolk. The Revolutionary Committee decided to destroy the cathedral via explosives, and asked a local architect to organise it. He saved the building by pointing out that the vast amount of rubble from the demolished building would so clog the streets it would take years to clear away. However, when metal was needed for the army the brass plaque in the centre of the labyrinth was removed and melted down; our only record of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the plaque was Felibien's description.|$|E
25|$|The iPlayer {{received}} {{the approval of}} the BBC Trust on 30 April 2007, and an open beta for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 was launched at midnight on 27 July 2007, where it was announced that only a fixed number of people would be able to sign up for the service, with a controlled increase in users over the summer. The BBC had been criticised for saying that the iPlayer would 'launch' on 27 July 2007, when <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> offer was simply an extension of the beta to an open beta, admitting more users in a controlled manner. This was done reportedly to allow British ISPs and the BBC to gauge the effect of the iPlayer traffic on the Internet within the UK.|$|E

25|$|Before her launch on 23 May 1912, Cunard {{announced}} that their new ship, , which was under construction {{at the time}} at the John Brown shipyards in Glasgow, would be longer by one foot. There was chagrin in Hamburg. Several weeks later, she was fitted with an imposing bronze eagle figurehead, created by Professor Bruno Kruse of Berlin, which adorned her forepeak with a banner emblazoned with HAPAG's motto Mein Feld ist die Welt (My field is the world); this extension increased Imperator length sufficiently to (easily) surpass Aquitania. The eagle's wings were later torn off in an Atlantic storm during the 1914 season, after which it was removed and replaced with gold scroll-work which was similar to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> her stern.|$|E

However, he perceived that [...] "it was something special" [...] but {{had no idea how to}} classify it. Bay-Schuck felt the song needed time to grow as [...] "the more you hear it, the more of an earworm it becomes", leading the promotional department to make sure that program directors weren't afraid of playing a track that [...] "sounded different from <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the radio".|$|E

500|$|Former Test batsman Jack Fingleton, {{who covered}} the tour as a journalist, said Australia's day went [...] "progressively downhill" [...] and {{described}} the efforts as the country's worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of full tosses. England had batted conservatively, steadily accumulating runs on a pitch unfavourable for fast bowlers, and Miller bowled placidly. Fingleton's fellow journalist and former playing colleague O'Reilly criticised the bowling display as the worst by the Australians on tour and said none of the bowlers could be excused. He lambasted the attack for operating [...] "without objecthopelessly and meaninglessly" [...] throughout the day. He decried the [...] "so-called attack" [...] for being [...] "so blatantly inaccurate both in direction in length" [...] and likened it to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> offer in [...] "another monotonously uninteresting county match". O'Reilly criticised Bradman's players for what he regarded as an overly casual and relaxed disposition in the morning, which gradually became more lethargic throughout the day as the home team strengthened their position. O'Reilly speculated that the tourists had become complacent because of their comfortable 20 series lead.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> the screen, later recalling, [...] "It {{was a story}} filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney {{for the chance to}} retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the series}} uses {{a wide range}} of styles of humor, {{including}} self-deprecation, black comedy, off-color humor, slapstick, and surreal humor, its primary source of comedy is its satirical depiction of everyday life in the future and its parodical comparisons to the present. Groening notes that, from the show's conception, his goal was to make <b>what</b> <b>was,</b> <b>on</b> the surface, a goofy comedy that would have underlying [...] "legitimate literary science fiction concepts". The series contrasted [...] "low culture" [...] and [...] "high culture" [...] comedy; for example, Bender's catchphrase is the insult [...] "Bite my shiny metal ass" [...] while his most terrifying nightmare is a vision of the number 2, a joke referring to the binary numeral system (Fry assures him, [...] "there's no such thing as two").|$|E
