Activities and case studies throughout the book are drawn from community health and social care practice and are used to illustrate the principles, approaches, and issues related to working <b>with</b> <b>communities.</b> The activities, when used in conjunction with the 'reflective practice' approach, demonstrate that there are different ways to practice. The importance of adapting concepts and practical skills to people's experiences is a core theme in the text and provides the basis for learning, and working effectively <b>with</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after quadriplegia and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently <b>with</b> <b>community</b> support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E

Lastly, if a patient is unable to be cared for at home, the social worker will work to find a safer place for the patient to receive hospice care.|$|E

5|$|The 15th Avenue Northeast {{site for}} the University District's station was {{rejected}} {{in favor of an}} option on Brooklyn Avenue. The placement of the Brooklyn station, either on the north or south side of NE 45th Street, was debated by the Sound Transit Board in 2004. Seattle mayor Greg Nickels favored a station on the north side, but other boardmembers sided <b>with</b> <b>community</b> and business groups who wanted a site on the south side. The station site was further complicated the following year by Safeco's decision to expand its headquarters building {{on the west side of}} Brooklyn Avenue NE, impacting staging areas that were selected by Sound Transit. Ultimately, Safeco moved its headquarters to a downtown building in 2006, and sold the Brooklyn building to the University of Washington, and the staging areas remained available.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus there is often overlap <b>with</b> <b>community</b> sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E
