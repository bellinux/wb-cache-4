5|$|A {{black hole}} is {{a region of}} spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Brussels was still in many <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> medieval city. The royal quarter in the upper town, inhabited mainly by the nobility and the richer members of the bourgeoisie, was upscale and modern. The rest of the city, however, in particular the lower town, located in the western half of the Pentagon, was densely populated and industrial, characterized by an illogical street layout, back alleys, narrow streets, and numerous dead ends.|$|E

This view has been challenged recently and modern historians credit him with some significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum {{is in some}} <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> typical Roman fort: {{inside the}} wall are {{straight}} roads which cross, a headquarters building (the Praetorium), the commandant's house, a set of barrack blocks for the cohort of auxiliary soldiers, and granaries to store food. Also as usual, there is a bath house and a temple (dedicated by the auxiliaries to the Emperor Caracalla) outside the wall. There is an altar to Mithras and another, as already mentioned, to Hercules.|$|E
5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E

5|$|Ravel drew on {{many generations}} of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré {{and the more}} recent {{innovations}} of Satie and Debussy. Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert, Liszt and Chopin. He considered himself in many <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> classicist, often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary, to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies. The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata.|$|E

5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many <b>ways,</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) {{grounded in the}} existence of conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E

5|$|In World War II, Southern Rhodesia again enthusiastically {{stood behind}} the UK, symbolically declaring war on Germany in support of Britain before any other colony or dominion. Over 26,000 Southern Rhodesians served in the Second World War, making the colony once more the largest {{contributor}} of manpower, proportional to white population, {{in all of the}} British Empire and Commonwealth. As in World War I, Southern Rhodesians were distributed in small groups throughout the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Dedicated Rhodesian platoons again served in the KRRC, and the Rhodesian African Rifles, raised in 1940, were in many <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> resurrection of the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Military aviation, already associated with the colony following the First World War, became a great Southern Rhodesian tradition during the Second, with the colony providing No. 44, No. 237 and No. 266 Squadrons and other personnel to the Royal Air Force, as well as training in Southern Rhodesia for 8,235 Allied airmen.|$|E
5|$|Players on {{the batting}} team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out {{in any of}} several <b>ways.</b> <b>A</b> player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to {{subsequent}} bases during teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other means. The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed of nine innings, and {{the team with the}} greater number of runs {{at the end of the}} game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.|$|E

5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating second messenger systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex <b>ways.</b> <b>A</b> large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|The Waleses made Sandringham House their {{preferred}} residence, with Marlborough House their London base. Biographers agree that their marriage {{was in many}} <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> happy one; however, some have asserted that Albert Edward did not give his wife {{as much attention as}} she would have liked and that they gradually became estranged, until his attack of typhoid fever (the disease which was believed to have killed his father) in late 1871 brought about a reconciliation. This is disputed by others, who point out Alexandra's frequent pregnancies throughout this period and use family letters to deny the existence of any serious rift. Nevertheless, the prince was severely criticised from many quarters of society for his apparent lack of interest in her very serious illness with rheumatic fever. Throughout their marriage Albert Edward continued to keep company with other women, including the actress Lillie Langtry; Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick; humanitarian Agnes Keyser; and society matron Alice Keppel. Alexandra knew about most of these relationships, and later permitted Alice Keppel to visit the king as he lay dying. Alexandra herself remained faithful throughout her marriage.|$|E
5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two <b>ways.</b> <b>A</b> toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint to this idea is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there are two <b>ways</b> <b>a</b> planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E
