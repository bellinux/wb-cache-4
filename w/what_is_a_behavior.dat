The major goal of this project will be {{to come up with}} behavior based intelligent system that can automate the system security, appropriately and without any significant administrator help. The aim of this project will be preventing false alarms and generate a correct warning based on the behavior intelligence. The focus will be to monitor the system call sequences of the process, and identify malicious activities and threats that take place on the system. The protection system would monitor the system activity; identify malicious activities and threats through the content analysis. One of the main tasks would also be to minimize false positives by researching on various normal activities in the system and distinguish clearly <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> unacceptable <b>behavior.</b> <b>As</b> the part of this project, behavior of some of the popular applications like Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Outlook Express are captured by creating the learning database by running application in well controlle...|$|R
40|$|No desenvolvimento de Agentes Sintéticos Educacionais, ainda reside a dúvida sobre o que seria um comportamento que possa ser considerado, de fato, plausível para esse tipo de agente, qual forma pode ser considerada eficaz na transmissão do conhecimento pelo agente e qual o papel das emoções nesse processo. A proposta desse trabalho tem um cunho investigativo na tentativa de descobrir quais aspectos são importantes para esse comportamento coerente e prático no desenvolvimento de um chatterbot com o papel de tutor virtual, inserido no contexto de ensino de algoritmos. Neste estudo, são explanados os conceitos básicos de agentes, Sistemas Tutores Inteligentes, bots, chatterbots e como esses sistemas precisam se apresentar para transmitir credibilidade no seu comportamento. Modelos de emoções, personalidade e humor para agentes computacionais também são abordados, bem como estudos já realizados na área por outros pesquisadores. Após isso, é detalhado o protótipo desenvolvido, as pesquisas realizadas, síntese dos resultados alcançados, o modelo arquitetural do sistema, visão do ambiente computacional e visão macro das funcionalidades implementadas.

40|$|The main aims of {{this study}} <b>is</b> from <b>a</b> gender {{perspective}} identify possible reasons why so many men compared to women visited the European football Championship in Poland/Ukraine 2012. The study also aims to classify European Championship visitors from their primary purpose with the trip. To {{be able to answer}} the study's purpose and issues, {{it is important that we}} get an understanding of the phenomenon so that we can clearly express an opinion on this phenomena. This meant that we chose to use qualitative methods designed to give a deeper insight into <b>what</b> <b>is</b> being investigated. We made use of both deep, email and telephone interviews with our respondents. The six respondents are evenly distributed between the sexes. The selection was made through the snowball method. We also used a constructivist scientific approach where we conducted a qualitative analysis that encodes the significant statement as we got from the interviews. When studied the sport tourism we used scientific articles concerning <b>what</b> sport tourism <b>is.</b> This theory also identified how these tourists can be categorized. There are different types of visitors who have different goals with their trip to European Championship in Poland / Ukraine. We have classed these tourists from their primary purpose of the trip where some visitors were in Europe championship to see the football that was played while others were there to experience the event surrounding the football. To be able to identify possible reasons why more men than women visited the European Championships in Poland / Ukraine, we used Pierre Bourdieu's gender theory that deals with how the male dominance creates a power relationship between the sexes. The result that emerged from this study <b>is</b> that <b>a</b> male jargon dominated in the European championship. To identify possible reasons in why this appears we used gender theories. The male dominance (gender theory of Bourdieu) explained that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> strong male jargon which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> system of norms that determines <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> acceptable <b>behavior.</b> It's <b>a</b> man-centered world where the male <b>behavior</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> preference that determines the conditions in terms of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> socially acceptable. <b>A</b> male jargon appears when men <b>are</b> in <b>a</b> clear majority. The results also show that women fall into a subordinate role in an environment where a male jargon occurs resulting in the fact that women feel uncomfortable showing up in a role where they are expected to correct themselves in the hierarchy. We have also been able to identify possible reasons from a gender perspective why more men than women visited the European Championship in Poland / Ukraine 2012...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 This {{comparative}} {{case study}} describes the development, from childhood to early adulthood, of eight {{people who were}} failing in school and involved in criminal activity during early adolescence. At age twenty-five: three respondents were thriving; three were struggling to live independently, and two share characteristic with both groups. There are subtle yet important differences in circumstances and conditions in which the respondents grew up, and these differences influenced their developmental trajectories. All {{of the respondents were}} exposed to multiple environmental and personal risk factors. However, this did not, in and of itself, prevent them from thriving in early adulthood. Instead, it appears to be the cumulative weight of multiple, violent, exploitive childhood experiences, particularly exposure to domestic violence and child abuse, and multiple personal problems, particularly difficulties with addiction and psychiatric disorders, that weighed down the struggling respondents' ability to overcome the challenges they faced. The interrelationship between oppression and risk factors is complex. In several of the respondents' stories racism and sexism appear to create, facilitate, or augment the role of risk factors. Sometimes <b>what</b> <b>is</b> perceived, as <b>a</b> <b>behavior</b> problem by mainstream standards may <b>be</b> <b>an</b> attempt to establish a particular racial or gender identity. It may be that issues of power and domination undergird many risk factors. Some of the differences in the respondents' development can also be attributed to differences in the kinds of opportunities the respondents were given, the degree to which their capabilities were noticed and encouraged, and the kind of support or nurturance they received. Each of the thriving respondents had close relationships with at least two people who made a significant commitment of time and resources them. These individuals attended to their particular needs, encouraged their coping efforts and competence, and helped them to define themselves as valuable and capable. The African American respondents felt more comfortable accepting support and guidance from people who shared their cultural background and life experiences...|$|R
