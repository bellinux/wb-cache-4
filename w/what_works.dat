And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure.

The {{designing}} of a stained glass window that “works” from a visual point of view is a more complex matter than simply drawing up a cartoon and painting the colours in. <b>What</b> <b>works</b> on paper does not necessarily work when it has the added element of light streaming through it. Some colours are notoriously difficult. Blue glass, frequently used for backgrounds, can create a halo effect that dominates the window.

25|$|At {{the core}} of his {{philosophy}} is a view of humanity as greater than the contexts in which it is placed. He sees each individual possessed of the capability to rise to a greater life. At the root of his social thought is the conviction that the world is made and imagined. His work begins from the premise that no natural social, political, or economic arrangements underlie individual or social activity. Property rights, liberal democracy, wage labor—for Unger, these are all historical artifacts that have no necessary relation to the goals of free and prosperous human activity. For Unger, the market, the state, and human social organization should not be set in predetermined institutional arrangements, but need to be left open to experimentation and revision according to <b>what</b> <b>works</b> for the project of individual and collective empowerment. Doing so, he holds, will enable human liberation.|$|E

25|$|Drugs {{are tested}} {{by the people who}} {{manufacture}} them, in poorly designed trials, on hopelessly small numbers of weird, unrepresentative patients, and analysed using techniques which are flawed by design, {{in such a way that}} they exaggerate the benefits of treatments. Unsurprisingly, these trials tend to produce results that favour the manufacturer. When trials throw up results that companies don't like, they are perfectly entitled to hide them from doctors and patients, so we only ever see a distorted picture of any drug's true effects. Regulators see most of the trial data, but only from early on in a drug's life, and even then they don't give this data to doctors or patients, or even to other parts of government. This distorted evidence is then communicated and applied in a distorted fashion. In their forty years of practice after leaving medical school, doctors hear about <b>what</b> <b>works</b> through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues can be in the pay of drug companies – often undisclosed – and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups.

500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode [...] "Camping," [...] locks her {{in a room and}} refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say <b>what</b> <b>works</b> for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say <b>what</b> <b>works?</b> You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't you married 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E

He added that both overshadowed {{the rest of the}} record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debbie Miller from Rolling Stone commented that Madonna's voice [...] "doesn't have the power or range of, say, Cyndi Lauper, but she knows <b>what</b> <b>works</b> on the dance floor." [...] In 2014, Ryan Reed, also writing for Rolling Stone, called the song a [...] "classic".|$|E

And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
