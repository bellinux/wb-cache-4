5000|$|Misgurnus fossilis is {{a species}} of loach in the genus Misgurnus. It is {{commonly}} known as European <b>weatherfish</b> or European weather loach, due to its activity patterns changing when air pressure rises or falls. If there is a sudden change in barometric pressure, the <b>weatherfish</b> comes to the surface and swims about excitedly. In water with a low oxygen content it gulps air; it extracts oxygen through its intestinal mucous membrane, which has a complex system of blood vessels. It feeds on thawed frozen blood worms, small fish, brine shrimp, earthworms and some vegetables. It is quite an active loach and can grow to a length of 30 cm.|$|E

50|$|Misgurnus is a genus of loaches from Europe and Asia. Commonly {{known as}} <b>weatherfishes</b> or weather loaches, they are {{commonly}} eaten in Asia, while some {{have found their}} way into the aquarium trades and sold as pets. The origin of the name Misgurnus comes from the Greek word miseo (to hate) and the Turkish gür (stentorian), a name given to them due to their habit of becoming very active during barometric pressure changes that occur during thunderstorms.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to other olfactory receptor families that exhibit frequent lineage-specific expansions, the vomeronasal type 1 receptor (V 1 R) family exhibits a canonical six-member repertoire in teleosts.

On the meadows west from the lake vegetation of rare plants like the yellow lady's slipper, fly orchid, the Hungarian iris and Iris pumila and various butterfly species can be found, while the eastern puszta areas are covered by Puccinellia peisonis, Aster tripolium, A. pannonicum and Suaeda maritima.|$|E
50|$|The sea's basin (including {{associated}} waters such as rivers) has 160 {{native species}} and subspecies {{of fish in}} more than 60 genera. About 62% of the species and subspecies are endemic, as are 4-6 genera (depending on taxonomic treatment). The lake proper has 115 natives, including 73 endemics (63.5%). Among the more than 50 genera in the lake proper, 3-4 are endemic: Anatirostrum, Caspiomyzon, Chasar (often included in Ponticola) and Hyrcanogobius. By far the most numerous families in the lake proper are gobies (35 species and subspecies), cyprinids (32) and clupeids (22). Two particularly rich genera are Alosa with 18 endemic species/subspecies and Benthophilus with 16 endemic species. Other examples of endemics are four species of Clupeonella, Gobio volgensis, two Rutilus, three Sabanejewia, Stenodus leucichthys, two Salmo, two Mesogobius and three Neogobius.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to present some preliminary life history observations on a new exotic species, oriental <b>weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), in the Lake Washington watershed of Washington State. During 1999 electrofishing surveys of Lake Washington Ship Canal (Portage Bay, Lake Union, Fremont Cut, and Salmon Bay), 21 oriental <b>weatherfish</b> were collected. An additional 15 specimens were observed but not captured. Two additional oriental <b>weatherfish</b> were found in the stomach of a largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). Oriental <b>weatherfish</b> were collected in areas that contained aquatic macrophytes and a mud/silt substrate. Most female oriental <b>weatherfish</b> were gravid. On average, females were considerably larger than males. Only 7 of 19 oriental <b>weatherfish</b> contained prey. Chironomid larvae and pupae, amphipods, and cladocerans made up 96 % of the diet by wet weight. Cladocerans and chironomid larvae were the most frequently consumed prey. It is unclear what impact oriental <b>weatherfish</b> will have on the fish assemblage in the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

40|$|The Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> is {{considered}} a globally invasive fish species. In Europe, several reported feral populations of Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> display an overlapping distribution range with native <b>weatherfish</b> Misgurnus fossilis, a declining species of international conservation and aquatic management concern. Morphologically distinguishing the different <b>weatherfish</b> species can be difficult, as their coloration is highly variable, many species reveal high phenotypic plasticity, and morphological traits like coloration might be not obvious or might be degraded during field sampling and after preservation. Herein, we analysed suspicious <b>weatherfish</b> specimens from southern Germany, demonstrating the usefulness of molecular genetic species identifications in this genus. We present the first molecular genetic species record of Misgurnus anguillicaudatus in Central Europe, and confirm the range expansion of Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> into the river Inn catchment in southern Germany.

In this work we report {{the presence of an}} established <b>weatherfish</b> population in northeastern Iberian Peninsula and describe, {{for the first time in}} Europe, a clear range expansion. The species was first located in the Ebro River Delta in 2001 and has since been detected in 31 UTM 1 × 1 km quadrates. The capture of over 1, 000 <b>weatherfish</b> shows that its population is composed by both juvenile and adult individuals. <b>Weatherfish</b> occupies mostly the web of irrigation channels associated with rice culture, although it has also been detected in rice fields and in the Ebro River. The expansion of the species in the area seems to be limited by water conductivity. An additional location for the species in the Ter basin (some 300 km to the north) suggests that inter-basin expansion could be occurring.

40|$|Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), {{native to}} Southeast Asia, are {{freshwater}} fish {{belonging to the}} family Cobitidae (loaches). They are benthic fish {{with the ability to}} breathe atmospheric air, and exhibit an unusual behavior of swimming vertically in the water column in response to changes in barometric pressure. Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> appear to be successful invaders to North American waterways. Within the last century they have been sighted in freshwater systems throughout the United States, yet the distribution and source of this invasion are largely unknown. This study investigates the distribution patterns, surveying methods, and population genetics of the Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> within Illinois and Indiana waterways. These data were collected in 2013 and 2014 and supplemented with publically available data to provide the most up-to-date map of the current distribution in Illinois (IL) and Indiana (IN). Catch rates were calculated and compared across gear types and sampling sites to assess different survey methods. Sequence data from cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the control region (D-Loop) were compared among specimens collected from multiple sites throughout IL and IN with those available on GenBank. Results from this study suggest a single introduction to IL and IN before 1987, with a subsequent range expansion. This study is the first to genetically examine this <b>weatherfish</b> population.

40|$|The oriental <b>weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) is {{invasive}} to 13 U. S. {{states and}} at least 9 other countries. Although this cryptic fish species is widespread, very little is known regarding its ecology. We used baited minnow traps to collect 237 individuals from water bodies connected to the Boise River, Idaho. To determine the diet of the fish within this invasive population, we dissected and examined stomach contents of the sampled fish. Most of the stomachs (158 of 237) were empty, and 42 contained only the trap bait. However, 37 contained natural food items. Gravimetric analysis, frequency of occurrence, and mean percent by number all indicated macroinvertebrates as the primary diet component, with chironomid larvae as the most numerous prey eaten. Graphical analysis of prey-specific abundance also indicated that oriental <b>weatherfish</b> fed on a generalized diet, of which detritus is likely an important part. An omnivorous diet may, in part, explain the species’ ability to expand its invasive range quickly and successfully.

40|$|Invasive {{fish species}} have been {{identified}} as a major threat to aquatic biodiversity world-wide. The most successful of these invaders share several life history characteristics such as long lifespan, high fecundity, multiple reproductive events, generalized omnivorous diet, and tolerance {{for a wide range of}} environmental conditions. Although many studies have focused on well-known and economically costly invaders, there are many invasive fish about which very little is known. In this series of studies, I describe some life history characteristics of one such invasive fish, the oriental <b>weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). I collected 586 specimens from water bodies connected with the lower Boise River, Idaho, USA. For the first study, I dissected 237 of these individuals and used morphometrics, ova counts, and otolith ageing to build a life history profile of this invasive population. I found a 1 : 1 sex ratio of sexually mature males and females. Young of the year displayed rapid growth to sexual maturity within one year of life and fish lived to six years of age in the wild. Upon reaching maturity, the fish became capable of reproduction during two predicted spawning events over a protracted spawning season (June through October). Female fish had the capacity for releasing up to 40, 000 eggs per spawning season. For the second study, I examined the stomach contents of the dissected fish and used gravimetric, frequency, and abundance data to determine the fish’s diet. Oriental <b>weatherfish</b> were eating a generalized diet of aquatic invertebrates and detritus. For the third study, I used a temporally extended Critical Thermal Minimum (CTmin) approach to find the lowest water temperature that the fish could survive. Fish survived exposure to subfreezing water temperatures and direct contact with ice. I used logistic regression to estimate the CTmin of this sample of oriental <b>weatherfish</b> as - 1. 76 °C. This series of studies shows that the oriental <b>weatherfish</b> possesses many hallmark characteristics of other successful invasive fishes. These characteristics, coupled with ongoing dispersal through the aquarium pet trade make the oriental <b>weatherfish</b> an ideal invasive species.

40|$|The oriental <b>weatherfish</b> Misgurnus anguillicaudatus is a nonindigenous, cryptic {{species for}} which the {{currently}} invaded range spans 13 states in the USA as well as six other countries. Anecdotal evidence suggests that because they are facultative air-breathers, oriental <b>weatherfish</b> can survive in the terrestrial environment and may move across land to colonize new water bodies. Given the lack of empirical research on this subject, we conducted an experiment with oriental <b>weatherfish</b> to determine their longevity under increasingly dry conditions and their tolerance to desiccation. We introduced the fish (obtained from a wild population in Idaho) {{into a series of}} tanks and allowed some of the tanks to dry out. Over the course of the experiment, we measured substrate moisture content and temperature in each tank, and we periodically removed some fish to determine changes in mass and to check the status (alive or dead) and viability of the fish. Some individuals survived for over 81 d in desiccated conditions with soil moisture content less than 3 %; these fish lost over 25 % of their body weight. No mortalities occurred in the control group, which lost no more than 20 % of their body weight despite being unfed for nearly 90 d.

40|$|The Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> Misgurnus anguillicaudatus is {{invasive}} to {{many countries}} around the world, but very {{little is known about}} the life history or environmental tolerances of this cryptic fish. As part of a larger study of its life history, we conducted an experiment designed to determine the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> collected from water bodies near Boise, Idaho, USA. In each of three experimental trials, 16 fish were placed into individual tanks in an environmental chamber where over the course of 20 d the ambient air temperature was lowered to 0 °C. Air temperature was then held at 0 °C for 102 – 134 h. Individual tank temperatures decreased over the course of each trial such that fish were exposed to temperatures ranging from 20 °C to − 3. 64 °C. Tank temperatures reaching below the ambient air temperature set-point were attributed to cold air currents within the environmental chamber. Six of 48 fish died due to temperature-related factors. Thirty-eight of the remaining 42 fish survived exposure below the freezing point of freshwater, and 2 fish survived full enclosure in ice with direct contact between skin and ice. In the absence of an observed lethal temperature at which 50 % of fish died (LT 50), we used logistic regression and observational data to extrapolate a CTmin of − 1. 8 °C. The ability of Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> to survive at subfreezing temperatures and being embedded in ice indicates a physiological adaptation to cold that may include systemic antifreeze proteins. Tolerance for low temperature and resistance to freezing add to a growing list of characteristics that make the Oriental <b>Weatherfish</b> a highly successful invasive species...|$|E

40|$|The Baltic herring Clupea harengus membras, a local {{subspecies}} of the North Atlantic herring {{which had}} reached the Baltic Sea nearly 5, 000 years ago, {{is probably the most}} important food fish (for salting) both in the coastal regions as well as everywhere else in Estonia. The need to determine the exact time of fishing has inspired nearly 30 % of its popular names, mainly on the basis of orientation to phenological phenomena or popular festivals. Vendace/whitefish? Coregonus albula and rudds Rutilus rutilus and Scardinius erythrophthalmus, as common fresh-water fishes, are mentioned mostly in relation to omens. According to a legend the smelt Osmerus eperlanus smelled of horsemeat, as the fish were believed to have been born of drowned horses. According to ichthyologists, reports stating that the freshwater form of this species usually found in Lake Peipus had also been discovered in Estonia's largest inland-lake (Lake Võrtsjärv) date back to the 19 th century. By the mid- 20 th century the species had disappeared from Lake Võrtsjärv. A popular belief accuses the competing Russian fishers who had used magic to make the fish disappear (Orthodox peoples ate primarily fish during the Lent). The Baltic cod Gadus morhua callarias was traditionally caught with trawl-lines, as suggest the words of the spelling song in the article. The making of cod line was also associated with magic. Similar to the pike, the Baltic cod was considered a mythological being of the underworld (it has been called a one-eyed hog, piglet, etc.). The outward appearance of the fish has become to be thought as resembling the face of the Evil One (cf. Loorits 1926 : US 95). Various long-jawed species of fish have been popularly called 'windfish'. In coastal villages people used to hang the windfish outside {{and use it as a}} windsock. The coming of garpike Belone belone to the coastal waters before the Midsummer Day indicates the beginning of the Baltic herring's fishing season. Sturgeon Acipenser sturio was once considered an important food fish in Estonia, both for its flesh as well as roe. The collection of folklore at the second half of the 19 th century began too late to find reports on this wholly agreeable species. Stylised figures of two sturgeons were depicted on the blazon of Narva town, and the 17 th century öre coined in Narva. Remarkably, the popular name of the fish on the northern coast of Estonia was samb. According to the Finnish legends, sampo-fish was a giant mythical fish. And the Finno-Ugric myth about the three primordial bearers of the Earth is associated to the three sturgeons of the rivers. We might assume that the mythological concept which was inspired by the huge dimensions of the fish rather than particular species or family, concerned also other large fish (pike, sheatfish). The Russian word som and the Latvian word sams denoting sheatfish, not sturgeon, suggest the same. A legend from South-East Estonia concerning <b>weatherfish</b> Misgurnus fossilis or Cobitis fossilis, tells a story, where one of the characters, according to the register, was a snake (cf. Aa US 61). The Evil One tempted the rat to chew a hole into [Noah's] Ark, but the <b>weatherfish</b> closed the opening with its tail. There upon God rewarded <b>weatherfish</b> by naming them the best of fishes. A belief report from the northern coast of Lake Peipus contends that <b>weatherfish</b> could turn into snakes. And as <b>weatherfish</b> (much like eel) resemble snakes in many ways, the folkloric transmittance from one species to another is quite logical and expected...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{incubation}} temperature (range: 9 – 36 °C; interval: 3 °C) on artificially propagated <b>weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus fossilis) early ontogeny (during interval from egg fertilization {{to the finish}} of hatching) was investigated. Both, the amplitude of the incubation period (evaluated in four crucial moments), the total hatching period duration was inversely proportional to the {{incubation temperature}} and ranged from 17. 5 days at 9 °C to 1. 8 days at 24  °C (expressed at H 50) or from 137 hours at 9 °C to 9 hours at 24 °C, respectively. There were no influence of rising temperature on the total length of newly hatched larvae (TL = 4. 23 – 4. 67 mm), in contrast to negative correlation with developmental stage (9 – 18 °C: stage 37; 21 – 24 °C: stage  36), i. e. the length might determine the age at hatching, rather than the age at hatching determines the hatching length. The thermal tolerance range in term of survival lies between 9 and 24 °C (the thermal optimum 15 – 24  °C, i. e. <b>weatherfish</b> is a warm-mesothermic species).

40|$|The {{aim of the}} M. Sc. thesis was {{to verify}} {{possibility}} of weaning <b>weatherfish</b> larvae (Misgurnus fossilis) from the live food to the dry starter mixture using the method of co-feeding. The experiment included 3 control groups (starved control no feeding; negative control fed exclusively with dry starter mixture; positive control fed exclusively with live food) and 10 experimental groups with 5 different dates of termination of co-feeding period (at the age 13, 18, 23, 28 and 33 days post-hatching dPH) and different duration of co-feeding period (1 and 7 days). The experiment lasted from the 6 dPH, when mixed feeding was iniciated, until the age 48 dPH at the temperature of 17, 8 +- 0, 7 °C. The effects of termination and duration of co-feeding period upon continuous survival, morphometric and gravimetric characteristics, ratio of macrobiogenic elements and gross caloric value in somatic tissues of larvae/juveniles were evaluated. Continuous survival, morphometric and gravimetric characteristics and total content of carbon and nitrogen in somatic tissues of larvae/juveniles were increasing with extending dates of termination of co-feeding period. The rearing of <b>weatherfish</b> larvae was accompanied by the marked decline of survival in the period 13 20 dPH, regardless of selected diet regimes in individual groups. Within all fed groups, the worst results of continuous survival and growth were recorded in the negative control as well as groups with date of co-feeding period termination at age 13 dPH. All individuals in these groups died at age 41 dPH. At {{the end of the}} experiment, the highest values of continuous survival were achieved in the positive control as well as groups with dates of co-feeding period termination at age 23, 28 and 33 dPH, respectively. There was no significant statistical difference among these groups. Very good results in terms of morphometric and gravimetric characteristics were achieved in the groups with dates of co-feeding period termination at age 28 and 33 dPH, respectively. However, only in group with date of co-feeding period termination at age 33 dPH were achieved comparable values of morphometric characteristics with the positive control. The exception formed only values of the body height as well as dry and wet weights which were significantly higher in the positive control compared to other fed groups. The duration of the co-feeding period (either 1 or 7 days) did not affect any of the monitored characteristics. The results of the present thesis also show that the <b>weatherfish</b> fry best prospers on live food and, on the contrary, fry can not be reared using dry starter mixture as a sole food source. To sum up, among all tested groups that use co-feeding, only weaning of larvae with the date of co-feeding termination at age 33 dPH could be advised.

The goal of this thesis was assess the suitability of individual commercially produced hormonal preparations for controlled reproduction of <b>weatherfish</b> and the possibility to replace with them unstandardized use of homogenate of carp pituitary. It was found that use of various hormonal preparations and dosage may to in some extent affect hatchability and survival rate of larvae (fry), the size of the yolk sac of larvae, and the amount of energy deposited in body tissues of larvae. However, demonstrable difference in studied parameters for the application of different preparations on the different hormonal basis (hCG versus GnRH) was not reported. The highest rate of hatching larvae (93. 3 ? 3. 8 %) was observed in the groups treated with preparation Pregnyl 3000 IU - kg- 1. In terms of overall survival of the larvae (from deployment of hatched eggs until the end of the experiment) have proven to be the most effective medication Pregnyl 3000 IU - kg- 1 (69. 9 ? 12. 1 %) and Dagin (60. 56 ? 11. 71 %).

40|$|Temperature {{acclimation}} of poikilotherms entails metabolic rearrangements {{provided through}} the variation of enzyme properties. However, {{in most cases}} the underlying molecular mechanisms resulting in structural changes of enzymes are obscure. The present study reports that acclimation to low (5 °C) and high (18 °&# 1057;) temperatures causes differential expression of alternative forms of the LDH-A gene in white skeletal muscle of <b>weatherfish</b> Misgurnus fossilis. Two isoforms of LDH-A mRNA were isolated and characterised: a short (1332 bp) and long (1550 bp) form, which differ in the length of 3 'UTR, despite identical ORF lengths. These two mRNAs have 44 nucleotide point mismatches along the sequence resulting in three amino acid mismatches (Gly 214 Val; Val 304 Ile and Asp 312 Glu) between protein products from short and long forms of mRNA. Correspondingly, LDH-A subunit synthesized from short form of mRNA has been denoted as S-subunit, whereas the other one is L-subunit. It is expected that the L-subunit is more aliphatic due to properties of the mismatched amino acids. According to molecular modelling of M. fossilis LDH-A the Val 304 Ile mismatch is located in the subunit contacts of the tetramer, whereas the remaining two surround the contact area, which should manifest in kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the assembled tetramer. In warm acclimated fish the relative ratio between short and long isoforms of the LDH-A mRNA expression is around 5 : 1, whereas in cold acclimated fish expression of long mRNA is reduced to almost zero. This indicates that at low temperature the pool of overall tetrameric LDH-A is more homogeneous in terms of subunit composition. The temperature acclimation pattern of proportional pooling of subunits with different kinetic and thermodynamic properties of the tetrameric enzyme could result in the fine tuning of properties of overall skeletal LDH-A, which is in line with previously observed kinetic and thermodynamic differences between cold and warm LDH-A purified from <b>weatherfish.</b> Additionally, an irregular pattern of nucleotide mismatches indicates that these mRNAs are products of two independently evolving genes, i. e. paralogs. Karyotype analysis has revealed that the experimental population of M. fossilis is tetraploid (2 n= 100), therefore gene duplication possibly through tetraploidy may contribute to the adaptability towards temperature variation...|$|E

In the upper temperature treatments (19, 23 and 27 ° C), survival of larvae was stable throughout the entire rearing period (> 75 %), whereas 11 and 15 ° C resulted in severe declines in survival (to 27 ° C. All larvae of the 35 ° C regime, however, died within the ṀO 2 measurement period. M. fossilis larvae show greater than expected tolerance of high temperatures. On the other hand, low temperatures that are {{within the range of}} likely habitat conditions are critical because they might lead to high mortality rates when larvae are exposed over periods > 10 [*]days. These findings help to improve rearing conditions and to identify suitable waters for stocking and thus support the management of re-introduction activities for endangered M. fossilis...|$|E
40|$|In the loach, or Oriental <b>weatherfish</b> Misgurnus anguillicaudatus (Teleostei: Cobitidae), diploid (2 n = 50) and {{tetraploid}} individuals (4 n = 100) {{are often}} sympatric in central China. The evolutionary mechanism of this tetraploidization was analyzed with {{the observation of}} meiotic behavior of chromosomes in both the germinal vesicles of mature oocytes and the primary spermatocytes in diploid and tetraploid loaches. Whereas diploid specimens usually showed 25 bivalents in meiotic cells, tetraploid loaches exhibited 0 – 6 quadrivalents and 38 – 50 bivalents in both sexes, with the modal number of quadrivalents as three in females and four in males. In the diploid specimens, the two largest metacentric chromosomes bearing nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) identified by chromomycin A 3 staining and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} with a 5. 8 S + 28 S rDNA probe formed one bivalent with terminal association. In the tetraploids, four NOR-bearing chromosomes never formed a quadrivalent, but were organized into two terminally-associated bivalents. These findings suggest an autotetraploid origin of the natural tetraploid loach and subsequent rediploidization of whole genome. The latter process, however, seems still in progress as inferred from the concurrence of up-to several quadrivalents and the majority of bivalents...|$|E
40|$|In northwestern Italy, {{traditional}} {{rice cultivation}} using permanent flooding {{has been replaced}} by cultivation that uses a reduced water depth and a shortened submersion period. Prey availability for the numerous herons and egrets using this intensive rice cultivation region changed as well, with a diminution of amphibians and an increase of crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and oriental <b>weatherfish</b> (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus). The prey intake in 2014 was compared with data available for 1987 for the three most common species of waterbirds that forage in the paddies. Total biomass intake by Grey Herons (Ardea cinerea) feeding in the paddies decreased from 28 g dry mass/min in 1987 to 7 g in 2014, and by Black-crowned Night-Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) from 8 g to 5 g, while the intake by Little Egrets (Egretta garzetta) remained similar (12 and 13 g in 1987 and 2014, respectively). The observed levels of prey intake allowed breeding Grey Herons to meet their energy needs by feeding exclusively in the rice paddies in 1987, but not in 2014. The other two study species could not meet their daily requirements for successful breeding by feeding in the paddies only, either in 1987 or 2014. Yet the three species bred successfully in the study area, and their reproductive output remained stable both in 1987 and 2014. Successful breeding was probable by the three species foraging in other habitats, such as rivers, small natural wetlands and irrigation canals, in the region...|$|E
