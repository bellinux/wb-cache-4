40|$|This note {{comments}} {{on a number}} of recent gain-scheduling approaches which assume that the plant to be controlled is in so-called linear or quasi-linear parameter-varying form. In {{the first part of the}} note it is shown that present theory does not support the reformulation of nonlinear systems into linear/quasi-linear parameter-varying form <b>without,</b> in <b>general,</b> considerable <b>restrictions</b> either on the class of nonlinear systems considered or on the allowable operating region. The shortcomings of a popular ad hoc reformulation approach are also demonstrated. In the second part of the note, it is shown that, by employing velocity-based formulation, a very general class of nonlinear systems can, indeed, be transformed into linear/quasi-linear parameter-varying form. It is emphasised that this transformation is global in nature, with no restriction to near equilibrium operation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} affine {{rectification}} {{of a plane}} exploiting knowledge of relative scale changes is presented. The rectifying transformation is fully specified by the relative scale change at three non-collinear points or by two pairs of points where the relative scale change is known; the relative scale change between the pairs is not required. The method also allows homography estimation between two views of a planar scene from three point-with-scale correspondences. The proposed method is simple to implement and without parameters; linear and thus supporting (algebraic) least squares solutions; and <b>general,</b> <b>without</b> <b>restrictions</b> on either {{the shape of the}} corresponding features or their mutual position. The wide applicability of the method is demonstrated on text rectification, detection of repetitive patterns, texture normalization and estimation of homography from three point-with-scale correspondences. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} a rearrangement inequality for pairs of n × n matrices: Let ‖A‖p denote (Tr(A ∗ A) p/ 2) 1 /p, the C p trace norm of an n×n matrix A. Consider the quantity ‖A+B ‖ p p +‖A−B‖p p. Under certain positivity conditions, {{we show that}} this is nonincreasing for a natural “rearrangement” of the matrices A and B when 1 ≤ p ≤ 2. We conjecture that this is true in <b>general,</b> <b>without</b> any <b>restrictions</b> on A and B. Were this the case, it would prove the analog of Hanner’s inequality for L p function spaces, and would show that the unit ball in C p has the exact same moduli of smoothness and convexity as does the unit ball in L p for all 1 < p < ∞. At present this {{is known to be}} the case only for 1 < p ≤ 4 / 3, p = 2, and p ≥ 4. Several other rearrangement inequalities that are of interest in their own right are proved as the lemmas used in proving the main results. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{cast the}} problem of motion {{segmentation}} of feature trajectories as linear manifold finding problems and propose a general framework for motion segmentation under affine projections which utilizes two properties of trajectory data: geometric constraint and locality. The geometric constraint states that the trajectories of the same motion lie in a low dimensional linear manifold and different motions result in different linear manifolds; locality, by which we mean in a transformed space a data and its neighbors tend to lie in the same linear manifold, provides a cue for efficient estimation of these manifolds. Our algorithm estimates a number of linear manifolds, whose dimensions are unknown beforehand, and segment the trajectories accordingly. It first transforms and normalizes the trajectories; secondly, for each trajectory it estimates a local linear manifold through local sampling; then it derives the affinity matrix based on principal subspace angles between these estimated linear manifolds; at last, spectral clustering {{is applied to the}} matrix and gives the segmentation result. Our algorithm is <b>general</b> <b>without</b> <b>restriction</b> on the number of linear manifolds and without prior knowledge of the dimensions of the linear manifolds. We demonstrate in our experiments that it can segment a wide range of motions including independent, articulated, rigid, non-rigid, degenerate, non-degenerate or any combination of them. In some highly challenging cases where other state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms may fail, our algorithm gives expected results. 2...|$|R
