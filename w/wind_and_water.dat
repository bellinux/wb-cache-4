5|$|The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse. Species of Liliaceae bloom {{at various}} times from spring to late summer. The {{colorful}} flowers produce large amounts of nectar and pollen that attract insects which pollinate them (entomophily), particularly bees and wasps (hymenopterophily), butterflies (psychophily) and moths (phalaenophily). The seeds are dispersed by <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> Some species (e.g. Scoliopus, Erythronium and Gagea) have seeds with an aril structure that are dispersed by ants (myrmecochory).|$|E

5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, {{but as it}} was then abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by vandalism led to further structural deterioration.

5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The {{condition of the}} building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest that the spirit of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E
5|$|The Petrified Forest {{is known}} for its fossils, {{especially}} fallen trees that lived in the Late Triassic Period, about 225million years ago. The sediments containing the fossil logs are part of the widespread and colorful Chinle Formation, from which the Painted Desert gets its name. Beginning about 60million years ago, the Colorado Plateau, of which the park is part, was pushed upward by tectonic forces and exposed to increased erosion. All of the park's rock layers above the Chinle, except geologically recent ones found in parts of the park, have been removed by <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> In addition to petrified logs, fossils found in the park have included Late Triassic ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and many other plants as well as fauna including giant reptiles called phytosaurs, large amphibians, and early dinosaurs. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the park's fossils since the early 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> damage {{across the}} Outer Banks was extensive. Strong waves and {{the storm surge}} from Hurricane Isabel knocked about 30 to 40 houses and several motels off of their pilings. Two {{families}} who did not evacuate were nearly swept out to sea when their home was destroyed. Local rescue was unable to reach them; however, they were ultimately able to reach safety. The rough waves greatly affected piers in Nags Head, Rodanthe, and Frisco, with three being completely destroyed. Several locations along North Carolina Highway 12 were partially washed out or covered with debris, and 15foot (4.5m) sections of pavement {{on both sides of}} a bridge near Ocracoke were washed away. Strong waves destroyed a beach access ramp, as well. Several thousand homes and businesses were damaged by the passage of the hurricane, and damage in Dare County totalled nearly $350million (2003USD, ($ USD)). In the Outer Banks, no deaths or injuries were reported.|$|E
5|$|Although {{effects from}} Andrew were catastrophic, {{the extent of}} damage was limited mainly from Kendall to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm. The {{hurricane}} destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county, including 99% of mobile homes in Homestead. At the Homestead Air Force Base, most of the 2,000buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable. Damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure. Nearby, {{in the small town}} of Florida City, over 120homes were demolished and 700others were damaged, while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair, including City Hall. Further north, damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as Country Walk and Saga Bay resembled that of an F3 tornado, as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from , below the threshold for an F3 tornado. Four of the five condominiums at Naranja Lakes were destroyed. The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe <b>wind</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> damage; after the storm, significant looting was reported at that location. More than 50streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines. Agriculture suffered extensively as well, with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados, limes, and mangoes. Crop damage in Dade County totaled about $509million. The county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane, totaling approximately $25billion. Andrew left at least 40deaths in the county, 15direct and 25indirect.|$|E
