5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it,</b> the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
25|$|Healthy {{humans have}} two kidneys, a {{redundancy}} that enables living donors (inter vivos) {{to give a}} kidney to someone <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it.</b> The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Las Abejas" [...] (Spanish for [...] "the bees") was chosen, {{according}} to {{one member of the}} organization, because [...] "like the bees we want to build our houses together, to collectively work and enjoy the fruit of our work. [...] We want to produce 'honey' but also to share with anyone <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it...</b> We know that, like the little bees, the work is slow but the result is sure because it is collective." [...] Another member of the organization notes a political element in the choice of the name: [...] "The bee is a very small insect that is able to move a sleeping cow when it pricks. [...] Our struggle is like a bee that pricks, that is our resistance, but it's non-violent." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phaedrus and Socrates {{walk through}} a stream and find {{a seat in the}} shade, and Phaedrus commences to repeat Lysias' speech. Beginning with [...] "You understand, then, my situation: I've told you how good it would be for us in my opinion, if this worked out", the speech {{proceeds}} to explain all the reasons why it is better to give your favor to a non-lover rather than a true lover. Friendship with a non-lover, he says, demonstrates objectivity and prudence; it doesn't create gossip when you are seen together; it doesn't involve jealousy; and it allows for a much larger pool of possible partners. You will not be giving your favor to someone who is [...] "more sick than sound in the head" [...] and is not thinking straight, overcome by love. He explains that it is best to give your favor to one who can best return it, rather than one <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it</b> most. He concludes by stating that he thinks the speech is long enough, and the listener is welcome to ask any questions if something has been left out.|$|E

Katie {{tried in vain to}} speak. The tears coursed freely down her cheeks, but never a word could she utter. She put her arm round the neck of the poor girl and kissed her.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{thought the}} Abbot to himself, [...] "in that red {{perspective}} I could fancy to myself the peaceful towers of Dundrennan, where I passed my life ere I {{was called to}} pomp and to trouble. A quiet brotherhood we were, regular in our domestic duties; and when the frailties of humanity prevailed over us, we confessed, and were absolved by each other, and the most formidable part of the penance was the jest of the convent on the culprit. I can almost fancy that I see the cloister garden, and the pear-trees which I grafted with my own hands. And for what have I changed all this, but to be overwhelmed with business which concerns me not, to be called My Lord Abbot, and to be tutored by Father Eustace? I would these towers were the Abbey of Aberbrothwick, and Father Eustace the Abbot,--or I would he were in the fire on any terms, so I were rid of him! The Primate says our Holy Father, the Pope hath an adviser--I am sure he could not live a week with such a one as mine. Then there is no learning what Father Eustace thinks till you confess your own difficulties--No hint will bring forth his opinion--he is like a miser, who will not unbuckle his purse to bestow a farthing, until the wretch <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it</b> has owned his excess of poverty, and wrung out the boon by importunity. And thus I am dishonoured {{in the eyes of}} my religious brethren, who behold me treated like a child which hath no sense of its own--I will bear it no longer!--Brother Bennet,"--(a lay brother answered to his call)--" [...] tell Father Eustace that I need not his presence." ...|$|E
60|$|No {{theory is}} so perfect {{as not to}} be subject to {{exceptions}} in the experiment, and in spite of her conviction of the truth of Mr. Peck's social philosophy, Annie is aware, through her simple and frank relations with the hands in a business matter, of mutual kindness which it does not account for. But perhaps the philosophy and the experiment were not contradictory; perhaps it was intended to cover only the cases in which they had no common interest. At anyrate, when the Peck Social Union, as its members voted to call it, at the suggestion of one of their own number, got in working order, she was as cordially welcomed to the charge of its funds and accounts {{as if she had been}} a hat-shop hand or a shoe-binder. She is really of use, for its working is by no means ideal, and with her wider knowledge she has suggested improvements and expedients for making both ends meet which were sometimes so reluctant to meet. She has kept a conscience against subsidising the Union from her own means; and she even accepts for her services a small salary, which its members think they ought to pay her. She owns this ridiculous, like all the make-believe work of rich people; a travesty which has no reality except the little sum it added to the greater sum of her superabundance. She is aware that she is a pensioner upon the real members of the Social Union for a chance to be useful, and that the work they let her do is the right of some one <b>who</b> <b>needs</b> <b>it.</b> She has thought of doing the work and giving the pay to another; but she sees that this would be pauperising and degrading another. So she dwells in a vicious circle, and waits, and mostly forgets, and is mostly happy.|$|E
