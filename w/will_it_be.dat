25|$|Stephen Donald Cummings (born 13 September 1954 in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian rock singer-songwriter and writer. He was {{lead singer}} of Melbourne-based rock band, The Sports, from 1976 to 1981, {{followed}} by a solo career which has met with critical acclaim but has had limited commercial success. He has written two novels, Wonderboy (1996) and Stay Away from Lightning Girl (1999), and a memoir, <b>Will</b> <b>it</b> <b>Be</b> Funny Tomorrow, Billy? (2009). In 2014 a documentary film Don't Throw Stones based on his memoir premiered {{as part of the}} Melbourne International Film Festival.|$|E

25|$|On 14 November 1998, Cummings and, a briefly reformed, The Sports {{performed}} at the Mushroom Records 25th anniversary concert. His next solo album, Spiritual Bum, had Cummings as record producer and was issued in June 1999. He returned to an acoustic, melancholic sound. Cummings also had his second novel, Stay Away from Lightning Girl, published in 1999, which described an aging musician and his band. In 2001, he released Skeleton Key followed by Firecracker in 2003, Close Ups in 2004, Love-O-Meter in 2005, Space Travel in 2007, and Happiest Man Alive in 2008. On 1 May 2009, his memoir, <b>Will</b> <b>it</b> <b>Be</b> Funny Tomorrow, Billy? : misadventures in music was printed, which his publishers described {{as a series of}} anecdotes from his childhood through thirty years of the music business and his family relationships. In October 2010, his 1988 album Lovetown was listed in the top40 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.|$|E

[...] " [...] (Truly, truly I say to you, {{whatever}} you ask of the Father in My name, so <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> given to you.), {{is given to}} the bass as the vox Christi, the voice of Jesus. The instruments, strings probably doubled by oboe d'amore, introduce vocal motifs which the voice picks up. The bass sings the text three times, while the instruments continue playing the same motifs. Julian Mincham observes: [...] "The richness of the text, the unobtrusive nature of the melodic ideas and the gently flowing rhythms combine to create an appropriate atmosphere of dignified restraint".|$|E

[...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 26, 2014, Opeth {{released}} its eleventh studio album, titled Pale Communion. Åkerfeldt {{began working on}} new material {{as far back as}} August 2012. In January 2014 he stated, [...] "We've been looking at [...] Rockfield Studios in Wales where Queen recorded [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody", but we haven't made a decision yet, but it will be an expensive album. There's a lot going on, lots of string arrangements that we haven't had in the past." [...] Despite fearing that the band's new musical direction would split Opeth's fanbase, when asked if it <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> heavier or softer than Heritage, Åkerfeldt said, [...] "Maybe a little bit heavier, not death metal heavy, but hard rock/heavy metal heavy. There's also lots of progressive elements and acoustic guitars, but also more sinister-sounding riffs." [...] Åkerfeldt also produced the new album which will include string instrumentation, something that he became interested in doing when working on Storm Corrosion. The band members in Opeth felt rejuvenated after creating Heritage which resulted in closer relationships between them.|$|E

500|$|While his {{explanation}} {{was found to}} be credible by some readers, Long's critics faulted an example he gave of two orioles he had seen building a nest outside his window. Intended to prove his thesis about the unpredictable and adaptive nature of wild animals, he wrote of how the pair [...] "plainly deliberated" [...] their elaborate swinging nest that had been made out of three sticks fastened together; when finished, the birds then [...] "tied a single knot at the extreme end" [...] of a dangling string so it would not unravel over time. Burroughs and his allies were again incensed at Long's insistence that what he wrote was based entirely upon fact, and quickly responded with criticism; Burroughs' written reply reportedly proved to be almost too harsh for publication. The Atlantic Monthly did not wish to escalate the debate, so it was ultimately published by Century Magazine. Evoking Long's story of the orioles, Burroughs wrote, [...] "After such an example as this, how long <b>will</b> <b>it</b> <b>be</b> before the water-birds will be building little rush cradles for their young or rush boats driven about the ponds and lakes by means of leafy sails, or before Jenny Wren will be living in a log cabin of her own construction?" ...|$|E
