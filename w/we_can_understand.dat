25|$|Biolinguistics is {{the study}} of the biology and {{evolution}} of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the fundamentals of the faculty of language.|$|E
25|$|Deeper {{analysis}} is needed before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> why these distinctions {{should result in}} {{a difference in the}} twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.2‑11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the path integral) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E

500|$|Spins Colin Joyce was {{impressed}} by [...] "Start a War". He stated that [...] "the number {{seems to be the}} sort of skyward ballad that [...] has made her wheelhouse" [...] and found it to be [...] "a good look for Stefani". Stassa Edwards of Jezebel was equally positive, declaring that it [...] "has all of the hallmarks of a Sia ballad – those mournful, moody bridges that Sia does so well". Edwards concluded by saying she enjoyed the feathery-inspired setup that accompanied Stefani's performance. Richard Baxter, a blogger on Popology Now, largely praised the track. He wrote: [...] "As expected, 'Start a War' is very much in the veins of a typical Sia ballad. Same sound, same melodies, yet Gwen makes the song her own by not channeling Sia's vocals." [...] Baxter continued: [...] "It's got a bit of radio appeal, at least from what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> and Gwen sounds pretty phenomenal." [...] Also writing of Stefani's vocals, Julien Goncalves on the French website Purebreak Charts was pleased that the [...] "aerial" [...] song was strong enough to emphasize her voice.|$|E
500|$|The film conveys {{what some}} viewers have {{described}} as {{a sense of the}} sublime and numinous. Roger Ebert writes in his essay on 2001 in The Great Movies: [...] In a book on architecture, Gregory Caicco writes that Space Odyssey illustrates how our quest for space is motivated by two contradictory desires, a [...] "desire for the sublime" [...] characterized by a need to encounter something totally other than ourselves—"something numinous"—and the conflicting desire for a beauty that makes us feel no longer [...] "lost in space," [...] but at home. Similarly, an article in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy, titled [...] "Sense of Wonder," [...] describes how 2001 creates a [...] "numinous sense of wonder" [...] by portraying a universe that inspires a sense of awe, which {{at the same time we}} feel <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand.</b> Christopher Palmer wrote that there exists in the film a coexistence of [...] "the sublime and the banal," [...] as the film implies that to get into space, mankind had to suspend the [...] "sense of wonder" [...] that motivated him to explore space to begin with.|$|E

500|$|Orr {{was also}} {{involved}} in the 1991 lawsuit of retired NHL players against the NHL over its control of the players' pension fund. Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players {{to give up a}} seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment of one of our game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, as far as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand,</b> have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E

[...] Myles McNutt of The A.V.

[...] Todd VanDerWerff of The Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the 83rd best of Lost (excluding the finale), writing the episode is [...] "Not bad, but giving Sawyer a big, epic origin story feels kind of beside the point." ...|$|E
500|$|Chapter XI {{deals with}} {{evidence}} from biogeography, {{starting with the}} observation that differences in flora and fauna from separate regions cannot be explained by environmental differences alone; South America, Africa, and Australia all have regions with similar climates at similar latitudes, but those regions have very different plants and animals. The species found in one area of a continent are more closely allied with species found in other regions of that same continent than to species found on other continents. Darwin noted that barriers to migration {{played an important role}} in the differences between the species of different regions. The coastal sea life of the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America had almost no species in common even though the Isthmus of Panama was only a few miles wide. His explanation was a combination of migration and descent with modification. He went on to say: [...] "On this principle of inheritance with modification, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case." [...] Darwin explained how a volcanic island formed a few hundred miles from a continent might be colonised by a few species from that continent. These species would become modified over time, but would still be related to species found on the continent, and Darwin observed that this was a common pattern. Darwin discussed ways that species could be dispersed across oceans to colonise islands, many of which he had investigated experimentally.|$|E

500|$|Benn {{asserted}} that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a [...] "radical political importance" [...] on his life, and made {{a distinction between the}} historical Jesus as [...] "a carpenter of Nazareth" [...] who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and [...] "the way in which he's presented by some religious authorities; by popes, archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power", believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus. He believed that it was a [...] "great mistake" [...] to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain, and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was [...] "a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx". Later in his life, Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness, as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism. [...] "I've never thought <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church", Benn said to the Catholic Herald. [...] "All political freedoms were won, first of all, through religious freedom. Some of the arguments about the control of the media today, which are very big arguments, are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars. You have the satellites coming in now – well, it is the multinational church all over again. That's why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO: she was not prepared, any more than Ronald Reagan was, to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order, people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell." [...] According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman, Benn [...] "decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus". Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older, he was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity, radicalism and socialism. Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as [...] "as keen a Christian as I am myself", Benn wrote in 2005 that he was [...] "a Christian agnostic" [...] who believed [...] "in Jesus the prophet, not Christ the king", specifically rejecting the label of [...] "humanist".|$|E
