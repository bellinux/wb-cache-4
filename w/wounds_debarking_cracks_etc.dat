40|$|Abstract. Among {{mechanical}} systems, a {{large number}} presents naturally a divided feature: granular media, masonries, metal at the grain level, etc. Some of them, due to external loading, may evolve from a continuous state to a, globally or locally, divided one: fracture, wear, <b>cracks,</b> <b>etc.</b> When numerical studies of such media are performed, Discrete Elements Methods (DEMs) appear as most appropriate tool to face to different problems. Classically, DEMs are based on some hypotheses concerning contact area, deformations and contact interactions which are in some circumstance questionable, especially {{when they have a}} strong influence on the macroscopic behaviour of the media. Using the Contact Dynamics framework, the paper presents how classical hypothesis could be extended to avoid numerical effects. A reflection is proposed taking into account both physical and numerical aspects. Static and dynamic configuration have been used to illustrate the paper purposes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{wide range}} of {{materials}} used {{in the construction of}} embankments leads to highly differentiated structural behaviours and sometimes to accidents. Therefore, namely in higher hazard works, such as dams, it is necessary to periodically assess their safety. That assessment is done by site visits, to perform visual inspections, and the reading of certain quantities. Those variables are not to exceed certain values, which are related with the behaviour models predicted in the design. Applied Geodesy plays a significant part in the measurement of surface displacements. The visual inspections are a complement to the data obtained in those measurements, as zones of differential settlements, deviation, fissures, <b>cracks,</b> <b>etc.</b> This paper presents the contribution of the Applied Geodesy to detect the causes of accident in two embankment structures, {{as well as to the}} decisions adopted for their rehabilitation. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{combined}} thermodynamic and diffusion kinetic approach in predicting the product morphology developed during solid-state displacement reactions is exemplified by the interactions in the GaSb/Co and SiC/Me (where Me=Cr,Pt,Co) systems.

It was shown that the manifestation of the effects accompanying reactive-phase formation in inorganic solids (like the Kirkendall effect and the net volume change during internal precipitation) causes the generation and relaxation of the stresses. This significantly contributes to the morphological evolution of the reaction zone.
