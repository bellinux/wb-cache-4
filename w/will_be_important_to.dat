25|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to HZE nuclei on spatial learning, memory behavior, and neuronal signaling have been tested, and threshold doses have also been considered for such effects. It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> understand the mechanisms {{that are involved in}} these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe-ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age-related cognitive deficits.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after his}} death, the Viscount of Inhaúma {{was hailed as}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} figures of the Brazilian armada" [...] in the Brazilian Senate. He was extremely popular in the armada and was fondly called [...] "Uncle Joaquim" [...] by his subordinates. The Brazilian navy's slang phrase, [...] "andar na Inácia", which meant to behave correctly, was derived from his name. Since 1870, no comprehensive biography of Inhaúma has been published, even though he, according to Francisco Eduardo Alves de Almeira, [...] "is, and always <b>will</b> <b>be,</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> the navy of Brazil for his example as a modest and dedicated chief". The Inhaúma-class corvette, built in the 1980s and 1990s, was named after him. Despite the scant attention paid him in historical literature, there are some historians who share a highly positive view of Inhaúma. Américo Jacobina Lacombe {{said that he was}} [...] "one of the greatest names in our [...] military history". Max Justo Guedes regarded him among the greatest imperial navy officers, and Adolfo Lumans considered him one of the greatest navy officers in Brazilian history.|$|E

2500|$|Researching {{the mental}} health effects of {{earthquakes}} and other disasters is important so communities can heal properly after experiencing a traumatic event. This is a difficult topic to research because fixing the physical damage from a disaster is usually the first step a city takes towards recovery. Each individual can react differently to traumatic events, and more {{research needs to be}} done to learn how to predict vulnerability and access the effects to find solutions that work best. Because it has been found that different demographics are affected differently, this also needs to be taken into account when finding solutions to aid recovery. Different demographics may benefit from different types of mental counseling to help them recover from trauma. [...] It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> have information on a wide variety of demographic groups because the same mental health treatment will not help all of those affected by a trauma.|$|E
