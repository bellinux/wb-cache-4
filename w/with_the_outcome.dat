5|$|His {{performance}} at the Olympic trials was in vain as Mr. Justice Mackay upheld the BOA ban in the High Court of Justice and stated that a right to work was not sufficient reason to remove it. The BOA chairman, Lord Moynihan, was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> stating that those abusing drugs did not deserve to represent Great Britain at the Olympics. However, he lamented that a sprinter of Chambers' calibre had in effect excluded himself from the competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack was}} a success with the brigades taking all their {{objectives}} on schedule. The 4th Brigade captured 700 prisoners of war, {{for the loss of}} 130 men killed, and over 600 wounded. In the 1st Brigade, 192 were killed along with 700 wounded. From its starting positions, the division made gains of around 1,000 metres. Both Godley and Russell were pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> and pushed for further involvement by the New Zealand Division in the ongoing offensive.|$|E

30|$|For {{the second}} {{aim of this}} paper, we assume a network {{consists}} of several complete components and a complete network. Firstly, the stability of components does not generate a stable overall network. When comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of <b>the</b> stable components of a network <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of <b>the</b> complete network consisted {{of the same size}} of each component, we find that <b>the</b> individual <b>outcomes</b> of <b>the</b> complete components are smaller than <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of <b>the</b> complete network. Secondly, comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of <b>the</b> complete giant component <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of other components of a network shows that <b>the</b> individual <b>outcomes</b> are higher in the giant component.|$|R
5|$|The {{reaction}} to the award was surprise, with the award's lack of reasoning a particular concern. The Venezuelans were keenly disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> though they honored their counsel for their efforts (their delegation's Secretary, Severo Mallet-Prevost, received the Order of the Liberator in 1944), and abided by the award.|$|E
5|$|A {{few other}} {{lines have been}} tried, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> varying from an {{immediate}} equality to a clear advantage for Black. The cooling 4.e6 avoids complications and heads for an equal endgame with 4...dxe6 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8, Black's loss {{of the right to}} castle being of no great importance since queens have been traded. If Black wants to avoid this early endgame, he can try 4...Bb4+ 5.Nc3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3 dxe6 and now the exchange of queens would give a plus to Black, as the white queenside pawns are isolated and doubled. The greedy 4.f4 is weak because White neglects his development and weakens the a7–g1 diagonal. Black can immediately exploit this with 4...Bc5, which threatens a fork on f2 and forbids White's castling; Black may later push d7–d6 to open the centre, e.g. 5.Nh3 0-0 6.Nc3 d6 7.exd6 cxd6 when Black has good squares for its pieces while White's castling is delayed.|$|E
5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so pleased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the associations among the nine types of body constitution in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of overweight, obesity, and underweight. Method. Participants aged 30 to 90 years were recruited from communities in Shanghai and assessed using a self-administered questionnaire pertaining to their demographics, lifestyles, and self-reported medical history. The data of 3748 participants with complete information was available for the analysis. Multinomial logistic regression (MLR) analysis was performed to determine the associations among the TCM constitution variables and <b>the</b> health <b>outcomes.</b> Results. <b>The</b> standards of classification and determination of the constitution in TCM were used to gauge the patients’ constitution type. MLR revealed independent and significant associations among the Qi_Deficient and Yang_Deficient groups <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of overweight, obesity, and underweight (P< 0. 10 for all). MLR revealed independent and significant associations among the Qi_Deficient and Yang_Deficient groups <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of overweight, obesity, and underweight (P< 0. 05 for all). Conclusion. Our study revealed significant negative correlations between the Qi_Deficient and Yang_Deficient groups <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of overweight, obesity, and underweight. On the other hand, positive correlations were found between Phlegm_Dampness and <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> of overweight and obesity...|$|R

5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the Music Hall Convention. After {{a period}} of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats {{to vote for the}} Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship.|$|E
5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} of the Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884, both of which extended suffrage for men in the United Kingdom, led to large-scale political organisation. These combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the Corrupt Practices Act of 1883, which prevented the payment of canvassers, led to both Conservative and Liberal Parties approaching female supporters to aid them in political campaigning. The Conservatives were first to offer a political role for women in Wales {{with the opening of}} branches of the Primrose League, but campaigning for women's rights was not its priority and merely aimed to 'interest women in politics'.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Häkkinen {{said that he was}} happy with his race victory which he believed would help his confidence throughout the remainder of the season. Häkkinen added that his team displayed pit boards which instructed him not to over rev his engine during the race's first half. Coulthard said that he was satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the first lap as it allowed him to drive a conservative race. He added that his strong finish would not mean that he would think about his potential to clinch the Drivers' Championship. Barrichello explained that his car was loose from contact with Trulli during the race's early stages which prevented him from challenging de la Rosa.|$|E
5|$|America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) fought Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX) in an Elimination Last Team Standing {{match in}} the next encounter. Though the match was billed as a Last Team Standing match, it was held under Texas Death match rules. A Texas Death match {{is similar to a}} Last Team Standing match, however, the {{competitor}} must pin or make his opponent submit before the referee begins his count. Daniels pinned Storm following hitting him in the knee with a steel chair to begin the ten count, which Storm failed to make. Daniels was the second to be eliminated, failing to reach the ten count after being pinned following a top rope legdrop by Harris. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the match down to the competition between Harris and Skipper, Harris hit Skipper with the Catatonic onto a steel chair. Harris then pinned Skipper to begin the ten count; Skipper did not get to his feet, giving the win to AMW.|$|E

5|$|Antigonus {{emerged from}} the {{conflict}} as the unchallenged ruler of Macedon and the leading power in Greece. After his victory in Argos, Antigonus was able to install his supporter Aristippos as tyrant {{of the city and}} appointed various pro-Macedonian leaders as tyrants in other Greek cities. His support for tyrants over democratic rulers would lead to growing resentment amongst the Greek cities against Macedon. On his journey north to Macedon, Antigonus succeeded in placing garrisons in the cities of Chalcis and Eretria on the important island of Euboia <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> being that he further consolidated his power in Greece. The Spartan-Macedon alliance proved to be transient. Angered by Macedon's supremacy and full of ambition, Areus formed a coalition with several Greek poleis, most notably Athens. In the resulting Chremonidean War, Areus was slain by his former ally Antigonus in a battle on the Isthmus of Corinth in 265 BC. The war ended in a defeat that was so crushing for Sparta that it would not rise as a regional power again until the reign of Cleomenes III thirty years later.|$|E
5|$|Cotto faced WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight {{champion}} Sergio Martinez for {{the titles}} on June 7, 2014 {{in his first}} fight in the middleweight division at Madison Square Garden. It {{should be noted that}} Martinez was inactive for a year before this bout and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee. Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martinez was unable to bend, flex and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martinez himself proclaimed that his knee had nothing to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot. Cotto knocked Martinez down 3 times in the first round and once in the ninth round before Martinez retired on his stool before the tenth round, giving Cotto the win by ninth-round corner retirement. With the win, Cotto became the first Puerto Rican boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes.|$|E
5|$|Dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of {{the naval}} battle, Philip IV, who {{expected}} that the French fleet would have been destroyed, and the honour of his navy restored, dismissed and imprisoned Count of Linhares and Admiral Pimienta, among other officers, accusing them of mismanagement and abandonment of their forces. Linhares was replaced by Luis Fernández de Córdoba, Pimienta by Jerónimo Gómez de Sandoval, and Bazán del Viso by Giannettino Doria. Philip IV also appointed his 17 years old illegitimate son John of Austria as Príncipe de la mar, commander of all the Hispanic maritime forces, giving them widespread orders and powers in order to end with the misrule of the Spanish Navy. The French failure at Orbetello, nevertheless, contributed greatly to the reduction the French pressure in Italy. 6,000 soldiers from Naples could be consequently carried to Valencia {{to fight against the}} French armies in Catalonia. On September, a French expedition led by Charles de la Porte de la Meilleraye, with Portuguese help, succeeded in capturing both the presidi of Piombino and Porto Longone, which encouraged the Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena, to change his allegiance from the Spanish monarchy to France.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens and Hunt operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, and Hunt condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E
5|$|For Metal Gear Solid 4, Raiden's {{new design}} was a {{response}} to the criticism that only his face remained in his cybernetic body. Shinkawa, himself, was surprised by the way he came to illustrate Raiden. The staff noted that Raiden's debut in the Metal Gear Solid 4 trailer received notably positive responses; several video-game magazines promoted the game with Raiden's screenshots. Kojima echoed similar comments, indicating that he wanted to expand the character with another game. In designning him, Shinkawa wanted to convey both Raiden's beauty as well as sorrow in his cybernetic body. He was also made so that he could wield swords with his own legs giving the players the impressions he was a ninja. Raiden's first fight against Vamp in the game caused difficulty to motion and voice actors because of carefully planned movements performed by the two fighters. The staff was nevertheless satisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome,</b> considering it one of the best battles in the game. For the motion capture of Raiden, two actors were selected: one did most of his appearances while another did his action sequences.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> of the air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, {{and he had been}} {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. Then, he would turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
