5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Miguel was the queen's {{favourite}} child. After {{the death}} of her firstborn, it was Miguel who received most of her attention, rather than Pedro, who was closer to his father.|$|E
25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> now <b>is</b> {{that the}} West's {{fascination with the}} {{primitive}} {{has to do with}} its own crises in identity, with its own need to clearly demarcate subject and object even while flirting with other ways of experiencing the universe.|$|R
25|$|This {{process is}} {{expected}} to continue, as new organisms arrive through accidental or intentional introductions. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> less <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> {{the extent to which}} previous introductions pave the way for future invasions. This may occur in one of three ways.|$|R
30|$|The {{causes of}} the socio-political invisibility of urban water issues cannot be {{explained}} from one perspective alone. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>is</b> that an unprecedented {{effort on the part}} of all engaged stakeholders to abandon traditional approaches in favour of more courageous and open strategies is a necessity.|$|R
25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Harappan {{society was}} not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating {{some of the highest}} rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E
5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting <b>are</b> vague, but <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|R
50|$|The {{larger problem}} was that by 1979, {{combined}} ZIRPA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and {{it was evident that}} insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country. Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force <b>is</b> questionable. However, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.|$|R
50|$|The Director of Army Public Relations, Brig. -Gen. Olajide Laleye, {{told the}} News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) by {{telephone}} {{that the investigation}} would establish what happened. “However, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> already <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Nigerian Army troops did not initiate firing and only acted in self-defence after being fired upon,” Laleye said.|$|R
25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{fall of the}} Mauryas {{left the}} Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign {{invasion}} followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was {{to establish a new}} capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.|$|E
3000|$|Although the {{definition}} of <b>what</b> constitutes piracy <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> not <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> with regard to piracy committed within the territorial waters by countries that are considered failed states such as Somalia. Even the 1982 UN Convention on Law of Seas (UNCLOS) doesn’t spell out adequately such matters and hence {{the legality of the}} issue remains problematic. 4 [...]...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that DDE is an endocrine disruptor and contributes to breast cancer, but more recent studies provide strong evidence that there is no relationship between DDE exposure and breast cancer. [...] <b>What</b> <b>is</b> more <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that DDE is a weak androgen receptor antagonist and can produce male genital tract abnormalities.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of large numbers}} of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought, and a number of desperate last stands were made. Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by cairns, were found in several large groups around the camp – including one stand of around 150 men. A Zulu account describes a group of the 24th forming a square on the neck of Isandlwana. Colonial cavalry, the NMP and the carabiniers, who could easily have fled as they had horses, died around Durnford in his last stand, while nearby their horses were found dead on their picket rope. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that the slaughter was complete in the area around the camp and back to Natal along the Fugitive's Drift. The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.|$|E
500|$|Abercrombie's next {{error was}} an {{apparent}} over-reliance on {{the analysis of}} Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, {{did not want to}} act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice. Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, [...] "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French {{in a very short time}} from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter was reputed for his bravery, {{bordering}} on recklessness, and was confident of success, {{as evidenced by}} his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights [...] "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed, but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights, encumbered by their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The Chronicle of the Morea {{on the other hand}} implies that the battle was hard-fought, which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras, and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of bogging it down entirely. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that the Catalans held, and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries, reassured {{that this was not a}} ruse, descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing what remained of it.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> {{whenever}} races <b>were</b> {{first run}} on the Knavesmire, is that York was the first centre after Newmarket to formulate a structured race programme, starting in 1751 with the Great Subscription Purses.|$|R
5000|$|Possibly {{the best}} known action {{involving}} RP-3s {{was that of the}} Falaise pocket of mid-August 1944. During the battle German forces, retreating to avoid being trapped in a pincer movement by Allied ground forces, came under air attack. Amongst the waves of light, medium and fighter bombers attacking the German columns the Typhoons of 2 TAF attacked with their rockets, claiming hundreds of tanks and [...] "Mechanised Enemy Transport". After the battle Army and 2nd TAF Operational Research Sections studying the battleground {{came to the conclusion that}} far fewer vehicles (17 in total) had been destroyed by rocket strike alone. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that in the heat of battle it was far harder for pilots to launch the weapons while meeting the conditions needed for accuracy. Smoke, dust and debris in the target areas made accurate assessment of the damage caused almost impossible.|$|R

2500|$|Dordain's {{remarks were}} echoed by Daniel Sacotte, ESA's {{director}} of human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration, in saying simply that [...] "The Russians {{are not going to}} finance it, we will finance it from our side", despite adding a cautionary note that [...] "We needed the support from at least two states out of France, Italy and Germany. We didn't get it."

2500|$|Victor Davis Hanson has {{commented that}} [...] "Recent {{scholars}} have suggested Poitiers, so poorly recorded in contemporary sources, {{was a mere}} raid and thus a construct of western mythmaking or that a Muslim victory might have been preferable to continued Frankish dominance. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that Poitiers marked a general continuance of the successful defense of Europe, (from the Muslims). Flush from the victory at Tours, Charles Martel went on to clear southern France from Islamic attackers for decades, unify the warring kingdoms into {{the foundations of the}} Carolingian Empire, and ensure ready and reliable troops from local estates." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Armenian {{translations}} of Eusebius and Syncellus' transmissions (Chronicon and Ecloga Chronographica, respectively) both record Berossus' use of [...] "public records" [...] {{and it is}} possible that Berossus catalogued his sources. [...] This did not make him reliable, only that he was careful with the sources and his access to priestly and sacred records allowed him to do what other Babylonians could not.

30|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>is</b> that a {{misunderstanding}} between the villagers and Earth Island {{has resulted in}} one of the worst cases of dolphin slaughter in the Solomon Islands for some time, and delivered a huge setback to conservation efforts in a world “hot spot” for the dolphin trade.

2500|$|Kamiizumi fought {{his way out}} of the castle, {{and escaped}} to eastern Kōzuke, where he joined with Kiryū Ōinosuke Naotsuna. [...] But Naotsuna died soon {{thereafter}} and his son Matajirō Shigetsuna took over. [...] With this, Kamiizumi returned to Minowa Castle. [...] It is not known why. [...] One story is that he returned because of many friends still at the castle, and there he joined the service of Naitō Shūri-no-kami, the governor appointed by Shingen. [...] Or, another story is that, impressed by Kamiizumi's valor, Shingen invited him to join the Takeda side after Minowa Castle fell.

2500|$|Some have Flatman {{falling from}} the horse rather than being kicked by it. [...] It has even been {{said that it was}} a {{different}} horse entirely, Lord Aylesbury's Sudbury, which he had ridden in the Biennial Stakes. [...] <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear,</b> <b>is</b> that for a while, Flatman was expected to fully recover. [...] In reality, the rib had been driven into his lung, which became infected, and consumption followed. [...] He began to relapse while out riding in his carriage and, after a lingering illness, died on Monday 20 August 1860. [...] It had only been the second riding accident he had had in his long career. The first was a broken collar bone. [...] By strange coincidence, the first race he had ever ridden was on Golden Pin, the last on Golden Pippin.|$|E
2500|$|April 1777 was a busy {{month for}} Camilla. On 6 April she {{captured}} the brig Willing Maid, bound from St. Thomas, Danish West Indies, to Ocracoke Inlet, North Carolina, with a cargo of sugar, rum, and salt. However, the brig sprang a leak and sank. On 11 April 1777, Camilla was patrolling with 44-gun frigate [...] {{near the mouth}} of the Delaware River, just north of the Cape Henlopen lighthouse, when they came upon the American merchantman Morris. Gunfire from the two British vessels drove Morris ashore, where she suddenly blew up with such force that it shattered the windows on the British vessels. [...] Reports indicate that Morris was carrying 35 tons of gunpowder and that the captain and six crewmen still on the vessel were laying a train of gunpowder to blow her up, when things went wrong. It is not clear whether the powder train burnt too quickly or a shot from Camilla or Roebuck set it off. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> that the vessel disintegrated and all aboard her died in the explosion. Much of her cargo of arms was, however, salvageable, and Americans onshore were able to get it.|$|E
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> {{apparently}} <b>clear,</b> <b>is</b> {{that regardless}} of names assigned by scientists and scholars, the broad ancient Mexico region or Cem Anahuac, had many cultures and subcultures scattered in time and space, {{it is very likely}} that all had a common origin, the Nahuatl language and its derivations, and the many found similar archaeological evidence could corroborate this, regardless of the assigned name.|$|R
5000|$|.....the horrors {{actually}} began {{as soon as}} we crossed the old frontier. By five p.m. we were approaching Kumanovo. The sun had set, it was starting to get dark. But the darker the sky became, the more brightly the fearful illumination of the fires stood out against it. Burning was going on all around us. Entire Albanian villages had been turned into pillars of fire... In all its fiery monotony this picture was repeated the whole way to Skopje... For two days before my arrival in Skopje the inhabitants had woken up in the morning to the sight, under the principal bridge over the Vardar - that is, in the very centre of the town - of heaps of Albanian corpses with severed heads. Some said that these were local Albanians, killed by the komitadjis cjetniks, others that the corpses were brought down to the bridge by the waters of the Vardar. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that these headless men had not been killed in battle.|$|R
50|$|The court {{emphasised}} {{that its}} {{silence on the}} issue of brain death should not be taken to be an indication that the approach of the trial court ought to be accepted. The question then was left open, and there remains to this day no general legal definition of death in South African law. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that, where a person is so seriously wounded that he would, in the absence of prompt medical intervention, very soon be dead, and is kept alive artificially by means of a respirator, the eventual disconnection of the respirator could not be seen as the act which caused the death. It was merely the termination of a fruitless attempt to save a life: that is, to avert the consequences of the wounding. The causal connection between the wounding of the deceased and his eventual death exists from beginning to end, and is not interrupted and eliminated by the disconnection of the respirator.|$|R
