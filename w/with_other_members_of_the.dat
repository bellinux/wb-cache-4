5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis {{is adapted to}} a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as {{it is very hard}} to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E

5|$|The up-down {{display is}} used {{for a number of}} {{interactions}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a threat display. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.|$|E
5|$|Tikal's great rival was Calakmul, another {{powerful}} {{city in the}} Petén Basin. Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive {{systems of}} allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same network. Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other. At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline.|$|E
5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh shrew is {{sympatric}} <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh shrew typically has a longer snout {{than that of the}} American water shrew, which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E

5|$|Ian Hunter (or Ian Patterson), {{the lead}} singer of the 1970s pop group Mott the Hoople, was a {{resident}} of 23a Swan Hill in the town centre, and wrote a song of the same name. Also {{a resident of the}} town was John Peel, a DJ and radio presenter, who was educated at Shrewsbury School. Another DJ from the town is Lange, a producer of dance music, who was born in Shrewsbury. The 1980s pop group T'Pau was formed in the town and the band's vocalist Carol Decker was born and educated in the town, along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band. Notable music historian Charles Burney was born and educated in the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Balch started {{investigating}} the Iron Age cave dwellers in Wookey Hole Caves, {{embarking on a}} four-year study of the caves along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mendip Nature Research Committee. The group mapped the caves, drew illustrations of their finds and took photographs, collecting {{the information in the}} 1914 book Wookey Hole: its Caves and Cave-Dwellers. When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E
5|$|In March 1888, Riley {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. {{where he had}} dinner at the White House <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International Copyright League and President of the United States Grover Cleveland. Riley made a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking {{about the need for}} international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics. In the 1888 Presidential Election campaign, Riley's acquaintance Benjamin Harrison was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|Plants grow {{best in a}} moist but well-drained, acidic soil, {{with added}} peat being helpful. They may be grown in coastal gardens in a {{sheltered}} position, and generally require some degree of shade. Once established, plants can tolerate short dry spells. As they age, plants may become straggly, but benefit from hard pruning after fertilizing and watering, which promotes compact, bushier growth. Common heath can be short-lived and difficult to transplant, though it can be readily grown as a pot plant. Along <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus, Epacris impressa initially proved difficult to grow and maintain on original soil in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.|$|E
5|$|Structure 4 {{is another}} pyramid-temple {{base on the}} west side of Plaza C.

Most of the skulls were found with associated obsidian blades. Most of the skulls had been individually buried in pits cut into the floor of the plaza, although a few were grouped into small lots.|$|E

5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch {{was first}} described in 1843 by British zoologist Edward Blyth, from a specimen he examined in Darjeeling. Its kinship <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genus is unclear. The bright blue color of its plumage invites a {{comparison to the}} blue nuthatch (S. azurea), or other blue-tinted nuthatch species such as the velvet-fronted nuthatch (S. frontalis), yellow-billed nuthatch (S. solangiae) and the sulphur-billed nuthatch (S. oenochlamys), but its distribution being focused in the eastern Himalayas, and the uniqueness of its plumage, argues against the assumption. According to the International Ornithological Congress and ornithologist Alan P. Peterson, no subspecies have been identified.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a down payment on the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E
