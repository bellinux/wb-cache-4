5000|$|A {{local group}} [...] working under IWAI's Boyne Navigation Branch is {{currently}} undertaking {{works on the}} Slane section of the navigation. Recent works which have taken place include: removal of thick vegetation growth on the <b>waterway</b> <b>section</b> (during Summer 2014) between Slane Lock (Lock 9) to a little beyond the Bridge that crosses the Boyne Navigation and River Boyne leading to Slane. Sluices were installed in the concrete barriers at Locks 8 and 9 at this section {{to allow for the}} rewatering of the <b>waterway</b> <b>section</b> and also allow for the regulation water levels. Once or were funding sourced, it would be hoped for the installation of lockgates at Lock 8 (Morgan's Lock) and Lock 9 (Slane Weir) allowing boat passage from the River Boyne to the other using the Boyne Navigation. A boat would do this by enter the double lock chamber at Lock 8 under the engineering feat of the man made archway (locally known as the Scabby Arch) under the stone arch road bridge to Slane up to Lock 9 and back out onto the River Boyne.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt the European scale, inland {{navigation}} waterway transport is {{considered as a}} competitive and environment friendly alternative to road and rail transport. This transport mode is promoting in north of France thanks to {{the building of the}} Canal Seine-Nord. The number of boats and the navigation scheduling will increase significantly. A big raise of the required water volume is waited. Overcoming this future navigation demand will be particularly challenging in a climate change context. Hence, a crucial step consists in investigating the resilience of the {{inland navigation}} networks considering the future navigation demand and the climate change impacts. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} present the tools dedicated to the resilience determination that is required to design adaptive management strategies of these networks. An integrated model is proposed to model the network and to identify and quantify water supplies and water intakes. Then, a generalized flow-based network is used to model the water volume dispatching. The water dispatching has to be optimized according to the network resilience against the increase of navigation demand, and against the decrease of available water resource particularly during drought periods. Due to the complex structure of the networks, uncertainties that are linked to the daily number of boat and to the available water resource, an interesting approach will consist in defining a distributed problem. Local virtual agents will be designed to manage each <b>waterway</b> <b>section,</b> and a global coordination process will guarantee the efficient management of the network. The tools are designed and tested considering the inland navigation network in north of France...|$|E

50|$|Oakland County was {{originally}} divided into 25 separate townships, which are listed below. Each township is roughly equal in size at six miles (10 km) by six miles, {{for a total}} township area of 36 sq mi. The roots of this design were born out of the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the subsequent Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Oakland County itself {{is a prime example}} of the land policy that was established, as all townships are equal in size (save for slight variations due to <b>waterways).</b> <b>Section</b> 16 in each township was reserved for financing and maintaining public education, and even today many schools in Oakland County townships are located within that section.|$|R

50|$|In 1887 Kaiser Wilhelm I inaugurated {{construction}} {{on a new}} canal through Schleswig-Holstein called the Kiel Canal. Though the new canal's western end is farther south (at {{the mouth of the}} Elbe), much of the Eider Canal's watercourse was reused for the new <b>waterway.</b> Many <b>sections</b> were deepened, and some were straightened, cutting off bends that still exist as lakes. The new canal was opened by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1895.|$|R

30|$|In {{this paper}} three core models are {{developed}} {{to create an}} overall assessment framework for intermodal transport policies: a multimodal freight model (NODUS), a discrete event simulation model of the inland waterway network and its terminals (SIMBA) and the LAMBIT model supporting location analyses for Belgian intermodal terminals. The combination of the three models creates a decision support system that allows simulating policy measures to support the intermodal transport industry and foreseeing possible problems in the freight infrastructure network. The effectiveness and sustainability of policy measures in terms of modal shift, external costs and capacity restrictions can be analysed. In the next section, the context of intermodal transport in Belgium will be briefly presented. This will be followed in Section 3 by an outline of the three core models of the decision support framework. A complete case study will finally illustrate {{the use of the}} tools to solve the particular problem of the optimal localisation of an additional intermodal terminal along the Belgian inland <b>waterways</b> network (<b>Section</b> 4).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{waterway}} of Jiangxinzhou to Wujiang {{section is}} the only hindering navigation section in Wuhu to Nanjing of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Because of the unsteadiness of the main stream, the navigation condition in this section tends to worse, in which the regulation work is sorely needed and more important. The major problem for channel regulation in this section is the design of regulation project. In this paper, the 2 D numerical model for simulating the flow and sediment in the <b>waterway</b> of Jiangxinzhou-Wujiang <b>section</b> is used to analyze these questions. From the numerical simulation results, {{we know that the}} overall navigation regulation project can solve the problem of hindering navigation...|$|R

The thesis dealt with the newly navigable Vltava in South Bohemia, which was part of the state project "Completion of Vltava <b>waterway</b> in the <b>section</b> Ceske Budejovice - Tyn nad Vltavou". It was elaborate the situation analysis and realization of own exploration by means of structured interviews and survey. Based on the obtained data were created proposals to improve current situation. The main contribution of this thesis is the efficient interconnection of these suggestions would significantly increase the attractiveness of the whole idea navigable Vltava river for tourism. The most important output of the thesis is the elaboration of the project "Modernization of steamers on the Vltava river in South Bohemia"...|$|R
5000|$|The Illinois Waterway system {{consists}} of 336 mi {{of water from}} the mouth of the Calumet River to the mouth of the Illinois River at Grafton, Illinois. It is a system of rivers, lakes, and canals which provide a shipping connection from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico via the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. The Illinois and Michigan Canal opened in 1849. In 1900, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal replaced it and reversed the flow of the Chicago River so it no longer flowed into Lake Michigan. The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains a 9 ft navigation channel in the waterway. [...] The <b>waterway's</b> complex northern <b>section</b> is referred to in various contexts for study and management as the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS).|$|R

50|$|The Mayenne was navigable in {{its natural}} state up to Château-Gontier. Works were {{undertaken}} in the 16th century to make the river navigable upstream from here to Laval; royal decrees by François I in 1536 and 1537 authorised the necessary works, including flash locks. Economic expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries justified engineering with locks and weirs not only to Laval but also upstream to Mayenne. This extension, with 20 locks and weirs, was built {{at the same time}} as about 40 flash locks were replaced by 25 weirs and locks, some in short lock-cuts, between 1853 et 1878. The river was used by barges carrying up to 130 tonnes, and the principal traffics were construction materials (wood and stone), coal from the mines of L'Huisserie, grain, fruit and vegetables. At this time it was planned to build a watershed canal north from Mayenne to the tidal river Orne at Caen, but the project was abandoned as railways became the preferred carrier of freight. The navigation was abandoned after World War II, but restored from the 1970s as a cruising <b>waterway.</b> The upstream <b>section</b> was completed in the early 1990s.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{significant}} limitations of inland waterway transport on the Oder River is the water level. Its variability determines the minimum clearance under the bridges and thus the maximum drought of moving vessels. An important factor affecting the water level in the Oder River is the phenomenon of wind backwater. Certain pressure field distribution situations may affect in an increase of water level on the coast and thereby block the outflow of river waters. In this paper {{an example of the}} limitations of inland navigation in the estuarine part of the Lower Oder under the weather conditions on the southern Baltic Sea in autumn 2016 is presented. For the analysis area of Szczecin <b>Waterway</b> Node and <b>section</b> of Oder River from Szczecin to Gryfino was chosen. Based on data the weather and navigational conditions of the area of the Lower Oder were assessed. Occurring winds, currents and changes in water level has been analyzed. In the situations of unfavorable raise of the water level in the river, inland navigation is redirected to the section of Regalica River, and a section of the port of Szczecin region is closed. This causes obvious difficulties and results in prolonged ships routes. Additional obstacle that take place here is an arbitrarily determined time of railway bridge span lifting in Szczecin Podjuchy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to assess, on the basis of a number of indicative examples, the time needed to build new and replace old transportation and energy systems, and their infrastructures. Most of the examples are taken from the United States, since the United States has been one of the few countries to experience most of the technological changes that occurred during the last 200 years. However, because most of these technological changes were subsequently disseminated throughout the world, the examples also indicate the dynamics of these processes elsewhere. Within the scope of this paper, the use of the term infrastructure is rather narrow, referring only to transportation and energy grids and networks, and other components of these two systems. These two systems are interesting because they played a crucial role in the economic and technological development process, are very capital intensive and, in general, have long lifetimes. The analysis of the historical development of these two systems will include a quantitative description of performance improvement, the general evolution of a particular infrastructure, and the replacement of old by new technologies and infrastructures in terms of their relative market shares. We use the term performance as a multidimensional concept (i. e., as a vector rather than a scalar indicator) and, where appropriate, measure the size of an infrastructure as a function of time. The first section describes the evolution of transport system and their related infrastructures. The analysis starts, somewhat unconventionally, with the youngest technologies, aircraft and airways, and ends with the oldest transport networks [...] canals and <b>waterways.</b> The second <b>section</b> describes the evolution of energy consumption and pipelines as an example of dedicated transport infrastructures...|$|R
