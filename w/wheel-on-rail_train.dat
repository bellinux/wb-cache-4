The magnetically levitated train has no wheels, but floats [...] or surfs [...] on an electromagnetic wave, enabling rides at 330 miles per hour. By employing no wheels, maglev eliminates the friction, and concomitant heat, associated with conventional <b>wheel-on-rail</b> <b>train</b> configurations. There are two basic types of non-contact Maglev systems Electro Dynamic Suspension and Electro Magnetic Suspension. EDS {{is commonly known as}} "Repulsive Levitation, " and EMS is commonly known as "Attractive Levitation. " Each type of Maglev system requires propulsion as well as "levitation. " The various projects above use different techniques for propulsion, but they are all variations of the LIM or Linear Synchronous Motor. The conversion to a linear geometry has a far greater effect on induction motor performance than on that of synchronous motors. The cost of making the guide way is a high percentage of the total investment for a maglev system. The comparison looks even better for maglev when the terrain becomes difficult. Many of the tunnels, embankments, and cuttings necessary for roads and railroads are avoided because maglev guide ways can be easily adapted to the topography. The Maglev system requires a slightly larger start-up capital construction cost, its operating cost [...] because it deploys electricity in electromagnets in an extraordinarily efficient manner, rather than using as a fuel source coal, gas or oil can be onehalf that of conventional rail. The crucial point is that maglev will set off a transportation and broader scientific explosion...|$|E
