50|$|The TV swivel {{system is}} simply screwed to the wall, a cabinet {{or a piece}} of {{furniture}} just like any conventional flat-screen <b>wall</b> <b>bracket.</b> Depending on the direction in which it is mounted, the TV swivel system can be swivelled outward either to the left or right. This makes it possible to watch television from a variety of different viewing positions and angles. TV swivel systems can be specially designed and combined with further devices in order to achieve invisible TV installation. A number of manufacturers also offer the possibility to programme the viewing angle down to the exact degree angle.|$|E
50|$|The {{influence}} of English style upon the Skolfields {{is apparent in}} the renovations made to the house at this time. The family purchased many new decorations for the home in England, including carpets, a piano, a Chippendale <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> and several paintings by J.B. Smith, Spinks, Enser and Woolett. The Skolfields also updated their furniture by purchasing many pieces in the popular Eastlake style. English influence led the Skolfields to separate the bathtub and toilet added to the former carriage house into two separate rooms. In 1891, the home was wired for electricity and circa 1894-1895, the home {{was connected to the}} new town sewer lines.|$|E
50|$|The Palladian {{house was}} built by Hugh Hume-Campbell, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, in 1750. His bust, albeit a plaster copy, sits on a <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> in the saloon. The {{original}} is in Mellerstain House, another important Borders house which has intimate historical links with Marchmont. Before its completion the family lived in Redbraes Castle, the diminutive ruins {{of which can be}} seen in front of the present house by the steading. At Redbraes lived Sir Patrick Hume of Polwarth, later Patrick Hume, 1st Earl of Marchmont. His portrait by William Aikman, c 1720, and framed by a George II period gilt mirror, hangs above the chimneypiece in the drawing room. It is not coincidence that a near identical portrait hangs in the Music Room at Mellerstain.|$|E

5000|$|A cartel {{clock is}} a {{cartouche}} shaped clock designed to hang directly on a wall, very commonly executed in fire-gilt bronze (a.k.a. ormolu). The form {{is a more}} unified development from a wall-mounted bracket clock standing upon its separate, complementary bracket characteristic of the Régence (1715-23), which continued to be stylish in Paris through the 1740s. In Paris, where the ébéniste's wooden contribution to the case and <b>wall</b> <b>bracket,</b> conceived as complements in design, was by degrees overshadowed by gilt-bronze mounts. wholly gilt-bronze bracket clock cases became most common by ca 1730. The cartel clock, incorporating clock case and bracket in a single unified organic sculptural conception, was a Rococo invention initiated in Paris. Highly ornate Rococo examples exist, with flowing, asymmetrical and curvilinear designs, the most notable being a series of unified cartel clocks in half a dozen related models, dateable to the 1730s and 40s and attributed (some of them signed) to Charles Cressent.The style that originated in Paris was used there from ca 1730 through the reign of Louis XV. With the return of classicism under Louis XVI, however, cartel clocks fell from favour in Paris, where the domestic clock moved to the mantel. In provincial French cities, and elsewhere on the Continent, cartel clocks {{were made in the}} neoclassical style (illustration, right) The style was adapted in Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, with the style used for clocks executed in wood and decorated with gold leaf. Such cartel clocks were made into the 19th century. With the [...] "Second Rococo" [...] beginning ca 1830, mid-18th century models were revived or imitated.Commons:Category:Cartel clocks ...|$|E
40|$|The {{project was}} carried out in {{cooperation}} with the department of product development IOS at IKEA. The work included improvements of a new existing product that Ikea soon will release on the market, Observatör, a <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> for flat screens. The product is supposed to fulfil the needs within this market for IKEA. However, since Ikea was not satisfied with it, our work was to carry out the improvements that were specified {{in the beginning of the}} project. Another task in the project was to develop a side-product that is supposed to be used together with Obeservatör for storage of DVD/decoders. The project included labour as problem definition to final technical drawings and a prototype. In the project start information was gathered to understand the current market and its competition. The next step was to start solving the problem in a creative way through brainstorming and concept drawings. When the final concepts were chosen they were developed into final solutions with technical drawings. The final result meets the main requirements that were stated in the beginning of the project. The <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> is now in two main parts that will make the assembly on the wall easier, the joints between the parts and the shafts works smother at the same time as the demands for tilt, rotation etc. works successfully. The final result is two user friendly products, Observatör and storage for DVD/decoders that have the same interface so the costumer easy can see that they are supposed to be used together...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an enhancement of the Nimrod/O optimization tool by interfacing DEMO, an external multiobjective optimization algorithm. DEMO is {{a variant of}} differential evolution – an algorithm that has attained much popularity in the research community, and this work represents {{the first time that}} true multiobjective optimizations have been performed with Nimrod/O. A modification to the DEMO code enables multiple objectives to be evaluated concurrently. With Nimrod/O’s support for parallelism, this can reduce the wall-clock time significantly for compute intensive objective function evaluations. We describe the usage and implementation of the interface and present two optimizations. The first is a two objective mathematical function in which the Pareto front is successfully found after only 30 generations. The second test case is the three-objective shape optimization of a rib-reinforced <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> using the Finite Element software, Code_Aster. The interfacing of the already successful packages of Nimrod/O and DEMO yields a solution that we believe can benefit a wide community, both industrial and academic...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} retaining devices {{which are used}} to latch two elements or parts together and, more particularly, to gate latches for use in locking a gate to a <b>wall</b> <b>bracket</b> in a water pit utilized to store or handle hazardous materials. A retaining latch is provided comprising a latch plate which is rotatably mounted to {{each end of the}} top of the gate and a recessed opening, formed in the gate frame, for engaging an edge of the latch plate. The latch plate is circular in profile with one side cut away or flat, such that the latch plate is D-shaped. The remaining circular edge of the latch plate comprises steps of successively reduced thickness. The stepped edge of the latch plate fits inside a recessed opening formed in the gate frame. As the latch plate is rotated, alternate steps of the latch plate are engaged by the recessed opening. When the latch plate is rotated such that the flat portion of the latch plate faces the recessed opening in the gate frame, there is no connection between the opening and the latch plate and the gate is unlatched from the gate frame...|$|E

50|$|Riahi {{started out}} as an {{engineer}} and road-builder, eventually acquiring an apartment in France. He started collecting in the 1970s, in order to furnish the apartment in the grandest possible tradition. Riahi swiftly achieved notoriety among French dealers due to regularly outbidding them on the finest pieces at auction. Among the master craftsmen represented in the collection were André Charles Boulle, the ébénistes Bernard II van Risamburgh and Martin Carlin; and carpets and tapestry from the Savonnerie and Gobelins manufactories. Some of his individual pieces included <b>wall</b> <b>brackets</b> from Marie Antoinette's bedroom and a cabinet made for the Comtesse de Provence. 59 pieces from the collection, including pieces with royal provenances, were purchased in 2000 by Christie's and estimated to raise 25 million dollars when auctioned off.

25|$|Huddersfield Parish Church is a Grade II listed {{building}} on Byram Street, Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. There {{has been a}} church on this site since the 12th century, and it was rebuilt 1834–36 by James Pigott Pritchett. Barber effected an interior re-ordering of this building {{at a cost of}} £2,500 in 1873, as follows. The box pews were replaced by open and cushioned stalls, and the gallery seats were cleaned and painted. The old pulpit was replaced with one of carved oak in Gothic design. There was new flooring of encaustic tiles made by Maw's and laid by W and S Thornton of Huddersfield. John Brook of High Street, Huddersfield, did the painting; possibly decorative fresco or stencilled work. There was gas lighting by brass standards and <b>wall</b> <b>brackets.</b> The whole of the woodwork, including stalls, pulpits, screens (including the screen work in the north and south transepts) was designed by Barber and carried out under his supervision. James Christie was the sole contractor for all the woodwork, and Joseph Shaw was one of the sub-contractors for the carving, working under Christie.|$|R
