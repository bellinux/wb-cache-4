500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I just got out of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Joan Ganz {{was born}} on November 30, 1929 in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline (née Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was a native Phoenician {{who was born in}} the U.S. so that his mother could receive medical care after his birth. [...] Her {{grandfather}} Emil Ganz was a tailor from Walldorf, Thuringia [...] in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms. [...] Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings. [...] She described her childhood as [...] "upper middle class, country club atmosphere" [...] and stated, [...] "I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five". Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is good to}} see you {{pulling out}} all right," [...] {{answered}} Alfred. [...] "I tell you, I feared you were in a bad way <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> you <b>out</b> of the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're in the trunk. There, now. And they're {{just the}} same as they was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them <b>out</b> of the office. I hain't looked into them, I hain't touched them. But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if you warn't in no hurry, I'd--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were pretty}} heavy, Jack. Once or twice I thought of dumping {{my share of}} them, but it's {{fortunate}} that Hollin, who seemed to suspect my intentions, kept his eye on me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> played <b>out.</b> You see, an assayer we took them to found that they were rich in lead and silver." ...|$|R
60|$|FALDER. [Sullenly] I {{meant to}} write <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> there--I would have repaid the money.|$|E
60|$|My indignation ebbed away, {{and into}} my being rushed the tides of fear. I saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and lowly. Each day I {{resolved}} more emphatically to make no rumpus <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> All I asked, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> {{was a chance to}} fade away from the landscape. And that was just what I did do when I was released. I kept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for Pennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{particular}} {{happened on}} our journey to London, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at the station, a tall footman, whose face I remembered, {{came up and}} touched his hat, and asked what luggage I had.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall soon {{be healthy}} and strong again, mother. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of these fine clothes, which I only put on because I {{could not get}} into my old ones, and you have fed me up for a week on good English beef, {{you will see that}} there is no such great change in me after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> {{shut the}} window, and went away fifty yards or so, where I {{could hear them}} come back. Presently I heard some {{footsteps}} coming from the opposite direction. Then I heard a voice I knew say, [...] "There is the fire; we shall soon know whether the poor lad has got ashore." ...|$|R
60|$|G. I {{meant to}} lie about my reasons <b>when</b> <b>I</b> began, but--I've <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the habit of lying to you, old man. Jack, you won't?--But I know you won't.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of {{the room}} I felt limply flat, like a {{squeezed}} lemon, and the doorkeeper in his glass cage, where I stopped to get my hat and tip him a shilling, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> {{of the van}} yesterday. I never knew before what sunshine was. I {{hope it will be}} a sunny day when I go out for the last time!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at my station I {{felt for}} the first time ill at ease. Why was I getting out at this wayside place, on to the great, raw high-road? I did not know. But I set off walking. It was nearly tea-time.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>out</b> of {{the tree}} I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in {{the edge of the}} water, and tugged at them till <b>I</b> <b>got</b> them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was {{covering}} up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.|$|R
60|$|My {{return home}} to Lady Grove was a very {{different}} thing from what <b>I</b> had anticipated <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>out</b> to sea with my load of quap and fancied the Perfect-Filament was safe within my grasp. As I walked through the evening light along the downs, the summer stillness seemed like the stillness of something newly dead. There were no lurking workmen any more, no cyclists on the high road.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{could make}} no way with my knife; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> the bar <b>out</b> of the grate, I managed faster. I'll put this one back now, {{or some of}} those folks down below may notice that we have got it loose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But that's not all! I {{saw them}} again under the gas <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> I was very near {{trying to speak}} to her, but I lost sight {{of her in the}} throng; but I saw that face so like Master Michael, only scared and just ready to cry.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't call it home, Miss Mohun,' he said. 'I {{have not}} had that these many years; but I declare, the first sound of our county dialect, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at the station, made my heart leap into my mouth. I could have shaken hands with the fellow.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} street and met the {{disgorging}} picture-palaces capering on the pavements and humming it (for he had put the gramophones on with the films), and when I saw far to the south the red electrics flash 'Gubby' across the Thames, I feared more than ever.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> at last <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> was a shadow. But {{everybody}} {{was full of}} attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly up toward health and strength again; so I gained fast.|$|R
6000|$|Carrie said nothing, {{and he went}} on. [...] "Now I come {{to think}} of it, I've been strangely dull. You have cooked for us, and cared for us in ways we didn't know. I'd {{sometimes}} a notion my clothes were wearing longer than they ought--there was a jacket I meant to mend and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> it <b>out</b> one evening I couldn't find the hole." [...] He paused and spread out his hands. [...] "Well, that's the kind of fool I am and the kind of girl you are!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It is {{certainly}} the jug I bought for you,” said Wilfrid, looking closely at it; “it was in my portmanteau <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> my bath-robe <b>out</b> this morning, before going to my bath, {{and it was not}} there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> unlocked the portmanteau on my return. Some one had taken it while I was away from the room.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was late}} {{yesterday}} evening before I arrived at Bingen. A servant {{was waiting to}} take my portmanteau, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the coach. After first asking my name, he communicated to me the melancholy tidings of dear Mr. Engelman's death. He had sunk under a fit of apoplexy, at an early hour that morning.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{no sign of}} {{the girl}} in the plantation. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> through the sand-hills, on to the beach, there she was, in her little straw bonnet, and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her {{deformed}} shoulder as much as might be--there she was, all alone, looking out on the quicksand and the sea.|$|E
6000|$|It DID break too, {{and down}} I {{came into the}} slush; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of it, I can tell you I didn't look much like the Venuses or the Apollor Belvidearis what I used to dress and titivate up for my shop window when I was in the {{hairdressing}} line, or smell quite so elegant as our rose-oil. Faugh! what a figure I was! ...|$|E
60|$|When the Blefuscudians saw {{the fleet}} moving in order, and me pulling at the end, {{they set up}} a scream of grief and despair that it is {{impossible}} to describe. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of danger <b>I</b> stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival. I then took off my spectacles, and after waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput.|$|R
2500|$|On {{appearing}} in HDYSAPLM? Mulholland said, [...] "It was very, very tough. My goal {{from the beginning}} had been {{to make it to}} the final and then let the public decide. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> voted <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> was absolutely devastated. I was so close and knocked at the final hurdle! It was a big shock to the system." [...] Andrew Lloyd Webber has since admitted that he made a mistake in sending her home too early from the BBC show, and is now immensely proud of the singer and her performances at the London Palladium as Maria; Lloyd Webber announced her recruitment saying her audition was [...] "sensational." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this was}} too much for me, so I slipped off again to be alone, and this time headed for the forest. Warm patches of sunlight, like gold, brightened the ground; dark patches of sky, like ocean blue, gleamed between the treetops. Hardly a rustle of wind in the fine-toothed green {{branches}} disturbed the quiet. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> fully <b>out</b> of sight of camp, I started to run as if I were a wild Indian. My running had no aim; just sheer mad joy of the grand old forest, the smell of pine, the wild silence and beauty loosed the spirit in me so it had to run, and I ran with it till the physical being failed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh. This was curious: When I {{took off}} my dress last night--it was a darling dress, I loved it so, {{but of course the}} mud had spoiled it. I cried over it and----No matter. But my white silk {{stockings}} were all torn, and the strange thing is, I don't know whether I caught my legs in the briers <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> to look at the sign-post, or whether Cy scratched me when I was fighting him off." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{hesitated a}} little before he replied. [...] "Well, I was always {{interested}} in them, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> among the Payonnay I tried to get at their notions of life; {{but they are a}} strange people--a secretive people--and I couldn't win their confidence for a long time. One day while on a hunting expedition I came suddenly upon a crew of wood-choppers who had an old man tied to a tree and were about to burn him alive--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} dark, where my hot face cooled in the wind, my relief equaled my other feelings. Sampson {{had told me}} to clear out, and {{although}} I did not {{take that as a}} dismissal I considered I would be wise to leave the ranch at once. Daylight might disclose my footprints between the walls, but even if it did not, my work there was finished. So I went to my room and packed my few belongings.|$|E
6000|$|And what a ride it was, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> fairly <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of London; and the {{afternoon}} brightening of the foggy atmosphere, showed the smooth, empty high road before me! The dashing {{through the rain}} that still fell; {{the feel of the}} long, powerful, regular stride of the horse under me; the thrill of that physical sympathy which establishes itself between the man and the steed; the whirling past carts and waggons, saluted by the frantic barking of dogs inside them; the flying by roadside alehouses, with the cheering of boys and half-drunken men sounding for an instant behind me, then lost in the distance--this was indeed to occupy, to hurry on, to annihilate the tardy hours of solitude on my wedding day, exactly as my heart desired! ...|$|R
5000|$|On August 14, {{he had a}} {{breakthrough}} performance in the Grade I Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap {{at a distance of}} [...] miles over a yielding turf course at Saratoga. The favorite, Balto Star, went to the early lead and set moderate fractions for the first mile, then was passed in the stretch by Request For Parole. Better Talk Now saved ground early in the race then swung wide in the stretch and accelerated rapidly, winning by [...] lengths. [...] "I felt like I had a lot of horse," [...] said Dominguez, [...] "but once you get them out, you never know if they're going to respond. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>out,</b> he responded so nicely." [...] Better Talk Now earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 106 for the win.|$|R
60|$|The Blefuscudians, {{who had not}} {{the least}} {{imagination}} of what I intended, were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of grief and despair as {{it is almost impossible}} to describe or conceive. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of danger, <b>I</b> stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput.|$|R
