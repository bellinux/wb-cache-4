30|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of the challenges associated with cheese whey fermentation to ABE, there is need to evaluate inexpensive non-whey-lactose-based substrates for ABE fermentation. <b>Milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> is such a substrate. Milk dust {{is a blend of}} different <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> left over after industrial milk packaging. <b>Milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> constitutes a considerable hazard because suspensions of milk dust at 75 – 1000 g/m 3 of air can explode or self-ignite upon contact with hot surfaces (Davis et al. 2011; Ministry of Labor, New Zealand 1993). A drier with a capacity of 10 metric tons per h can generate 80.3 kg of airborne <b>milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> (Prevention of dust explosions in the food industry (2010)). The projected <b>milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> production (including skimmed and whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder)</b> in the USA in 2012 was approximately 1.02 million metric tons, which translates into 116.44 metric tons per h (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2012). At present, some of the <b>milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> generated from the dairy industry is used as livestock feed; however, this enormous amount of waste (equivalent to 1.15 [*]×[*] 1014 Joules/year) has potential as a substrate for ABE fermentation. <b>Milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> constitutes predominantly of lactose, with small amounts of protein, fat and minerals. In addition, it retains all the natural properties of milk, such as color, flavor and solubility. Hence, upon mixing with <b>water,</b> <b>milk</b> dust <b>powder</b> resembles raw <b>milk</b> in appearance. In addition, milk dust does not contain urea, citric, lactic, and uric acids, found in low amounts in whey (Chatzipashali and Stamatis 2012; Foda et al. 2010; Napoli 2009), which can adversely affect fermentation efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of instant skim milk and whole <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} with special respect to lactose crystallization during storage. X-ray diffraction {{analysis was used to}} confirm the crystallization. Some samples were ashed in a plasma asher and the residues were also examined by scanning electron microscopy. The structures of instant skim milk and whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> particles were well-preserved after the ashing procedure. The crystallization of ~X-Iactose hydrate occurred in instant skim milk and whole <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> according to moisture uptake. In instant skim <b>milk</b> <b>powder,</b> ~X-Iactose hydrate crystals were observed on the particle surface. In whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder,</b> numerous droplets of free fat appeared on the surface of particles stored under conditions favoring the crystallization of ~XIactose hydrate except few lactose crystals. Only, 6 -lactose was in the state of crystal in whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> stored at 3 rC for 5 months at a relative humidity of less than 20 %. In fresh <b>powders</b> of skim <b>milk</b> and whole milk, prismatic crystals of lactose formed in Heinz fluid, whereas in stored powders, they did not...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparatively}} slow {{development of}} the <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> industry can probably {{be attributed to the}} many difficulties involved in the economic manufacture of whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> of high quality. While occasional new processes were invented and patents granted, the commercial production of <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> dates back only to the closing years of the nineteenth century. However despite the many improvements in processing since that time, whole <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> is still a relatively unstable product. The greatly increased demand because of the war has again focused attention on the difficulties involved in the preparation of a product which would resist the unfavourable conditions of military requirements. It was found at the outset of this investigation that available methods were not sufficiently sensitive to detect incipient chemical changes which occur in whole <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> and which result in disagreeable flavours and odours.

40|$|Physicochemical, {{microbiological}} and {{sensory characteristics}} of <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> packed in Sudan were investigated and compared with international quality standards. The compositions (moisture, fat, protein, ash and lactose) of the locally packed <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> are almost insignificantly different (p < 0. 05) {{and they are}} comparable to the compositional quality in US and Argentina. Despite the significant (p < 0. 05) variations in acidity and pH between <b>milk</b> <b>powder</b> samples, their levels remained within the acceptable standard levels. Results also showed that most <b>milk</b> <b>powders</b> packed in Sudan had partial solubility in water, {{in comparison with the}} instantly soluble standards. Microbiologically the samples were safe, but organoleptically they considered of fair quality...|$|R
