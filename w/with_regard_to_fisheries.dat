40|$|Abstract. —Preservation of {{ecosystem}} structure is the guiding principle {{by which the}} Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) endeavors to manage the harvests of living resources of the Southern Ocean (with the notable exception of marine mammals). The experiences of CCAMLR <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> on Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, mackerel icefish Champhsocephalus gunnari and Patagonian toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides are reviewed. The unifying paradigm employed by CCAMLR is {{the application of a}} precautionary approach, which explicitly incorporates uncertainty in the analysis of risk of exceeding defined management criteria. Each fishery, however, presents a unique set of circumstances and unresolved concerns. While the current fishery for krill is small compared to the precautionary limit established by CCAMLR, fishing effort concentrated near colonies of land-breeding krill predators may pose a threat in addition to those posed by the broader-scale influence of climatic cycles and trends on krill production. Management of the fishery on mackerel icefish relies on frequent surveys and short-term population projections because of high variability in natural mortality and is further complicated by the dual role of icefish as both consumers of krill and alternative prey to krill predators. While CCAMLR management of the fishery on toothfish is based on longer-term projections and has demonstrated success in addressing incidental mortality of seabirds, large-scale misreporting of catches, particularly in the Indian Ocean sector, threatens to compromise the viability of the fishery.

40|$|Three {{fundamental}} foraging {{patterns in}} air-breathing marine vertebrates have been described: epipelagic, mesopelagic and benthic. Many sea lion species {{with access to}} extensive continental shelves {{have been described as}} benthic foragers. Coincidently these species are considered threatened. The Galapagos sea lion Zalophus wollebaeki, a top predator in the Galapagos Islands, is also considered threatened in this ecosystem. Sea lions at {{the central part of the}} archipelago have access to a vast continental shelf. For this reason we hypothesized that sea lions within this region would dive benthically. In addition, effective protection and conservation of this species requires knowledge of their foraging patterns and habitat utilization. We investigated the diving behaviour and habitat utilization of female Z. wollebaeki of a centrally located colony situated inside the highest density area of the population using time-depth recorders and satellite telemetry. Three distinct foraging patterns were found and described (shallow, deep and bottom divers), and individuals utilizing each pattern foraged in different locations. Epipelagic, mesopelagic and benthic dives were exhibited in the sea lions’ diving behaviour, but these dive types were not exclusively associated with a foraging pattern. Between foraging trips females hauled out more frequently on other islands than they did on their breeding colony. The finding of 3 distinct foraging patterns that differ spatially has direct implications for management, particularly <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries</b> interactions. Marine protected areas can be implemented in the regions described as Z. wollebaeki foraging areas.

40|$|Fisheries {{can have}} {{profound}} {{impacts on the}} structure and functioning of marine ecosystems and affect seabird populations. For seabirds, impacts can include direct mortality in fishing gear, but fisheries also represent an abundant source of food that may otherwise be inaccessible. Previous studies with seabirds have revealed the occurrence of individual foraging specializations, and therefore in scavenging species some individuals may have a higher propensity to feed on fisheries discharges {{than the rest of}} the population. Here we used recently developed techniques (spatio-temporal match of positions) to detect interactions between black-browed albatrosses Thalassarche melanophris and fishing vessels, and also stable isotope analysis of tissues with different turnovers, to investigate long-term individual specialization in fishery waste products. We combined global positioning system tracking data from 89 birds with vessel monitoring system data from the entire fleet operating around the Falklands Islands, in 2009 and 2011. Interactions with vessels (freezer/factory bottom trawlers) occurred in 15 out of 89 independent albatross trips. Among individuals tracked in both years, those that associated with fisheries in 2009 were not more likely to do so again in 2011. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in whole blood and feathers of albatrosses that interacted with trawlers were similar to those of individuals that did not. Also, we found no correlation between feather and blood isotopic ratios of carbon or nitrogen, indicating no long-term consistency in the isotopic niche of study birds. These results suggest no specialization of individual albatrosses <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries.</b> Studies of other albatrosses have also failed to show long-term trophic consistency, which may indicate that scavenging albatrosses, a group particularly threatened by fisheries activity, do not specialize in discards. Therefore, any management actions leading to a reduction of discards will be beneficial, decreasing the numbers of birds behind vessels and consequently the likelihood of incidental mortality...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{important}} oceanic climate {{features such as}} sea surface temperature, sea level, pH, and rainfall are becoming evident {{as a result of}} climate change. In this review, the influence of the primary factor, the water temperature on the biological systems is presented. Seawater temperature influences biological systems at four levels: organismal, population, community and ecosystem. At organismal level, temperature has direct influence on two vital life traits of fish, namely, food utilisation and spawning. Growth rate of fish increases with increasing temperature within the optimal temperature window. It is likely that the food utilization parameters may be operating at an elevated level in fishes at higher temperatures, demanding higher food supply to attain faster growth rate. Fishes may change their phenology of reproductive activity to adapt to elevated temperatures for spawning and larval survival. At population level, temperature and other factors related to climate change may strongly influence distribution and abundance, evidences for which are accumulating in Indian seas. As the tolerance and adaptation capacities are different between species, the species that adapt and gain from warming are increasingly becoming dominant. On the other hand, those species, which are already at the threshold limits are vulnerable and lose to adaptable ones. At community level, this is reflected as changes in species composition over the years. All these changes have the potential to alter the structure and function of ecosystems. Habitat destruction, pollution, energy production, mining, fisheries, aquaculture, and invasive species are all affecting marine ecosystems and may exacerbate the effects of climate change. Effectively reducing climate change and other human-related threats requires integrated management actions with the goal of increasing adaptive capacity of ecosystems. As a first step, robust indicators need to be developed to understand the changes at ecosystem level. <b>With</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries,</b> the changes pose problems on the effectiveness of fisheries management measures. Reducing fishing pressure would be a major step to increase the capacity of fish stocks to adapt to environmental changes. It is important that a concerted effort is made to address the issues related to sustainability of tropical marine fisheries and ecosystems by considering climate change as a component of a suite of anthropogenic interventions...|$|E

Although there are many features of Lake Victoria, which are of intense interest to scientist, it is fish biology and economics that have received the most attention The study program had a multidisciplinary character and included the themes specified in the objectives. Methods of research within the seven interrelated themes are given in this report. Together with data from historical sources and literature collect during the LVEMP project, they provide basic knowledge about the meteorology, river regime, hydraulics, sediment transport and deposition, land use characteristics of their drainage basins (watershed), nutrient fluxes, biota associations and environmental impacts The Water Quality and Ecosystem Management Components of the Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project (LVEMP) in the three East African countries collaborating on LVEMP phase 1 have made considerable progress towards understanding Lake Victoria water quality and its ecosystem as well as effects of resource utilization and exploitation on the lake and its catchment. The components have been able to collect considerable amounts of data and information. In order to achieve LVEMP objectives and Water Quality and Ecosystem Management objectives, in particular, a well-coordinated analysis, synthesis and interpretation of all relevant data was required. This synthetic report documents and explains the changes that have taken place over the recent decades, and it provide an overview of the present water quality status of the lake as well as identifying past changes and continuing trends that may require remedial action. The report provides enough detailed information and spatial resolution at the regional scale to support environmental decision making in regards to possible remediation of undesirable changes that have reduced beneficial uses of Lake Victoria biological and water resources. To achieve the desired synthesis report, a National Consultant, Dr Joseph Abuodha and an international consultant, Prof. Robert Hecky of the University of Waterloo, Canada, were retained to guide and assist the process of preparation of this National Report as well as integration of these national reports and other studies into the required regional synthesis report.

40|$|Reviewing the {{conservation}} situation in Indonesia, {{we see that}} concern for animals outweighs that for plants. Sumatra with its richer fauna of large mammals, is better cared for than Borneo with its richer flora*. Too often in the reports, a forest is called a forest, {{to the neglect of}} the amazing diversity among the lowland primary rain forests. The absence of botanical expertise beyond the surface is evident throughout, and but occasionally regretted. In view of the great species diversity, and of {{the fact that this is}} located in primary vegetations, for animals of nearly all groups as well as for plants, plant conservation clearly comprises at least half {{the conservation}}ist’s job, in a humid tropical forest region like Malesia. A botanist’s contribution can be summarized in the following areas: 1) State of the vegetation. Most instructive is the table in R. F. DASMANN e. a., ’Ecological Principles for Economic Development’ (1973) p. 60 - 61, where an elementary comparison is given between Pioneer, Early secondary, Late secondary, and Climax forest, on 21 points, and the table by VAN STEENIS in UNESCO, ’Natural resources of humid tropical Asia’ (1974), p. 274 - 275 (in the ’Botanical Panorama’) reviewing all the many factors that exert an influence on vegetations. This is all done in the field; air and ERTS photographs can help. 2) Floristic composition and wealth. These, of course, determine much of the conservation potential of an area, and its position among other reserves as a complete representation of botanical diversity. This diversity is reflected in its value as a gene pool and as a silvicultural resource. This work is done during quick field surveys (or long ones if collections are made for taxonomic purposes) but much can be accomplished in the Herbarium as well. 3) Identifying the useful plants, sources of minor forest products (like rattans, fibre plants, medicinal or toxic plants, wild fruit trees, etc.). A quick survey of I. H. BURKILL’s ’Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula’ (1966), native plants only, revealed that no less than about one third of the flowering plant species in Malaya are useful in some way. 4) Assessment of research potential, on account of important plant families which occur, in view of the state of taxonomic, ecological, phytochemical knowledge about them. This work must be done in the field. 5) Setting up an infra-structure for biological research. The diversity in a reserve is roughly to be mapped, trails laid out, common plant species marked, identified, labelled, voucher specimens collected and made available. 6) Scanning of literature, in order to support other workers. Only a botanist can be expected to have access to the many publications on reserves, vegetations, landscapes, plant families and genera, and to have an idea about their very unequal value. 7) Interpreting vegetation maps, which are a many-purpose instrument to land assessment and integrated planning, as well explained by A. W. KÜCHLER in his book ”Vegetation mapping’ (1967). The ’International bibliography of vegetation maps’ vol. 3 (1968) by the same author lists the maps of Malesia and parts of it. 8) Decision-making, based on all foregoing points. Which areas are worth keeping, what gaps are there to be filled, what measures are to be taken or not to be taken to enhance their conservation value. 9) Advising and contributing to integrated development, with regard to land use planning, reforestation, watershed management, and other activities in which conservation must play a part. 10) Algologists are indispensable <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>fisheries,</b> and in general, management of open water resources and coasts. If we are to specify the qualifications of a conservation botanist for Malesia, it is evident that he must have a wide knowledge of plant families, and be at home in taxonomic reference works. It should also be emphasized, that there are considerable botanical differences between on the one hand Sumatra Malaya Java Lesser Sunda Islands Borneo Philippines, and on the other Celebes Moluccas New Guinea Solomons. Particularly New Guinea holds a place of its own, also because of the fauna, and of the characteristic patterns of landownership which reflects upon conservation policy...|$|E

In view of the nature of the artisanal fishery in Tanga and the capacity at government level in Tanzania, co-management was recommended for the Tanga region. Permanent fishery reserves or closed areas appear to be the only suitable management tool for the multi-species reef fishery. A drastic reduction in fishing effort is necessary in order that populations of reef fishes can recover and alternative sources of income such as mariculture, agriculture and tourism will have to be developed. Further, the Tanzanian government has to take responsibility for the eradication of dynamite fishing along the coast and international pressure should be brought to bear on the country in this regard...|$|R

In marine fishing, the efficiency of fishing methods in general depends {{on the ability of}} the fishermen to locate the fishing grounds where the fish are abundant and to catch them there. In case of some of the pelagic fisheries like Indian mackerel, in the exploitation of which the fishermen rely on the arrival of the fish shoals in the inshore area, the fishing efficiency will depend on the ability and skill of the fishermen to identify the time and period when the mackerel shoals are most abundant in the inshore waters and to concentrate most of their effort at the time to catch the fish. The present paper provides a method for measuring quantitatively the fishing efficiency of the fishermen of the Karwar area <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the mackerel <b>fishery.</b> Though the results of the quantitative analysis will specifically relate to the efficiency of the Karwar fishermen, it is believed that the same will be applicable to the fishermen of the entire Mysore coast, if not the entire Indian coast...|$|R

The joint commission entered at once upon its task and on 8 May concluded a treaty which received the prompt approval of the two governments. Aside from the settlement of the dispute growing out of the so-called Alabama Claims, provision was made for the adjustment of the differences <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the northeastern <b>fisheries</b> by the appointment of a mixed commission to meet at Halifax and pass upon the relative value of certain reciprocal privileges granted each of the contracting parties. In 1877, the Halifax Fisheries Commission appointed under the Treaty directed the United States to pay $5,500,000 to the British Government as compensation. Finally, provision was made for submitting to the arbitration by William I, German Emperor, of the Pig War dispute concerning the maritime boundary in Puget Sound. Thus, the treaty profoundly affected International Law, with subsequent effects upon the 1878 Congress of Berlin.|$|R

Microfilm. xi, 151 leaves ill. 29 cmThis {{dissertation}} is a {{case study}} analysis {{of the relationship between}} trade policy and renewable resource utilization in the fisheries industry of Thailand. The main research objective is a determination whether protection policy has been directed to support the utilization of resources in an industry where the internationally comparative advantage lies, The theories of effective protection are combined with comparative advantage analysis using models of domestic resource cost and revealed comparative advantage to serve this purpose. The study indicates that the fisheries industry in Thailand is economically advantageous both in terms of foreign exchange earned compared to domestic resource cost spent, and in terms of export performance in the world market. The selected Thai fisheries activities in this study show the substantial degree of export potential. Thailand's protection system <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> the <b>fisheries</b> industry, however, does not provide neutral incentives to either production or processing. In fact, a penalty of negative protection still exists in this industry. The indicators estimated from both the industrial survey data and the input-output structure exhibit similar conclusions. The growth of the Thai fisheries production and exports, therefore, cannot be attributed to the protection policy, rather it is the potential of the industry in terms of comparative advantage in resource use that enables it to survive and succeed. The study recommends the identification and measurement of the market failures that impede industrialization, and implementation of effective strategies to overcome these failures. The economic incentive system would be rationalized and strengthened to offset the negative protection. The problem regarding the proper management of the fishery resources in the future should also be urgently taken into consideration {{in order to maintain the}} degree of comparative advantage that the Thai fisheries industry currently holds in international trade...|$|R

The new Water Framework Directive will, eventually, also have consequences for the area. What are the consequences of EU Directives aimed at protecting the Wadden Sea area? Provide these Directives effective protection against harmful activities? These questions have been dealt with through a case study on the decision-making process <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> mechanical cockle <b>fisheries</b> in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea in 2004. Also, data obtained from other European research projects into {{the effectiveness of the}} Directives have been analyzed. These studies indicate that especially the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives can be very effective tools for legal protection of the area. Especially case law by the European Court of Justice has rendered the Directives strong teeth. The Directives offer opportunities to protect the area, without neglecting economic interests, although the effectiveness still very much depends on the political will to take the Directives seriously, and/or on NGOs that go to court, invoking the provisions of the Directives. According to some, the Directives are too effective! Evaluation and amendments of the Wild Birds and Habitats Directives are to be expected within the next few years. The tiger may lose its teeth in this process. ...|$|R

The central theme of {{the paper is the}} effect of globalization processes on local production systems. We discuss the relative power of local and global forces and the interplay between local and global and actors. Moreover, we explain the specific glocalization process of the seafood industry and provide evidence from an empirical study of the success on the French market of shrimps from Madagascar, a pioneering country <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> developing sustainable <b>fisheries</b> and seafood farming. The case shows that local actors have the power and control to set conditions and define strategies for economic growth in the local seafood industry. However, the local production system in turns depends on foreign resources – financial, technical and human, to create economic growth. The success of Madagascar shrimps is therefore the result of the long term interplay between local and global actors...|$|R

They were so thick that many appeared to be afoul of one another; now all standing on this tack, now on that.

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} project <b>to</b> restore <b>fisheries</b> {{resources}} in tributaries located on the Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation, this report details the activities of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe's Fisheries Program for FY 1997 and 1998. This report (1) analyses the effect introduced species and water quality have on the abundance of native trout in Coeur d'Alene Lake and selected target tributaries; (2) details results from an ongoing mark-recapture study on predatory game fish; (3) characterizes spawning habitats in target tributaries and evaluates the effects of fine sediment on substrate composition and estimated emergence success; and (4) provides population estimates for westslope cutthroat trout in target tributaries. Low dissolved oxygen values in the hypolimnion of Coeur d'Alene Lake continue to be a cause for concern <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> available <b>fisheries</b> habitat. Four sample sites in 1997 and eight sample sites in 1998 had measured levels of dissolved oxygen below what is considered optimum (6. 0 mg/L) for cutthroat trout. As well, two sample points located north of the Coeur d'Alene River showed hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen deficits. This could lead to a more serious problem associated with the high concentration of heavy metals bound up in the sediment north of the Coeur d'Alene River. Most likely these oxygen deficits are a result of allochthonous input of organic matter and subsequent decomposition. Sediment loading from tributaries continues to be a problem in the lake. The build up of sediments at the mouths of all incoming tributaries results in the modification of existing wetlands and provides ideal habitat for predators of cutthroat trout, such as northern pike and largemouth bass. Furthermore, increased sediment deposition provides additional substrate for colonization by aquatic macrophytes, which serve as forage and habitat for other non-native species. There {{was no significant difference in}} the relative abundance of fishes in Coeur d'Alene Lake from 1997 to 1998. Four out of the six most commonly sampled species are non-native. Northern pikeminnow and largescale suckers are the only native species among the six most commonly sampled. Northern pikeminnow comprise 8 - 9 % of the electroshocking catch and 18 - 20 % of the gillnet catch. Largescale suckers comprise 24 - 28 % of the electroshocking catch and 9 - 21 % of the gillnet catch. Cutthroat trout and mountain whitefish, on the other hand, comprise less than 1 % of the catch when using electroshocking methods and about 1. 4 % of the gillnet catch. Since 1994, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe Fish, Water and Wildlife Program has conducted an extensive mark-recapture study (Peters et al. 1999). To date, 636 fish have been tagged and 23 fish have been recaptured. We are finding that northern pike have a tendency to migrate from the original sampling site, while largemouth bass appear very territorial, rarely moving from the site where they were tagged. Both species are most commonly associated with shallow, near-shore habitats, where the potential for encountering seasonal migrations of cutthroat trout is maximized. Low-order tributaries provide the most important spawning habitat for cutthroat trout on the Reservation. The mapped distribution of potentially suitable spawning gravel was patchy and did not vary considerably within reaches or between watersheds. Furthermore, the quantity of spawning gravel was low, averaging just 4. 1 % of measured stream area. The lack of a strong association between spawning gravel abundance and several reach characteristics (gradient, proportion of gravel and pea gravel) corroborates the findings of other authors who suggest that local hydrologic features influence spawning gravel availability. Although the distribution of spawning substrate was patchy within the target watersheds, there is probably adequate habitat to support resident and adfluvial spawners because of currently depressed numbers. Spawning gravels in target tributaries of the Reservation contained proportions of fine sediments comparable to those in egg pockets of salmonid redds in the Rocky Mountain region. At 23 of 29 sample sites, low levels of fine sediment led to high predictions of overall embryo survival (mean = 28. 4 %). The estimates of fry production potential at sample sites ranged widely (0. 0 to 31. 2 fry/ 100 square meters) due, primarily, to the quantity of suitable gravels present. Only in the mainstem of Lake Creek were the proportions of both small and coarse fines considered above the levels for these particle sizes (10 % and 30 %, respectively) shown to adversely affect salmonid emergence success. Of the 6 sites where high levels of small or coarse fines were recorded, only the sites located in the mainstem of Lake Creek showed supporting evidence for low recruitment...|$|R
