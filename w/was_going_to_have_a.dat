500|$|After {{the episode}} aired, series {{composer}} Casey Basichis posted a video explaining his inspiration and method of producing the music {{featured in the}} episode. According to the video, Basichis created a [...] "skeleton" [...] of the score in his shower using his voice and a ukulele; the audio was captured on a phone. Originally, the score <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "New York City, taxi, and jazz" [...] feel, but Basichis was unhappy with the genre choice, and changed the feel. For the music that played while the Ice King interacted with Ricardio, Basichis {{was inspired by the}} score from the original seven-minute short. In addition, opera singer Karen Vuong lent her voice to the episode. According to Basichis, Vuong was able to record her vocals successfully in one take. Basichis chose opera because he knew it had a reputation for being [...] "sickeningly intellectual" [...] and [...] "preoccupied with murder", traits that he felt suited Ricardio.|$|E

500|$|On {{a special}} episode of Raw dubbed Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He {{explained}} to fans {{that he was}} informed by doctors that he had conjured a knee injury {{and that he had}} to retire. His speech was regarded as controversial, as Michaels was allegedly unwilling to lose to Bret Hart at WrestleMania 13 (since it was noted that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> rematch with Hart at WrestleMania). Michaels contemplated thoughts of retirement and stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] somewhere down the line. After knee surgery by Dr. James Andrews, Michaels returned a few months later, briefly teaming with Stone Cold Steve Austin to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. In his autobiography, Michaels reveals about his real-life feud with Bret Hart, claiming that Hart did interviews on live television claiming that he [...] was faking his whole injury.|$|E

James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> baby, James said [...] "I went in to see our producer later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E
500|$|Ric Flair and his [...] "executive consultant" [...] Mr. Perfect {{had been}} {{allies in the}} WWF for much of 1992. After Flair lost the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Macho Man Randy Savage at WrestleMania VIII, Flair and Perfect {{initiated}} a feud with Savage. They interfered in Savage's match at SummerSlam and caused him to lose by countout. The rivalry continued, and Flair received assistance from Perfect and Razor Ramon to win the title back from Savage on September 1, which aired on the September 14 edition of WWF Prime Time Wrestling. The WWF planned for Savage to team with the Ultimate Warrior in a match against Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series, but Bobby Heenan announced {{at the end of}} Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI that he had been informed either Savage or Warrior <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new tag team partner. The Ultimate Warrior left the WWF before the match could take place. Two possible reasons have been given for his departure. The first states that he was fired due to allegations of steroid abuse, while the other states that he was upset with the WWF's future plans for his character. The WWF was forced to change the plan and decided to turn Perfect into a babyface (fan favorite) from a heel. Perfect and Flair began having conflicts while teaming together, and Perfect accepted Savage's offer on the November 16 episode of WWF Prime Time Wrestling to team with him at Survivor Series.|$|E

[...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, Steven Moffat revealed that the Eleventh Doctor had an entirely different costume until close {{to the start of}} filming. The original look had a swashbuckling feel which Doctor Who Magazine editor Tom Spilsbury described as [...] "a little like something Captain Jack Sparrow wears in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies". However, Matt Smith was unhappy with the costume as he felt it reflected how someone else would dress the Doctor, rather than how the Doctor would dress himself. Smith also mentioned in a 2012 interview that his Doctor <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] "very long black leather jacket, but it was too Matrix-style". The eventual costume, in particular the bow-tie, was influenced by Patrick Troughton's Second Doctor, after Matt Smith {{fell in love with the}} Troughton story The Tomb of the Cybermen.|$|E

2500|$|The costumes of the prequel trilogy are purposefully more {{elaborate}} {{than those of}} the original trilogy. Lucas asserts that galactic society in the prequels is much more sophisticated. Commenting on the disparities between the two trilogies, Carrie Fisher mused, [...] "Harrison Ford wears the same outfit for three flicks, and I was complaining that I wear, like, six outfits. And my mother – Natalie Portman – she wears three million. She walks through a doorway and there's another outfit. It's like the Liberace of sci-fi changing of clothes." [...] Trisha Biggar reveals that originally there were only three costumes planned for Amidala in The Phantom Menace, but [...] " [...] decided that every time we saw [...] she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different costume."
