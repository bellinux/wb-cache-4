5|$|The Persian {{military}} {{consisted of}} {{a diverse group of}} men drawn across the various nations of the empire. However, according to Herodotus, there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting. The troops were usually armed with a bow, a 'short spear' and a sword or axe, carried a <b>wicker</b> shield. They wore a leather jerkin, although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor. The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy, then closed in to deliver the final blow with spears and swords. The first rank of Persian infantry formations, the so-called 'sparabara', had no bows, carried larger <b>wicker</b> shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears. Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation. The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Though {{some stories}} {{attribute}} its invention to Benjamin Franklin, historians trace the rocking chair's origins to North America {{during the early}} 18th century.

50|$|<b>Wickers</b> worked nights as a {{custodian}} at Northwestern University {{for much}} of his life. After the deaths of both his grandmother and girlfriend in the 1980s, a distraught <b>Wickers</b> found himself homeless and without a stable job. From 1984 to 1990, he attended Cubs games with donated tickets. <b>Wickers</b> was absent at Wrigley Field games for a brief period in 1987, which prompted some Cubs fans to worry that he had died. He eventually contacted news organizations {{to say that he was}} alive and well. Since 1990, most of Wickers' income has come from washing windows in the neighborhood around Wrigley Field. He also makes paid appearances at parties and has starred in local commercials. In 2000, two Wrigleyville bar owners organized a much-publicized fundraiser to provide <b>Wickers</b> with a new pair of dentures.|$|R

5|$|Another {{attempt to}} capture {{the city for the}} Christians was made by Enrique de Guzmán, Second Count of Niebla. The Seventh Siege of Gibraltar ended in {{disaster}} on 31 August 1436 when a landing led by Enrique resulted in his drowning at the Red Sands along with 40 knights and men-at-arms. His body was retrieved by the Moors, beheaded and displayed in a <b>wicker</b> basket above Gibraltar's Sea Gate for the next 26 years.|$|E
5|$|Loughor Castle is a ruined, medieval {{fortification}} {{located in}} the town of Loughor, Wales. The castle was built around 1106 by the Anglo-Norman lord Henry de Beaumont, during the Norman invasion of Wales. The site overlooked the River Loughor and controlled a strategic road and ford running across the Gower Peninsula. The castle was designed as an oval ringwork, probably topped by <b>wicker</b> fence defences, and reused the remains of the former Roman fort of Leucarum.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Ticonderoga, NY9N passes through a valley before curving to the east and {{entering}} the hamlet of Ticonderoga. For the most part, NY9N bypasses the community as it turns north onto <b>Wicker</b> Street, the westernmost north–south through street in the hamlet. Northwest of the former village's center, NY9N meets NY22 and NY74, the latter of which serves as a northerly bypass of Ticonderoga. NY22 joins NY9N here, following the route out of the hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent to Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a <b>wicker</b> replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E
5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got any sleep. The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their <b>wicker</b> cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to have been formed when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or <b>wicker</b> basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and {{is said to be the}} mother of all the goddesses and gods.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been drummed to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with <b>wicker</b> hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers {{and was very}} well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects are reminiscent of the 1970s film The <b>Wicker</b> Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitization, violence as entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E

Pollution and high demand for water {{have reduced the}} productive capacity of farms in the Gaza Strip. Small-scale industries include the production of plastics, construction materials, textiles, furniture, pottery, tiles, copperware, and carpets. Since the Oslo Accords, thousands of residents have been employed in government ministries and security services, UNRWA and international organizations. Minor industries include textiles and food processing. A variety of wares are sold in Gaza's street bazaars, including carpets, pottery, <b>wicker</b> furniture, and cotton clothing.

5|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} a rebellion at York, Marius heads north to aid the defeated legion stationed there. Upon capturing King Oswald and his daughter Boudica, Basilius, {{the son of the}} Emperor, reveals that his brother Commodus (Gerald Kyd) has been captured by the barbarians, whose whereabouts are unknown. Basilius, threatens and forces King Oswald into revealing the location of Commodus, who has been traded to the fearsome men north of Hadrian's Wall. Basilius orders Vitallion and Marius to retrieve him. After crossing the border into Caledonia, the party is ambushed, Vitallion is taken hostage by barbarians, and Marius is separated from his legion. Marius makes his way into the enemy camp, freeing and rallying captured Roman soldiers along the way. He kills the barbarian leader Glott and rescues Commodus and Vitallion from being burned inside a giant <b>Wicker</b> man.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for a Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities for meetings. The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a <b>wicker</b> chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E

Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands {{in the place of}} a {{mannequin}} of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the helium of the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a <b>wicker</b> basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E
5|$|The Persian {{infantry}} used in {{the invasion}} was probably a heterogeneous group drawn from across the empire. However, according to Herodotus, {{there was at least}} a general conformity in the type of armour and style of fighting. The troops were, generally speaking, armed with a bow, 'short spear' and sword, carried a <b>wicker</b> shield, and wore at most a leather jerkin. The one exception to this may have been the ethnic Persian troops, who may have worn a corslet of scale armour. Some contingents would have been armed somewhat differently; for instance, the Saka were renowned axemen. The 'elite' contingents of the Persian infantry seem to have been the ethnic Persians, Medians, Cissians and the Saka; Herodotus specifically mentions the presence of Persians and Saka at Marathon. The style of fighting used by the Persians was probably to stand off from an enemy, using their bows (or equivalent) to wear down the enemy before closing in to deliver the coup de grace with spear and sword.|$|E
5|$|The only grave {{goods were}} a pot found {{with the female}} adult body and partial remains of <b>wicker,</b> fur and linen with the other bodies. In the predynastic period bodies were usually buried naked and {{sometimes}} loosely wrapped. In such a burial, when the body is covered in warm sand, the environmental conditions mean {{that most of the}} water in the body is quickly evaporated or drained away, meaning that the corpse is naturally dried and preserved. This method was widely used in the pre-dynastic Egyptian period, before artificial mummification was developed. The natural mummification that occurred with these dry sand burials may have led to the original Egyptian belief in an after-death survival and started the tradition of leaving food and implements for an afterlife.|$|E
