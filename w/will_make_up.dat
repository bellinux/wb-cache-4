5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in the proportion of female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period the proportion of civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. The proportion of women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase the proportion of service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E

25|$|Mutable: The mutable {{signs are}} Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces. A native with mainly mutable signs are adaptable, {{co-operative}} and friendly. They can fit into almost any situation, {{put up with}} anything and turn any situation to their advantage. Mutable people can steer projects through periods of transition {{and bring them to}} a successful conclusion. Although gentle and likeable, mutable subjects seem to have more than their fair share of problems and can be selfish and ruthless when they feel threatened. These subjects may devote their lives to helping others, but they can often paradoxically be surprisingly selfish at the same time. Subjects lacking mutable signs may be unable to adapt to any kind of change and be particularly unhappy when faced with uncertainty. They need lots of notice before they will commit themselves to anything, and lack flexibility and adaptability. They may also hold onto rigid and unchanging views. Planets in the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses will help to compensate for this lack, and water signs in the chart <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> for the lack of intuition.|$|E
