25|$|Macroscopically, the gas {{characteristics}} measured {{are either}} {{in terms of}} the gas particles themselves (velocity, pressure, or temperature) or their surroundings (volume). For example, Robert Boyle studied pneumatic chemistry for a small portion of his career. One of his experiments related the macroscopic properties of pressure and volume of a gas. His experiment used a J-tube manometer <b>which</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> test tube {{in the shape of the}} letter J. Boyle trapped an inert gas in the closed end of the test tube with a column of mercury, thereby making the number of particles and the temperature constant. He observed that when the pressure was increased in the gas, by adding more mercury to the column, the trapped gas' volume decreased (this is known as an inverse relationship). Furthermore, when Boyle multiplied the pressure and volume of each observation, the product was constant. This relationship held for every gas that Boyle observed leading to the law, (PV=k), named to honor his work in this field.|$|E

500|$|From {{contemporary}} reviews, Howard Thompson of The New York Times gave a brief negative {{review of}} Danger: Diabolik {{referring to the}} film as [...] "infantile junk." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film a {{two and a half}} star rating out of four, stating that he felt it was better than the other Dino De Laurentiis production Barbarella, but that it was [...] "long and eventually loses track of itself." [...] Variety gave the film a negative review, calling it a [...] "dull Dino De Laurentiis programmer" [...] whose [...] "izarre sets, poor process work, static writing and limp direction spell pure formula fare for lowercase grind bookings." [...] The Monthly Film Bulletin gave the film a positive review, noting that: [...] "Bava's superb visual sense stands him in good stead in this comic-strip adventure <b>which</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brilliant pastiche of the best of everything in anything from James Bond to Matt Helm." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (<b>which</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cylinder {{in the case of}} three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, within a small region on the surface around any given point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics. One can therefore consider an auxiliary theory in which [...] "spacetime" [...] is given by the boundary of anti-de Sitter space. This observation is the starting point for AdS/CFT correspondence, which states that the boundary of anti-de Sitter space can be regarded as the [...] "spacetime" [...] for a quantum field theory. The claim is that this quantum field theory is equivalent to the gravitational theory on the bulk anti-de Sitter space in the sense that there is a [...] "dictionary" [...] for translating entities and calculations in one theory into their counterparts in the other theory. For example, a single particle in the gravitational theory might correspond to some collection of particles in the boundary theory. In addition, the predictions in the two theories are quantitatively identical so that if two particles have a 40 percent chance of colliding in the gravitational theory, then the corresponding collections in the boundary theory would also have a 40 percent chance of colliding.|$|E
