500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> because there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the US {{ambassador}} to the UN at the time, wrote in his autobiography that [...] "China altogether backed Fretilin in Timor, and lost.

2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball <b>was</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs.
