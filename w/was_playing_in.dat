5|$|Ambrose {{made his}} {{debut in the}} English County Championship for Northamptonshire County Cricket Club in 1989—the club signed him for the 1988 season but as he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the West Indies touring team, he was {{unavailable}} that year. He took a wicket with his first delivery for the club, but was not particularly successful {{in the first part}} of the season; he settled down later and took 28 first-class wickets at 28.39 for Northamptonshire in nine games.|$|E
5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew. Instead, Berg sneaked onto the roof of the hospital, one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo, and filmed the city and harbor with his movie camera. He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E

However, Casino Royale <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> 370 fewer cinemas and had a better average ($11,890 per cinema, against $10,918 for Happy Feet). It earned $167,445,960 {{by the end of}} its run in North America, marking what was at the time the highest-grossing film of the series, before being surpassed by Quantum of Solaces $168.4million.|$|E

The film broke records in Switzerland, Finland, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Romania and Slovenia. Its Chinese and Indian openings were the second largest ever for foreign-language films.|$|E
5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring bluegrass music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{the highest}} ever average {{attendance}} {{in a season}} was 10,142 during the club's Division 1 campaign of 1987–88. Since then, the average attendance has usually been under 5,000 spectators. In the 2008–09 season, the average was as low as 2,348 when the club <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the Championnat National.|$|E

5|$|Whitemore cricket club {{began in}} the 19th century. An early record is of a match against Oaks in 1898, though club minutes date only from 1927 at which time it <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the Westmoreland association. A cricket {{pavilion}} was built some time prior to 1900 and was replaced during 1962-63. The cricket club has continued to field teams and in 2013 they played in the B grade of the Northern Midlands Cricket Association. Their most successful years were from the 1960s through to the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|A new {{professional}} indoor lacrosse league {{was created}} in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League. This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal, Toronto, Rochester, Syracuse, Philadelphia, and Maryland. For the 1975 season, Rochester moved to Boston, Syracuse moved to Quebec City, and Toronto moved to Long Island. Thus, by its second year, the original NLL <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> all major league arenas: the Colisée de Québec, the Montreal Forum, the Boston Garden, Nassau Coliseum, the Spectrum, and the Capital Centre. When the two wealthier '75 NLL franchises, Philadelphia and Maryland, finished out of the playoffs, and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> a tent theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
5|$|By 1947–48, Brown had recovered, so Harvey had {{to compete}} with him as well as Morris and Barnes for selection. In the first match of the season against the touring Indians, Harvey made 4 and 35. The {{following}} week, he made 89 in the first innings against South Australia but managed only three in the second innings as the Victorians collapsed to be all out for 182 and lost by nine wickets. Harvey was overlooked for the Australian XI for the Test trial against India the following week. Instead, {{he played in the}} match against Queensland, scoring only 13 and 3. He was subsequently overlooked for the Test selection. During this time, he played alongside Neil in all but the Queensland match, when his younger brother <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the Australian XI. However, neither batted together.|$|E
5|$|Diarra {{began his}} career playing for clubs based in Seine-Saint-Denis, such as CSL Aulnay and {{hometown}} club FC Villepinte. In 1997, he joined Louhans-Cuiseaux and made his professional debut with the club in the 1999–2000 season while the club <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the second division. In 2000, Diarra was recruited by German club Bayern Munich. He spent two years playing on the club's reserve team, Bayern Munich II. In 2002, he was signed by compatriot Gérard Houllier {{as part of the}} manager's French Revolution to play for English club Liverpool. Diarra's stint at the club was deemed a disappointment as he spent both years at the club on loan in France playing for Le Havre, Bastia, and Lens.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, one of Luton's {{greatest}} sides emerged under manager Dally Duncan. The team included Gordon Turner, {{who went on}} to become Luton's all-time top goalscorer, Bob Morton, who holds the record for the most club appearances, and Syd Owen, an England international. During this period, Luton sides also featured two England international goalkeepers, Ron Baynham and Bernard Streten, as well as Irish internationals Seamus Dunne, Tom Aherne and George Cummins. This team reached the top flight {{for the first time in}} 1955–56, after finishing the season in second place behind Birmingham City on goal average. A few years of success followed, including an FA Cup Final appearance against Nottingham Forest in 1958–59; at the end of the season, Owen was voted FWA Footballer of the Year. However, the club was relegated the following season and, by 1964–65, <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the fourth tier.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season, Brewer was traded after 17 games to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a third-round draft pick in 2015 on November 28, 2014. At the time, he <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> his fifth season with the Lightning. He appeared in 17 games, and had four assists on the year. Brewer played in 246 games with Tampa, scoring 10 goals and 46 assists. He also had 180 penalty minutes in his four-and-a quarter seasons with Tampa Bay. On December 3, 2014, the Ducks announced that Brewer was expected to miss four-to-six weeks with a broken bone in his foot from a blocked shot.|$|E
5|$|Of the 65 players picked in {{the first}} round by Washington or Texas, 36 have been pitchers, the most of any position; 26 of these were right-handed, while 10 were left-handed. Eleven outfielders, seven third basemen, five shortstops, four catchers, and two first basemen were also taken. The team has never drafted a player at second base. Twelve of the players came from high schools or colleges in the state of Texas, and California follows with nine players. The Rangers have drafted one player, Tanner Scheppers in 2009, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball {{at the time of the}} draft. Scheppers was {{originally}} drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 29th round of the 2005 MLB Draft, and by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the second round of the 2008 MLB Draft.|$|E

Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for Rocky Horror conventions. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres. The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. The fan publication The Transylvanian printed a number of issues, and a semi-regular poster magazine was published {{as well as an}} official magazine.|$|E
5|$|Sakic and {{his wife}} Debbie have three children: son Mitchell, born in 1996, and fraternal twins; son Chase and {{daughter}} Kamryn, born in October 2000.

Sakic is an avid golfer, and competed in the celebrity Pro Am golf tournament in Lake Tahoe {{in the summer of}} 2006. Each summer, he also hosts his own charity golf tournament which benefits the Food Bank of the Rockies. His charity work, which is estimated to have provided more than seven million meals to poor children and families, has earned an NHL Foundation Player Award in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} {{canceled}} {{due to the}} lockout; many Devils players played in European leagues and in the hockey world championships. Patrik Elias, who <b>was</b> <b>playing</b> <b>in</b> the Russian Superleague, contracted hepatitis A. Faced with Elias' indefinite recovery timetable, plus the loss of defensive stalwarts Scott Niedermayer to free agency and Scott Stevens to retirement, Lamoriello signed veteran defenseman Dan McGillis and two former Devils, winger Alexander Mogilny and defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, none of whom finished the season on the ice. In July 2005, the team announced that head coach Pat Burns would not return for the 2005–06 season after being diagnosed with cancer {{for the second time}} in little more than a year. Assistant Coach Larry Robinson, the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002, was promoted to start the season.|$|E
