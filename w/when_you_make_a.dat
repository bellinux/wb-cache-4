After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You know <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting {{him as much as}} he thinks they should." [...] On 18 December 2016, he received a Ruby Play Button from YouTube as a reward for hitting 50 million subscribers.|$|E
500|$|Antonov {{described}} his inspiration from London as [...] "a big metropolis, it's messy, it's chaotic and intense...and it's both exotic and familiar to Americans and to Europeans". He highlighted {{the importance of}} that familiarity to different cultures because [...] "you want to communicate {{to a lot of}} people <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> new piece of fiction". He said that Edinburgh provided a sense of containment and a variety of architectural designs, which were combined with a futuristic vision which Antonov said was not comparable to the brass, rivets, and steam of steampunk design. Antonov and Mitton traveled to London and Edinburgh for research, taking photographs of people, places, and objects. The pair avoided the busier streets and focused on side streets and alleyways that would better suit the game's world. Mitton stated: [...] "We were trying to design the game from a rat's viewpoint...if we have a small city, from a constrained viewpoint, what are all the different angles that we can explore?". Inspiration also came from the artwork of John Atkinson Grimshaw, Canaletto, and Gustave Doré. The world map was designed as a single piece of art and was sectioned so the designers were clear on where each mission takes place.|$|E

[...] "With parkour, I often say, 'Once is never'. In other words, someone can manage a jump one time {{but it does not}} mean anything. It can be luck or chance. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> jump, {{you have to do it}} at least three times to be sure you can actually do it. It's an unavoidable rule. Do it the hard way and stop lying to yourself. When you come for training, you have to train. Even if it means doing the same jump fifty or a hundred times." [...] To its founder, parkour is a method of self-refinement, used for learning to control and focus oneself.|$|E

60|$|What {{is there}} in going a-fishing, I wonder, that seems to change even the leopard's spots, and that puts a new heart into the man who hies him away to the brook when buds are swelling? There is Keeonekh the otter. Before he turned {{fisherman}} he was probably fierce, cruel, bloodthirsty, with a vile smell about him, {{like all the other}} weasels. Now he lives at peace with all the world and is clean, gentle, playful as a kitten and faithful as a dog <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pet of him. And there is Ismaques the fishhawk. Before he turned fisherman he was probably hated, like every other hawk, for his fierceness and his bandit ways. The shadow of his wings was the signal for hiding to all the timid ones. Jay and crow cried Thief! thief! and kingbird sounded his war cry and rushed out to battle. Now the little birds build their nests among the sticks of his great house, and the shadow of his wings is a sure protection. For owl and hawk and wild-cat have learned long since the wisdom of keeping well away from Ismaques' dwelling.|$|E
60|$|The ideal {{holiday in}} bed {{does not require}} the {{presence}} of a ministering angel in the room all day. You frequently prefer to be alone, and point out to your wife that you cannot have her trifling with her health for your sake, and so she must go out for a walk. She is reluctant, but finally goes, protesting that you are the most unselfish of men, and only too good for her. This leaves a pleasant aroma behind it, for even when lying in bed, we like to feel that we are uncommonly fine fellows. After she has gone you get up cautiously, and, walking stealthily to the wardrobe, produce from the pocket of your great coat a good novel. A holiday in bed must be arranged for beforehand. With a gleam in your eye you slip back to bed, double your pillow to make it higher, and begin to read. You have only got to the fourth page, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> horrible discovery--namely, that the book is not cut. An experienced holiday-maker would have had it cut the night before, but this is your first real holiday, or perhaps you have been thoughtless. In any case you have now matter to think of. You are torn in two different ways. There is your coat on the floor with a knife in it, but you cannot reach the coat without getting up again. Ought you to get the knife or to give up reading? Perhaps it takes {{a quarter of an hour}} to decide this question, and you decide it by discovering a third course. Being a sort of an invalid, you have certain privileges which would be denied you if you were merely sitting in a chair in the agonies of neuralgia. One of the glorious privileges of a holiday in bed is that you are entitled to cut books with your fingers. So you cut the novel in this way, and read on.|$|E

6000|$|And he said, {{upon those}} scenes where battles have been fought, the [...] hand of nature effaces {{the traces of}} the wrath of man, and the [...] {{cultivator}} of the soil in following times finds the rusted arms, [...] and looks upon them with calm and joy, as the memorials of [...] forgotten strife, and as quickening his sense of the blessings of [...] his peaceful occupation. The noble lord went on to say, in [...] reference to the powerful opposition then offered to the bill for [...] the endowment of Maynooth, that {{it seems as if}} upon the questions [...] of religious freedom, our strife is never to cease, and our arms [...] are never to rust. Would any man, who heard the noble lord deliver [...] these impressive sentiments, have believed not only that the strife [...] with respect to religious liberty was to be revived with a greater [...] degree of acerbity, in the year 1851, but that the noble lord [...] himself was to be a main agent in its revival--that his was to be [...] the head that was to wear the helmet, and his the hand that was to [...] grasp the spear? My conviction is, that this great subject of [...] religious freedom is not to be dealt with, as one of the ordinary [...] matters in which you may, with safety or with honour, do to-day and [...] undo to-morrow. This great people, whom we have the honour to [...] represent, moves slowly in politics and legislation; but, although [...] it moves slowly, it moves steadily. The principle of religious [...] freedom, its adaptation to our modern state, and its compatibility [...] with ancient institutions, was a principle which you did not adopt [...] in haste. It was a principle well tried in struggle and conflict. [...] It was a principle which gained the assent of one public man after [...] another. It was a principle which ultimately triumphed, after you [...] had spent upon it half a century of agonising struggle. And now [...] {{what are you going to}} do? You have arrived at the division of the [...] century. Are you going to repeat Penelope's process, but without [...] the purpose of Penelope? Are you going to spend the decay and the [...] dusk of the nineteenth century in undoing the great work which with [...] so much pain and difficulty your greatest men have been achieving [...] during its daybreak and its youth? Surely not. Oh, recollect the [...] functions you have to perform in the face of the world. Recollect [...] that Europe and the whole of the civilised world look to England at [...] this moment not less, no, but even more than ever they looked to [...] her before, as the mistress and guide of nations, in regard to the [...] great work of civil legislation. And what is it they chiefly admire [...] in England? It is not the rapidity with which you form [...] constitutions and broach abstract theories. On the contrary; they [...] know that nothing is so distasteful to you as abstract theories, [...] and that you are proverbial for resisting what is new until you are [...] well assured by gradual effort, by progressive trials, and [...] beneficial tendency. But they know that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> step [...] forward you keep it. They know that there is reality and honesty, [...] strength and substance, about your proceedings. They know that you [...] are not a monarchy to-day, a republic to-morrow, and a military [...] despotism the day after. They know that you have been happily [...] preserved from irrational vicissitudes that have marked the career [...] of the greatest and noblest among the neighbouring nations. Your [...] fathers and yourselves have earned this brilliant character for [...] England. Do not forfeit it. Do not allow it to be tarnished or [...] impaired. Show, I beseech you--have the courage to show the pope of [...] Rome, and his cardinals, and his church, that England too, as well [...] as Rome, has her semper eadem; and that when she has once adopted [...] some great principle of legislation, which is destined to influence [...] the national character, to draw the dividing lines of her policy [...] for ages to come, and to affect the whole nature of her influence [...] and her standing among the nations of the world--show that when she [...] has done this slowly, and done it deliberately, she has done it [...] once for all; and that she will then no more retrace her steps than [...] the river that bathes this giant city can flow back upon its [...] source. The character of England is in our hands. Let us feel the [...] responsibility that belongs to us, and let us rely on it; if to-day [...] we make this step backwards, it is one which hereafter we shall [...] have to retrace with pain. We cannot change the profound and [...] resistless tendencies of the age towards religious liberty. It is [...] our business to guide and to control their application; do this you [...] may, but to endeavour to turn them backwards is the sport of [...] children, done by the hands of men, and every effort you may make [...] in that direction will recoil upon you in disaster and disgrace. [...] The noble lord appealed to gentlemen who sit behind me, in the [...] names of Hampden and Pym. I have great reverence for these in one [...] portion at least of their political career, because they were men [...] energetically engaged in resisting oppression. But I would rather [...] have heard Hampden and Pym quoted on any other subject than one [...] which relates to the mode of legislation or the policy to be [...] adopted with our Roman catholic fellow-citizens, because, if there [...] was one blot on their escutcheon, if there was one painful--I would [...] almost say odious--feature in the character of the party among whom [...] they were the most distinguished chiefs, it was the bitter and [...] ferocious intolerance which in them became the more powerful [...] because it was directed against the Roman catholics alone. I would [...] appeal in other names to gentlemen who sit on this side of the [...] House. If Hampden and Pym were friends of freedom, so were [...] Clarendon and Newcastle, so were the gentlemen who sustained the [...] principles of loyalty.... They were not always seeking to tighten [...] the chains and deepen the brand. Their disposition was to relax the [...] severity of the law, and attract the affections of their Roman [...] catholic fellow-subjects to the constitution by treating them as [...] brethren.... We are a minority insignificant in point of numbers. [...] We are more insignificant still, because we are but knots and [...] groups of two or three, we have no power of cohesion, no ordinary [...] bond of union. What is it that binds us together against you, but [...] the conviction that we have on our side the principle of [...] justice--the conviction that we shall soon have on our side the [...] strength of public opinion (oh, oh!). I am sure I have not wished [...] to say a syllable that would wound the feelings of any man, and if [...] in the warmth of argument such expressions should have escaped me, [...] I wish them unsaid. But above all we are sustained by the sense of [...] justice which we feel belongs to the cause we are defending; and we [...] are, I trust, well determined to follow that bright star of [...] justice, beaming from the heavens, whithersoever it may lead.|$|E
