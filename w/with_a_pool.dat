Needy arrives there and finds Jennifer feeding on Chip. Needy tries to drown Jennifer but Jennifer, hovering in the air, attacks her. She is then stabbed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> skimmer by a fatally injured Chip. Jennifer escapes while Needy watches her boyfriend die.|$|E

DOI: 10. 1016 /j. aap. 2004. 09. 004 [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]The effectiveness of post-licence driver education for preventing road traffic crashes was quantified using a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Searches of appropriate electronic databases, the Internet and reference lists of relevant papers were conducted. The searches were not restricted by language or publication status. Data were pooled from 21 randomised controlled trials, including over 300, 000 full licence-holding drivers of all ages. Nineteen trials reported subsequent traffic offences, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> relative risk of 0. 96 (95 % confidence interval 0. 94, 0. 98). Fifteen trials reported traffic crashes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> relative risk of 0. 98 (0. 96, 1. 01). Four trials reported injury crashes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> relative risk of 1. 12 (0. 88, 1. 41). The results provide no evidence that post-licence driver education is effective in preventing road injuries or crashes. Although the results are compatible <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small reduction in the occurrence of traffic crashes, {{this may be due to}} selection biases or bias in the included trials...|$|R

40|$|Context Ureteropelvic {{junction}} obstruction (UPJO) is {{the most}} common obstructive disease of the urinary tract in infancy and childhood <b>with</b> <b>a</b> prevalence of 15 % - 45 % in neonates with antenatal hydronephrosis. The diagnosis of UPJO should be confirmed by imaging studies - most of which have a propensity to radiation exposure. Objectives The current study aimed to present a review protocol to assess the role of measuring urinary biomarkers to distinguish severe UPJO from milder forms of the disease. Data Sources The database of UPJO studies was searched and studies that compared the levels of urinary biomarkers with the gold standard (i e, dynamic renal scans) for UPJO diagnosis were selected. Severity assessment was done quantitatively. Study Selection Three hundred fifty-eight articles were identified across the electronic databases. Twenty-seven articles were selected for the final analyses. Data Extraction Data were extracted independently by three reviewers and analyzed using STATA software version 12. Results Meta-analysis of studies showed that patients with severe UPJO had significantly higher biomarker levels than those with mild to moderate obstruction, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0. 5 (confidence interval (CI) 95 %, 0. 34 - 0. 67; P < 0. 001); and significantly higher biomarker standardized to urinary creatinine levels than those with mild to moderate obstruction, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> SMD of 1. 02 (95 % CI, 0. 88 - 1. 16; P < 0. 001). Meta-analysis showed that patients with severe UPJO had significantly higher biomarker levels than healthy children, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> SMD of 1. 27 (CI 95 %, 1. 16 - 1. 39; P < 0. 001); and significantly higher biomarker standardized to urinary creatinine levels than healthy children, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pooled</b> SMD of 1. 14 (CI 95 %, 0. 95 - 1. 32; P < 0. 001). Conclusions The assessment of urinary biomarkers is a helpful tool to assess the presence and severity of UPJO, but there is little published data on each of the studied biomarkers. It is suggested to perform future larger multicenter studies...|$|R

The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in pitch black (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come up on a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Palace (Palacio Real) is {{surrounded}} by three green areas. In front of the palace, are the gardens of the Plaza de Oriente; to the north, the gardens of Sabatini and to the west up to the Manzanares River, the famous Campo del Moro. Campo del Moro gardens has a surface area of 20 hectares and is a scenic garden with an unusual layout filled with foliage and an air of English romanticism. The Sabatini Gardens have a formal Neoclassic style, consisting of well-trimmed hedges, in symmetric geometrical patterns, adorned <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool,</b> statues and fountains, with trees also planted in a symmetrical geometric shape. Plaza de Oriente can distinguish three main plots: the Central Gardens, the Cabo Noval Gardens and the Lepanto Gardens. The Central Gardens are arranged around the central monument to Philip IV, in a grid, following the barroque model garden. They consist of seven flowerbeds, each packed with box hedges, forms of cypress, yew and magnolia of small size, and flower plantations, temporary. These are bounded on either side by rows of statues paths, popularly known as the Gothic kings, and mark the dividing line between {{the main body of}} the plaza and the Cabo Noval Gardens at north, and the Lepanto Gardens at south.|$|E
25|$|A {{follow-up}} {{effort in}} 2009's championships in Rochester, New York saw UMass fall one round earlier - in the quarterfinals - yet arguably {{closer to a}} title. Thanks to some unfortunate pool placement, largely due to eventual runner-up Robert Morris (IL) underachieving {{during the regular season}} and ranking fifth, the fourth-seeded Minutemen drew the Eagles in their pool, where they dropped a 5–2 result. While UMass still advanced to the quarterfinals, it did so as second in its pool as was therefore paired up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>pool</b> winner in the form of Lindenwood, a team {{on the way to the}} second of three consecutive national championships. The Bay Staters did push the Lions like few teams of that era could though, in taking an early lead before LU tied things up late, then won in double overtime on an Alexandra Johansson goal. Still, 2008–09 did see one unprecedented success: UMass finally broke through and finished first in the ECWHL standings to take the regular season league title, the first time since the ECWHL's founding that Rhode Island did not take both the regular season and playoff crowns. URI managed to save face by quadrupling a Caitlin Scannell goal in a 4–1 win for that year's playoff title.|$|E
