40|$|Abstract — Capacitive and {{inductive}} crosstalk noises {{are expected}} to be more serious in advanced technologies. However, capacitive and inductive crosstalk noises in the future have not been concurrently and sufficiently discussed quantitatively, though capacitive crosstalk noise has been intensively studied solely as a primary factor of interconnect delay variation. This paper quantitatively predicts the impact of capacitive and inductive crosstalk in prospective processes, and reveals that interconnect scaling strategies strongly affect relative dominance between capacitive and inductive coupling. Our prediction also makes the point that the interconnect resistance significantly influences both inductive coupling noise and propagation delay. We then evaluate a tradeoff between wire cross-sectional area and worst-case propagation delay focusing on inductive coupling noise, and show that an appropriate selection of <b>wire</b> <b>cross-section</b> can reduce delay uncertainty by the small sacrifice of propagation delay.

Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed using Embedded atom method (EAM) to investigate the structural behaviours and properties under high strain rate. Velocity-Verlet algorithm {{has been used to}} solve the equation of motions. Two different thermal loading cases have been considered: (i) Isothermal loading, in which Nose-Hoover thermostat is used to maintain the constant system temperature, and (ii) Adiabatic loading, i. e., without any thermostat. Five different <b>wire</b> <b>cross-sections</b> were considered ranging from 0. 723 x 0. 723 nm(2) to 2. 169 x 2. 169 nm(2) The strain rates {{used in the present study}} were 1 x 10 (9) s(- 1), 1 x 10 (8) s(- 1), and 1 x 10 (7) s(- 1). The effect of strain rate on the mechanical properties of copper nanowires was analysed, which shows that elastic properties are independent of thermal loading for a given strain rate and cross-sectional dimension of nanowire. It showed a decreasing yield stress and yield strain with decreasing strain rate for a given cross- section. Also, a decreasing yield stress and increasing yield strain were observed for a given strain rate with increasing cross-sectional area.

40|$|We {{review the}} effects of Coulomb {{correlation}} on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of semiconductor quantum wires, with emphasis on recent results for the bound excitonic states. Our theoretical approach is based on generalized semiconductor Bloch equations, and allows full three-dimensional multisubband description of electron-hole correlation for arbitrary confinement profiles. In particular, we consider V- and T-shaped structures for which significant experimental advances were obtained recently. Above band gap, a very general result obtained by {{this approach is that}} electron-hole Coulomb correlation removes the inverse-square-root single-particle singularity in the optical spectra at band edge, in agreement with previous reports from purely one-dimensional models. Strong correlation effects on transitions in the continuum are found to persist also at high densities of photoexcited carriers. Below band gap, we find that the same potential- (Coulomb) to kinetic-energy ratio holds for quite different wire cross-sections and compositions. As a consequence, we identify a shape- and barrier-independent parameter that governs a universal scaling law for exciton binding energy with size.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} novel {{homogenization}} methods {{for the inclusion}} of skin and proximity effect in windings in finite-element (FE) models of electromagnetic devices. A general frequency-domain approach and its original extension to the time domain are proposed. In a preprocessing step the conductors (i. e. type of cross-section and packing, and fill factor) are characterized in the frequency domain by means of a reduced FE model, producing six dimensionless and frequency-dependent skin- and proximity-effect coefficients. The latter coefficients are readily taken into account in a frequency-domain FE analysis of a complete device. A time-domain FE analysis with homogenized winding requires the introduction of additional unknowns and equations; this extension to the time domain is analogous to the approximation of a frequency-dependent inductive impedance by a ladder circuit consisting of constant resistances and inductances. By way of illustration and validation, the homogenization methods are applied to a 2 D FE model of an inductor. For the winding, different types of <b>wire</b> <b>cross-section</b> and packing, viz round/hexagonal and rectangular/rectangular, are considered.
