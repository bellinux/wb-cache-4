25|$|Before {{becoming}} a member party, an organization {{needs to have}} been an observer of the EFA for at least one year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, {{the party}} however left the EPP {{to join the}} Alliance of European Conservatives and Reformists (now Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe) instead. This move was {{attributed}} to the AKP's disappointment not to be granted full membership in the EPP, while it was admitted as a full member of the AECR. It drew criticism in both national and European discourses, as {{the driving force of}} Turkey's aspirations to {{become a member of the}} European Union decided to join a largely eurosceptic alliance, abandoning the more influential pro-European EPP, feeding suspicions that AKP <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> a watered down, not a closely integrated EU.|$|E

Oscar now <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> forces with his brother, Benjamin, {{to construct a}} cotton mill. They need an additional $75,000 and approach Regina, asking her {{to invest in the}} project. Oscar initially proposes marriage between his son Leo and Regina's daughter Alexandra—first cousins—as a means of getting Horace's money, but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. Horace refuses when Regina asks him outright for the money, so Leo, a bank teller, is pressured into stealing Horace's railroad bonds from the bank's safe deposit box.|$|E
500|$|On his {{way back}} to his quarters, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) steps off a turbolift and instead of finding himself in a {{corridor}} onboard the Enterprise, ends up on board a shuttlecraft with Q (John de Lancie) at the controls. Picard demands to be returned to the Enterprise; Q calls him [...] "an impossibly stubborn human" [...] and refuses to take him back until he agrees to at least hear Q's requests. Q then transports them to Ten Forward, where Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), who recognizes him, warns Picard not to trust him. Q reveals that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the crew to assist them as they push further into unexplored regions of the galaxy, asserting they are not ready for the threats they will encounter. Picard chooses to make their own way into the unknown, and rejects Q's offer. Irritated by Picard's arrogance, Q snaps his fingers and sends the Enterprise thousands of light years across the galaxy, then disappears. Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) reports that the nearest starbase is over two years away at maximum warp. A fearful Guinan warns Picard to set course for home immediately, but Picard is curious to explore the new area of the galaxy.|$|E

In 2012, Iraqi Defence Minister Saadoun al-Dulaimi stated that Iraq <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the GCC. Kuwait supports Iraq joining the GCC. The lack of membership of Iraq is widely believed to be due to the low-income economy, its substantial Shia population, its republican political system, and its invasion of member state Kuwait during the Gulf War.|$|E

2500|$|Surprisingly, however, Rimmer {{is still}} capable of nobility, honour and love. When Red Dwarf {{encounters}} a holoship with an all-hologram crew composed of the [...] "best and brightest" [...] in the episode [...] "Holoship" [...] (1991), Rimmer desperately <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join.</b> A female officer aboard the ship, Nirvanah Crane, played by Jane Horrocks, {{falls in love with}} him and sacrifices her place on the ship for Rimmer, only for Rimmer to do the same in return for her. This act of nobility surprises even Rimmer himself. Furthermore, in the episode [...] "Out of Time" [...] (1993), Rimmer is disgusted by his corrupt future self to the point where he'd rather do battle with him than surrender ("Better dead than Smeg!"), Rimmer later frantically risking his life to save the others after their future selves kill them. [...] He is also able to show respect for viewpoints in conflict with his own; in [...] "The Last Day" [...] (1989), he tries to convince Lister that he should respect Kryten's right to believe in Silicon Heaven in spite of it conflicting with Lister's own beliefs.|$|E

2500|$|Primary {{reasons for}} Turkey's {{persistent}} requests {{to join the}} EU are, among others, the many Turks in Europe {{and the importance of}} trade between the two. Turkey is, however, also increasingly disappointed with the widespread opposition to its accession among EU member states. In September 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan was asked by CNN if Turkey still <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the EU. His response: [...] "There are 5 million Turks in Europe and 3 million Turks in Germany alone. We are a natural member of the European Union. Germany invited Turkish workers 50 years ago, however 50 years have passed and we have waited at the European Union's doorstep. No other country has experienced such a thing. We will be patient until a point. However, when we cross that point, we will bring light to the situation and decide accordingly." [...] During a trip to Yalta, Erdoğan expressed his stern disappointment regarding the EU accession process: [...] "We are still an EU negotiating candidate. At such a position, I wish EU accession. Otherwise, such a scenario would affect a large region including Ukraine and Turkey." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rogues are reconstituted {{with a new}} {{membership}} of Heat Wave, Mirror Master, Captain Cold, Abra Kadabra, Weather Wizard, Trickster and Pied Piper, led by Inertia. Several Rogues distrust Trickster and Piper as they have reformed in the past. The Rogues plan to and eventually succeed in, killing the Flash, Bart Allen. Piper and Trickster then go on the run following Bart's murder, but attend his funeral, where they are captured by Multiplex and Deadshot. Eventually escaping, they are later pursued in Gotham City by the Suicide Squad (composed of Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, Plastique and Captain Boomerang, Jr.) and later Oracle's dispatches: the Question and Batwoman, villainous duo Poison Ivy and Deathstroke, and eventually Batman and Wally West himself, on his vendetta against the Rogues who he believes killed his cousin Bart. Piper and Trickster attempt to tell Wally that they overheard Deathstroke's plans to murder the attendees at Black Canary and Green Arrow's wedding, but are internally attacked by Deathstroke's tracking device. Flash manages to remove the explosive implants and brings {{the two of them}} to Zatanna's home. Flash confiscates the duo's weapons. However, Trickster and Piper use Zatanna's mummy bodyguard Hassan to create a distraction and escape Black Canary's bachelorette party. They then find himself {{in the middle of a}} battle on the wedding day and manage to use the Joker's exploding [...] "present" [...] against Poison Ivy, gaining some measure of revenge over her. As they escape in a stolen car, they are suddenly accosted by Double Down, who had hidden in the back seat. Double Down <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the two in their run from the law, mentioning the disappearances of several villains. The group is then attacked by the Suicide Squad. Double Down is defeated and captured, but Piper and Trickster, using Trickster's cloaking field, evade the squad and decide to follow them and free the other villains they have captured. They follow them to a government facility, and manage to free Two-Face. Two-Face tells them that Checkmate is behind the abductions. After flipping his coin, Two-Face declines to join the two. Piper and Trickster continue to flee, escaping capture by Deadshot. They are able to defeat Deadshot, but not before he manages to shoot the Trickster dead. The cord attaching them together detects that Trickster is dead and begins a fail-safe procedure, counting down from twenty-four hours until it detonates. Piper uses his flute to slow the countdown. The train they are on stops for a routine check, causing Piper to flee into the desert. Piper, delirious from the heat, begins to imagine Trickster's corpse is talking to him and removes Trickster's hand from his body to avoid triggering the bomb.|$|E
