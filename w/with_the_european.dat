The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation.

As a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries more in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> average.|$|E
