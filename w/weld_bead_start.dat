40|$|Arc-welding {{involves}} the deposition of molten filler metal and the localised input of intense heat. The surrounding parent material and, {{in the case}} of multi-pass welds, previously deposited weld metal, undergoes complex thermo-mechanical cycles involving elastic, plastic, creep and viscous deformations. These processes result in the development of large residual stress gradients around the welded region, which can be particularly detrimental to the structural integrity of plant components. The present study examines aggregated <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> <b>start</b> and stop stress concentration effects in a three pass slot weld specimen that was designed to represent a multi-pass weld repair (without any original weld). The specimen design comprised a Type 316 L stainless steel base-plate of nominal dimensions (300 × 200 × 25) mm 3 with a 100 mm long by 10 mm deep central slot filled with 3 stringer manual metal arc weld beads, laid one on top of another. Residual stresses in three orthogonal directions were measured by neutron diffraction on a plane cutting through the centre of the plate, parallel to the welding direction, to show concentrations of tensile stress at both the weld start and stop positions. The transverse component of residual stress on the same plane in a second, nominally identical, specimen was mapped using the contour method. By applying two independent measurement techniques the residual stress field within the specimen type was determined with an increased level of confidence. Maximum transverse stress values of about 200 MPa at the weld start position and 300 MPa at the weld stop position were found. Peak tensile stresses in the longitudinal direction of 370 and 460 MPa were measured using neutron diffraction at the weld start and stop positions, respectively. The stresses measured by the contour method and neutron diffraction were in reasonable overall agreement with each other. However, the comparisons pointed to the possible presence of cutting artefacts in the contour results...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of residual stress in three orthogonal directions has been measured within a Type 316 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} bead-on-plate weld specimen. Neutron diffraction was employed using the ENGIN-X instrument, located at the ISIS spallation facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. A stress-free lattice parameter reference value was determined from a small cube, extracted from a {{far corner of the}} plate. A high magnitude of tensile residual stress was found along the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> in the longitudinal and transverse directions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} transverse {{residual stress}} and strain measurements aimed at quantifying end effects in single and multi-pass weld-runs. Two test specimens are examined: a 60 mm long <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> deposited {{on the surface of}} a 180 mm × 120 mm × 17 mm thick stainless steel plate, and a 62 ° arc-length multi-pass repair weld in a 432 mm outer diameter, 19. 6 mm thick stainless steel pipe girth weld. The residual stress measurements were made by employing the relatively new Contour method and by neutron diffraction using ENGIN-X, the engineering spectrometer at the ISIS facility of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (UK). The measured underlying transverse residual stress levels are observed to be essentially uniform directly beneath the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> in the plate specimen and in the heat affected zone beneath the capping passes moving from mid-length towards the stop-end of the pipe repair. However, results from both test components demonstrate the existence of short-range concentrations of transverse residual stress along the welding direction owing to individual <b>weld</b> capping <b>bead</b> <b>start</b> and stop effects. Such short length-scale stress variations must be allowed for when interpreting residual stress measurements from line-scans. The experimental work also demonstrates the importance of knowing the expected stress or strain distribution prior to choosing measurement lines for detailed study. The Contour measurement method and neutron strain scanning are powerful tools for mapping residual {{stress and strain}} fields. Copyright © 2005 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. As {{a part of}} a {{study and}} {{analysis}} on the effects of process para-meters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume in sub-merged arc welding (SAW) of pipes, mathematical models were developed to relate the process parameters and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters. Further, the optimization of <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume was carried out using the optimization module available in the MATLAB version 4. 2 b software package. The mathemati-cal models thus developed for optimiza-tion are also helpful in predicting the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters and in set-ting process parameters at optimum val-ues to achieve the desirable <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality at a relatively low cost {{with a high degree of}} repeatability and increased production rate.

This paper focuses on investigation of the development of the simple and accurate model for {{prediction of}} <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> width of butt joint of SMAW process. Artificial neural networks technique was used to train a program in C++ with the help of sufficient number of welding data sets having input variables current, voltage, speed of welding and external magnetic field and output variable <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> width.

40|$|Purpose: Show the {{relationship}} between geometric characteristics of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> and the optical-acoustic emissions from electric arc during welding in the GMAW-S process. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Bead</b> on plate <b>welding</b> experiments was carried out setting different process parameters. Every welding parameter group was set aiming to reach a high stability level what guarantee a geometrical uniformity in the <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> In each experiment was simultaneously acquired arc voltage, welding current, infrared and acoustic emissions; from them were computed parameters as arc power, acoustic peaks rate and infrared radiation rate. It was used a tri-dimensional LASER scanner for to acquire geometrical information from the <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> surface as width and height of the bead. Depth penetration was measured from sectional cross cutting of <b>weld</b> <b>beads.</b> Findings: Previous analysis showed that the arc emission parameters reach a stationary state with different characteristic for each experiment group which {{means that there is}} some correlation level between them. Posterior analysis showed that from infrared parameter is possible to monitoring external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and principally its penetration depth. From acoustic parameter is possible to monitoring principally the external <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. Therefore is concluded that there is a close relation between the arc emissions and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and that them could be used to measuring the welding geometrical parameters. Research limitations/implications: After analysis it was noticed that the infrared sensing has a better performance than acoustic sensing in the depth penetration monitoring. Infrared sensing also sources some information about external geometric parameters that in conjunction with the acoustic sensing is possible to have reliable information about <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. This method of sensing geometric parameters could be applied in other welding processes, but is necessary to have visibility of the arc, it means that for example this method cannot be used in the submerged arc welding - SAW process.

Developing these models is difficult because welding process parameters can affect not only <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry but also weld pool formation. Therefore, the aim of this research is to develop mathematical models to predict welding process parameters, to obtain the required <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and to study the effects of weld process parameters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> dimensions for the Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) process. In this study, the mathematical models for presenting the interrelationship between the welding process parameters and <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry were proposed. The effects of weld process parameters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> profile were investigated through the empirical and theoretical mathematical models in weld pools. And finally, an infrared camera was employed to monitor the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry. A relationship between the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry and the surface temperature distribution was also established. An image analysis technique was employed to quantify the changes in the surface temperature distribution of the workpiece being welded. Using the infrared camera in conjunction with this image technique was shown to be one of the most sophisticated techniques to monitor perturbations occurred during welding. Partial-penetration, single-pass, bead-on-plate welds were fabricated in 12 mm AS 1204 mild steel flats employing five different welding process parameters. The experimental results were used to develop three empirical equations: curvilinear;polynomial; and linear equations. The results were also employed to find the best mathematical equation under eleven <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> dimensions to assist in the procedure optimisation and the process control algorithms for the GMAW process and to correlate welding process parameters with <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry of bead-on-plates deposited. With the help of a standard statistical package program, SAS, using an IBM-compatible PC, multiple regression analysis was undertaken for investigating and modelling the GMAW process, and significance test techniques were applied for the interpretation of the experimental data. A transient two-dimensional (2 D) axisymmetric model was developed for investigating the heat and fluid flow in weld pools and determining <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> geometry, velocity profile and temperature distribution for the GMAW process. The mathematical formulation considers four driving forces for weld pool convection: electromagnetic; buoyancy; surface tension; and plasma drag forces. The formulation also deals with the molten metal droplets. The equation was solved using a general thermofluid-mechanics computer program, PHOENICS code, which is based on the SIMPLE algorithm. The application of infrared thermography for the adaptive control of the GMAW process was studied. Welding process parameters were purposely varied and thermal response fluctuations were recorded. Infrared images were compared and contrasted with those extracted using machine vision. It was found that reasonable correlations exist between the two systems: infrared thermography and machine vision (as far as weld pool geometry interrogation is concerned). The technique developed can help to increase productivity and weld quality by minimising the amount of post process rework and inspection efforts otherwise needed...|$|R
