The band's line-up {{consisted}} of vocalist Josh Franceschi, guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller, bassist Matt Barnes, and drummer Joe Phillips. The group released an EP, <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>It</b> Means to Be Alone in 2006, after which, Phillips left the band. Dan Flint, a friend the band {{had gone to}} college with, was initially asked to fill in on drums for a tour. He ended up becoming Phillips' permanent replacement following the band's appearance at Slam Dunk Festival 2007. The band then released another EP later in 2007.|$|E

After releasing [...] "Save It for the Bedroom" [...] as a single to promote their tour, the band gained attention from both independent and major record labels.|$|E

Since differentiable manifolds are topological spaces <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means for f to be continuous. But what does [...] "f is [...] " [...] mean for ? We {{know what that means}} when f {{is a function}} between Euclidean spaces, so if we compose f with a chart of M and a chart of N such that we get a map that goes from Euclidean space to M to N to Euclidean space <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means for that map to be [...] We define [...] "f is [...] " [...] to mean that all such compositions of f with charts are [...] Once again the chain rule guarantees that the idea of differentiability does not depend on which charts of the atlases on M and N are selected.

2500|$|His Theology in the Flesh: How Embodiment and Culture Shape the Way We Think about Truth, Morality, and God is {{the first}} book to apply the field of {{cognitive}} linguistics to theology. According to cognitive linguistics, the specific types of bodies humans have shape how we interact with and understand our world. We have concepts such as up/down and in/out because we have bodies that can experience these sorts of things. Embodied experience also gives rise much of our metaphorical thinking. For instance, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like {{to go on a}} journey in which we experience getting to a destination together and perhaps overcoming obstacles on the way. Many, but not all, languages use the experience physical journeys as the framework in which to understand the experience of love. We say, [...] "Our relationship {{has come a long way}} together" [...] and [...] "We have overcome many bumps in the road." [...] We reason about our love relationship in terms of a journey. Yet, in English, we also conceive of love in terms of strong physical forces ("He's blown away by love"), magnetism ("She is attracted to him"), and even insanity ("He is crazy about her"). That means that metaphors can be cognitive and not merely rhetorical. We actually think with metaphors.|$|E

5000|$|The book closes with [...] "The Inner Eye", a {{collection}} of short pieces on the subjective nature of experience. How can one describe <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to be a particular entity, without actually being it yourself? Thomas Nagel, Raymond Smullyan, Douglas Hofstadter, and Robert Nozick tackle the problem of translating the experiences of one being into terms another can understand. But can <b>we</b> ever <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to be another self? For that matter, <b>what</b> can <b>we</b> <b>know</b> about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is like to be ourselves?

60|$|THE NATIONAL MIND IS AWAKENED TO THE SUBJECT OF SNOBS. The word Snob {{has taken}} a place in our honest English vocabulary. We can't define it, perhaps. We can't say what it is, any {{more than we can}} define wit, or humour, or humbug; but <b>we</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is. Some weeks since, {{happening}} to have the felicity to sit next to a young lady at a hospitable table, where poor old Jawkins was holding forth in a very absurd pompous manner, I wrote upon the spotless damask 'S--B,' and called my neighbour's attention to the little remark.|$|E

Barnard {{that he was}} [...] "not clear in the head" [...] about one problem on fiducial inference, and, also writing to Barnard, Fisher complained that his theory seemed to have only [...] "an asymptotic approach to intelligibility". Later Fisher confessed that [...] "I don't understand yet what fiducial probability does. We shall {{have to live with}} it a long time before <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it's</b> doing for us. But it should not be ignored just because we don't yet have a clear interpretation".|$|R

60|$|Beyond {{the gates}} the sight was sad enough, {{the houses in}} the suburbs with broken windows and doors as though pillaged, the gardens devastated, the trees cut down, and the fields, which {{ought to have been}} {{ripening}} to harvest, trampled or mown for forage, all looking as if a hostile invader had been there, and yet it was the sons of the country that had done this, while swarms of starving people pursued us begging.

You know, {{when we were}} grumbling {{sometimes}} at not being employed in the fighting, we have wished we had stopped in Ladysmith, and gone through the siege there; now, one can thank God that one did not do so.

60|$|The squire {{then went}} to the {{governor}} of the jail, who had been connected with him many years as a county magistrate. The governor had heard nothing, received no information as to his prisoner from any one in authority; but quite believed the story as to Crinkett and the woman. 'Perhaps you had better not see him, Mr. Babington,' said the governor, 'as he has heard nothing as yet of all this. It would not be right to tell him till <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> will come to.' Assenting to this, Mr. Babington took his leave with the conviction on his mind that the governor was quite prepared to receive an order for the liberation of his prisoner.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} so," [...] he answered, looking {{steadily}} seawards. [...] "We country people have strong prejudices, you see. It {{seems to us}} that all the sin and all the unhappiness and all the decadence {{and all the things}} that mar the beauty of the world, come from the cities and from life in the cities. No wonder that we want to keep away. It isn't that we think ourselves better than the other folk. It is simply that we have realized pleasures greater than we could find in paved streets and under smoke-stained skies. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is to smell the salt wind, to hear it whistling in the cords and the sails of our boats, to feel the warmth of the sun, to listen to the song of the birds, to watch the colouring of God's land here. I suppose we have the thing in our bloods; we can't leave it. We hear the call of the other things sometimes, but as soon as we obey we are restless and unhappy. It is only an affair of time, and generally a very short time. One cannot fight against nature." ...|$|E

But I charge you to write to him, and tell him that if he does this thing he shall not have a child's portion from me. It is not that I will shorten that which would have been his; but he shall have--nothing!" [...] Then, having spoken these words with a solemnity which for the moment silenced his wife, he got up and left the room.

6000|$|And {{yet it is}} {{impossible}} for any one among us to do otherwise than acquiesce in this vicious circle. Why? Just because no man can dissociate himself outright from the social organism of which he forms a component member. He can no more do so than the eye can dissociate itself from the heart and lungs, or than the legs can shake themselves free from the head and stomach. We have all to learn, and to let our boys learn, what authority decides for us. We can't give them a better education than the average, even if <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is and desire to impart it, because the better education, though abstractly more valuable, is now and here the inlet to nothing. Every door is barred with examinations, and opens but to the golden key of the crammer. Not what is of most real use and importance in life, but what [...] "pays best" [...] in examination, is the test of desirability. We are the victims of a system; and our only hope of redress is not by sporadic individual action but by concerted rebellion. We must cry out against the abuse till at last we are heard by dint of our much speaking. In a world so complex and so highly organised as ours, the individual can only do anything in the long run by influencing the mass--by securing the co-operation of many among his fellows.|$|E
40|$|The {{verification}} {{theory of}} meaning aims to characterise <b>what</b> <b>it</b> {{is for a}} sentence to be meaningful and also what kind of abstract object {{the meaning of a}} sentence is. A brief outline is given by Rudolph Carnap, one of the theory's most prominent defenders: If <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> would be for a given sentence to be found true then <b>we</b> would <b>know</b> <b>what</b> its meaning is. [ [...] . ] thus the meaning of a sentence is in a certain sense identical with the way we determine its truth or falsehood; and a sentence has meaning only if such a determination is possible. [4 : 420] In short, the verification theory of meaning claims that the meaning of a sentence is the method of its verification...|$|R
