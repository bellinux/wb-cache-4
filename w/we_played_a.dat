Then <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> place in Boston called the Lizard Lounge. In fact, a car had run into {{the front of the}} building, and it was all boarded up, but we still played there." [...] When one of the guitarists broke a string Araya would hand them the bass, Hanneman stating, [...] "We'd argue about it, too—like, 'I wanna play bass for a while!'" ...|$|E

Chicago also allowed two 100-yard rushers in the same game {{for the first time}} since 1976 against the Denver Broncos, with Norris Weese (120 yards) and Ottis Anderson (116 yards) guiding the Broncos to 28–14 win. After the game, Marc Trestman stated, [...] "We are a team that was ready to play this game and <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> terrible football game for lack of a better word. I'm not going to use any word other than that. We were terrible in all three phases. We didn't play well in any phase of football." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer James Wong was {{disappointed}} with the episode, feeling that he [...] "didn't {{do a great job}} on the script. We wanted to do a show that's all about paranoia and a conspiracy theory, but at the end I felt like we didn't really gain a lot of new ground or learn a lot of new things. I think <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> lot of texture instead of substance." [...] Series creator Chris Carter on the other hand claimed the episode {{was one of the most}} popular first-season episodes and thought the teaser and the scene with Mulder meeting Deep Throat at a shark tank were memorable. He also praised Jerry Hardin's performance in the episode, finding that he lent the show the [...] "believability" [...] that it needed.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was {{determined}} to move on from the final after scoring an own goal: [...] "Losing cup finals and scoring an own goal is a bad day for myself, but I'll {{look forward to the}} next game now." [...] He also said that Chelsea deserved the victory: [...] "We scored early on and tried to see the clock out because we were 15 minutes away from lifting the cup, but credit to Chelsea they came back and deserved the win." [...] Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez believed that Liverpool would have won the match had they scored when they were leading 1–0: [...] "If you have clear chances at 1–0 and you score the second goal you finish the game, but we made some mistakes and at the end we conceded in our own goal." [...] Despite the defeat he was proud of his players' efforts: [...] "I say to the players we must be proud because <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> good game, Chelsea controlled the game when they started playing, but we re-organised the team with three midfielders and had some opportunities." ...|$|E
500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> college in Santa Barbara, {{and there were}} all these blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

2500|$|During the band's {{existence}} Katsu played throughout Pennsylvania, {{including the}} Grape Street Pub of Manayunk, Philadelphia, popular for its original music performances, and the Hard Rock Cafe in Pittsburgh, {{as well as}} playing in Cleveland, Ohio. Katsu featured at the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon and served as the opening acts for The Presidents of the United States of America and Jason Mraz. Regarding the latter act, Fallon said, [...] "Yeah, <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> show with all the screaming 12-year-old girls. We also opened for the '80s metal band FireHouse. We don't really match that scene, either. It was pretty wacky." [...] State College remained the band's base, however, despite the propensity of a rural university town for cover songs. Fallon explained, [...] "State College is our base of operations. This is where we learned how to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{negotiating}} parties came to agreement: (1) Conversions must {{be carried}} out according to halakha, (2) the beit din overseeing the conversion would be Orthodox, perhaps appointed by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, and (3) there would be a committee consisting of representatives of all three groups to interview potential converts as to their sincerity. [...] Many Reform rabbis took offense at the notion that the beit din must be strictly halakhic and Orthodox, but they acquiesced. [...] However, when word about this project became public, a number of leading Haredi rabbis issued a statement denouncing the project, condemning it as a [...] "travesty of halakha". [...] Rabbi Moshe Sherer, then the Chairman of Agudath Israel World Organization, stated that [...] "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in putting an end to that farce, and I'm proud we did.,” Lamm condemned this interference by Sherer, stating that this was [...] "the most damaging thing that he [...] ever did in his brilliant forty year career." ...|$|E

60|$|And then <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> game {{in which}} the coon failed to be stuck. The victim was a lean and dyspeptic-looking hobo, {{the one who had}} laughed least of all of us.

The coon looked disappointed, then rose to the occasion and guessed he'd have some. He meant it, too. He had some, and then some, and then some. Ever the melancholy hobo climbed down and up the steep bank, and ever the coon called for more. He drank more water than {{all the rest of us}} put together. The twilight deepened into night, the stars came out, and he still drank on. I do believe that if the whistle of the freight hadn't sounded, he'd be there yet, swilling water and revenge while the melancholy hobo toiled down and up.|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} eight when I wrote the lines with which this day begins. Feeling strangely restless and uneasy, I left my rooms and walked round {{to spend the}} evening with Agatha and her mother. They both remarked that I was pale and haggard. About nine Professor Pratt-Haldane came in, and <b>we</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> game of whist. I tried hard to {{concentrate}} my attention upon the cards, but the feeling of restlessness grew and grew until I {{found it impossible to}} struggle against it. I simply COULD not sit still at the table. At last, in the very middle of a hand, I threw my cards down and, with some sort of an incoherent apology about having an appointment, I rushed from the room. As if in a dream I have a vague recollection of tearing through the hall, snatching my hat from the stand, and slamming the door behind me. As in a dream, too, I have the impression of the double line of gas-lamps, and my bespattered boots tell me that I must have run {{down the middle of the}} road. It was all misty and strange and unnatural. I came to Wilson's house; I saw Mrs. Wilson and I saw Miss Penclosa. I hardly recall what we talked about, but I do remember that Miss P. shook the head of her crutch at me in a playful way, and accused me of being late and of losing interest in our experiments. There was no mesmerism, but I stayed some time and have only just returned.|$|E
6000|$|My dear Brothers--I {{ought to}} have written before, and you {{should have had a}} long letter last week, but I {{undertook}} the Champion for Reynolds, who is at Exeter. I wrote two articles, one on the Drury Lane Pantomime, the other on the Covent Garden new Tragedy, which they have not put in;[37] the one they have inserted is so badly punctuated that you perceive I am determined never to write more, without some care in that particular. Wells tells me that you are licking your chops, Tom, in expectation of my book coming out. I am sorry to say I have not begun my corrections yet: to-morrow I set out. I called on Sawrey[38] this morning. He {{did not seem to be}} at all put out at anything I said and the inquiries I made with regard to your spitting of blood, and moreover desired me to ask you to send him a correct account of all your sensations and symptoms concerning the palpitation and the spitting and the cough--if you have any. Your last letter gave me a great pleasure, for I think the invalid is in a better spirit there along the Edge; and as for George, I must immediately, now I think of it, correct a little misconception of a part of my last letter. The Misses Reynolds have never said one word against me about you, or by any means endeavoured to lessen you in my estimation. That is not what I referred to; but the manner and thoughts which I knew they internally had towards you, time will show. Wells and Severn dined with me yesterday. We had a very pleasant day. I pitched upon another bottle of claret, we enjoyed ourselves very much; were all very witty and full of Rhymes. <b>We</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> concert from 4 o'clock till 10--drank your healths, the Hunts', and (N.B.) seven Peter Pindars. I said on that day the only good thing I was ever guilty of. We were talking about Stephens and the 1st Gallery. I said I wondered that careful folks would go there, for although it was but a shilling, still you had to pay through the Nose. I saw the Peachey family in a box at Drury one night. I have got such a curious[39] ... or rather I had such, now I am in my own hand.|$|E

Andrew Martin, from the University of Sydney, looked to the sporting arena {{to find new ways to}} motivate and engage students. Personal best measures are a motivational tool commonly used in sports training. Martin reasoned that if focusing on self-improvement (personal bests) produced elite athletes then it might well improve academic performance, too. Martin's motivation and engagement scale forms the heart of Swinburne University's academic personal best program. Whereas Martin's research focused on individual work, we are trialling a group mentoring approach to use the psychological benefits and support gained from a group environment. The overall aim of the program is to ensure better support, retention and success of students undertaking higher education for the first time...|$|R
