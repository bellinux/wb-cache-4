500|$|On April 9, 1987, {{a two-hour}} meeting with {{three members of}} the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's {{investigation}} of Lincoln. Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> I want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to {{the editing}} process of their {{previous}} DVD Disasterpieces, Crahan watched and analysed all of the footage recorded for the DVD. However in contrast to Disasterpeices this DVD was intended to show a previously unseen side to the band. During an interview in 2006 guitarist Mick Thomson explained that with the DVD the band intended to [...] "bring something new", he also went on to add [...] " [...] more backstage stuff, getting to see more inside stuff {{as opposed to just}} a concert performance." [...] Crahan explained how he wanted to allow the viewer in on more of their time instead of just their performance, recalling a moment when the band were in Australia. He included the footage in the film, explaining; [...] "So I go down to Australia and I go ‘Jesus, there’s bats in the air.’ I’m going to film it and share it <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> it’s part of our lives together. But most bands and people don’t want to share that side of it and I think that’s wrong." [...] Throughout the movie whenever the band members appear unmasked, their faces are blurred, whereas on the second disc, during the interviews, they are completely revealed. When questioned on the subject during an interview on The Sauce in 2007, Crahan explained that when the band perform, the masks are always a part of their show and footage of them unmasked is blurred to represent this. Further adding; [...] "We chose to blur it because, it's really an intrusion. [...] That's our safe place and I kind of broke the veil a little bit by grabbing a camera and trying to show everybody those kinds of things that go on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{provoked}} him," [...] Louis said firmly. [...] "You {{gave him}} provocation such as no gentleman of honour could suffer. It {{was not for}} this that I came out <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> but <b>because</b> <b>you</b> said that you wished to unravel {{what may be a}} plot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{suffering}} from ingrowing sentimentality, Mr Birdsey. That's what's the matter <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Just <b>because</b> {{this man has}} escaped justice for five years, you {{think he ought to}} be considered quit of the whole thing.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove {{to me that}} you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] Ellison replied that his constituents, [...] "know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to — need to prove my patriotic stripes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The January 21 CNN/Congressional Black Caucus {{debate in}} Myrtle Beach {{was the most}} heated {{face-to-face}} meeting yet between the candidates, reflecting apparent personal animosity. Clinton criticized Obama for voting [...] "present" [...] on many occasions while in the Illinois legislature. [...] "It's hard to have a straight up debate <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> you never take responsibility for any vote," [...] she said. Obama explained that Illinois had a different system than Congress and that 'present' votes had a different function and use in the Illinois Senate. Obama {{said that he was}} working to help unemployed workers in Chicago while Clinton was [...] "a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart." [...] He also took issue with statements made on the campaign trail by Bill Clinton, saying [...] "I can't tell who I'm running against sometimes." [...] The confrontation was the most-watched primary season debate in cable television news history.|$|E
2500|$|Martin Luther, {{founder of}} the Lutheran Church, {{believed}} that it was of no avail to pray for the dead. Nonetheless, a core statement of Lutheran doctrine, from the Book of Concord, states: [...] "We know that the ancients speak of prayer for the dead, which we do not prohibit; but we disapprove of the application ex opere operato of the Lord's Supper on behalf of the dead. ... Epiphanius [...] testifies that Aerius [...] held that prayers for the dead are useless. With this he finds fault. Neither do we favor Aerius, but we do argue <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>because</b> you defend a heresy that clearly conflicts with the prophets, apostles, and Holy Fathers, namely, that the Mass justifies ex opere operato, that it merits the remission of guilt and punishment even for the unjust, to whom it is applied, if they do not present an obstacle." [...] (Philipp Melanchthon, Apology of the Augsburg Confession).|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then, if I {{must tell}} you," [...] said she; [...] "in the first place, I don't know you; and, then, I'd rather not shake hands <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> anyway, <b>because</b> {{your hands are}} so dirty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have borne <b>with</b> <b>thee,</b> Annina, <b>because</b> I {{would let}} the gondola get {{beyond the limits of}} the city; but now thou must throw aside thy subterfuge, and speak plainly. Where didst thou leave my wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, sir," [...] {{said the}} Major, fuming, [...] "you compel me to say--putting all modesty aside--that I believe the reason Mrs. Riddel would {{have nothing to}} do <b>with</b> <b>you</b> was <b>because</b> she thought {{somebody}} else might make a similar offer." ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps {{you will}} say I deal not fairly <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> you treat, as of moral, so of gospel or New Testament laws.|$|E

6000|$|... "If you did," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "I should {{perfectly}} despise you. I didn't {{understand how it}} was before. I thought you were just holding out against Dryfoos because he took a dictatorial tone <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't recognize his authority. But now I'm <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Basil, every time, as that horrid little Fulkerson says. But who would ever have supposed he would be so base as to side against you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Afraid!" [...] exclaimed Maikar, with {{a sarcastic}} laugh. [...] "No, captain, but I'm sorry to part <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> you've {{been a good}} captain to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{have the}} truth, then!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I {{brought you here}} to be alone <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> I hoped that I might find you a little kinder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I {{ought to}} agree <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>because</b> {{we never had}} any." [...] Then there was a pause. [...] "I suppose you've heard about Lord Ongar," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shan't {{ask you to}} let me live <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> Angel, <b>because</b> I have {{no right}} to!

6000|$|... "That's where Mrs. Green wouldn't agree <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> Perhaps <b>because</b> {{it would}} make the bold things happy to have masters, though she does n't say so. Probably she wants the women to have women doctors so they won't be so well, and can have more time to think whether they have been good or not. You ought to hear some of the ladies over there talk, mother." ...|$|R

60|$|It {{would take}} the whole year through, my friend, to show you all {{that it has to}} do <b>with</b> <b>you</b> and your unhappiness.

Then Christmas-day is a witness to you, that whatsoever happens to you, happens to you by the will and rule of Jesus Christ, The perfect man; think of that. THE PERFECT MAN--who understands men's hearts and wants, and all that is good for them, and has all the wisdom and power to give us what is good, which we want ourselves. And what makes you unhappy, my friends? Is it not at heart just this one thing--you are unhappy <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are not pleased <b>with</b> yourselves? And <b>you</b> are not pleased <b>with</b> yourselves <b>because</b> <b>you</b> know you ought not to be pleased <b>with</b> yourselves; and <b>you</b> know you ought not to be pleased <b>with</b> yourselves, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> know, in the bottom of your hearts, that God is not pleased <b>with</b> <b>you?</b> What cure, what comfort for such thoughts can we find?--This.|$|R
