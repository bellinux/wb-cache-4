500|$|... 1910 saw the {{restoration}} of the rood screen in a style consistent with that of the two ancient panels, the reconstruction of the rood loft, and the installation of a Norman and Beard two-manual organ with more than a thousand pipes. The organ pipes are above the parclose screens; the bellows, <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> and electric blower are concealed in the chamber above the chancel. The stalls with their misericords were restored in 1913. The rood crucifix, flanked by St Mary and St John, came from Germany in 1913.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{instrument}} called hulusheng is a mouth organ with a gourd <b>wind</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The most {{well-known}} instrument is the qeej, {{a type of}} reed pipe, in which each tone corresponds to a Hmong spoken word. [...] It is a free-reed mouth organ, used to play a text-based melody in the middle range. It consists of a wooden <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> with a long horizontal tapering neck ending in a mouth hole. The wooden section is made from two identical pieces of mahogany bound together with straps. The six bamboo tubes are variously curving or straight and can also change in length from quite small for a child's instrument to about two meters long for a more experience player. Each bamboo tube has a hole for fingering above the <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> and a metal reed over {{a hole in the}} pipe encircled within the <b>wind</b> <b>chest.</b> For extra volume, the lowest tube, which is also the thickest and shortest one, often has two or three reeds. The tubes are inserted vertically through the <b>wind</b> <b>chest.</b> When the player exhales or inhales and covers one or more holes for fingering, this allows air in the tube in motion to create a musical tone. There are two types of qeej composition: text-based and text-free. Both genres are played successively in rituals, including funerals, ancestral rites, offerings to vital spirits, sacrifices to the drum, and marriages.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{has four}} manuals, 88speaking stops and 4565pipes. It works {{by way of}} air pressure, {{controlled}} by an electric current and operated by the keys of the organ console; this opens and closes valves within the <b>wind</b> <b>chests,</b> allowing the pipes to speak. This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} {{following}} the 1984 rebuild, the organ suffered quite serious water and some rodent damage. This particularly affected {{the right-hand side}} of the instrument, the section containing parts of the Great, Positive and Pedal organ. Damage to the <b>wind</b> <b>chests,</b> some of the wooden pipes and to the electro-mechanical working of the organ affected the instrument to the extent that several ranks of pipes no longer functioned.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} organ {{installed in}} the Ira Allen Chapel was a three-manual, electro-pneumatic Welte-Mignon Philharmonic Pipe Organ. The manual compass was CC to C4 (61 notes). The pedal compass was CCC to G (32 notes). The <b>wind</b> <b>chests</b> of the manuals featured superoctave couplers (4'), which extended the compass of the keyboards to 73 notes. There was also installed a reproducing console, which played recorded rolls in detail utilizing pedals, swells, and tempo characteristics of renown organists.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Pipes of the Pedal Organ. The foot, cap, {{block and}} mouth {{of several of}} the large pipes of the Open Diapason 16'. The middle pipe shown sounds FFF(23.125 Hz). These are the organ's largest wooden pipes with nine pipes grouped {{together}} on their own <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> each pipe with double air valves to accommodate the large amount of air they require to sound.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Wallace Clement Sabine started {{experiments}} at Harvard University {{to investigate the}} impact of absorption on the reverberation time. Using a portable <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> and organ pipes as a sound source, a stopwatch and his ears, he measured the time from interruption of the source to inaudibility (a difference of roughly 60 dB). He found that the reverberation time is proportional to room dimensions and inversely proportional {{to the amount of}} absorption present.|$|E
5000|$|A trumpeter clock can {{be found}} in several {{different}} variations. The most common examples are known to collectors as a [...] "blowers" [...] or [...] "German buglers". These examples use a modified cuckoo type movement that produces a simple trumpet like call. Instead of using a wooden cuckoo pipe, these examples have small reed/horn assemblies. This varies from the large trumpeter clocks that use a large bellows system that feeds air into a <b>wind</b> <b>chest.</b> A pinned music wheel controls a series of valves to reproduce a complex musical tune.|$|E
50|$|Most {{significant}} changes {{in the structure of the}} instrument were made during the interwar period. Between 1934-1935, Gdańsk organ builder, Joseph Goebel extended the organ to 4 manuals and added a new electro-pneumatic tracker action with <b>wind</b> <b>chests.</b> He used 51 registers from those already existing, renewing some of them and adding some new ones. Moreover, he connected the choir organ to the main console. After completion of the work, the Oliwa organ had 82 standard registers and 5 transmitted ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action is}} a control system for pipe organs, whereby air pressure, controlled by an electric current and operated by the keys of an organ console, opens and closes valves within <b>wind</b> <b>chests,</b> allowing the pipes to speak. This system also allows the console to be physically detached from the organ itself. The only connection was via an electrical cable from the console to the relay, with some early organ consoles utilizing a separate wind supply to operate combination pistons.|$|R
50|$|Many {{alterations}} {{were done}} on the organ {{in the course of}} time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the <b>wind</b> <b>chests</b> were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.|$|R
5000|$|More {{thorough}} {{rehabilitation of}} the organ became necessary. Problems arose such as unstable intonation. The worn-out leather parts (carefully and leak proof knitting as of the modern age) of the instrument needed replacement since they caused air leakage. Many of these leather parts were located in the <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> - replacing them would resort to disassembling the instrument. From September 2003 to November 2004, the Diego Cera Organbuilders, Incorporated carried out the general overhaul of the instrument under the sponsorship of the National Commission for the Culture and the Arts.|$|E
5000|$|The Yu ( [...] ; pinyin: yú) {{was a free}} reed wind {{instrument}} used in ancient China. It {{was similar to the}} sheng, with multiple bamboo pipes fixed in a <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> which may have been made of bamboo, wood, or a gourd. Each pipe contained a free reed, which was also made of bamboo. Whereas the sheng was used to provide simultaneous tones in harmony (in fourths and fifths), the yu was played in single lines melodically. The instrument was used, often in large numbers, in court orchestras of ancient China (and was also exported to Korea and Japan) but is no longer used.|$|E
50|$|In 1925 and 1926, {{the organ}} was badly damaged by two floods. It was {{repaired}} by an R. Myram {{and moved to}} its present position in the loft above the floor level. In 1927, Kuala Lumpur's sole organ builder, James A Riddell, rebuilt the organ and replaced most of the wooden pipes, the pedal board, the <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> {{and some of the}} keys. It was badly damaged again during the Second World War necessitating a complete rebuild in 1951, making the organ more Riddell than Willis by then. The fact that Riddell's work was reminiscent of Willis' work strongly suggests that Riddell might have been a former apprentice or jourmeyman of Henry Willis & Sons.|$|E
50|$|The organ by Renatus Harris {{was built}} in the early 18th century. It has {{undergone}} a historical restoration by the organ builders Goetze and Gwynn, and been returned to its 1744 specification using many of the original components. The organ has been described as the oldest church organ in the United Kingdom. Although there are older pipes and cases, this is the oldest collection of pipes in their original positions on their original <b>wind</b> <b>chests.</b> Because of its historic importance, the organ was filmed and recorded for the documentary The Elusive English Organ.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the organ}} was again in a state of disrepair, with an {{ever-increasing}} number of stops unusable due to leaks in the wind system, cracks in the soundboards, and other problems. By 2002, it was maintained only through [...] "heroic efforts" [...] on the part of Harrisons and could not be used at all without their staff present, in case of mishap. The <b>wind</b> <b>chests</b> and pipes were leaking noisily and wind pressure was insufficient to support full use. The leatherwork in the actions was also failing.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} is playable from two consoles. Its main console {{is located at}} the upper gallery and has 4 manuals and a pedal. The second console is on the lower gallery and it duplicates the fourth manual of the main console. The organ has 124 stops, which sound from 6718 pipes arranged on 26 <b>wind</b> <b>chests.</b> The longest pipe is about 10 metres long, the shortest one is only 13 mm. Pipe diameters are from 50 cm to 4 mm. The materials used in the pipes include pine, fir, maple, oak, beech, and pear and different metal alloys. There are 116 voices, 144 ranks; 18 combinations and General Crescendo.|$|R
5000|$|An early medieval writer Theophilus Presbyter, {{believed}} to be the Benedictine monk and metalworker Roger of Helmarshausen, wrote a treatise in the early-to-mid-12th century that includes original work and copied information from other sources, such as the Mappae clavicula and Eraclius, De dolorous et artibus Romanorum. It provides step-by-step procedures for making various articles, some by lost-wax casting: [...] "The Copper <b>Wind</b> <b>Chest</b> and Its Conductor" [...] (Chapter 84); [...] "Tin Cruets" [...] (Chapter 88), and [...] "Casting Bells" [...] (Chapter 85), which call for using [...] "tallow" [...] instead of wax; and [...] "The Cast Censer". In Chapters 86 and 87 Theophilus details how to divide the wax into differing ratios before moulding and casting to achieve accurately tuned small musical bells. The 16th-century Florentine sculptor Benvenuto Cellini may have used Theophilus' writings when he cast his bronze Perseus.|$|E
50|$|All bird box {{movements}} have a clock-work motor {{which must be}} wound up. This motor is doing two basic jobs: The first one is to operate a small bellows which supplies air, via a <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> to a whistle which produces the birdsong and the second task is to rotate a number of cams. One cam controls the note produced by the whistle, a second determines when the note will be produced and for how long, and a third one produces the motion which causes the bird to turn from side to side. In some movements the flapping of the bird's wings {{and its ability to}} turn its head are also cam-controlled, in others not. The final cam determines {{the point at which the}} song ends, the bird folds away, the lid drops and the motor stops. The bird's beak movements are always connected to the cam controlling the air supply to the whistle: in this way the sound and beak movements are automatically synchronized.|$|E
5000|$|Ericsson's earlier {{works were}} closer in style {{to those of}} Klaus Huber or Luigi Nono, but this {{compositional}} approach became restrictive, and Ericsson went {{through a period of}} compositional silence in between 1984/85 and 1999. Ericsson's more recent music draws more freely from various styles, and concentrates, to a certain extent, on musical timbre and space, as well as referential ideas in music. For example, his work [...] "The Four Beast' Amen", for organ and electronics, begins with the organ in dialogue with recordings of organs from Hamburg, Stade, Norden, Cappel and Lüdingworth. The style refers to older organ works, such as those of Frescobaldi or Buxtehude, but with all of the organs overlapping {{in such a way that}} everything is blurry. The second movement changes completely in style, concentrating on sounds created by the <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> of the organ. Some of the later movements of this work focus on differences in tuning between some of the organs that we heard in the beginning.|$|E
50|$|Finally, in 1965, a {{complete}} restoration was urgently needed, and organ builder Hærpfer-Erman was designated. The restoration was supervised by famous organist Gaston Litaize and transformed the instrument's specification {{according to the}} néo-classique ideas that were in vogue after World War II.The wind system, action, console and <b>wind</b> <b>chests</b> were mostly kept unspoilt, but the stop specifications were modified and pipes were re-voiced. Some characteristic stops from the romantic organ’s period such as harmonic stops, several viola da gamba, and several 16’ stops were replaced by smaller ones such as mixtures and mutation stops, corresponding to the classical French organ style. As was customary after World War II, materials used were of poor quality, especially regarding the organ’s historical content.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to new pipe work, voice work, new <b>wind</b> <b>chests,</b> Schantz built two new identical four-manual consoles: {{one for the}} Gallery {{and one for the}} Chancel allowing the organist to control both organs from either location. The chancel console can be moved around the sanctuary to suit various needs. In the original Moller installation, the Great Gallery organ console had four-manuals and could control over both the Gallery and Sanctuary organs. The Sanctuary organ console was two manuals, had complete control over the Sanctuary organ and the Gallery organ through [...] "blind" [...] controls. The Sanctuary console was replaced in 1974 due to a fire in the console which caused smoke damage to both organs' pipework. After the renovations, the Great Gallery organ holds 100 ranks and the Sanctuary organ holds 27.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Salzburg, Lehrndorfer {{grew up in}} Kempten. He {{received}} his first music lessons from his father, who was a choir director and musicologist. He played the organ in the local parish age 9. From 1948 to 1951, Lehrndorfer studied Catholic Church Music in Munich, achieving his master class diploma for organ in 1952. After graduation, {{he worked as a}} music teacher with the boys' choir Regensburger Domspatzen under cathedral Kapellmeister Theobald Schrems. In 1962, he {{began his career as a}} lecturer at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater München where he worked until his retirement in 1993 as head of Catholic church music. From 1969 to 2003, Lehrndorfer also worked in the position of organist at the Munich cathedral Frauenkirche. A particular focus of his artistic activity is organ improvisation. In 2001, he played the premiere of Harald Genzmer's Concerto for organ and edited it for publication by Schott Music. He composed mostly works for organ, such as variations on the carol [...] "O du fröhliche", and sacred music. Lehrndorfer designed several major organs, including in 1980 the new organ of the Tegernsee Abbey with 33 stops, three manuals, a pedalboard and mechanical <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> made by Georg Jann.|$|E
5000|$|... 1910 saw the {{restoration}} of the rood screen in a style consistent with that of the two ancient panels, the reconstruction of the rood loft, and the installation of a Norman and Beard two-manual organ with more than a thousand pipes. The organ pipes are above the parclose screens; the bellows, <b>wind</b> <b>chest</b> and electric blower are concealed in the chamber above the chancel. The stalls with their misericords were restored in 1913. The rood crucifix, flanked by St Mary and St John, came from Germany in 1913.Much church plate, such as the chalice and pyx had been confiscated, sold or stolen {{in the heat of the}} Reformation. In the more tolerant climate of Elizabethan England, the excesses of extreme Protestantism were curbed by centralised control of the Church of England, the Act of Uniformity and the Book of Common Prayer. Most churches then had to buy a new chalice; Blakeney's was purchased in 1567, and exchanged for another in 1716. One lost treasure is a [...] "Map of the World" [...] (Mappa Mundi et Chroniculum Mundi), which was recorded as present in the church in 1368. This is thought more likely to be a version of Ranulf Higdon's Polychronicon, a geographical text, than a true map like the Hereford Mappa Mundi.|$|E
50|$|A set of levers called keys is {{positioned}} {{just above the}} surface of the barrel. Each key corresponds to one pitch. A rod is connected to the rear of each key. The other end of the rod is a metal pin which operates a valve within the <b>wind</b> <b>chest.</b> When the instrument is played (by turning the crank), offsets on the crank shaft cause bellows to open and close to produce pressurized air. A reservoir/regulator maintains a constant pressure. A worm gear on the crank shaft causes the barrel to rotate slowly and its pins and staples lift the fronts of the keys. This causes {{the other end of the}} key to press down on the end of the rod which, in turn, activates the valve and allows air from the bellows to pass into the corresponding pipe. To allow different tunes to be played from one barrel, the barrel can be moved laterally to bring a different set of pins and staples under the keys. Street barrel organs usually play 7 to 9 tunes, although small organs (usually the older ones) can play up to 15 tunes. Less commonly (and usually for large orchestrions) the pinning will form one continuous spiral and the barrel will be gradually moved as it rotates so that the pins remain lined up with the keys. In this case, each barrel plays only one long tune.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, an Electropneumatic organ, {{built by}} Hill, Norman and Beard (England), was {{installed}} in the gallery at the “west” end of the church. The instrument of two manuals and 20 stops was dedicated on October 25, 1958. In 1982, the organ was rebuilt by Francois Caron. The console was replaced (the surround being retained), new <b>wind</b> <b>chests</b> were installed and {{a large amount of}} new pipework was added, bringing the specification to 29 stops. The new organ was blessed and dedicated on October 24, 1982, as a memorial to those members of the congregation who gave their lives in two world wars. During the 1982 rebuild, the organ case was expanded to incorporate new pipework, and reconfigured so as to not obscure the rose window above it. In mid-October 1982, the organ was installed. It was blessed and dedicated on October 24, 1982, the Feast of Dedication, by the Rt. Rev. E.K. Lackey, Bishop of Ottawa, as a memorial to those members of the congregation who gave their lives in two world wars. In 1995, the organ case was beutified by stylistic wooden mouldings and countless hours of careful hand-painting. The original swell box mechanism, retained from the Hill, Norman and Beard instrument was replaced in summer 1997. In 1998, all of the pipework was removed and shipped to Montreal for cleaning, adjustment and revoicing by Sylvain Brisson. There was a rededication of the organ at Solemn Evensong and Benediction on the Feast of Dedication, October 18, 1998.|$|R

60|$|Mad Jack was {{expressly}} {{created and}} labelled for a tar. Five feet nine is his mark, in his socks; and not weighing over eleven stone before dinner. Like so many ship's shrouds, his muscles and tendons are all set true, trim, and taut; he is braced up fore and aft, like a ship on the <b>wind.</b> His broad <b>chest</b> is a bulkhead, that dams off the gale; and his nose is an aquiline, that divides it in two, like a keel.

40|$|Abstract In this talk, I {{will discuss}} a few {{different}} types of free-reed mouth organs that I have researched on the Chinese side of the China-Vietnam border region. These mouth organs are played by ethnic groups speaking languages belonging to different language phyla, namely Austroasiatic, Tibeto-Burman, and Hmong-Mien. The Austroasiatic-speaking Bugan people of Zhuanjiao Township 篆角乡, Guangnan County, Yunnan, China play a long calabash-gourd mouth organ which they call the pɔ 31, which also literally means ‘to blow’ in the Bugan language. Intriguingly, some Lolo-Burmese-speaking peoples of the region also play very similar instruments, such as the ɲɛ 31 of the Kathu people of Nanping Town 南屏镇, Guangnan County, Yunnan, and the ɲaŋ 33 of the Meang people of Dala Village 达腊村, Napo County, Guangxi. All of the aforementioned instruments measure about one meter in length and have five bamboo pipes, a calabash gourd <b>wind</b> <b>chest,</b> and a calabash gourd resonator; as of now, these musical instruments are all severely endangered. However, the neighboring Hmong in the region play a morphologically different mouth organ called the qen, which differs in shape and tone from the larger type played in Laos and north-central Vietnam. Photographs and videos of these mouth organs will be shown, and implications for interethnic interactions and migrations will also be discussed...|$|E
