5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} ever, the NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name of the list, and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed <b>well</b> <b>out</b> to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|By November 1885, Adler had a {{theatrical}} club of his own, the Princes Street Club, No. 3 Princes Street (now Princelet Street, E1), purpose-built, financed by a butcher named David Smith. It seated 300; playing every night except Friday, he was earning about £3 s.10 a week, {{but with a}} fame <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of proportion to the meagre money. Many {{of the most prominent}} figures in Yiddish theater, including Sigmund Mogulesko, David Kessler, Abba and Clara Shoengold, and Sara Heine (the future Sara Adler), gave guest performances when they passed through London.|$|E
5|$|Giro {{champion}} Denis Menchov was {{the last}} man to take the course. The rain started again as he and Di Luca were the last ones on course. He was on pace to win the stage, but he dramatically crashed in the final kilometer, with his bike skidding <b>well</b> <b>out</b> {{in front of him}} on the wet cobbles. Support staff from his team car gave him a very quick bike change and he was back up in moments, finishing 24 seconds back on the stage to preserve his overall victory in the Giro.|$|E

5|$|Heskey was {{selected}} in the squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and {{was used as a}} makeshift option to play in England's left-wing role in the match against Sweden, but did not perform <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of his regular position. He scored against Denmark in England's 3–0 victory, which saw England reach the quarter-finals of the tournament. He featured in this match, where England were beaten 2–1 by the eventual champions Brazil. He and teammate Ashley Cole received abuse from some Slovakia supporters when England played them in a friendly in October 2002, which led to UEFA opening an investigation into the allegations. Slovakia were eventually forced to play their next home international behind closed doors.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, the Dodgers won the NL pennant {{and went}} to the World Series to face the Oakland Athletics. Alston used closer Mike Marshall in a record-setting 106 games that season and Marshall won the Cy Young Award. Alston {{received}} some media attention when he considered using Marshall as a starter. Marshall ended up appearing in all five games of the series and gave up one run in nine innings, but he did not start a game. The Dodgers lost the series four games to one. The 1975 and 1976 Dodgers won 88 and 92 games respectively, but they finished <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of first place in both seasons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lobengula {{moved to}} the north-east, now <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of the Company's reach for the {{foreseeable}} future. However, his sickness, {{which turned out to}} be smallpox, sharply intensified and eventually killed him on 22 or 23 January 1894. With the king dead, Mjaan, the most senior of the izinDuna, took command of the Matabele. Mjaan was an old man, and his only son had been killed in the war. He wished to make peace. In late February 1894, he convened an indaba at which he and his contemporaries met with James Dawson, a trader known to them for many years, who offered the olive branch on behalf of the Company. The izinDuna unanimously accepted. They also told the trader what had happened to the Shangani Patrol, and led him to the battle site to survey it, as well as to examine and identify the largely skeletonised bodies of the soldiers, which still lay where they had fallen. Dawson was the first non-Matabele to learn of the last stand.|$|E

5|$|Most mysticetes reside at the poles. So, {{to prevent}} the unborn calf from dying of frostbite, they migrate to calving/mating grounds. They will then stay there for {{a matter of months}} until the calf has {{developed}} enough blubber to survive the bitter temperatures of the poles. Until then, the calves will feed on the mother's fatty milk. With the exception of the humpback whale, it is largely unknown when whales migrate. Most will travel from the Arctic or Antarctic into the tropics to mate, calve, and raise during the winter and spring; they will migrate back to the poles in the warmer summer months so the calf can continue growing while the mother can continue eating, as they fast in the breeding grounds. One exception to this is the southern right whale, which migrates to Patagonia and western New Zealand to calve; both are <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of the tropic zone.|$|E
5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) is a delicate process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E
5|$|At 12:30 two {{companies}} of the Canterbury Battalion landed and {{were sent to}} support the Aucklands, who had now been ordered back to Plugge's Plateau, and were forming on {{the left of the}} 3rd Brigade. The Canterbury companies moved into the line on the Aucklands' left, waiting {{for the rest of their}} brigade to land. However, between 12:30 and 16:00 not one infantry or artillery formation came ashore. The ships carrying the New Zealanders were in the bay, but the steamers and rowing boats were being used to take the large numbers of wounded to the hospital ship. The transports with the 4th Australian Brigade on board were still <b>well</b> <b>out</b> at sea and not due to land until that evening. The landings recommenced around 16:30 when the Wellington Battalion came ashore, followed by the Otago Battalion around 17:00, who were put into the line beside the Aucklanders. Next to land were the two other Canterbury companies, who were sent north to Walker's Ridge to extend the corps left flank. Events ashore now forced a change in the disembarkation schedule, and at 17:50 orders were issued for the 4th Australian Brigade to start landing to boost the defence. It would take until the next day for the complete brigade to come ashore. The transports carrying both divisions' artillery batteries had been forced further out to sea by Turkish artillery fire, and were unable to land.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} squadron sailed from Cadiz on 9 July, progressing rapidly southwards {{and reaching}} Algeciras Bay {{late in the}} afternoon, except for Saint Antoine which was delayed and arrived the following morning. The force was anchored close to Algeciras, <b>well</b> <b>out</b> of range of cannon at Gibraltar, and there waited for Linois to finish making the necessary repairs to his ships. Shadowing the combined squadron was a small British force under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats on HMS Superb with the frigate HMS Thames and the brig HMS Pasley. Although part of Saumarez's squadron, Keats had been too late {{to take part in}} the first battle, and had instead cruised off Cadiz watching the Spanish fleet there. When Moreno sailed, Keats was initially chased by portions of the Franco-Spanish squadron, but eluded and followed them, subsequently joining Saumarez at Gibraltar. At the British port, the dockyards were the scene of frantic activity as Saumarez, supported by commissioner Captain Alexander Ball, sought to repair his squadron so that it could intercept Moreno's forces on their voyage back to Cadiz. Pompée was temporarily abandoned in the yard, her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron. Saumarez also gave orders that his flagship, HMS Caesar was also to be left at Gibraltar, but Captain Jahleel Brenton requested the opportunity to repair his ship and Saumarez relented, the crew of Caesar working all day and in shifts throughout the night in order to bring their ship up to fighting standard. Saumarez believed however that due to the condition of Linois's ships and the mistaken assumption that the combined squadron would sail for Cartagena to the east, he would have at least two weeks to prepare and sent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith, then at sea off Egypt, requesting support against the combined squadron.|$|E
