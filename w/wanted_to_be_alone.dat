2500|$|From {{the early}} days of her career, Garbo avoided {{industry}} social functions, preferring to spend her time alone or with friends. She never signed autographs or answered fan mail, and rarely gave interviews. Nor did she ever appear at Oscar ceremonies, even when she was nominated. Her aversion to publicity and the press was undeniably genuine, and exasperating to the studio at first. In an interview in 1928, she explained that her desire for privacy began when she was a child, stating [...] "as early as I can remember, I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone.</b> I detest crowds, don't like many people." ...|$|E

2500|$|On {{the nights}} of September 19 and 21, Clementi texted with Ravi about using their {{room for the}} evening. On the first occasion, Ravi met Clementi's male friend, and Clementi said that the two <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> for the evening. In conversations with Wei and later text {{messages}} with friends, Ravi expressed distrust of the stranger that Clementi brought into the room, describing him as [...] "an older, shabbier-looking guy".

However, other witnesses testified that Ravi said he also wanted to confirm that Clementi was gay. Ravi and Wei viewed the video stream via iChat for a few seconds, seeing Clementi and his guest kissing. Ravi posted to his 150 Twitter followers, [...] "Roommate asked for the room till midnight.
