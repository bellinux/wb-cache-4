5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had no interest in such subjects. Notably, <b>when</b> <b>given</b> a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} slug caterpillar, Limacodidae, have {{numerous}} protuberances and stinging spines along their dorsal surfaces.

5|$|One of the {{advantages}} of linezolid is its high bioavailability (close to 100%) <b>when</b> <b>given</b> by mouth: the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, {{as if it had been}} given intravenously. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.|$|E
5|$|Saber {{doubted that}} it would be able to convert Combat Evolveds split-screen {{cooperative}} play to facilitate online play. Greg Hermann, a 343 Industries technical lead who had experience with Bungie technology, assisted Saber in development of a networking solution that would allow online co-op. Since the original game would behave identically <b>when</b> <b>given</b> the same scenario and inputs, only the player inputs needed to be synchronized between players' Xbox consoles.|$|E
5|$|Some organisms, {{such as the}} lichen Trapelia involuta or {{microorganisms}} such as {{the bacterium}} Citrobacter, can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times {{the level of their}} environment. Citrobacter species absorb uranyl ions <b>when</b> <b>given</b> glycerol phosphate (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in bioremediation to decontaminate uranium-polluted water.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the player}} has no direct {{control over the}} patients, they have some {{influence}} over whether to evict them from the hospital and in determining {{what to do with}} them <b>when</b> <b>given</b> a choice by the staff. The player can pick up any staff member in the building and move them (mainly to reassign them to another room or send them to get rest), or dismiss them if they argue about pay or are no longer required. The player may force patients to take a chance at a cure for their suspected disease before diagnosis is complete (at the risk of killing the patient), and rearrange queues.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{models of}} {{cooperation}} require proximate mechanisms that sustain prosociality despite inherent costs to individuals. The "warm glow" that often follows prosocial acts could provide one such mechanism; if so, these emotional benefits may be observable {{very early in}} development. Consistent with this hypothesis, the present study finds that {{before the age of}} two, toddlers exhibit greater happiness <b>when</b> <b>giving</b> treats to others than receiving treats themselves. Further, children are happier after engaging in costly giving [...] forfeiting their own resources [...] than <b>when</b> <b>giving</b> the same treat at no cost. By documenting the emotionally rewarding properties of costly prosocial behavior among toddlers, this research provides initial support for the claim that experiencing positive emotions <b>when</b> <b>giving</b> to others is a proximate mechanism for human cooperation...|$|R
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp had taken a bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. <b>When</b> <b>given</b> the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Governor John P. Richardson {{had been}} elected in 1886; in 1888 he sought re-nomination, to be met with {{opposition}} from Tillman's farmers. As {{had been done to}} Republican rallies in 1876, Tillman and his followers attended campaign events and demanded that he be allowed equal time to speak. Tillman was a highly talented stump speaker, and <b>when</b> <b>given</b> the opportunity to debate, accused Richardson of being irreligious, a gambler and a drunkard. Even so, Richardson was easily re-nominated by the state Democratic convention, which turned down Tillman's demand for a primary election. Tillman proposed the customary gracious motion that Richardson's nomination be made unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Hines led John Hunt Morgan back to Confederate lines. First, {{they arrived}} at the train station in {{downtown}} Columbus, where they bought tickets to Cincinnati, Ohio. The duo jumped off the train before it entered the Cincinnati train station. They continued to evade capture in Cincinnati, staying for one night at the Ben Johnson House in Bardstown, Kentucky. In Tennessee, Hines diverted the Union troops' attention away from John Hunt Morgan, and was himself recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging. He escaped that night by telling stories to the soldier in charge of him and subdued him <b>when</b> <b>given</b> the chance. A few days later he again escaped Union soldiers who intended to hang him.|$|E

5|$|In 1639 William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} Covenanters, a Presbyterian {{movement}} who opposed the established Episcopal Church and the changes which Charles I was attempting to impose. With James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, he marched against the Catholic James Gordon, 2nd Viscount Aboyne, Earl of Huntly, and defeated an attempt by the Royalists to seize Stonehaven. However, when Montrose changed sides to the Royalists and marched north, Marischal remained in Dunnottar, even <b>when</b> <b>given</b> command of the area by Parliament, and even when Montrose burned Stonehaven.|$|E
5|$|Indium has no {{metabolic}} role in any organism. In {{a similar}} way to aluminium salts, indium(III) ions can be toxic to the kidney <b>when</b> <b>given</b> by injection. Indium tin oxide and indium phosphide harm the pulmonary and immune systems, predominantly through ionic indium, though hydrated indium oxide is more than forty times as toxic when injected, measured by the quantity of indium introduced. Radioactive indium-111 (in very small amounts on a chemical basis) is used in nuclear medicine tests, as a radiotracer to follow the movement of labeled proteins and white blood cells in the body. Indium compounds are mostly not absorbed upon ingestion and are only moderately absorbed on inhalation; {{they tend to be}} stored temporarily in the muscles, skin, and bones before being excreted, and the biological half-life of indium is about two weeks in humans.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. <b>When</b> <b>given</b> intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E

5|$|Turbinellus floccosus is {{poisonous}} to {{some people}} who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A tricarboxylic acid known as α-tetradecylcitric acid {{may be responsible for}} the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms. Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that <b>when</b> <b>given</b> to rats, it led to mydriasis, skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression. Turbinellus floccosus contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related T. kauffmanii.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>given</b> {{for short}} periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe antibiotic. It {{can be used in}} people of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common side effects with short-term use include headache, diarrhea, rash, and nausea. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, bone marrow suppression, and high blood lactate levels, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause sometimes irreversible nerve damage including optic nerve damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tour}} matches, Loxton {{sometimes}} opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller {{in order to}} conserve their energy for the Tests, such as in both innings of the match against Northamptonshire and the second match against Surrey. In his 22 first-class innings, he batted twice at No.4 and opened in one innings, but he was otherwise invariably in the middle-order between No.5 and No.7.N- Loxton was the most economical of those who bowled more than 70 overs, but also the least incisive, taking a wicket every 67.75 balls, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings, which he managed on three occasions. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries and took 32 wickets at 21.71. Loxton was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was given less opportunities than the other frontline batsmen who scored more heavily; whereas he had 22 innings, they all had at least 26 innings and tended to bat higher in the order. However, Loxton was productive <b>when</b> <b>given</b> a chance, ranking fifth in the averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven ahead of him took at least 50 wickets.|$|E
