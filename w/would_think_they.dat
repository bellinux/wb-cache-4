25|$|The {{idea that}} those aboard Voyager {{incorrectly}} assessed {{their position in}} relation to the carrier was most prominently supported by Robertson during the first commission: he suggested that Stevens and the others aboard the destroyer may have believed that they were on Melbournes port bow. The navigational lights aboard Melbourne may have been dimmed (there is disagreement on this point), and experimental red floodlights on the flight deck may have been seen and misinterpreted as a port-side navigation light. The second Royal Commission felt that this, combined with the ill health of Stevens, was the more likely cause of the collision. Frame states that for this theory to be plausible, the entire bridge crew had to lose the tactical picture at the same time, which he considered to be too improbable. Ferry is also of the opinion that, unless Melbourne was both in Voyagers radar blind spot and obscured by exhaust from the destroyer, it was unlikely that the bridge crew <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were not to starboard of the carrier.|$|E
500|$|The {{downloadable}} episode Turnabout Reclaimed {{was written}} by the game designer Yuki Nakamura, {{with the concept of}} [...] "lighthearted fun" [...] to set it apart from the main game. The first thing she decided on was to feature an orca, and have the story take place in an aquarium; it took her several tries to decide {{on the rest of the}} story. One of the scrapped ideas involved the orca stealing treasures from the aquarium and attacking people by the shore during its escape to the sea, with the episode's mystery involving the reason for the orca's behavior. The opening for this draft would have involved guards and detective Fulbright vaguely referring to someone escaping; the intention was that the player <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were talking about Blackquill, before it was revealed to be the orca.|$|E
500|$|Williams {{returned}} {{to work on the}} King's Quest series after Phantasmagoria was completed. Sierra used the same technology and Hollywood techniques from Phantasmagoria to make [...] (1995), another interactive movie adventure game. Williams later described Phantasmagoria as the game that best represented her career as a game designer. Due to its development delays, Phantasmagoria was released after other interactive movie games like Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon, so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that gaming subgenre as the other titles. Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said {{by the time it was}} finally released, [...] "computer games that incorporate video (were) becoming a common sight on the software store racks". Sean Clark, a project leader at LucasArts, feared the success of Phantasmagoria would set a bad precedent in that software companies <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> need huge budgets and lots of discs to have a successful game, rather than focusing on quality.|$|E

2500|$|The website BuzzFeed {{interviewed a}} man named Ray, who {{was a friend of}} Mess and an {{acquaintance}} of Tsarnaev. Ray said: Tam wasn't there at the memorial service, he wasn't at the funeral, he wasn't around at all... And he was really close with Brendan. That's why it's so weird when he said, 'I don't have any American friends.' Ray continued: [...] "He was somebody who was in contact with Brendan on a daily basis. Anybody like that you <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would have been around." [...] Ray did not have any further contact with Tsarnaev after the murders.|$|E
2500|$|Capote {{was well}} known for his distinctive, high-pitched voice and odd vocal mannerisms, his offbeat manner of dress, and his fabrications. He often claimed to know intimately people whom he had in fact never met, such as Greta Garbo. He professed to have had {{numerous}} liaisons with men thought to be heterosexual, including, he claimed, Errol Flynn. He traveled in an eclectic array of social circles, hobnobbing with authors, critics, business tycoons, philanthropists, Hollywood and theatrical celebrities, royalty, and members of high society, both in the U.S. and abroad. Part of his public persona was a longstanding rivalry with writer Gore Vidal. Their rivalry prompted Tennessee Williams to complain: [...] "You <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were running neck-and-neck for some fabulous gold prize." [...] Apart from his favorite authors (Willa Cather, Isak Dinesen, and Marcel Proust), Capote had faint praise for other writers. However, one who did receive his favorable endorsement was journalist Lacey Fosburgh, author of [...] (1977). He also claimed an admiration for Andy Warhol's [...]|$|E
2500|$|Occasional disapproval was voiced, {{with some}} critics noting {{the absence of}} a [...] "central character" [...] and [...] "climactic scene"; its [...] "disappointing finish" [...] and [...] "dependen on an {{arbitrarily}} manipulated plot"; or a general lack of [...] "soul" [...] and sense of [...] "hopelessness". Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph argued that [...] "Chigurh never develops as a character [...] with material as strong as this, one <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> could do better than impute to him a sprawling inscrutability, a mystery that is merely pathological." [...] He further accused it of being full of [...] "pseudo profundities in which [...] have always specialised." [...] In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter criticized Chigurh's weapons as unintentionally humorous and lamented, [...] "It's all chase, which means that it offers almost zero in character development. Each of the figures is given, a la standard thriller operating procedure, a single moral or psychological attribute and then acts in accordance to that principle and nothing else, without doubts, contradictions or ambivalence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Generally a {{contract}} forms when one person makes an offer, and another person accepts it by communicating their assent or performing the offer's terms. If the terms are certain, and the parties can be presumed from their behaviour to have intended that the terms are binding, generally {{the agreement is}} enforceable. Some contracts, particularly for large transactions such as a sale of land, also require the formalities of signatures and witnesses and English law goes further than other European countries by requiring all parties bring something of value, known as [...] "consideration", to a bargain as a precondition to enforce it. Contracts can be made personally or through an agent {{acting on behalf of}} a principal, if the agent acts within what a reasonable person <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have the authority to do. In principle, English law grants people broad freedom to agree the content of a deal. Terms in an agreement are incorporated through express promises, by reference to other terms or potentially through a course of dealing between two parties. Those terms are interpreted by the courts to seek out the true intention of the parties, from the perspective of an objective observer, {{in the context of their}} bargaining environment. Where there is a gap, courts typically imply terms to fill the spaces, but also through the 20th century both the judiciary and legislature have intervened more and more to strike out surprising and unfair terms, particularly in favour of consumers, employees or tenants with weaker bargaining power.|$|E

6000|$|He was chilled into {{quietness}} till Papa Gouroff, {{the owner}} of the restaurant, arrived from above-stairs. Papa Gouroff was a Russian Jew who had been a police spy in Poland and a hotel proprietor in Mogador, where he called himself Turkish and married a renegade Armenian. He had a nose like a sickle and a neck like a blue-gum nigger. He hoped that the place would degenerate into a Bohemian restaurant where liberal clergymen <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were slumming, and barbers <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were entering society, so he always wore a fez and talked bad Arabic. He was local color, atmosphere, Bohemian flavor. Mr. Wrenn murmured to Theresa: ...|$|E

"It is singular," [...] said Mareschal to Ratcliffe, [...] "that four {{horsemen}} and {{a female}} prisoner should have passed through the country without leaving the slightest trace of their passage.

25|$|The Melians {{argue that}} they are a neutral city and not an enemy, so Athens has no need to conquer them.
