25|$|As {{a kind of}} benefit, {{overseas}} {{civil servants}} in Hong Kong were entitled to a free exclusive sea passage when they retired. Norman-Walker was eligible and chose to enjoy the benefit when he left Hong Kong on 30 September 1973. He <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on board an ocean liner like his counterparts, {{but it turned out}} that there was no ocean liner calling at Hong Kong {{at the time of his}} departure.

On his departure, in the presence of the members of the Executive and Legislative Councils and senior government officials, Norman-Walker boarded Lady Maurine from HMS Tamar and travelled across the Victoria Harbour to the Kowloon side. From there he travelled to Kwai Chung Container Port and boarded the cargo ship, which sailed for Britain.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, the world's top {{eight players}} {{met in the}} Netherlands {{to compete in the}} AVRO tournament, whose winner <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a title match with the World Champion, Alexander Alekhine. Botvinnik placed third, behind Paul Keres and Reuben Fine. According to Botvinnik, Alekhine was most {{interested}} in playing an opponent who could raise the funds. After consulting the nearest available Soviet officials, Botvinnik discreetly challenged Alekhine, who promptly accepted, subject to conditions that would enable him to acclimatize in Russia and get some high-quality competitive practice a few months before the match. In Botvinnik's opinion, Alekhine was partly motivated by the desire for a reconciliation with the Soviet authorities, so that he could again visit his homeland. The match, including funding, was authorised at the highest Soviet political level in January 1939; however, a letter of confirmation was only sent two months later – in Botvinnik's opinion, because of opposition by his Soviet rivals, especially those who had become prominent before the Russian Revolution – and the outbreak of World War II prevented a World Championship match.|$|E

He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a six-pack. But it didn't really work out."

He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E

Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg {{would be unable to}} have his scheduled title match with Kevin Nash later that night. Due to Goldberg's apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan took Goldberg's title shot in the match. Soon after, Elizabeth accompanied Lex Luger, and sometimes Kevin Nash, to ringside.
