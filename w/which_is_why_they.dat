25|$|European hornets {{have been}} given a {{reputation}} for being very aggressive. Evidence to support this is from the first documented instance by Davis of V. crabro parasitizing the yellow garden spider Argiope aurantia. Davis observed the hornets in Georgia fly into the spider’s web and appear entangled. Looking closer, the hornet was cutting free prey that had been caught by the spider’s web. The spider did not attack or interfere with V. crabro as it was stealing its prey. This also follows the trait that is observed in most vespines that as the year progresses, they change their food-seeking techniques from foraging for food to scavenging, especially once the fall season begins. A common scavenging technique in the fall consists of Vespines loitering around a garbage can, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are regarded as pests in some areas.|$|E

The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E

Two of the targets, Patty and Selma Bouvier, {{were killed in a}} similar fashion to the style of Wile E. Coyote. [...] "In the Na'vi" [...] was a parody of the 2009 film Avatar. In the end, Kang and Kodos mentions that [...] "there is no word for ‘yours’ or ‘mine.’", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> do not enjoy the 1968 film Yours, Mine and Ours (or the 2005 remake).|$|E

500|$|Campbell's dwarf hamsters inhabit burrows in the steppes and semideserts {{of central}} Asia, the Altai mountains, {{autonomous}} areas of Tuva, and the Hebei province in northeastern China. A burrow can contain {{four to six}} horizontal and vertical tunnels. The tunnels leading to the nesting area can be as deep as [...] below the ground, but are usually [...] deep. The burrows are lined with either dry grass or sheep's wool. They may sometimes share burrows with Daurian pikas, {{but only in the}} steppes and semideserts of northern Manchuria. In parts of Mongolia, the hamsters may also share burrows with species of Meriones to save them from digging their own. In Tuva, Campbell's dwarf hamsters have been found living with other hamsters, such as the Chinese striped hamster, the Roborovski hamster, and the long-tailed dwarf hamster. The diets of the three types of hamsters are different to avoid fighting over the same type of food, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> live together.|$|E

The bladder not only provides buoyancy but also enables them to breathe in air <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> are able to inhabit bodies of water in which most other fishes would die of suffocation. [...] The swim bladder is connected to their foregut by a small pneumatic duct which allows them to breathe or gulp air when they break the surface, an action that is seen quite frequently on lakes in the southern United States during the hot summer months. [...] The scales of alligator gar are not like the scales of other fishes which have flexible elasmoid scales; their bodies are protected by inflexible and articulated ganoid scales that are diamond-shaped, often with serrated edges, and composed of a tough inner layer of bone and hard outer layer of ganoin which is essentially homologous to tooth enamel, making them nearly impenetrable.|$|E

He points to a history of highly emotional religious practices in the 17th and 18th centuries. He then argues that after [...] "fundamentalist religion" [...] (particularly Evangelical and the newly formed Pentecostal branches) were set back after the Scopes Monkey Trial, they {{appeared to have been}} dealt a permanent blow. Phillips cites statistical studies that suggest that after this point, fundamentalist religion grew at a rapid rate, while mainstream denominations actually declined (this was covered to most observers at the time due to other circumstances, such as the increase in population at the time.) ...|$|R

Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies only survived for a few days at most, which wasn't long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks's cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> became known as [...] "immortal." [...] After Lacks' death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, take further HeLa samples while Henrietta's body was at Johns Hopkins' autopsy facility. The roller-tube technique was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected. Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks's sample by isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey's standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient's first and last names.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> went elsewhere." ...|$|E

At first, they are unaware that [...] "Betelgeuse" [...] is pronounced [...] "Beetlejuice", <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>they</b> have such difficulty pronouncing his name and thereby summoning him. However, Betelgeuse quickly offends the Maitlands with his crude and morbid demeanor; and they reconsider hiring him, though too late {{to stop him from}} wreaking havoc on the Deetzes. The small town's charm and the supernatural events inspire Charles to pitch his boss Maxie Dean on transforming the town into a tourist hot spot, but Maxie wants proof of the ghosts. Using the Handbook for the Recently Deceased, Otho conducts what he thinks is a séance and summons Adam and Barbara, but they begin to decay and die, as Otho had unwittingly performed an exorcism instead. Horrified, Lydia begrudgingly summons Betelgeuse for help; but he agrees to help her only on the condition that she marry him, enabling him to freely cause chaos in the mortal world. Betelgeuse saves the Maitlands and disposes of Maxie, his wife, and Otho, then prepares a wedding before a ghastly minister. The Maitlands intervene before the ceremony is completed, with Barbara riding a sandworm through the house to devour Betelgeuse.|$|E

The 500 extras were largely the Snow and Bolton armies as Wildlings, archers, swordsmen and spearmen. Each army was trained separately to create off-screen rivalry between the two groups, and visual effects were used to expand the army to thousands. Kristofer Hivju, who plays Tormund Giantsbane, said about the intensity of filming the scenes: [...] "It was pretty intense, actually. When you have 20 people running around getting squeezed together, and you're trying to chop at another bearded guy with a sword, you are not out of danger. You're laying down in the mud, and one wrong step, you won't have a face anymore. It was very intense, and Miguel insisted on making it that muddy and messy. War is not beautiful. Sometimes you see action sequences where battles seem organized. I know that from how the Vikings fought. It's not beautiful. It's hard. It's hard work.
