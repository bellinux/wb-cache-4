500|$|Soon {{after the}} collapse, the owners {{arrived at the}} mall. A {{representative}} spoke {{on behalf of the}} owner, stating [...] "I'd rather not , because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to our lawyers and we’re {{going to be in the}} City Hall to represent ourselves. But nevertheless, we are very much concerned [...] this accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2016 feature via The Quietus, Kavus Torabi {{shed light}} on several past, present, and future Cardiacs projects. [...] It was an {{extraordinarily}} interesting and brilliant time for me because we’d already talked {{a great deal about}} what the plan was {{for the next few years}} for Cardiacs. We were going to make a film. Tim and I were planning out loads of treatments and scripts. Tim wanted to share the burden of Cardiacs a bit with someone and I was more than happy to do that. The way things stand, [...] is nearly done but needs vocals and eyebrows and some of them need a few other touches. What there is does sound great but there’s far more stuff completed that hasn’t come out yet, that needs to come out. Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Kenton, {{already in}} her bed turned her face upon him with a despairing [...] "Tchk! Dear! What is it? I thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> over everything." ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{about the}} {{appearance}} of the little boy at Venice, and his strange altered garb. My companion said they were pale, wretched-looking and DRESSED QUITE SHABBILY.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose it's my {{having the}} matter {{so much in}} mind {{that makes me feel}} as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> it over. I {{mentioned}} it in one of my letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> enough of serious affairs tonight," [...] he said. [...] "I shall {{challenge}} Sir Edward {{to a game}} of billiards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Kennedy, {{this is my}} granddaughter, Frances Newbury. I {{told you}} about her and her ambitions last night. You see, Frances, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> you over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I shall {{like that}} best. Dear Constance, {{do you think}} when I write to Mary that I must tell her all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> about?" ...|$|E
60|$|A {{change was}} coming over this young man. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> on other {{subjects}} {{and he had}} been shy and deferential. On this matter of bricks and mortar he spoke as one explaining things.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, yes; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> of it {{for some}} time. We cannot remain here always. My cousins De Crécy are there, and my aunt De Coudremont. We shall be among friends, Pétronelle, if we ever get there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{all that}} out long ago," [...] I answered, a little wearily. [...] "You {{would have been}} very foolish if you had acted differently. I don't see how else you could have acted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would do what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> of," [...] mournfully remarked Lucetta. [...] "Give up business, and go away from here. We have plenty of money, and why should we stay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not more {{sanguine}} {{than your}} sister. Often <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> of this. I wish she {{were here to}} help us, but I will do my part. At present let us go to luncheon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{hesitate}} on that ground, since we're two men short," [...] Scott answered, smiling. [...] "Well, {{suppose we}} wait until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> to him. I guess {{you know this}} silver-lode is getting hold of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I should {{love to hear}} them," [...] Pamela replied, [...] "but I {{feel just}} now as though <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> enough politics. Do you know that I came up on deck {{in a state of}} great agitation?" ...|$|R
60|$|She too, I think, had {{forgotten}} {{these things for}} a while. For it is curious and I think a very significant thing that since <b>we</b> <b>had</b> become lovers, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{very little of the}} broader things that had once so strongly gripped our imaginations.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear, I {{am sorry}} {{it seemed so}} unkind. I do not think <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> let the pond stay, for it was making the house unhealthy; but if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> over it together, it need not have {{appeared}} so very cruel and spiteful.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Clara; and you {{can write}} a line. It would be such a pity that you should not see all about the mill, now that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over together. Do tell her to stay, mamma." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Enough words!' growled {{the hairy}} {{creature}} beside me. 'It is because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> instead of acting that this Buonaparte has a crown upon his head or a head upon his shoulders. Let us {{have done with}} the fellow and come to business.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'All that I possess I {{have gained}} through {{contracting}} for the French armies,' said he. 'Your Emperor {{has been a}} good friend to me. But I beg that you will ride on now, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> long enough. Beware only of Lutzow's night-riders!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{result of}} it was, however, as I fancied, that Hiram {{succeeded in making}} Master Lord believe <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the fullest {{confidence}} in him, {{and at the same}} time was firmly convinced our host to be as thorough paced a scoundrel as when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> with him previously.|$|R
60|$|By {{three o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> until our tongues were tired, and every topic of conversation was exhausted. Then we fell silent, with none too pleasing thoughts for company, until Darius sprang to his feet with an exclamation that aroused us all.|$|R
6000|$|... "And pray, am I {{responsible}} for everything my friends say? And to have dragged up that wretched fiasco after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{it out to}} the very dregs! Oh, how I have been longing and longing to come home. And this is what you make of it." ...|$|R
60|$|But we {{must make}} haste; for the tide is rising fast, and our stone will be {{restored}} to its eleven hours' bath, long before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> over half the wonders which it holds. Look though, ere you retreat, at one or two more.|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems {{incredible}} that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> so long," [...] Philippa said, {{glancing at}} the watch upon her wrist. [...] "I really feel now that I know all about you--your school days, your college days, and your soldiering. You have been very frank, haven't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{we cannot}} say, my lord. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{as we came}} down. It seems to us {{that he could have}} nothing to gain by {{hindering}} you; but that perhaps he might detain you, in order to obtain a ransom for you from the lord of India." ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{calabash}} {{hanging on}} the wall. It was the very calabash I had seen when I came into the cabin and which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> about. She took it down. It was all dusty, so she poured water into it from the water-bottle, and rinsed it with her fingers.|$|R
60|$|ANNYS [A little doubtfully.] No. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> always <b>talked</b> {{everything}} over together.|$|R
40|$|In the note,we give a quick {{introduction}} to variation of Hodge structures and its applications to algebraic geometry. <b>We</b> <b>has</b> <b>talked</b> {{most of the}} note in work-ing seminars at Harvard University and CMS. The revised version has been finished after lectures of Algebraic Geometry Workshop of 2004 Hangzhou-Beijing International Summer School. Content...|$|R
6000|$|... "Happily, Miss Purcell, {{we are in}} a {{position}} to say that money is no object to us. Hilda is our only child. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> it over, of course, and will tell you exactly what we propose, and I hope that you will fall in with the arrangement." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O father! I feel {{wild with}} joy, only {{to think that}} all <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> over {{together}} {{is going to be}} true, and that we are to be the first Englishmen who ever saw the beautiful islands they talk about, and the natives with their feathers and strange attire. And--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Sang Solomon to Sheba, [...] And {{kissed her}} dusky face, [...] 'All day long from mid-day [...] <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>talked</b> {{in the one}} place, [...] All day long from shadowless noon [...] We have gone round and round [...] In the narrow theme of love [...] Like an old horse in a pound.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Burns came in, {{stick and}} hat in hand, {{incredibly}} vulgarised by his smart shore togs, with a jaunty air and an odious {{twinkle in his}} eye. Being asked to sit down he laid his hat and stick {{on the table and}} after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> of ship affairs for a little while: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made this}} inquiry more expressively, doubtless, than before; for when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>talked</b> {{of the matter}} then he had {{naturally}} spoken of her consent as a simple contingency. It was contingent upon the lapse of {{the first months of}} her bereavement; it was not a question he could begin to press a few days after her husband's death.|$|R
6000|$|... "Understand that foolish {{game and}} poor lookout for Jeekie, Major, but can't {{think of any}} plan." [...] Then he rubbed his big nose reflectively and added, [...] "Fahni and his people your slaves now, 'spose <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>talk</b> with him. I tell priests to bring him along when they come with breakfast. Leave it to me, Major." ...|$|R
