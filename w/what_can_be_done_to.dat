5|$|Having {{completed}} those chapters which analyse {{the relevant}} aspects {{of power in}} social life, Russell shifts his focus onto the philosophical issues that are connected with those problems. Moving into this new terrain, he wonders <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> curb the efforts of those who love power. The answers can be found either in possible collective actions, or in individual duties.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton to see <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> stem the losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls {{a meeting with}} Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present {{because he had been}} Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> them. These rights cannot be violated, even {{in the name of}} the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E

The Hill, one of {{the original}} parts of the zoo, was closed as many of the animals there were moved to the new Giants of the Savanna exhibit. One of the more recent additions to ZooNorth is the Wildlife Amphitheater. The Wildlife Amphitheater is home to SOAR! A Festival of Flight. Primate Place features monkeys, with species from Africa and South America. ZooNorth is also home to the Pierre A.

500|$|Finally, {{in chapter}} ten Townsend affirms that the [...] "backward Chinese" [...] are America’s [...] "only {{legitimate}} problem in Asia" [...] and asks <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> {{deal with a}} nation that spends aid money corruptly, does not respect its loans, mistreats and attacks foreigners, ignores international drug laws, will not protect foreign investment, and does not engage in productive diplomacy with other nations. He warns Americans that the Chinese see kindness only as weakness and thus can never respond to any type of positive reinforcement. [...] "For every Chinese, from highest to lowest," [...] he argues, [...] "all the acts of life are concentrated upon extracting, from those who mean nothing to him, what he can {{for the benefit of}} himself and his clan." [...] By contrast, he believes that the Chinese do understand force and respect strength. Therefore, he advocates that the United States forgo naive [...] "sentimentalist" [...] thinking and adopt a policy of [...] "stern insistence upon our rights without cruel abuse of our strength", including withholding further loans without strict conditions and holding on to foreign concessions and extraterritoriality.|$|E
2500|$|Family {{therapists}} {{tend to be}} {{more interested}} in the maintenance and/or solving of problems rather than in trying to identify a single cause. [...] Some families may perceive cause-effect analyses as attempts to allocate blame to one or more individuals, with the effect that for many families a focus on causation is of little or no clinical utility. It {{is important to note that}} a circular way of problem evaluation is used as opposed to a linear route. Using this method, families can be helped by finding patterns of behaviour, what the causes are, and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> better their situation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general idea}} behind modern {{antiviral}} drug design {{is to identify}} viral proteins, or parts of proteins, that can be disabled. These [...] "targets" [...] should generally be as unlike any proteins or parts of proteins in humans as possible, to {{reduce the likelihood of}} side effects. The targets should also be common across many strains of a virus, or even among different species of virus in the same family, so a single drug will have broad effectiveness. For example, a researcher might target a critical enzyme synthesized by the virus, but not the patient, that is common across strains, and see <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> interfere with its operation.|$|E

USPACOM relied upon two different DoD organizations for CIP assessments: Balanced Survivability Assessments, or BSAs, and Mission Assurance Assessments. [...] The BSA is a two-week mission-focused assessment at a military installation or designated site. [...] A Mission Assurance Assessment is unique because it uses an area assessment approach to focus on both commercial and military asset vulnerabilities and dependencies. [...] The final step to determine vulnerabilities is to integrate the two analyses and assessments.

2500|$|In Northern Ireland 2010 Deputy Mayor of Newry and Mourne Council, Cllr Karen Mc Kevitt {{launched}} the Magnet Young Men's Health Event,' on Friday 19 November. The event {{was attended by}} men from across the district and representatives from local statutory, voluntary and community organisations were organised to celebrate 19 November as International Men's Day. Deputy Mayor, Cllr Mc Kevitt said, ‘It {{is a great idea}} to give an issue that has an international perspective a local focus. All men need to look after their health and take advantage of the services and help that is out there, as we all do. But it is particularly good to see an event that looks at the barriers that young men may be facing and brings together people from all organisations across the district to look at <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> work together to make things better.' The event offered opportunities for men to have health checks with experienced staff from Action Cancer, and speakers such as Ken Harland (University of Ulster's Centre of Young Men's studies), Peter Mc Donald, a senior child care worker from Giggles Daycare nursery, and local athlete Ronan Murtagh shared their own insight into the choices young men make and the opportunities that are out there for young men today. Also in attendance was Jerome Burns, Assistant Director, Department for Social Development. Jerome stated, ‘The department for Social Development is delighted to support local initiatives that work with young men to highlight inequalities in health.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Seeger {{enrolled}} at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, {{but as he}} became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He {{dropped out of college}} in 1938. He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art, as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater [...] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico". One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, Daily Worker reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring [...] "suppers" [...] and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night."They fed us too well," [...] the girls reported. [...] "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm."In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers’ problems, about antisemitism and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," [...] the puppeteers report, [...] "the farmers wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized {{effort on the part of}} city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress. That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father's, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial [...] "race" [...] and [...] "hillbilly" [...] music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53). Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray's weekly Columbia Broadcasting show Back Where I Come From (1940–41) alongside Josh White, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). Back Where I Come From was unique in having a racially integrated cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the White House organized by Eleanor Roosevelt called [...] "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers," [...] before an audience that included the Secretaries of War, Treasury, and the Navy, among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast. During the war, Seeger also performed on nationwide radio broadcasts by Norman Corwin.|$|E
