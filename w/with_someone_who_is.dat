He advised the brothers to find the monkey (vanara) king Sugriva, who would guide them in the quest for Sita. Vishvavasu informed Rama that Sugriva was driven out of his kingdom by his own brother Vali and that Rama should help Sugriva regain his kingdom. The deposed Sugriva dwelt at Rsyamukha hill. Vishvavasu then described in detail the route to Rsyamukha hill. He instructed Rama to travel in the western direction till he reached the Pampa lake in the region called Matangavana where sage Matanga's hermitage once stood. Ram would meet vanaras at this lake and also sage Matanga's aged female disciple Shabari, who is waiting for him and after Rama's visit, would ascend to heaven. To east of Matangavana is the Rsyamukha hill, which has an arduous path up. Kabandha revealed that one who ascends to the top of this hill, his dreams come true. Kabandha also assured Rama that his sorrows would end after reaching this hill, where Sugriva dwelt in a cave on the side on the hill. Kabandha then disappears.|$|E

2500|$|According to Andrew Leahey of AllMusic, Oh Land is a {{combination}} of [...] "club, dance, and nocturnal electro-pop". The album opens with [...] "Perfection", which was co-written and produced by Dan Carey.

[...] "Break the Chain" [...] references the singer's back injury following a dancing accident, where she [...] "defies doctor's orders" [...] by continuing to pursue her dreams; it contains dubstep and flamenco [...] "undertones" [...] in addition to shackle sound effects. Single [...] "Sun of a Gun" [...] uses a metaphor regarding the orbit of the sun to describe being in love <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> [...] "destructive" [...] and [...] "dangerous". The song's Europop sound was compared to the works of Kylie Minogue and Goldfrapp. The fourth track and third single, [...] "Voodoo", is a synth-pop track that has Oh Land performing a [...] "spoken word verse over disco beats". The style of the track is similar to the work of Marina and the Diamonds, according to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine. He also compared the album's fifth track, [...] "Lean", to Massive Attack's [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998).

2500|$|The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 regulates clauses that exclude or limit terms {{implied by}} the common law or statute. Its general pattern is that if clauses {{restrict}} liability, particularly negligence, of one party, the clause must pass the [...] "reasonableness test" [...] in section 11 and Schedule 2. This looks at the ability of either party to get insurance, their bargaining power and their alternatives for supply, and a term's transparency. In places the Act goes further. Section 2(1) strikes down any term that would limit liability for a person's death or personal injury. Section 2(2) stipulates that any clause restricting liability for loss to property has to pass the [...] "reasonableness test". One of the first cases, George Mitchell Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd saw a farmer successfully claim that a clause limiting the liability of a cabbage seed seller to damages for replacement seed, rather than the far greater loss of profits after crop failure, was unreasonable. The sellers were {{in a better position}} to get insurance for the loss than the buyers. Under section 3 businesses cannot limit their liability for breach of contract if they are dealing with [...] "consumers", defined in section 12 as someone who is not dealing in the course of business <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is,</b> or if they are using a written standard form contract, unless the term passes the reasonableness test. Section 6 states the implied terms of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 cannot be limited unless reasonable. If one party is a [...] "consumer" [...] then the SGA 1979 terms become compulsory under the CRA 2015. In other words, a business can never sell a consumer goods that do not work, even if the consumer signed a document with full knowledge of the exclusion clause. Under section 13, it is added that variations on straightforward exemption clauses will still count as exemption clauses caught by the Act. So for example, in Smith v Eric S Bush the House of Lords held that a surveyor's term limiting liability for negligence was ineffective, after the chimney came crashing through Mr Smith's roof. The surveyor could get insurance more easily than Mr Smith. Even though there was no contract between them, because section 1(1)(b) applies to any notice excluding liability for negligence, and even though the surveyor's exclusion clause might prevent a duty of care arising at common law, section 13 [...] "catches" [...] it if liability would exist [...] "but for" [...] the notice excluding liability: then the exclusion is potentially unfair.|$|E
