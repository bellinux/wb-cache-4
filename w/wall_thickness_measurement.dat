40|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> of pipe is very {{important}} of the structural integrity of the industrial plant. However, the radiography method has an advantage because the ability of penetrating the insulated pipe. This will have economic benefit for industry. Moreover, the era of digital radiography has more advantages because the speed of radiographic work, less exposure time and no chemical used for film development. Either the conventional radiography or digital radiology, the <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> is using the tangential radiography technique (TRT).

This paper is revisited the mathematical derivation of the determination of <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> based on tangential radiography technique (TRT).

40|$|To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} value of spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transthoracic echocardiography in {{quantitative assessment of}} the extent of hypertrophy in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), we examined 52 consecutive patients with HCM. The Spirito-Maron and Wigle hypertrophy scores were calculated with <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained by both imaging modalities. MR imaging yielded complete assessment of anatomic features and allowed calculation of hypertrophy scores in 49 patients (94 %). Adequate echocardiograms were obtained in 33 patients (63 %) and correlated well with MR imaging for <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> and for determination of the two hypertrophy scores (bath r > 0. 9). MR imaging provided additional information not available by echocardiography in 16 patients (31 %). We conclude that the Spirito-Maron and Wigle hypertrophy scores correlated well between echocardiography and MR imaging.

40|$|AbstractHypertrophic Cardiomyopathy is {{characterized}} by unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. It is uncertain, however, {{to what extent the}} right ventricle is also thickened. Right ventricular hypertrophy is found at autopsy in patients who die suddenly but, until recently, systematic evaluation of right ventricular morphology has not been feasible. In this two-dimensional echocardiographic study, a total of 4 to 10 (median 7) right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> were made from six right ventricular views in 73 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Fortyone normal subjects were also studied for comparison. Thirty-two (44 %) of the 73 patients had right ventricular hypertrophy with {{at least two of the}} <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> exceeding 2 standard deviations (SD) from the mean value in the normal subjects. Right ventricular hypertrophy was mild (≤ mm) in 24 patients, moderate (9 to 12 mm) in 7 and severe (> 12 mm) in 1. The coefficient of variation of right ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> was similar in normal subjects and patients with and without right ventricular hypertrophy (17 ± 7, 11 ± 8 and 10 ± 8, respectively). The hypertrophy was concentric, with a current of variation of 25 % in all but one patient. There was a strong correlation of maximal right and mean left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> (r = 0. 643, p < 0. 001). Right ventricular hypertrophy was not associated with the occurrence of secondary pulmonary hypertension, but was more common in patients with dyspnea on exertion (p < 0. 05), severe left ventricular hypertrophy (p < 0. 007), supraventricular arrhythmias (p < 0. 005) and ventricular tachycardia (p = 0. 02) during electrocardiographic monitoring. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that mean left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> and supraventricular arrhythmias were independent risk factors for right ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, the presence of right ventricular hypertrophy was associated with more severe disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Pulsed Eddy Current (PEC) {{has been}} applied to monitor <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> in piping of {{refineries}} and oil production platforms. PEC is a non-intrusive and noncontact NDT method and has a much better reproducibility than e. g. periodic ultrasonic <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurements</b> and is therefore a preferred choice for corrosion monitoring with relative short intervals. As PEC is a non-contact NDT technique, it can also be applied for <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> monitoring at high temperatures. PEC corrosion monitoring is illustrated here with an example of a hydrocracker unit in a refinery. Precision <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> monitoring allowed extension of runtime despite aggressive flow-assisted NH 4 HS corrosion.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of corrosion {{can be both}} expensive and dangerous. In the USA alone, corrosion has been estimated to cost the petroleum industry around $ 8 billion a year. Corrosion damages to pressurized components, such as pipes and boilers, can lead to sudden failures, fatalities and environmental catastrophes. Ultrasonic <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> {{is one of the}} most used field-deployable techniques for assessing and surveying the effects of corrosion. However, the manual setup and operation of ultrasonic testing equipment often results in poor <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> repeatability (~ 0. 1 - 0. 5 mm). These errors are mainly due to surface preparation, and positioning and coupling errors that are associated with the manual setup of the measurement. It has been demonstrated that the repeatability of ultrasonic inspection can be improved significantly by the use of permanently installed transducers [1]. Measurement precision in the micro-meter range has been achieved for wall thickness monitoring [2, 3]. While it is very difficult to avoid corrosion altogether, industry is interested in detecting corrosion rates that are larger than ~ 0. 1 mm/year so that corrosion mitigation strategies for maximizing plant life can be effectively put in place. With manual measurements the corrosion rates of interest can only be detected over time frames that span years. Ultrasonic monitoring with a repeatability of the order of micro-meters means that corrosion rates of industrial interest (i. e. 0. 1 mm/year or 270 nm/day) can be detected over a time frame of several days or even weeks. In this paper, an optimized wall thickness monitoring setup with a <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> repeatability of 40 nm will be introduced. This enables the detection of the abovementioned corrosion rates over the periods of hours rather than days or weeks. The ultrasonic measurements presented in this paper have been verified by the results of an optical technique and, where possible, by analytic models. The effects of signal-to-noise ratio and temperature variation will be discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{primary heat}} {{transport}} system {{of a typical}} CANDU®- 6 nuclear power reactor contains 760 feeder pipes. These feeders carry the coolant between the inlet or outlet headers and the individual fuel channels. Inspection requirements that developed in feeders in the 1990 ’s led to rapid development of NDE technology to evaluate feeder integrity. The NDE technology {{had to deal with}} the complex and variable geometry of feeders and access constraints inherent in feeder inspections. The first feeder inspection requirement was ability to detect Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC). This led to an evolution in <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> techniques for feeders that is continuing. The leading edge technique for <b>wall</b> <b>thickness</b> <b>measurement</b> is the METAR Crawler that scans feeder bends with 14 wall thickness probes. This system uses motors to push the bracelet along the feeder bend. Second, cracking was detected in a feeder in 1997. This led to development of a specialized, manual inspection technique to deal with access problems. This technique has been extended to use a Hydro Quebec developed drive system to move the probes over a raster scan. The presentation will explain feeder degradation modes and the NDE developed to evaluate feeder integrity.
