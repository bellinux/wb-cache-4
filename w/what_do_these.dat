2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> changes {{mean for}} the future of chamber music? [...] "With the {{technological}} advances have come questions of aesthetics and sociological changes in music", writes analyst Baron. [...] "These changes have often resulted in accusations that technology has destroyed chamber music and that technological advance is in inverse proportion to musical worth. The ferocity of these attacks only underscores how fundamental these changes are, and only time will tell if humankind will benefit from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{another such}} tradition, Ali was once reciting a sermon {{in the city}} of Kufah, when Ash'as ibn Qays, a {{commander}} in the Arab army protested, [...] "Amir-al-Momeneen! These Iranians are excelling the Arabs right in front of your eyes and you are doing nothing about it!" [...] He then roared, [...] "I will show them who the Arabs are!" [...] Ali immediately retorted, [...] "While fat Arabs rest in soft beds, the Iranians work hard on the hottest days to please God with their efforts. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> Arabs want from me? To ostracize the Iranians and become an oppressor! I swear by the God that splits the nucleus and creates Man, I heard the prophet once say, just as you strike the Iranians with your swords in the name of Islam, so will the Iranians one day strike you back the same way for Islam." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to survey Sir Arthur Wing Pinero's {{treatment}} {{and development of the}} leading women in four of his most highly regarded "social" plays. Their texts will be analyzed carefully in order to arrive at answers to the following questions: <b>What</b> problems <b>do</b> <b>these</b> women confront and how do they attempt to solve them? What are the factors which determine their success or failure? Are their failures due to inherent flaws in character or outside influences? To <b>what</b> extent <b>do</b> <b>these</b> women control their destiny? <b>What</b> common traits <b>do</b> <b>these</b> women possess and in <b>what</b> respects <b>do</b> they differ? <b>What</b> is Pinero's idea of women's role in society, and what is his idea of women in general? What can one learn of Pinero's art from a study of these women...|$|R

If some tsunami like tsunami induced to Landslide S 4 occurs in NSCS, particularly in the 32 run-up splace mentioned above, the coastal production and living quarters will suffer greatly or even a catastrophe.|$|R

6000|$|She {{realized}} that for perhaps a year {{she had not}} definitely looked at her husband. She regarded his table-manners.

40|$|Several large {{trials have}} {{examined}} the reduction of total homocysteine levels as secondary stroke prevention in patients with vascular disease. In the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention (VISP) trial, a moderate reduction of total homocysteine levels had no statistically significant effect on vascular outcomes. Two larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with longer follow-up were subsequently done: the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) 2 and the Norwegian Vitamin (NORVIT) trial. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>these</b> landmark trials show, and how will their findings affect clinical practice...|$|R
50|$|The {{anonymous}} {{author of the}} Liber Graduum points out six profiles of the Christian life, and claims that each Christian must evaluate where they are, and where others are around them, and work as a community to struggle up the staircase towards holiness.

6000|$|Right {{and left}} of the {{horsemen}} the pioneers of this strange army passed. At one that rolled along the ground, breaking shapelessly and trailing out reluctantly into long grappling ribbons and bands, all three horses began to shy and dance.

That result satisfied me that my view was the right one. If your ladyship and Mr. Betteredge persist in not agreeing with me, you must be blind to what happened before you this very day. In your hearing, I told the young lady that her leaving the house (as things were then) would put an obstacle in the way of my recovering her jewel. You saw yourselves that she drove off in the face of that statement.
