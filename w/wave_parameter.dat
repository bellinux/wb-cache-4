For this purpose we perfom a double expansion {{in both the}} background electric charge and the wave parameters of the relevant quantities in the Newman-Penrose formalism. We then display the gravitational, dilatonic and electromagnetic equations, which reproduce the static solution (at zero order in the <b>wave</b> <b>parameter)</b> and the corresponding wave equations in the Kerr background (at first order in the <b>wave</b> <b>parameter</b> and zero order in the electric charge). At higher orders in the electric charge one encounters corrections to the propagation of waves induced {{by the presence of}} a non-vanishing dilaton. An explicit computation is carried out for the electromagnetic waves up to the asymptotic form of the Maxwell field perturbations produced by the interaction with dilatonic waves. A simple physical model is proposed which could make these perturbation relevant in the detection of radiation coming from the region of space near a black hole...|$|E

The estimation method {{is based on the}} kinematic point-sensitivity indicator and regression fitting methods. The estimated parameters were verified and graphical aids for practical applications are presented. Since the presented kinematic <b>wave</b> <b>parameters</b> are independent of the flow depth, they are useful for kinematic wave modeling. For system-specific conditions, such as a desired range of flow depth, the effective-sensitivity method would be preferable to the full range of kinematic <b>wave</b> <b>parameters</b> presented by other researchers as it would easily produce local and more relevant parameters...|$|R

40|$|The common {{behavior}} of a wave is determined by wave parameters of its medium, which are generally associated with the characteristic oscillations of its corresponding elementary particles. In the context of metamaterials, the decoupled excitation of these fundamental oscillations would provide an ideal platform for top-down and reconfigurable access to the entire space of constitutive wave parameters; however, this has remained as a conceivable problem that must be accomplished, after being pointed out by Pendry. Here, by focusing on acoustic metamaterials, we achieve the decoupling of density ρ, modulus B^- 1, and bianisotropy ξ near the Dirac point, by separating the paths of particle momentum {{to conform to the}} characteristic oscillations of each macroscopic <b>wave</b> <b>parameter.</b> Independent access to all octants of <b>wave</b> <b>parameter</b> space (ρ, B^- 1, ξ) = (+/-,+/-,+/-) is thus realized using a single platform that we call an omni meta-atom; as a building block that achieves top-down access to the target properties of metamaterials.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to develop an {{efficient}} approach for the assimilation of the hindcasted <b>wave</b> <b>parameters</b> in the Persian Gulf. Hence, the third generation SWAN model was employed for wave modeling forced by the 6 -h ECMWF wind data with a resolution of 0. 5 ஠In situ wave measurements at two stations were utilized to evaluate the assimilation approaches. It was found that since the model errors are not the same for wave height and period, adaptation of model parameter does not result in simultaneous and comprehensive improvement of them. Therefore, an approach based on the error prediction and updating of output variables was employed to modify wave height and period. In this approach, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to estimate the deviations between the simulated and measured <b>wave</b> <b>parameters.</b> The results showed that updating of output variables leads to significant improvement in a wide range of the predicted wave characteristics.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} subjects in coastal engineering is the forecasting of wave climate evolution along a beach profile and its associated probability. Many authors have dealt with this problem proposing different CDFs and statistical descriptors evolution. One of these works suggests that, for a given sea state, the parameters of the local (at a given point of the profile) wave height CDF depend on the local value of kh and offshore <b>wave</b> <b>parameters.</b> Therefore, it is possible to describe the evolution of the probability distribution of wave heights on a beach profile provided its geometry is known as well as the statistical descriptors of wave oscillation approaching the beach profile (offshore the depth of closure).

40|$|The {{propensity}} toward thermoelastic instability (TEI) in multi-disk clutches and brakes is {{investigated by}} introducing a new bidimensional analytical model, where metal and friction disks {{are replaced by}} two-dimensional layers of finite thickness. This new model permits to estimate {{the effect of the}} thickness ratio a 1 /a 2, between friction and metal disks, on the critical speed, critical <b>wave</b> <b>parameter</b> and migration speed of the sliding system. It is found that as the thickness ratio a 1 /a 2 decreases the critical speed reduces significantly taking up values about 80 percent smaller than that predicted by previous two-dimensional models for commonly used ratios (0. 1 <a 1 /a 2 < 1), whilst the critical <b>wave</b> <b>parameter</b> slightly increases. Therefore, not only the susceptibility towards TEI can be reduced by changing the material properties of the friction lining but also by adjusting suitably the thickness ratio of the disks. The two-dimensional model is also employed to determine the critical speed in a real multi-disk clutch, and the results are compared with a three-dimensional finite element code. It is shown that the critical speed estimated by the present two-dimensional plane strain model is in good agreement with that determined by the FE code for sufficiently large radial thickness of the disks, whilst the two-dimensional plane stress solution has to be used for relatively small radial thickness ratios. Also, it is found that the critical number of hot spots is independent of the radial thickness ratio and it is correctly predicted by the two-dimensional mode...|$|E

The new algorithm presented here provides a fast method of extracting swell <b>wave</b> <b>parameters</b> using frequency modulation theory and is an improvement on existing wave spectrum analyses for routine swell detection. Swell parameters are produced from second-order (sideband) energy about the first-order Bragg peaks in the spectrum.

The data used to develop this algorithm were collected at two sites during 2001 using COSRAD (Coastal Ocean Surface Radar). The first deployment of this study occurred during February and March, 2001, at Tweed Heads.
