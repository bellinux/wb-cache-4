They were at that time already running 'Garbo' (Juan Pujol), 'Zig-Zag' (Eddie Chapman) and 'Tricycle' (Dušan Popov), supposedly German agents to <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> paying large sums of money, but who were in reality working for the British and were supplying the Germans with false information.|$|E

Xavin had first {{appeared}} to the Runaways in their masculine form, but changed into their feminine form {{for the sake of}} Karolina Dean, a lesbian hero <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to marry. In the series, Xavin often switches between their two forms.|$|E

5|$|Powers {{of search}} and seizure are covered by Section 3, which also {{repealed}} the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This section allows a Justice of the Peace, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe obscene publications are kept on certain premises for profit, to issue a warrant for that location. This warrant allows a police officer to enter the premises, search them and remove any suspect publications; if such publications are found, the officer can also take records relating to the businesses trade. The articles must then be brought before a magistrate and either forfeited by the owners or returned. The owner, author or publisher of the articles, or the person from <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> seized, may appear before the magistrate to argue why {{they should not be}} forfeited.|$|E
5|$|The event {{consisted}} of four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for the Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The main event match saw the All-Americans, {{a team of}} face wrestlers from the United States, competing against the Foreign Fanatics, a team of heels that represented other countries. The All-Americans won the match when Lex Luger was the last man remaining. In an undercard match, {{four members of the}} Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men. The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler, with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> feuding, but Lawler was not able to appear at the event. The Harts won the match, but a confrontation between Bret Hart and Owen Hart after the match led to Owen turning against the family the following year.|$|E
5|$|The first trade dollars {{were struck}} in 1873, and the {{majority}} of the coins were sent to China. Eventually, bullion producers began converting large amounts of silver into trade dollars, causing the coins to make their way into American commercial channels. This caused frustration among those to <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> given in payment, as the coins were largely maligned and traded for less than one dollar each. In response to their wide distribution in American commerce, the coins were officially demonetized in 1876, but continued to circulate. Production of business strikes ended in 1878, though the mintage of proof coins officially continued until 1883. The trade dollar was re-monetized when the Coinage Act of 1965 was signed into law.|$|E

They were often deployed alongside various Serbian collaborationist forces such as the Serbian State Guard (SDS) and the Serbian Volunteer Corps (SDK), with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> most closely allied. The Corps also closely cooperated with the Croatian fascist Ustaše when operating in the neighbouring NDH. Members of the Corps also plundered peasants in the areas within which they operated.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary {{circulating}} coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies almost invariably carried both Offa's name {{and the name of the}} moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.|$|E

5|$|Compared to {{neighbouring}} Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England, few {{records of}} 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source {{from the period}} is the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to KennethII (Cináed mac Maíl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the Poppleton Manuscript, a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries. In addition to this, later king lists survive. The earliest genealogical records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date {{from the end of}} the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} {{their place in the}} First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they only needed to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian temples {{were built}} for the {{official}} worship of the gods and in commemoration of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt and regions under Egyptian control. Temples were seen as houses for the gods or kings to <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dedicated. Within them, the Egyptians performed a variety of rituals, the central functions of Egyptian religion: giving offerings to the gods, reenacting their mythological interactions through festivals, and warding off the forces of chaos. These rituals were seen as necessary for the gods to continue to uphold maat, the divine order of the universe. Housing and caring for the gods were the obligations of pharaohs, who therefore dedicated prodigious resources to temple construction and maintenance. Out of necessity, pharaohs delegated most of their ritual duties {{to a host of}} priests, but most of the populace was excluded from direct participation in ceremonies and forbidden to enter a temple's most sacred areas. Nevertheless, a temple was an important religious site for all classes of Egyptians, who went there to pray, give offerings, and seek oracular guidance from the god dwelling within.|$|E

5|$|Nazi Germany used {{violence}} and economic pressure to encourage Jews to leave Germany {{of their own}} volition; around 250,000 of the country's 437,000 Jews emigrated between 1933 and 1939. Eichmann travelled to British Mandatory Palestine with his superior Herbert Hagen in 1937 to assess the possibility of Germany's Jews voluntarily emigrating to that country, disembarking with forged press credentials at Haifa, whence they travelled to Cairo in Egypt. There they met Feival Polkes, {{an agent of the}} Haganah, with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to strike a deal. Polkes suggested that more Jews should be allowed to leave {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but Hagen refused, surmising that a strong Jewish presence in Palestine might lead to their founding an independent state, which would run contrary to Reich policy. Eichmann and Hagen attempted to return to Palestine a few days later, but were denied entry after the British authorities refused them the required visas. They prepared a report on their visit, which was published in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Anxious {{to avoid}} war, Tsar Peter sent his two sons, Boris and Roman, as hostages to Constantinople. This move failed to appease Nikephoros, {{but he was}} not able or willing to {{campaign}} against Bulgaria; his forces were engaged in the East, and furthermore, drawing on the Byzantines' past experience, Nikephoros was reluctant to mount an expedition into the mountainous and heavily forested terrain of Bulgaria. Consequently, he resorted to the old Byzantine expedient of calling in a tribe from eastern Europe to attack Bulgaria. In late 966 or early 967, he dispatched the patrikios Kalokyros, a citizen of Cherson, as his ambassador to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus'. The Byzantines had long maintained close relations with the Rus', with <b>whom</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bound by treaty. With promises of rich rewards and, according to Leo the Deacon, a payment of 1,500pounds of gold, the Rus' ruler was induced to attack Bulgaria from the north. That Nikephoros should call upon Sviatoslav for aid was unusual, since the Pechenegs were traditionally used for such tasks. The historian A.D. Stokes, who examined the questions surrounding the background and chronology of Sviatoslav's Bulgarian campaign, suggested that this move had a second motive of turning the attention of Sviatoslav, who had recently destroyed the Khazar khanate, away from the Byzantine outpost of Cherson.|$|E
