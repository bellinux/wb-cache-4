25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as {{one might}} expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E
500|$|... <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> {{about this}} film, perhaps, {{is the moment}} when it was made. It was shot between Munich and the war, and I shot it {{absolutely}} impressed, absolutely disturbed {{by the state of}} mind of a part of French society, a part of English society, a part of world society. And {{it seemed to me that}} a way of interpreting this state of mind, to the world hopefully, was not to talk of that situation, but tell a frivolous story. I looked for inspiration to Beaumarchais, to Marivaux, to the classical authors of comedy.|$|E
60|$|The fellow had {{actually}} managed {{to steal a}} lighter with silver, and this, it seems only because he was implicitly trusted by his employers, who must have been singularly poor judges of character. In the sailor's story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal, a small cheat, stupidly ferocious, morose, of mean appearance, and altogether unworthy of the greatness this opportunity had thrust upon him. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>was</b> that he would boast of it openly.|$|R

500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the perfect, {{the word}} har ("have, has") is placed before the past participle: han har købt en bil, [...] "he has bought a car". In certain words {{implying}} a movement, however, er ("am, are, is") is used instead: [...] han er gået sin vej, [...] "he has gone" [...] (like German er ist gegangen or French il est allé). In such cases har {{is used for}} the activity, while er is used if the result is <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting.</b> Han har rejst meget, [...] "he has traveled a lot".

2500|$|Wordsworth's poetry conveys <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> in the commonest {{events and}} objects. It probes the {{feelings}} shared by all. It [...] "disdains" [...] the artificial, the unnatural, the ostentatious, the [...] "cumbrous ornaments of style", the old conventions of verse composition. His subject is himself in nature: [...] "He clothes the naked with beauty and grandeur from the stores {{of his own}} recollections". [...] "His imagination lends 'a sense of joy to the bare trees and mountains bare, and grass in the green field'. ... No one has shown the same imagination in raising trifles into importance: no one has displayed the same pathos in treating of the simplest feelings of the heart." ...|$|E

Worse still, it’s Richard Sambrook, Global News Director at the BBC (and a very good media blogger). Richard has been very kind about my new book and we tend to agree about Networked Journalism so I wasn’t likely to hear anything I disagreed with or hadn’t heard before.

The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants {{attention}} because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E
2500|$|Formally, the satire in the Tale is {{historically}} novel for several reasons. First, Swift {{more or less}} invented prose parody. In the [...] "Apology for the [...] " [...] (added in 1710), Swift explains that his work is, in several places, a [...] "parody," [...] which is where he imitates the style of persons he wishes to expose. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> is that the word [...] "parody" [...] had not been used for prose before, and the definition he offers is arguably a parody of John Dryden defining [...] "parody" [...] in the Discourse of Satire (the Preface to Dryden's translations of Juvenal's and Persius' satires). Prior to Swift, parodies were imitations designed to bring mirth, but not primarily {{in the form of}} mockery. Dryden imitated the Aeneid in [...] "MacFlecknoe" [...] to describe the apotheosis of a dull poet, but the imitation made fun of the poet, not Virgil.|$|E
2500|$|GameInformers Lix Lanier {{stated that}} no villain, male or female, has {{the charm of}} GLaDOS: [...] "If she's not trying to kill Chell, she's likely belittling her with passive-aggressive {{comments}} {{that would make a}} sorority girl proud. Even with her robotic voice, it's clear that 'You look great by the way, very healthy' is no compliment." [...] GamePros Chris Holt discussed GLaDOS as an icon of feminism, and wrote that as opposed to being an [...] "archetypal villain", she is a [...] "prototypical bound woman". He added that [...] "A female protagonist murdering a female villainess (or vice versa) is not <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> to us as critics, but it's the idea that despite her seemingly robotic, unemotional and unstoppable nature, GLaDOS appears vulnerable, sympathetic, and even a victim herself". He wrote [...] "GLaDOS has been augmented because of the danger she presents to a presumably misogynistic society" [...] and that [...] "by destroying these cores, Chell is stripping her of the layers that society has deemed necessary for her to wear" [...] and making her [...] "far more dangerous". He added that Chell and GLaDOS serve as opposing sides of femininity; where Chell is [...] "dutiful and does every task assigned of her", GLaDOS is [...] "aggressive and seemingly dangerous to the order of a male-dominated society". He also described Chell as a [...] "domestic icon" [...] while he described GLaDOS as a [...] "progressive, intelligent working woman" [...] and that by killing her, [...] "Chell {{can be seen as the}} dutiful 'safe' woman conquering the 'dangerous' feminist". He also cited the use of poems by Emily Dickinson, whom he compares to GLaDOS in how both were reclusive and were essentially disembodied voices.|$|E

50|$|In an {{experiment}} {{to test the}} vocalizations of grey parrots, four bred in captivity were placed in an aviary. Throughout the day they spent time {{in a room with}} toys and came into fairly regular contact with the humans taking care of them. The noises that these parrots could hear consisted of the calls of canaries in the laboratory, people cleaning, doors squeaking, etc. In the next 3 years, the parrots made over 50,000 vocalisations. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>was</b> that, although they were bred in captivity, the sounds they made were not only ones of their immediate surroundings. They also made calls similar to those of other captive grey parrots in different locations and even wild grey parrots.|$|R

6000|$|Now {{this is a}} {{perfectly}} plain piece of brute logic.

60|$|If France {{had been}} prosperous, all {{this would have}} passed for the empty declamation of an excited man of letters.

In the urgency of a present material distress, men were not over-careful that {{the basis of the}} indictment should be laid in the principles of a sound historical philosophy of society. We can hardly wonder at it. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting,</b> and what we do not notice earlier in the century, is that in the System of Nature the revolt against the impotence of society, and the revolt against the omnipotence of God, made a firm coalition. That coalition came to a bloody end for the time, four-and-twenty years after Holbach's book proclaimed it, when the Committee of Public Safety despatched Hébert, and better men than Hébert, to the guillotine for being atheists. Atheism, as Robespierre assured them, was aristocratic.|$|E

But, lovers and hunters of the picturesque, let us not keep too studiously out of view the miserable depravity, degradation, and wretchedness, with which this gay Neapolitan life is inseparably associated! It is not well to find Saint Giles's so repulsive, and the Porta Capuana so attractive. A pair of naked legs and a ragged red scarf, do not make ALL the difference between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>interesting</b> and what is coarse and odious? Painting and poetising for ever, if you will, the beauties of this most beautiful and lovely spot of earth, let us, as our duty, try to associate a new picturesque with some faint recognition of man's destiny and capabilities; more hopeful, I believe, among the ice and snow of the North Pole, than {{in the sun and}} bloom of Naples.|$|E

Histological examination revealed a distinct adenocarcinoma of conventional type with glandular structures admixed intimately with a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The latter component was deeply infiltrative, while the adenocarcinoma occupied the more superficial aspect of the tumor. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>was</b> the immunophenotype of the lesion: cytokeratin (CK) 20 expression was very focal in the adenocarcinoma component and negative in the neuroendocrine carcinoma, while CK 7 was expressed strongly in the adenocarcinoma and only focally in the neuroendocrine component.
