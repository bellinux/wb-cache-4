A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go. Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E

And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, because I think that if <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|After Phi Kappa Psi was {{reinstated}} at {{the start}} of the 2015 Spring semester, UVA Phi Psi President Stephen Scipione said, [...] "We are pleased that the University and the Charlottesville Police Department have cleared our fraternity of any involvement in this case... In today's 24-hour news cycle, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tendency to rush to judgment without having all of the facts in front of us. As a result, our fraternity was vandalized, our members ostracized based on false information." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{thermometer}} was at {{that point}} where morals become slack. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> piece; but <b>we</b> were <b>all</b> of us shocked at Dan, and told him so. It did not agitate him in the least.|$|R
500|$|The storyline which {{featured}} the character's old nemesis DC Hooch drew criticism of Becky's excessive littering of her cigarette butts. Environmental agencies 'Keep Britain Tidy' and 'CleanupUK' commented: [...] "It is disappointing that Coronation Street chooses to allow {{one of its}} characters to throw a butt {{on the floor and}} suggest that it is okay to treat our streets like a giant ashtray. We understand the writers are concerned with realism but Becky is a role model to many viewers. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> responsibility to keep our local area clean and we would hope that producers of programmes such as Coronation Street would support our call to encourage the public to keep our country tidy." [...] A spokesperson for the show defended Becky's actions, stating they were portraying the character's high levels of stress realistically. Inside Soap readers voted in a poll to find out which character would be missed the most after they depart. Becky won with sixty percent of the vote, whilst up against Eve Jenson (Emmerdale) and Ronnie Mitchell (EastEnders). Julie Richardson writing for Orange U.K. said she [...] "loved a good TV scrap" [...] and the serial had [...] "a corker" [...] with Becky and Kylie's fight which took place in 2011. Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror praised Becky's feud with Tracy, explaining it was a [...] "perfectly poised, barbed battle". Though he said it was ruined by Kylie's return.|$|E
500|$|Webb {{felt that}} the Lizard was the best villain because, [...] "He's the literal {{embodiment}} of {{the theme of the}} movie, which is <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> missing piece. He has no arm. Peter has no parents, and he fills that void with Spider-Man." [...] Producer Avi Arad felt likewise, explaining, [...] "ou look at Peter, he misses the parents, [...] Connors has one arm. ...motionally, [...] is a very similar problem. It is a cautionary tale." [...] Webb said that the Lizard [...] "is not the worst villain on the planet. He's not a mustache-twirling guy who wants to terrorize people. He believes he's doing the right thing." [...] Actor Rhys Ifans described his character as a flawed character comparable to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. [...] "Curt Connors is by no means an evil villain," [...] Ifans stated. [...] "He's not like the Batman villains, like the Joker, who are the embodiment of evil. Curtis Connors is a great man who makes a bad decision. ... hat's the whole magic of the Spider-Man idea. These people are the embodiment of our flaws and our desires that lead to tragedy." [...] Ifans described Connors as a force for good throughout his life: [...] "He's a geneticist who wants to help people, like him, who are limbless. In his eagerness to advance that science, he makes a mistake and that's an occurrence we've seen throughout time, sometimes to our benefit, sometimes to our detriment." [...] "...He is a broken man who wants to fix himself." [...] Ifans added, [...] "I'm not portraying a villain in any sense. Connors does feel cheated by God, and he's looking for answers in science. God seems to intervene." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Hindustan Times, Kaminey [...] "is {{the first}} attempt to deal with reality in a mature, matter of fact manner." [...] Unlike other Hindi films, in which the female lead is Sita, the protagonist is Rama and the {{antagonist}} is Ravana, the characters in Kaminey are nuanced humans in [...] "layered and complex" [...] situations. Namrata Joshi from Outlook wrote that Kaminey reflects Bhardwaj's [...] "enduring fascination for underdogs, characters {{on the margins of}} society and the morally compromised". Bhardwaj told Rediff.com that the film deals with [...] "themes that affect our lives directly", and [...] "is a reminder that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dark side, and often we are not fully aware of that side". Rakesh Bedi from The Economic Times wrote, [...] "Bhardwaj presents the two warring brothers with speech defects. In today's world of logorrhea, communication is fraught with many dangers: misunderstandings, paranoias, recriminations, conflicts. Everyone speaks but no one understands. Bhardwaj gave the twins verbal impediments to show that the world has now been so hardwired to convoluted and calamitous communication that it needs silence or a speech defect to hash things out." [...] He continued, [...] "ith some glitches, Bhardwaj has almost re-birthed the Hindi film". The film also explores sex and sexuality, which according to Bedi were explored in a [...] "radically different and refreshing" [...] way, and the director [...] "daringly takes it a step further". When Sweety becomes pregnant, the couple [...] "decide to carry the pregnancy to term after a bit of hesitation. So she literally pushes her man into marriage. (Had Bhardwaj abjured marriage, {{it would have been a}} complete break but the nuptials were essential to the drama of the film.)" [...] The Daily Beast said that [...] "for aficionados of the Hindi-language genre, Kaminey is a revolutionary manifesto. It takes classic Bollywood tropes—estranged brothers, a case of mistaken identity, high drama approaching slapstick comedy—and presents them with Hollywood-style realism instead of Bollywood's wink-nudge mix of melodrama and posturing.|$|E

50|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious {{we are aware}} of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.|$|R

We’re drunk with words.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Eleven {{weeks and}} one day after Hearst's death, Davies married Horace Brown on October 31, 1951, in Las Vegas. It was not a happy marriage. Davies filed for divorce twice, but neither was finalized, despite Brown admitting he treated her badly: [...] "I'm a beast," [...] he said. [...] "I took him back. I don't know why," [...] she explained. [...] "I guess because he's {{standing}} right beside me, crying. Thank God <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sense of humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by the Dallas Observer for {{his view}} of {{religion}} and spirituality, Lennon said,I'm not against religion, because I think it serves a purpose in our society {{and it can be}} helpful to certain groups of people. But, for me, religion is mythology. ... I do think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> spirit, and I think there's a lot more to life and human consciousness than science can explain. But I prefer looking to science for answers because it can be tested and vigorously logical.|$|E
60|$|A little after, my lord {{came with}} the lawyer, Mr. Carlyle; a bottle of old wine was brought, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> glass before <b>we</b> fell to business. The {{necessary}} deeds were then prepared and executed, and the Scotch estates made over in trust to Mr. Carlyle and myself.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were about}} seven writers, plus Sid, Carl Reiner, and Howie Morris...Mel Brooks and maybe Woody Allen would write {{one of the}} other {{sketches}} ... everyone would pitch in and rewrite, so <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> part of it ... It was probably the most enjoyable time I ever had in writing with other people.|$|R
6000|$|... "They meant it. And, Adrian, {{it is so}} far true {{that there}} is an inheritance—-with some more, with some less-—of our forefathers' nature. Some have tendencies harder to repress than others. But, my dear boy, you know that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> force given us {{wherewith}} to repress and conquer those tendencies, and that we can." ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2015, Khan stated {{his views}} at a popular online comedy group All India Bakchod for its celebrity Roast episode. He said, [...] "I {{completely}} believe in freedom of speech, no issues. But {{we have to}} understand that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> certain responsibility. When I heard what was being described to me I felt it was a violent event." [...] He further said violence is not just physical but it has verbal aspects to it. Calling the roast a shameless act, Khan did not spare even his friends from the film industry Karan, Ranveer and Arjun.|$|E
2500|$|At Marquette University, {{philosophy}} department chairman James South ordered {{graduate student}} Stuart Ditsler to remove an unattributed Dave Barry {{quote from the}} door to the office that Ditsler shared with three other teaching assistants, calling the quote patently offensive. (The quote was: [...] "As Americans we must always remember that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> common enemy, an enemy that is dangerous, powerful, and relentless. I refer, of course, to the federal government.") South claimed that the University's free-speech zone rules required Ditsler to take it down. University spokeswoman Brigid O'Brien Miller stated that it was [...] "a workplace issue, not one of academic freedom." [...] Ultimately, the quote was allowed to remain, albeit with attribution.|$|E
2500|$|Francis has said: [...] "The Lord has {{redeemed}} all of us, all of us, ... {{even the}} atheists. Everyone! ... We are created {{children in the}} likeness of God ... and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> duty to do good”. He points to the Last Judgment scene in Gospel of Matthew as proof of how God judges: what we do for the poor, the hungry, the indigent, the outcast, those who suffer and are alone, Jesus regards as done to himself (25:37-40). And {{he points to the}} Beatitudes as showing what gives deep happiness, what we should strive to live up to every day: being poor in spirit and meek and humble of heart, merciful and peacemakers, hungering and thirsting for righteousness.|$|E

5000|$|... "In my mind The Mystery of San Nicandro is {{ultimately}} {{a testament to}} the inexorable force of the past, how it shapes our identity and sense of belonging, and how the echo of our DNA reaches across centuries to claim us.

2500|$|Sam Jordison of The Guardian wrote, [...] "It is near impossible, I would say, not to {{root for}} Tom Ripley. Not to like him. Not, on some level, to want him to win. Patricia Highsmith does a fine job of {{ensuring}} he wheedles his way into our sympathies." [...] Film critic Roger Ebert made a similar appraisal of the character in his review of Purple Noon, Rene Clement's 1960 film adaptation of The Talented Mr. Ripley: [...] "Ripley is a criminal of intelligence and cunning who gets away with murder. He's charming and literate, and a monster. It's insidious, the way Highsmith seduces us into identifying with him and sharing his selfishness; Ripley believes that getting his own way is worth whatever price anyone else might have to pay. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little of that in us." [...] Novelist Sarah Waters esteemed The Talented Mr. Ripley as the [...] "one book I wish I'd written." ...|$|E

5000|$|Work on {{the album}} began after the band reunited for a one-off gig in front of 50,000 people at a V8 Supercars event in Sydney in 2009. Singer Jimmy Barnes explained: [...] "Even before the show, in the {{rehearsal}} period <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> really great time and we thought maybe we should carry it on a bit. So we went into my studio at my house and did some writing and recording, without having any plans of doing anything with it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lerche has {{teamed up}} with many {{charitable}} organizations throughout her career. Her desire to help people in need stems from her belief that everyone is connected. At a benefit in Ludhiana, she told local media, “We <b>all</b> <b>have</b> one heart.” Most of her humanitarian work supports organizations that provide children with an education and basic needs, as well as organizations that support those on the fringe of society.
