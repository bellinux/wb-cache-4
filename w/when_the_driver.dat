5|$|In 1996 a student, Greg White, {{died in a}} car {{accident}} {{on his way home from}} Cut. The student and several companions were riding in the bed of a pickup truck <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> lost control and the truck rolled. Nine other students were injured.|$|E
5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting only that two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> was shot dead.|$|E
30|$|Conversely, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> vehicle {{caught up}} with the {{preceding}} vehicle, a smooth and comfortable feeling of deceleration was achieved.|$|R
40|$|In forward {{collision}} avoidance systems, warnings may be provided more effectively if the underlying timing is set earlier than normal <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> attention {{is not in}} the forward direction of the vehicle. In this regard, we determined <b>the</b> following <b>driver</b> characteristcs: (1) <b>the</b> amount of horizontal facial rotation needed to keep track of a moving object in <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> field of view increases significantly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> horizontal viewing angle of that target object exceeds 20 degrees, (2) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> face is oriented in the forward direction, the horizontal angle of facial rotation falls within 15 degrees, and (3) the reaction time to warning lengthens in accordance with the increase in the horizontal viewing angle. In the context of forward collision warning systems, we have determined the difference in the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> horizontal facial rotation angle, for cases <b>when</b> <b>the</b> driver’ attention was and was not directed to objects in the forward direction of the vehicle. Furthermore, we have measured the reaction time to warning <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> face was not directed forward. Last, our findings were successfully applied to issue the onset timing of a forward collision warning system...|$|R
5000|$|Some Acuras (Honda's {{luxury car}} marque in the United States, Canada, and China) {{of the mid}} 2000s, would ask <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to [...] "please fasten your {{seatbelt}}" [...] <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> seatbelt was not fastened, {{in addition to a}} chime warning.|$|R
5|$|Drive {{has been}} called a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene <b>when</b> <b>The</b> <b>Driver</b> kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in the}} neon-bright opening credits and the retro song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|The job goes awry {{when the}} {{pawnshop}} owner shoots and kills Standard while the Driver {{is waiting for}} him with Cook's accomplice, Blanche. Pursued by a mysterious adversary, the Driver and Blanche escape after an intense car chase. The Driver hides with Blanche in a motel where he learns from a news report that Standard, according to the pawnshop owner, performed the robbery by himself and that no money had been stolen. When she lies about being oblivious to the second car <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> interrogates her, he slaps Blanche and threatens to hurt her {{to get her to}} talk. Blanche then admits that the bag contains a million dollars and that she and Cook planned to re-steal the money using the car that chased them. Two of Cook's men ambush them in the motel room, and kill Blanche before the Driver manages to kill them both.|$|E
5|$|The men torment the {{bound and}} gagged Sally while Leatherface, now {{dressed as a}} woman, serves dinner. Leatherface and the {{hitchhiker}} bring down Grandpa (John Dugan), one of the desiccated bodies from upstairs. He is revealed to be alive when he sucks blood from a cut on Sally's finger. They decide that Grandpa, the best killer in the old slaughterhouse, should kill Sally. He tries to hit her with a hammer but is too weak. In the ensuing confusion, she breaks free, leaps through a window, and flees to the road. Leatherface and the hitchhiker give chase, but the latter is run over and killed by a passing truck. Armed with his chainsaw, Leatherface attacks the truck <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> stops to help; the driver knocks down Leatherface with a pipe wrench, causing the chainsaw to cut his leg. The driver flees, and Sally escapes {{in the back of}} a passing pickup truck as Leatherface dances maniacally in the road with his chainsaw.|$|E
30|$|Following control: <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> {{vehicle is}} {{following}} behind the preceding vehicle, the system controls the throttle and brake {{so that the}} time interval between the vehicles (which corresponds to a distance between the vehicles that {{is proportional to the}} velocity of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> vehicle) is <b>the</b> time which was set by <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b>|$|R
30|$|Acceleration control: when, {{due to a}} lane change, {{there is}} no longer a vehicle ahead of <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> vehicle, <b>the</b> system accelerates the vehicle up to the {{velocity}} set by <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> and then maintains a constant velocity. Furthermore, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> vehicle approaches a vehicle ahead of it without slowing down enough, an alert buzzer and display prompt <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> to apply <b>the</b> brakes or take other appropriate action.|$|R
50|$|The Southall rail crash {{occurred}} on 19 September 1997 when a mainline high speed express train from Swansea to London Paddington ran a red signal, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> attention was distracted, and it {{collided with a}} goods train just outside Southall railway station. Seven people died and 139 were injured.|$|R
5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{of the car}} gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning {{over the head with}} a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making it appear that Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E
25|$|Blue {{flashing}} lights must only be lit {{at the scene}} of an emergency, or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> considers it desirable to indicate that the journey being undertaken is urgent, and (in terms of the law) convey to other drivers that they should take special care.|$|E
25|$|Tractor/Motorized {{equipment}} (T/M) permit can {{be obtained}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is 16 years old. T/M allows driving a moped. Anyone with B licence can drive tractors and Motorized equipment. Motorized equipment would be things like combine harvesters, steam rollers, loaders, excavators and other vehicles driving maximum 30km/h.|$|E
5000|$|The 2000 {{model year}} {{introduced}} an emergency trunk release system, child seat anchor brackets (LATCH) {{in the back}} seat, the [...] "Belt Minder" [...] chime to the Crown Victoria (Belt Minder is a seatbelt reminder system that sounds <b>the</b> vehicle's chime <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> seatbelt is not buckled). The engine's FEAD system was revised.|$|R
5000|$|If {{a driver}} stalled his car while {{entering}} the final grid, the other cars were sent instantly {{to a new}} warm-up lap, instead of all drivers stopping their cars and waiting {{a couple of minutes}} for a new start. The stalled car is pushed to the pit lane and the grid is clear <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> return.|$|R
5000|$|It {{remained}} {{powered by}} the [...] "Stovebolt Six" [...] six-cylinder engine, but now upgraded with a downdraft carburettor and a higher compression ratio to produce [...] A three-speed synchro-mesh transmission was fitted and a [...] "Free Wheeling" [...] mode was standard, which permitted the car to coast <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> foot was lifted from the accelerator.|$|R
25|$|The {{design of}} the rear {{suspension}} made for poor ride quality and, as the Board discovered, made the vehicles liable to experience rear wheel spin. This resulted in an accident in May 1986 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> of Cub no. 611 lost control and the vehicle crashed into a tree, with four of the occupants ending up in hospital.|$|E
25|$|On 21 August 2009 the 18:07 {{train from}} Balbriggan to Connolly was passing over the viaduct <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> noticed a {{subsidence}} and the embankment giving {{way on the}} northbound track. The train passed over the bridge before it collapsed and the driver alerted authorities. A major catastrophe was avoided but commuters faced significant subsequent disruption.|$|E
25|$|On February 3, 2010, {{a family}} from California was {{traveling}} east on snow-covered Interstate 40 near Gallup, New Mexico, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> hit {{a patch of}} ice, sending their pickup truck across the median into the westbound lanes, striking an oncoming vehicle, killing the adult passenger, and leaving the driver, the child, and {{the driver of the}} westbound vehicle critically injured.|$|E
30|$|Three {{systems were}} used in this experiment: CC, partial automation, and full automation. The CC was a {{standard}} Scania CC implemented in the driving simulator; however, <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> were unable to set the speed themselves, which was preset to 82  km/h. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> had entered <b>the</b> highway, they pressed the CC button and the vehicle accelerated/slowed to 82  km/h, just {{as if they had}} pressed the resume button on the CC.|$|R
30|$|The {{overestimation}} of {{the speed}} in some stages of congestion (parts between 4, 000  m– 4, 300  m and 6, 000  m– 6, 200  m) {{can be explained by}} the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> who decelerate just before the congestion and thus increase spacings. The same effect occurs after the passing of congestion <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> begin to accelerate (part between 5, 400  m and 5, 500  m). In latter case, halting vehicles are distorting the estimation additionally.|$|R
5000|$|Comfort and {{performance}} options {{available for the}} Cougar included the [...] "Tilt-Away" [...] steering wheel that swung {{up and out of}} <b>the</b> way <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> door was opened, the transmission in [...] "park", and the ignition was off, and from 1971, a power <b>driver's</b> seat. <b>The</b> new option appeared in 1968: Ford's first factory-installed electric sunroof. It was available on any hardtop Cougar, but rarely ordered on early cars.|$|R
25|$|The {{driver and}} the {{passenger}} enter and exit the car {{through the front}} hatch that houses the windshield. The conventional steering wheel and the brake and throttle controls were replaced with a device similar to a airplane's yoke. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> pushes the control stick forward the car speeds up, while when pulled back the car slows down. Turns are made by moving the yoke control left or right.|$|E
25|$|According to NHTSA data, early SUVs {{were at a}} {{disadvantage}} in single-vehicle accidents (such as <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> falls asleep or loses control swerving around a deer), which involve 43% of fatal accidents, with {{more than double the}} chance of rolling over. This risk related closely to overall US motor vehicle fatality data, showing that SUVs and pickups generally had a higher fatality rate than cars of the same manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|On May 8, 2009, two {{trolleys}} rear-end collided underground between Park Street and Government Center <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> {{of one of}} the trolleys, 24-year-old Aiden Quinn, was {{text messaging}} his girlfriend while driving. Quinn had run through a red light before the crash, which injured 46 people. MBTA officials estimated that the cost of the crash was $9.6 million. A strict ban on cell phone usage by MBTA operators was later enacted.|$|E

50|$|In jurisdictions {{which use}} a point system, {{the police or}} {{licensing}} authorities (as specified by law) maintain, for each driver, a driving score—typically an integer number specified in points. Traffic offenses, such as speeding or disobeying traffic signals, are each assigned {{a certain number of}} points, and when a driver is determined to be guilty of a particular offense (by whatever means appropriate in the region's legal system), the corresponding number of points are added to <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> total. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver's</b> total exceeds a certain threshold, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> may face additional penalties, be required to attend safety classes or driver training, be subject to re-examination, or lose his/her driving privileges.|$|R

25|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{was mainly}} unionist {{and there were}} many British servicemen and their relatives living in the area. At 8PM, two lorries carrying 13 Auxiliaries emerged from the barracks. The first slowed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> spotted Kenny as the IRA unit attacked with grenades and revolvers. As the IRA unit made its escape, some of the Auxiliaries managed to fire their rifles {{in the direction of the}} volunteers while others dragged the wounded to the nearest cover: O'Sullivan's pub.|$|E
25|$|The {{autonomy}} {{functions of}} the Model S, including Autosteer and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have limitations {{that have led to}} collisions <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> becomes inattentive. Tesla warns in the owners manual that drivers always must be aware of road conditions and not rely on the cruise control to prevent a collision, as the system may not detect stationary vehicles or obstacles, bicycles, and pedestrians. However, critics such as scientist Andrew Ng have accused Tesla of being irresponsible by releasing a product with such limitations as it can lull drivers into a false sense of security.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|E
40|$|A study {{into the}} effects of {{addendum}} modification on root stress in involute spur gears with various pressure angles are presented in this project work. The range of addendum modification co-efficient is taken from negative value to positive value through zero by considering both the upper limit(peaking limit) and the lower limit (undercutting limit). The root stress factor is found out for various loading positions. The variation of root stress factor with addendum modification co-efficient is shown <b>when</b> only <b>the</b> driving gear is modified. A study into {{the effects of}} addendum modification on root stress using mathematical formulation as well as finite element analysis <b>when</b> both <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and follower are modified {{at the same time}} also for different gear ratios. The value of root stress factor decreases with an increasing addendum modification coefficient <b>when</b> only <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> is modified. <b>The</b> root stress factor also decreases when pressure angle is increased. The root stress factor is further decreased <b>when</b> both <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> and follower are modified at the same time. The root stress factor decreases further as the gear ratio increases...|$|R
50|$|LS (stands for “Liniový Systém” in Czech, “continuous system” in English) is a cab {{signalling}} and a {{train protection}} system {{used on the}} main lines of the Czech and Slovak railways (on all lines which track speed exceeds 100 km/h in the Czech republic or 120 km/h in Slovakia). This system continuously transmits and shows a signal aspect of the next main signal in <b>driver’s</b> cabin and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> activity is needed (e.g. reduction of train’s speed), it periodically checks <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> vigilance (he has to press the “vigilance” button; else the emergency brake is applied). This is the main function of on-board part of the LS-system (continuous cab signalling and checking <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> vigilance <b>when</b> needed).|$|R
40|$|Rear-end crashes {{constitute}} approximately 30 % of all {{crashes and}} drivers who maintain inappropriately short time headways {{are at a}} higher risk {{for this type of}} crash. One approach to help drivers maintain appropriate headway times is to use technology to monitor headway and provide drivers with feedback. This paper investigates the effects of a feedback-reward system on headway time. Data utilized in this research were collected from 37 participants (20 to 70 years old) through a field trial commissioned by Transport Canada. In this field trial, a feedback-reward system was investigated, which provided feedback and rewards to <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> based on safe headway maintenance (≥ 1. 2 seconds) and speed limit compliance. The trial consisted of three phases: baseline (two weeks), intervention (twelve weeks), and post-intervention (two weeks). During the intervention phase, real-time feedback was provided on an in-vehicle display. Participants also accumulated reward points and could view related information on a special website. Results indicate that the intervention increased safe headway compliance rates by 10 %. Further, during instances <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> were not within the safe headway time, headway time was larger in the intervention period compared to the baseline. Thus, intervention had a positive effect even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> were not compliant. To a large degree, these benefits appeared to not persist in the post-intervention phase...|$|R
