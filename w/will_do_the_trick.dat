40|$|To {{develop a}} {{positive}} attitude towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), the actual experience of doing science is an important contributor. Just telling children that science is fun, <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick,</b> and neither <b>will</b> reading in books about it. However, enthusiasm of the teacher, an interesting explanation, discussion in class and designing and conducting experiments themselves, can lead to emotional involvedness, lasting memories and cognitive understanding (Van Graft & Kemmers, 2007). The teacher is the role model, and the attitude they have towards STEM and towards teaching STEM can have a lasting impact on the children’ attitude (Pell & Jarvis, 2003; Schroeder, Scott, Tolson, Huang, & Lee, 2007) ...|$|R
5000|$|Phephsile Maseko, {{national}} co-ordinator of the Traditional Healers Organisation (THO) says: [...] A true healer {{is someone}} who has been through initiation, inducted by an expert in the field, who has undergone rigorous training and completed external healing courses. If a patient complains of headaches, they will be given plants with painkilling properties. But the healer will also try to establish the root cause of the headaches, and treat that too. This may mean the healer will provide counselling to the patient. Treatment is usually holistic, and a once-off ointment <b>will</b> generally not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> Many clients come for help with their relationships or marriages. A potion may be given to open the communication channels between couples, so that they can speak about their problems. Counselling will also be on offer, but there is no quick-fix solution.|$|R
40|$|A Dutch artist, Christian Boer, has {{developed}} a special font ("Dyslexie") to improve reading performance {{for children and adults}} with readi ng difficulties. The font has received a lot of media attention and schools have started to use it for computerised reading exercises and publishers have started to use the font in books. Interestingly, there is barely any empirical evidence for the effica cy of this font. In this study we examined the effectiveness of Dyslexie font compared to Arial font in 39 low progress readers who were learning to read in English. In contrast to previous studies conducted with Dutch children, we used 1) a within-subject design and 2) three different control conditions (Arial font) in which we systematically matched for absolute font size and varied within and between word spacing. Results showed that the low-progress readers performed better (i. e., read more words per mi nute) in Dyslexie font than in Arial font matched on absolute letter size. However, when we slightly increased the within‐word spacing and between-word spacing, the difference in reading speed was no longer significant. We conclude that {{there is no need to}} buy Dyslexie font: changing <b>the</b> spacing settings <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same <b>trick...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{the other}} villagers, Obelix has {{no need to}} drink Getafix the druid's magic potion that gives superhuman strength, because he fell into the {{cauldron}} as a baby {{and its effect on}} him became permanent. Obelix is tall and massive. He is about 6 ft tall and he weighs more than 300 lb. The story of that incident is told in How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy. Since this effect was not intended or expected, Getafix refuses to allow him even one more drop except under the direst circumstances (either out of fear for his life, or fear for the lives of others should the inattentive and uncoordinated strongman become any stronger), which annoys Obelix greatly. (In Asterix and Obelix All at Sea, it is revealed that too much of the potion can turn the drinker to stone; exactly how much is not known, but a whole cauldron <b>will</b> certainly <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick.</b> This appears to only work on grown people as Obelix did not turn to stone as a baby, or may simply occur after drinking an excessive amount while still under the effects of a previous dose). However, in Asterix and Cleopatra, Getafix gives him a few drops to open a door in the Great Pyramid's Labyrinth but he comments that he does not see much difference between [...] "before and after the potion" [...] though this is presumably because Obelix is used to accomplishing any physical task with ease.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economic}} growth impact of organised political violence. First, we identify the various manifestations of political violence (riots, coups and civil war) and their risk of occurrence by using a multinomial model. Second, we use predicted probabilities of aggregate violence and its three manifestations to identify their growth effects in an encompassing growth model. The results of Generalised Method of Moments dynamic panel regressions suggest that organised political violence, especially civil war, significantly lowers long-term economic growth. Moreover, unlike most previous studies, we also find ethnic fractionalisation to have a negative and direct effect on growth, though its effect is substantially ameliorated by the institutions specific to a non-factional democratic society. Third, we find that Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been disproportionately impacted by civil war, which explains a substantial share of its economic decline, including the widening income gap relative to East Asia. Civil wars have also been very costly for SSA. For the case of Sudan, a typical large African country experiencing a long-duration conflict, war cost amounts to $ 46 billion (in 2000 fixed prices), which is roughly double the country's current stock of external debt. Fourth, we suggest that to break free from its conflict-underdevelopment trap, Africa needs to better manage its ethnic diversity and <b>the</b> way to <b>do</b> it is to develop inclusive, non-factional democracy. A democratic but factional polity <b>will</b> not <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>trick</b> and is only marginally better than authoritarian regimes. Copyright The author 2008.
