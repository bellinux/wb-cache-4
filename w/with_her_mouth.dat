25|$|Later, Lavinia {{writes the}} names of her attackers in the dirt, using a stick held <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and between her {{mutilated}} arms. Meanwhile, Tamora secretly gives birth to a mixed-race child, fathered by Aaron. Aaron kills the nurse to keep the child's race a secret and flees with the baby to save it from Saturninus' inevitable wrath. Thereafter, Lucius, marching on Rome with an army, captures Aaron and threatens to hang the infant. In order to save the baby, Aaron reveals the entire revenge plot to Lucius.|$|E
25|$|This species exists {{mostly in}} {{tropical}} areas with distinct rainy seasons, {{and the young}} hatch near {{the time of the}} first rains of the summer (July–August), after the preceding dry season and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> carrying them to the closest water source.|$|E
25|$|Aggression among captive {{killer whales}} is common. In August 1989, a {{dominant}} female killer whale, Kandu V, attempted to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> during a live show, and smashed {{her head into}} a wall. Kandu V broke her jaw, which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters {{to the bottom of}} the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. Tilikum had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of Dawn Brancheau and fined the company a total of US$12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the killer whales. In April 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld.|$|E

60|$|Philippa seized his hand. 'Ashley, Ashley! You don't mean it--that I must lose my pretty darling--the {{only one}} I have?' She met his gaze <b>with</b> <b>her</b> piteous <b>mouth</b> and wet eyes so painfully strained, that {{he turned away}} his face.|$|R
25|$|Corydoras aeneus is not {{particular}} about {{the composition of}} the water. Adequate conditions are a temperature range of 20 to 28 °C (68 to 82 °F), pH of 6.0–8.0, and hardness of 2–30 DGH. The water should have no salt added to it. A fairly dense growth of plants with a number of possible hiding places is greatly appreciated. Corys are easy to feed, they are omnivores eating all flake and pelleted food and also live and frozen foods. When it comes to sperm, then the female glues the eggs, only a few in number, to the chosen substrate and then (sometimes) quickly touches them <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> After several acts of spawning, which span a total of two to three hours, one female will have produced up to 200 eggs. Frequently, two males are used for each female, as one male has difficulty fertilizing all the eggs. The eggs gradually grow darker in color, and just prior to hatching (ranging from three days at 28 °C to a week at 20 °C) they turn dark brown. The fry keep {{to the bottom of the}} tank, feeding on detritus and any fine foods available. The parents may spawn again within two to three weeks.|$|E

It was to serve as the first song in the [...] "Countdown to Born This Way" [...] promotion on iTunes Store. However, after its release to the digital stores, [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] started selling a considerable amount of digital downloads, prompting Gaga to make it the third single from Born This Way.

60|$|But her {{brothers}} were {{too far off}} to hear; especially as the fright took away Europa's voice, and hindered her from calling very loudly.

500|$|Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), {{supervised}} by Stefen Fangmeier, created the film's 505 visual effects-shots. The filmmakers used as few digital effects as possible, though {{the train and}} smoke for the railroad crossing scene was entirely created using computer animation. ILM also used color grading techniques for the Lake Lachrymose scene, which required complete animation for the leeches. The digital animators studied footage of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season to accurately depict Hurricane Herman, which was ILM's most ambitious use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) for the film. Nexus Productions designed the opening [...] "Littlest Elf" [...] animated sequence by modeling it after stop motion animation and completing it with computer animation. The snakes at Uncle Monty's house were a combination of real snakes and animatronics. The animatronics, primarily the Incredibly Deadly Viper, were used as reference models that ILM later enhanced using CGI. Because working with infants was sometimes risky in producing a film, four scenes involving Sunny Baudelaire required CGI with motion capture technology. Among these are the shot of Sunny hanging on to a table by her teeth, catching a spindle <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and the scene where she is entangled with the Incredibly Deadly Viper. Animation supervisor Colin Brady used his baby daughter for motion capture recording. A remote controlled animatronic of Sunny was also designed by Kevin Yagher.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "spider-walk" [...] {{scene has}} been {{restored}} and digitally altered from the original scene. Here, crude wires from the scene have been digitally removed, she comes down the stairs much faster, and a second take <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> full of blood was used instead of a serpent tongue. It then cuts to black, and the next scene opens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{latter half}} of Callas's career was marked {{by a number of}} scandals. Following a {{performance}} of Madama Butterfly in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> turned in a furious snarl. The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a [...] "Tigress". In the same year, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, Time ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.|$|E
