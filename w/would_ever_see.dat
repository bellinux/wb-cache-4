25|$|Lauzun {{was freed}} on 22 April 1681 and obliged to live quietly at Bourbon before {{returning}} to Paris, but not the court, rather at the Hôtel de Lauzun, in March 1682. Prior {{to the death of}} Queen Marie Thérèse in July 1683, the couple had been on bad terms when they again came together temporarily in their grief. Soon after the two had an interview, the last time they <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> each other before Mademoiselle retired to her Parisian residence, the Palais du Luxembourg.|$|E

During the tour frontman Jacoby Shaddix and Hinder lead singer Austin John created a very tight friendship, causing the band to tour with Hinder on multiple tours in later years. It was revealed in 2015 that Shaddix and Austin wrote and recorded a song together for a part of Austin John's solo project, although the two {{said they were not}} for sure if the song <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> the light of day.|$|E
500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} The Great American Bash was between The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and The Undertaker. On the May 27 episode of SmackDown!, Paul Heyman told The Dudleys to [...] "make an impact". As {{part of the}} storyline, The Dudleys responded by abducting Paul Bearer, Undertaker's manager. The {{following}} week, Heyman told Undertaker {{that the only way}} he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> Bearer again, was to align himself with The Dudleys. Two weeks later, on the June 17 episode of SmackDown!, a Handicap match between The Dudleys and The Undertaker was booked for The Great American Bash, with the stipulation being if Undertaker lost, Bearer, as part of the scripted events, would be cemented in a glass crypt.|$|E

5000|$|He drew an enraged Imre Thököly in oriental garb {{behind bars}} (though it is {{unlikely}} that Mitelli <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> have <b>seen</b> the Hungarian rebel and Ottoman sympathiser as a prisoner in person). The Ottoman menace was still alive for Christian in this era.|$|R
500|$|Adler {{arrived in}} London with few contacts. In Whitechapel, {{the center of}} Jewish London at that time, he {{encountered}} extremes of poverty that he describes as exceeding any {{he had ever seen}} in Russia or <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> in New York. The quite distinguished Chief Rabbi of the British Empire at that time, Dr. Nathan Marcus Adler, was a relative. Adler's father had him written a letter of introduction in Hebrew, but nothing could have been farther from the rabbi's desires than to assist Yiddish-language theater. Nathan Marcus Adler viewed Yiddish as a [...] "jargon" [...] that existed at the expense of both liturgical Hebrew and the English necessary for upward mobility, and his Orthodox Judaism [...] "could not endure so much as a blessing given on stage, for such a blessing would be given in vain..."; further, he was afraid that the portrayals of Jews on stage would give aid and comfort to their enemies.|$|E
500|$|The first three-dollar {{pieces were}} 15proof coins, {{delivered}} to the Secretary of the Treasury, James Guthrie, by Mint Director Snowden on April28, 1854, most likely for distribution to legislators. [...] The Philadelphia Mint then began the largest production of three-dollar pieces the denomination <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see.</b> [...] Chief Coiner Franklin Peale delivered 23,140pieces on May8 and 29,181 pieces four days later. [...] However, after June8, {{there was only one}} further delivery by Peale, on November10, when the last 22,740 of the mintage of 138,618were delivered. [...] In addition to the strikings at Philadelphia, there was branch mint production, with 24,000pieces struck at the New Orleans Mint (1854-O) and 1,120at Dahlonega (1854-D). [...] A pair of dies was sent from Philadelphia to the Charlotte Mint on June1, but they were not used. A pair was sent to Dahlonega the same day, arriving on June10, with gauges and other necessary equipment following on July15. The coinage of the 1854-D took place in August; the piece is today a rarity as few were put aside and it was not until decades later that mintmarked coins were saved as distinct varieties. [...] Dies were sent to New Orleans in 1855, 1856, 1859, and 1861, only to remain unused; no further strikings took place at any of the three southern branch mints.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{also presented}} {{other pieces of}} circumstantial evidence linking Zach to the murder, including that he drove a white truck; a neighbor of the Bobo family had seen a white truck driving rapidly {{the morning of the}} murder. A number of other witnesses testified that Zach made statements implicating himself in her disappearance. Zach's then-girlfriend, Rebecca Earp, testified that [...] "He said he would tie me up just like he did Holly Bobo and nobody <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> me again." [...] He also allegedly threatened Dylan after his arrest that he would [...] "put him in a hole beside her" [...] if he didn't keep his mouth shut.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1930 season, {{the league}} {{considerably}} liberalized the passing rules, effectively eliminating offsides. The Stanley Cup champion Bruins took especial advantage, breaking many scoring records and recording the highest winning percentage the league <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see,</b> unsurpassed as of 2017. Leading {{the charge was}} the Dynamite Line, as Weiland {{led the league in}} scoring, Clapper finishing third and Gainor finishing ninth; Clapper's goal total of 41 was the third most in league history at that time. The Dynamite Line scored 102 of the Bruins' league record 179 goals, as many as last-place Pittsburgh managed. [...] While Clapper scored four goals in six playoff games, the Bruins were shocked in the Stanley Cup finals by the Montreal Canadiens in their best-of-three series.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{models of}} {{proposed}} developments were shown at Transpo. These included models of Garrett AiResearch's wheeled {{linear induction motor}} (LIM) testbed vehicle, drawings of Grumman Aircraft's and General Electric's TACV proposals, and a full-sized mock-up of a futuristic Rohr design. Three of the four designs eventually won contracts and were built to varying degrees at the TTC; Garrett's wheeled vehicle started testing under jet power before the LIM reaction plate was installed, Grumman's vehicle was given an extensive [...] track, but ran out of funding before the planned LIM reaction plate could be installed, and Rohr's vehicle {{was the last to}} arrive and received the least build-out with only {{a mile and a half}} of LIM-equipped track. Like the PRT systems, none of the TACV proposals <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> commercial development.|$|E
2500|$|Sometime afterward, {{the sons}} of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob {{wanted to know how}} things were doing, so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report. This was the last time he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up {{receiving}} came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (...) ...|$|E

2500|$|One man to {{whom they}} were ministering told them an amazing story: he had been {{separated}} from his wife {{at the very end}} of the war, and had not seen her since. At the time they were separated, his wife was a Christian, but he was not, but he had since been converted. His deep desire was to find his wife so they could at last share their faith together. But he told the Hines that he did not think he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> his wife on earth again. Instead he was longing for the day when they would meet in heaven, and could share in the Life Eternal there. These words again inspired Hine, and they became the basis for his fourth and final verse to 'How Great Thou Art': [...] "When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation to take me home, what joy shall fill my heart. Then we shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim, My God How Great Thou Art!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964 {{the family}} {{returned}} to Northern Ireland and Wright soon {{came under the}} influence of his maternal uncle Cecil McKinley, a member of the Orange Order. About three years later, Wright's parents separated and his mother decided to leave her children behind when she transferred once more to England. None of the Wright siblings <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> their mother again. Wright and his four sisters (Elizabeth, Jackie, Angela and Connie) were placed in foster care by the welfare authorities. He was raised separately from his sisters in a children's home in Mountnorris, South Armagh (a predominantly Irish nationalist area). Wright was brought up in the Presbyterian religion of his mother and attended church twice on Sundays. The young Wright mixed with Catholics and played Gaelic football, indicating an amicable relationship with the local Catholic, nationalist population. Nor were his family extreme Ulster loyalists. Wright's father, while campaigning for an inquest into his son's death, later described loyalist killings as [...] "abhorrent". Two of Wright's sisters married Catholic men, one having come from County Tipperary and whom Wright liked. Wright's sister Angela maintained that he personally got on well with Catholics, and that he was only anti-Irish republican and anti-IRA. For [...] a while David Wright cohabitated with Kathleen McVeigh, a Catholic from Garvagh.|$|E
2500|$|In {{attempting}} to give precise figures, some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated {{the number of}} murders by this order from 1865 to 1875; {{but no one can}} go through the evidence without being convinced that a great many men were killed to satisfy the vengeful spirit of the Molly Maguires. Some of the victims were men so useful, so conspicuous, and so beloved in their communities that their assassinations caused a profound and enduring impression. In some cases, so Dewees (who has written a very useful story) asserts, robbery was added to murder: superintendents, who were carrying the money for the monthly pay of the miners and laborers, were waylaid as they drove along some lonely road in the desolate country. While the murders were numerous, still more numerous were the threats of murder and warnings to leave the country written on a sheet of paper with a rude picture of a coffin or a pistol and sometimes both. One notice read: [...] "Mr. John Taylor-We will give you one week to go, but if you are alive on next Saturday you will die." [...] Another, to three bosses, charged with [...] "cheating thy men" [...] had a picture of three pistols and a coffin and on the coffin was written, [...] "This is your home." [...] In other mining districts and in manufacturing localities, during strikes and times of turbulence similar warnings have been common and have been laughed at by mining bosses, superintendents, and proprietors; but, in the anthracite region between 1865 and 1876 the bravest of men could not forget how many of his fellows had been shot and suppress a feeling of uneasiness when he found such a missive on his doorstep or posted up on the door of his office at the mine. Many a superintendent and mining boss left his house in the morning with his hand on his revolver, wondering if he <b>would</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> wife and children again.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} the church began to {{discourage}} all non-religious human images – the Emperor and donor figures counting as religious. [...] This became largely effective, so {{that most of}} the population <b>would</b> only <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> religious images and those of the ruling class. [...] The word icon referred to any and all images, not just religious ones, but there was barely a need for a separate word for these.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is going}} up {{the west coast of}} Greenland anyway," [...] said Chet. [...] "And that suits me, for that is where the Betsey Andrews was last heard of."

6000|$|... "Major! don't {{call him}} Major!" [...] Emmy said. [...] "I'm sure I can't tell what he meant." [...] His {{presence}} {{and that of}} his friend inspired the little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. They paid her tipsy compliments; they leered at her over the dinner-table. And the Captain made her advances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor <b>would</b> she <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> him unless she had George by her side.|$|R

5000|$|Palin {{opposed the}} Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action which placed limits on Iran's nuclear program, {{on the grounds}} that the treaty was not strict enough.

6000|$|He glanced furtively at Satan, and I {{think he}} hoped Satan would say, [...] "Yes, {{you will be}} there some day," [...] but Satan seemed to be {{thinking}} about something else, and said nothing. This made me feel ghastly, for I knew he had heard; nothing, spoken or unspoken, ever escaped him. Poor Seppi looked distressed, and did not finish his remark. The goblets rose and clove their way into the sky, a triplet of radiant sundogs, and disappeared. Why didn't they stay? It seemed a bad sign, and depressed me.

60|$|On {{looking over}} some letters I found the one I wrote, {{intended}} for you, from {{the foot of}} Helvellyn to Liverpool; but you had sailed, and therefore it was returned to me.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Kanin began solo writing in earnest with Heat of Anger, about a strong, older woman lawyer played by Susan Hayward, {{and a younger}} male lawyer. At first Kanin was {{put off by the}} lack of an {{immediate}} reaction from an audience, but once she realized that more people had seen it in one night than <b>would</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> it in theaters if it played for a year, she was hooked and wrote five more films for television.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily, {{his mind}} {{turned to the}} girl, {{wandering}} in the forest, alone and terrified. <b>Would</b> he <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> her again? At that thought he nearly lost his self-possession. But {{the idea that if}} she followed his instructions those men were not likely to find her steadied him a little. They did not know that the island had any inhabitants; and he himself once disposed of, they would be too anxious to get away to waste time hunting for a vanished girl.|$|R
5000|$|Macias, however, {{expressed}} a greater desire {{to spend more}} time in contemplative solitude rather than engage in conversational activities with others. He confessed this to Father Abbot Ramírez who said, “If he were to never follow his vow of obedience, nobody <b>would</b> have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> his face." [...] But his official position as the priory's porter, which he held for over 20 years and went against his natural inclinations of solitude, served to continue disciplining his vow of obedience. This filled him with a joyful sense of fulfillment. He died of natural causes in 1645.|$|R
