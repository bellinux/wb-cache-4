500|$|André 3000 is {{featured}} on an official remix of the song, released digitally on January 18, 2011. Kesha explained to Rap-Up {{how she got}} him to record a verse for the song: [...] "I sent him the track and was fully aware that he’s only been on a few songs {{in the past five}} years. But he ended up liking it. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, and he said, ‘With a flow like that, you could definitely have a career as a rapper.’ It was the biggest compliment I’ve ever had. It was coming from a god!" [...] She further elaborated that André 3000 is [...] "one of my favorite musicians, lyricists, rappers, of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon suggests that the uncomfortable working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I think all this paid off in terms of what <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area. Co-writer Nick Maley reprised his role as a special effects technician to produce the infant twin props that appear in the climax of the film.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was very}} close to what Mottola wanted the {{finished}} product to be, according to Afanasieff. [...] "We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day - and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: {{a day and a half}} for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing." ...|$|E

500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{only man}} {{who might have}} done it is that big scoundrel whom <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast, the Swahili.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{picked me}} up at Centerport. They saw that I was limber and could do a turn or two, and they made me join. They promised me good wages and a fine time, {{but as soon as}} <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road they treated me worse than my dog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yep!" [...] said Parkins, [...] "that's {{what things}} were like over there. So when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> board <b>the</b> train <b>we</b> asked a man {{when it was}} due to get to Vienna, and he said he hadn't the faintest idea!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Margaret," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I have lowered a {{lead into}} that hole {{with all the}} line {{attached}} which <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> place, and <b>we</b> can touch no bottom. I have telegraphed {{for a lot of}} sounding-wire, and I must wait until it shall arrive before I do anything more." ...|$|R
60|$|Buffalo was on {{the ticket}} for that afternoon, and the Bisons were leading the race and playing in topnotch form. I went into the {{dressing}} room while the players were changing suits, {{because there was a}} little unpleasantness that I wanted to spring on them before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> field.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{question}} easily asked, {{but hard}} to answer. In the first place, though {{an old and}} a gray-headed fellow, he twitched his skiff along as if it floated in air. We were not a minute, or two at the most, behind him; but, when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} slaver, boat and man had vanished!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In the {{confusion}} on the quay I slipped away. Nobody saw me. I took a car. Told {{the man to}} drive {{me out of the}} town. I watched when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> open road. No other car was following us. I saw a path {{at the side of the}} road. I told the man to wait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But our {{luck was}} out. We lost many days in finding these islands, {{and when we}} did get back to them, hardly had <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> board than <b>the</b> weather broke up.|$|R
5000|$|Kejriwal {{noted in}} 2012 {{that the success}} of the {{organisation}} was limited, saying that it was [...] "ephemeral and delusionary in nature. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> success <b>on</b> <b>the</b> issue till the time we worked on it in that area but as we moved on to next issue the old issue became even worse than before." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> {{main object}} <b>on</b> my mind, I remember, when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> fairly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, was {{to appear as}} old as {{possible}} to the coachman, and to speak extremely gruff. The latter point I achieved at great personal inconvenience; but I stuck to it, because I felt it was a grown-up sort of thing.|$|R
60|$|We {{soon began}} to think the captain was mistaken in saying there would be lots of ships coming this way. But then, we couldn't see very far. Ships may have passed within {{a few miles of}} us, without our knowing {{anything}} about it. It was very different from being high up on a ship's deck, or in her rigging. Sometimes, though, we seemed high enough up, when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of a wave.|$|E
60|$|Quitting our own {{quiet and}} secluded abode in the mountains, in the {{pleasant}} month of June, {{and in this}} current year of 1848, we descended into {{the valley of the}} Mohawk, got into the cars, and went flying by rails toward the setting sun. Well could we remember the time when an entire day was required to pass between that point on the Mohawk where <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rails, and the little village of Utica. On the present occasion, we flew over the space in less than three hours, and dined in a town of some fifteen thousand souls.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{track of}} the car all right," [...] the detective began, [...] "and traced it to a small village called Frisby, {{the other side of}} Chester, and to the house of a Mrs. Phillips, a woman in poor {{circumstances}} who had just removed from Liverpool. She was the widow, all right. She showed us letters, and plenty of them, from her husband in New York. It appears that Gant alone had brought the coffin, which was left at the cemetery, and the funeral will have taken place t his afternoon. Mrs. Phillips was full of his praises, and it seems that he had paid her over the whole of the money you spoke about--five thousand dollars." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a Rolling Stone article dated January 20, 2015, Gumbel said: [...] "There are a {{few things}} I hate more than the (National Rifle Association). I mean truly. I think they're pigs. I think they don't care about human life. I think they are a curse upon the American landscape. So <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} three hours, however, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> beautifully. <b>The</b> trail was fair, though {{somewhat}} greasy; the sun shone, though with a somewhat watery gleam, through the mists; and Peter Crow, coiled up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> folded tent behind the seat, slept soundly and snored mellifluously. That snore reassured me greatly. I {{had never thought of}} Indians as snoring. Surely one who did couldn't be dreaded greatly.|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> fairly down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{level part}} of the Danite farm, we came to places where we could {{actually}} run our horses. It was a notable circumstance.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{next was}} a {{beautiful}} crisp autumn morning--a weather-breeder, if I had taken the trouble to think; but it's refreshing to escape from kings and converts for half a day. We three went by ourselves in Meon's smallest boat, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> whiting near an old wreck, {{a mile or so}} off shore. Meon knew the marks to a yard, and the fish were keen. Yes--yess! A perfect morning's fishing! If a Bishop can't be a fisherman, who can?' He twiddled his ring again. 'We stayed there a little too long, and while we were getting up our stone, down came the fog. After some discussion, we decided to row for the land. The ebb was just beginning to make round the point, and sent us all ways at once like a coracle.' ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{street where}} the Babylon Hotel was he whipped up his horses {{so that they}} went almost on a run, and the horner blew his horn until his eyes seemed bursting, and with a grand sweep and a clank and a jingle we pulled up {{at the front of}} the big hotel. Out marched the head porter in a blue uniform, and out ran two under-porters with red coats, and down jumped the horner and put up his ladder, and Jone and I got down, after giving the coachman half-a-crown, and {{receiving}} from the passengers a combined gaze of differentialism which had been wholly wanting before. The men in the red coats looked disappointed when they saw we had no baggage, but the great doors was flung open and we went straight up to the clerk's desk.|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Kallenberg, it was {{not quite}} day; {{and we had to}} halt for more light. After some time the King said to his Groom, 'Give me my perspective!' looked slowly all round for a good while, and then said, 'I see no Austrians!'--(ground all at our choice, then; we know where to choose!) The King then asked me if I knew the road to"--in fact, to several places, which, in a Parish History of those parts, would be abundantly interesting; but must be entirely omitted here.... "The King called his Chamberlain; gave some sign, which meant 'Beer-money to Kappel!'--and I got four eight-groschen pieces [three shillings odd; a rich reward in those days]; and was bid tell my Master, 'That the King thanked him for the good quarters, and assured him of his favor.' ...|$|E
60|$|THE DEVIL. Alas! Senor Commander, {{now that}} <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> subject of Woman, he will talk more than ever. However, I confess {{it is for}} me the one supremely {{interesting}} subject.|$|R
5000|$|Before <b>we</b> <b>got</b> away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> journey, a very {{remarkable}} {{operation in}} shunting {{had to be}} performed, albeit it was commenced two minutes after the time for starting. Two trucks were brought in from a siding, and so manipulated with engine and by hand, that finally one was attached in rear of the car, {{and the other in}} front of the locomotive! ...|$|R
30|$|The {{prevalence}} of CEH was 1.72  % {{of the brain}} scanner performed during the study period. This result is lightly inferior to the one (2.2  %) found by Sjaastad and Bakketeig (2008). The difference between both values {{could be explained by}} the fact that Sjaastad and Bakketeig (2008) had studied various etiologies of CEH whereas <b>we</b> <b>got</b> focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relation between CEH and atlas spina-bifida occulta.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to {{the voyage}} itself, your {{intelligence}} will {{have told you}} by this time that, thanks to my manipulation, both compasses and chronometers were entirely untrustworthy. I alone worked out the course with correct instruments of my own, while the steering was done by my black friends under my guidance. I pushed Tibb's wife overboard. What! You look surprised and shrink away. Surely you had guessed that by this time. I would have shot you that day through the partition, but unfortunately you were not there. I tried again afterwards, but you were awake. I shot Tibbs. I think the idea of suicide was carried out rather neatly. Of course when once <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast the rest was simple. I had bargained that all on board should die; but that stone of yours upset my plans. I also bargained {{that there should be}} no plunder. No one can say we are pirates. We have acted from principle, not from any sordid motive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{subject of}} poetry and Southey, he gave us a {{critique}} of the Curse of Kehama, the fault of which he thought consisted in the association of a plot and a machinery so very wild with feelings so sober and tender: but he gave the poem high commendation, admired the art displayed in the employment of the Hindu monstrosities, and begged us to observe the noble feeling excited of the superiority of virtue over vice; that Kehama went on, from the beginning {{to the end of the}} poem, increasing in power, whilst Kailyal gradually lost her hopes and her protectors; and yet by the time we got to the end, we had arrived at an utter contempt and even carelessness of the power of evil, as exemplified in the almighty Rajah, and felt a complete confidence in the safety of the unprotected virtue of the maiden. This he thought the very great merit of the poem.|$|E
60|$|A {{few days}} later, another man {{died of the}} fever. This left but five {{of us in the}} forecastle, with the ship a long way to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope. Before we got up with the Cape, another {{foremast}} hand went crazy, and, instead of helping us, became a cause of much trouble {{for the rest of the}} passage. In the end, he died, mad. We had now only three men in a watch, the officers included; and of course, it was trick and trick at the helm. Notwithstanding all this, we did very well, having a good run, until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coast, which we reached in the month of January. A north-wester drove us off, and we had a pretty tough week of it, but brought the ship up to the Hook, at the end of that time, and anchored her safely in the East River. The Clyde must have been a ship of about three hundred tons, and, including every one on board, nine of us sailed her from the eastward of the Cape to her port, without any serious difficulty.|$|E
5000|$|In a September 2010 {{interview}} with Spike TV, Cudi spoke <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album's guest appearances: [...] "Man, {{when it comes}} to features, I kinda just stick to my homies. My peoples Chip tha Ripper, GLC is a GOOD Music affiliate. Got my boy Cage over there, and Mary J. Blige <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> Cee-Lo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. It's just really taking off where we last stopped." ...|$|R
