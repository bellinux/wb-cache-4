The processing parameters have to be optimal in order to minimize the cost and use of production materials while not decreasing the product quality. Regarding the product quality and particularly the cost, the hardening which is seen during the planing process and the cutting power were seen to both have a significant effect [6].|$|R

Also, high added-value processing products have been rapidly increased with increases of the imported lumbers has been rapidly increased with increases of the imported lumbers as affected by changes in the demand of wooden residence houses built with high quality of earthquake resistant <b>wooden</b> <b>materials.</b> However, in Korea,lower grade lumber and coniferous logs in low-price are needed instead of high quality <b>wooden</b> <b>materials</b> and lumbers because temporary <b>wooden</b> <b>materials</b> that {{does not need to}} be durability and high quality are comparing with that in Japan.
