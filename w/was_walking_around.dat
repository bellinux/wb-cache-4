500|$|Breakaways {{critical}} acclaim also enabled Clarkson to also earn critical respect, {{particularly from the}} rock and indie music scene, who had looked down upon American Idol contestants. In his memoir, Davis recalled a meeting with Simon Fuller and Sony BMG President Charles Goldstuck, where Fuller acknowledged how the worldwide success of Breakaway had validated American Idol itself. The popularity of [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] among the rock community also resulted in various cover versions by rock acts, such as A Day to Remember, Ted Leo, and Tokyo Police Club. Clarkson herself recalled, [...] "It's ridiculous how well that song was received by hard rockers, by indie people. I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> {{with a friend of}} mine and this hard-rock guy {{came up to me and}} was like, 'I look stupid, but I tell my friends I love this song.' People at concerts are like, 'That's my guilty pleasure. I don't mean to be mean, but I didn't want to like the American Idol girl.' But they love that song, and it kind of won them over." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it was so hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E

2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E

[...] "I thought it would be more fascinating if Todd <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> as a contradiction in terms of his feelings for Marty.

2500|$|Two Air Commando H-19 pilots {{received}} the Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Crosses from an attempted rescue mission described in their citations as [...] "the deepest helicopter {{penetration of the}} Korean War". [...] Taking off from Cho-do Island {{in the early morning}} hours, Captain Frank J. Westerman and Lieutenant Robert Sullivan flew low-level through darkness for two hours, guided north by an Air Rescue SA-16 pathfinder aircraft flying overhead at an altitude of 100 feet. [...] At first light, the helicopter was 16 miles south of the Chinese border and within ten minutes flying time of the Chinese MiG fighter base at Antung, the largest Chinese fighter base in North Korea. [...] Racing inland they discovered the valley the downed pilot was reported to be in, {{which turned out to be}} a massive camouflage supply and troop depot. The valley contained at least a regiment of troops, all armed and firing as fast as they could. [...] The hills looked like a large warehouse, piles of equipment and supplies under camouflage nets. [...] It was quickly evident that no evading American <b>was</b> <b>walking</b> <b>around</b> in the area. [...] The Air Commandos fled for their lives, informing the SA-16 offshore to do the same. [...] It was likely that the rescue attempt was bait for a Chinese trap. All of the Air Commandos returned to Cho-do successfully.|$|E
