25|$|The sediments entrained in a flow can {{be transported}} along the bed as bed load {{in the form}} of sliding and rolling grains, or in {{suspension}} as suspended load advected by the main flow.

5000|$|The {{composition}} of <b>wash</b> <b>load</b> {{is a good}} way to classify he difference between wash and bed loads because the definition is distinct. The <b>wash</b> <b>load</b> is almost entirely made up of grains that are not found in quantity in the bed. <b>Wash</b> <b>load</b> grains tend to be very small (mostly clays and silts, but also some fine sands) and therefore have a small settling velocity, being kept in suspension by the flow turbulence. The {{composition of}} the <b>wash</b> <b>load</b> changes as the bed load changes. According to Einstein, all particles that are not significantly represented in the deposits of the bed [...] "must be" [...] considered <b>wash</b> <b>load.</b> This means that as the bed load moves down the river and the size of the bed load is reduced so is the size of the <b>wash</b> <b>load.</b> This is shown by Einstein’s [...] "suggestion that the largest sediment size may be arbitrarily chosen as the grain diameter of the D10 (<b>wash</b> <b>load)</b> of which 10% of the bed sediment is finer.” <b>Wash</b> <b>load</b> also has a different composition than the bed load.

50|$|The {{suspended}} load {{is one of}} the three layers of the fluvial sediment transportation system.

30|$|The {{residential}} clothes washer {{was introduced}} to the US market in the 1920 s, but fully automated washing machines, which filled and drained water automatically and spun clothes {{to reduce the amount of}} water left after rinsing, were not available until the late 1930 s (Shehan and Moras 2006). Since the 1940 s, the sales of home laundry appliances have grown dramatically (Stawreberg 2011).

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of trace findings on spermatozoa on clothing is often problematic, as {{the manner of}} deposition may not be readily determined.

Small numbers of spermatozoa may be,a result of some type of sexual activity or may be due to an unrelated, innocuous incident. Transfer of spermatozoa between items during machine washing has been theorized as one possible method of Indi-rect deposition. This research was undertaken to determine the likelihood of such transfer. A normal machine wash was simulated in three independent experiments.

The concentration of suspended sediment with depth goes as {{the power of the}} negative Rouse number. It also is used to determine how the particles will move in the fluid.

50|$|Three {{components}} that {{are included in}} the load of a river system are the following: dissolved load, <b>wash</b> <b>load</b> and bed material load. The bed material load is the portion of the sediment that is transported by a stream that contains material derived from the bed. Bed material load typically consists of all of the bed load, and the proportion of the suspended load that is represented in the bed sediments. It generally consists of grains coarser than 0.062 mm with the principal source being the channel bed. Its importance lies in that its composition is that of the bed, and the material in transport can therefore be actively interchanged with the bed. For this reason, bed material load exerts a control on river channel morphology. Bed load and <b>wash</b> <b>load</b> (the sediment that rides high in the flow and does not extract non-negligible momentum from it) together constitute the total load of sediment in a stream. The order in which the three components of load have been considered - dissolved, wash, bed material - {{can be thought of as}} progression: of increasingly slower transport velocities, so that the load peak lags further and further behind the flow peak during any event.|$|E
50|$|If the upwards {{velocity}} {{approximately equal}} to the settling velocity, sediment will be transported downstream entirely as suspended load. If the upwards velocity is {{much less than the}} settling velocity, but still high enough for the sediment to move (see Initiation of motion), it will move along the bed as bed load by rolling, sliding, and saltating (jumping up into the flow, being transported a short distance then settling again).
