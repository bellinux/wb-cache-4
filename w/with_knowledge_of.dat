5|$|Gargi Vachaknavi (born about c. 700 BCE) was {{an ancient}} Indian philosopher. In Vedic Literature, she is honored {{as a great}} natural philosopher, renowned expounder of the Vedas, and known as Brahmavadini, a person <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Brahma Vidya. In the Sixth and the eighth Brahmana of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, her name is {{prominent}} as she participates in the brahmayajna, a philosophic debate organized by King Janaka of Videha and challenges the sage Yajnavalkya with perplexing questions {{on the issue of}} atman (soul). She is also said to have written many hymns in the Rigveda. She remained a celibate all her life and was held in veneration by the conventional Hindus.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E

5|$|On November 22, Kemp came {{in second}} to Ryan Braun in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award. Later, it was {{revealed}} that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted to suspend him, but lost on appeal. A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken, <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> Braun's positive test, then Kemp would have won. Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal. Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season.|$|E
5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. <b>With</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E

Some individuals <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> his {{sexuality}} {{becoming more}} common beginning in the 1970s, some film historians and gay studies scholars have detected homosexual themes in Whale's work, particularly in Bride of Frankenstein in which {{a number of the}} creative people associated with the cast, including Ernest Thesiger and Colin Clive, were alleged to be gay or bisexual. Scholars have identified a gay sensibility suffused through the film, especially a camp sensibility, particularly embodied in the character of Pretorius (Thesiger) and his relationship with Henry Frankenstein (Clive).|$|E
5|$|Anarky is {{a fictional}} character, {{appearing}} in comic books published by DC Comics. Co-created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle, he {{first appeared in}} Detective Comics No. 608 (November 1989), as an adversary of Batman. Introduced as Lonnie Machin, a child prodigy <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> radical philosophy and driven to overthrow governments to improve social conditions, stories revolving around Anarky often focus on political and philosophical themes. The character, who is named after the philosophy of anarchism, primarily espouses anti-statism; however, multiple social issues have been addressed through the character, including environmentalism, antimilitarism, economic inequality, and political corruption. Inspired by multiple sources, early stories featuring the character often included homages to political and philosophical books, and referenced anarchist philosophers and theorists. The inspiration {{for the creation of}} the character and its early development was based in Grant's personal interest in anti-authoritarian philosophy and politics. However, when Grant himself transitioned to the philosophy of Neo-Tech, developed by Frank R. Wallace, he shifted the focus of Anarky from a vehicle for socialist and populist philosophy, to rationalist, atheist, and free market thinking.|$|E
5|$|As {{the company}} expanded, it {{was subject to}} several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use {{as a case study}} in American law schools, {{one of the most prominent}} incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{finds out}} that Selma might have {{disappeared}} {{to get away from}} her husband. Veronica shows Wallace the Roman numerals, and they deduce that it is a date, and Veronica learns that a sorority house member died on that day. Veronica confronts a sorority girl about the dead member, and she implies that others believe that something happened to her. After finding out that leaving her husband after ten years would be beneficial to Selma, Veronica and Keith break into the Roses’ house and find Selma on the couch. Selma tells the pair why she has “disappeared”: Mr. Rose is trying to scam her for more money and has blackmailed her <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> a lesbian affair with her dog walker.|$|E
5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book The Sirius Mystery, credits them <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. This {{has been the subject of}} controversy and speculation.|$|E
5|$|The desert nomads {{were also}} traders. The Sahara {{is a very}} large expanse of land {{stretching}} from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. Trade routes were developed linking the Sahel in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards. Berbers <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> the region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells. Several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the Sahara between the 8th and 18th centuries. Traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles, shipping and air freight, but caravans still travel along routes between Agadez and Bilma and between Timbuktu and Taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge communities.|$|E
