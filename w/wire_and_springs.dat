40|$|AbstractIn this work, a {{model to}} {{simulate}} the superelastic response for shape memory alloy <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> <b>springs</b> subjected to torsional loading is constructed by combining thermodynamics principles along with preisach models. Following Doraiswamy et al. (2011), a Gibbs potential based formulation is employed to separate the thermoelastic response of the shape memory alloys from its dissipative response. The dissipative part is then modeled with a discrete Preisach approach. Rather than beginning with a full three dimensional model and solving for non-homogeneous shear stresses across the specimen cross-section, a “strength of materials” approach that can directly model the torsional response using experimentally measurable quantities such as torque and angle of twist is developed. The model results are verified with experiments performed on shape memory alloy springs at three different temperatures. The model {{is also used to}} predict torsion response of shape memory alloy wires at different twists and temperatures using experimental results for only one twist or temperature case respectively. The torsional response for three different wire diameters were predicted using experimental data for one diameter case...|$|R

40|$|An {{external}} pipe-crawling device {{presented in}} this paper aids the inspection of pipes in hazardous environments and areas inaccessible to humans. The principal component of our design, which uses inchworm type motion, is a compliant ring mechanism actuated using shape memory alloy (SMA) wire. It was fabricated and tested and was reported in our earlier work. But this device had a drawback of low crawling speed (about 1 mm/min) owing to the delay in heating and cooling of the SMA strips in the linear actuation. Additionally, that design also had the difficulties of mounting on pipes with closed ends, large radial span, and the need for housing for electrical insulation and guiding of the SMA wire. In this paper we present a compact design that overcomes the difficulties of the earlier design. In particular, we present a compact compliant mechanism with two halves so as to enable mounting and un-mounting on any closed or open pipe. Another feature is the presence of insulation and guiding of the SMA wire without housing. This design results in a reduction of the radial span of the ring from 22 mm to 12 mm, and the stiffness of the mechanism <b>and</b> the SMA <b>wire</b> are matched. An SMA helical spring is to used in the place of an SMA strip to increase the crawling speed of the device.

We first give a short review of the physical approach and the basic solution principle. Then, we give a more detailed description of some key aspects: We introduce a novel approach concerning dynamics based on an algorithm very similar to the one used for (quasi-) static computation. Then, we look at the plastic workpiece deformation, involving a modified computation algorithm and a special representation of the workpiece shape. Then, we give alternative solutions for two key aspects of the algorithm, and investigate the problem of performing the workpiece simulation efficiently, i. e., with desired precision in a short time. In the end, we introduce the inverse modeling problem which must be solved when the gripper trajectory for a given task shall be generated. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{wearable}} sensing glove {{for measuring}} {{the motion of the}} fingers is proposed. The system consists of linear potentiometers, flexible <b>wires,</b> <b>and</b> linear <b>springs,</b> which makes it compact and lightweight so that it does not interfere with the natural motion of the fingers. Inspired by the way wrinkles on finger joints are smoothed out when the finger is flexed, a flexible wire is attached to the back of each finger. As the flexible wire moves due to the motion of the finger, the joint angles are calculated by measuring the change in length of wire. Linear potentiometers with linear springs were used to maintain the tension of the wires in order to measure the wire length change consistently. Because the motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is dependent on that of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, only two linear potentiometers were used for each finger. A compact sensing module including 10 linear potentiometers <b>and</b> <b>springs</b> was attached to a glove. The proposed system can widely be applied for the systems, which require to measure finger motions accurately, e. g., virtual reality or teleoperation systems.

Starting from the homogenization theory of periodic slender domains and taking benefit of the property of helical symmetry, the overall elastic behavior can be obtained from the solution of three-dimensional problems posed on a reduced basic cell. The mechanical analysis of this reduced basic cell performed using a concise FE model allows therefore to compute easily the anisotropic beam homogenized stiffness coefficients. The accuracy and usefulness of this approach is demonstrated by comparisons with reference solutions and large FE model results for two numerical volume structure examples: a <b>wire</b> <b>spring</b> <b>and</b> a stranded “ 6 + 1 ” rope.

The objective of this study is the optimal design of helical spring based on dynamic criteria. The most important dynamic performance criterion of a helical spring is the resonance behavior, including dynamic stress, coil closing, and surge. In order to perform computer aided optimization, the construction of an accurate dynamic model is necessary. The more variables are considered as design variables, the more flexible and better designs are possible. More design variables are also making the description of dynamics more complex. In this study, predictive dynamic models for variable pitch angle, variable <b>wire</b> diameter, <b>and</b> variable <b>spring</b> radius are derived by fundamental mathematics and mechanics principles.

40|$|Background. Any {{decrease}} in friction between orthodontic <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket can accelerate tooth {{movement in the}} sliding technique and result in better control of anchorage. This study was carried out to evaluate frictional forces by coating orthodontic <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> porcelain brackets with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO). Methods. In this in vitro study, we evaluated a combination of 120 samples of 0. 019 × 0. 025 stainless steel (SS) orthodontic <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> 22 mil system edgewise porcelain brackets with and without spherical zinc oxide nanoparticles. Spherical ZnO nanoparticles were deposited on <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> brackets by immersing them in ethanol solution and SEM (scanning electron microscope) evaluation confirmed {{the presence of the}} ZnO coating. The frictional forces were calculated between the <b>wires</b> <b>and</b> brackets in four groups: group ZZ (coated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket), group OO (uncoated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> bracket), group ZO (coated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> uncoated bracket) and group OZ (uncoated <b>wire</b> <b>and</b> coated bracket). Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used for data analysis. Results. The frictional force in ZZ (3. 07 ± 0. 4 N) was the highest (P < 0. 05), and OZ (2. 18 ± 0. 5 N) had the lowest amount of friction (P < 0. 05) among the groups.
