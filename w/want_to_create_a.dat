25|$|The project Todo Mejora ("Everything Gets Better") was {{launched}} on March 20, 2012 in Chile. In August 2011 the activist Júlio Cezar Dantas raised {{the idea of}} creating a Spanish version of the original site along with the U.S. coordinators of It Gets Better. They identified and contacted the Chilean organization Fundación Iguales ("Equal Foundation") to support the initiative. The organization agreed to work, and make an alliance, with Proyecto Todo Mejora ("Everything Gets Better Project"). The Chilean project also aims to support, together with the coordinators of It Gets Better U.S., other countries in Latin America who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> Todo Mejora project in their nations.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} as a World Heritage Site {{creates an}} additional level of oversight by the State who {{must ensure that}} any changes along the canal and its structures {{is compatible with the}} strategic issues of UNESCO. However, a report of the General Inspectorate of Architecture and Heritage in 2003 showed that the channel was in very poor condition with many works and infrastructure devaluing its surroundings and suffering from significant housing pressure evidenced by uncontrolled construction, poorly designed facilities that misrepresent the site, and the construction of marinas in the ports on the canal. Nevertheless, to respect the uniformity of the canal development and support efforts for improvement, the Canal du Midi remains under the management of VNF under the tutelage of the State who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> monitoring mission like the Loire and Mont-Saint-Michel.|$|E
25|$|Long {{before the}} {{election}} of President Obama, Associate Justice David H. Souter had {{expressed a desire to}} leave Washington, D.C., and return to his native New Hampshire. The election of a Democratic president in 2008 made Souter more inclined to retire, but he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> situation in which there would be multiple vacancies at once. Souter apparently became satisfied that no other justices planned to retire {{at the end of the}} Supreme Court's term in June 2009. As a result, in mid-April 2009 he privately notified the White House of his intent to retire from the Supreme Court at the conclusion of its business for that term. Souter submitted a resignation letter to Obama on May 1, who later that day made an unscheduled appearance during the daily White House press briefing to publicly announce Souter's retirement.|$|E

In addition, Rock Kills Kid, The Pink Spiders, The Receiving End of Sirens, Envy on the Coast, Men, Women & Children, and Street Drum Corps joined the tour for select dates. Leto stated, [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> festival atmosphere. We plan on bringing {{an element of}} excitement and chaos and escape.

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the series, he was not sure whether it would be a detective manga or a romantic one. Although he does not like detective stories, Matsui {{nevertheless}} chose to write one because it was a genre that was not covered in the magazine that time. However, Matsui considers Neuro the antithesis to [...] "orthodox detective manga" [...] like Case Closed or Kindaichi Case Files because of Neuro's supernatural powers. Furthermore, he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> detective's reasoning manga because he does not like to read or draw it. He said that reasoning scenes are superfluous, so he placed some jokes in these scenes.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{dialogue}} {{system was}} inspired by Shin Megami Tensei (1992), particularly the gameplay mechanic whereby players can talk to monsters to avoid conflict. Fox intended to expand upon this mechanic, as failing to negotiate resulted in a requirement to fight. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> system that satisfied my urge for talking to monsters," [...] he said. When he began developing this mechanic, the concept of completing the game without killing any enemies [...] "just evolved naturally". However, he never considered removing the option to fight throughout development. When questioned on the difficulty of playing the game without killing, Fox responded that it is [...] "the crux {{of one of the}} major themes of this game", asking players to think about it themselves.|$|E
500|$|Ten main {{cast members}} {{are listed in}} the first series. Matthew Macfadyen plays primary protagonist and senior case officer Tom Quinn. Creator David Wolstencroft found Tom to be the most fun, yet hardest {{character}} to write for due to him being the main character. When portraying the character, Macfadyen did what he was told to do; he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> backstory for the character as he did not find merit in doing so. Keeley Hawes plays junior case officer Zoe Reynolds. Hawes was attracted to the parallels between acting and spying. The actress described Zoe as [...] "a feisty little number. She can be quite cold and you don't really know her," [...] and the series sees [...] "flashes of how she can be". David Oyelowo plays fellow junior case officer Danny Hunter. Oyelowo first became aware of the show when his agent brought him the script, and was quickly intrigued by the project, and wanted a part to play in it. He downplayed his enthusiasm to get the part. Macfadyen, Hawes and Oyelowo were initially wary of playing the lead characters even though the actors were in their mid-twenties, but eventually felt that they earned the right to be in the series.|$|E

500|$|Sixty {{tracks of}} the {{original}} Final Fantasy X soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu, Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were rearranged. Hamauzu and Nakano took charge {{of most of the}} revised music, with Tsutomu Narita and Ryo Yamazaki also making select arrangements. The soundtrack for Final Fantasy X-2 by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi was carried over from the original PlayStation 2 version. For the credits of the HD remaster, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will as an appendix taking place two years after X-2. Nojima and Nomura felt {{that it was a good}} opportunity to expand upon the universe of X. They opted for the audio drama format as the team did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> solid visual impression, instead intending to leave it up to interpretation. The team wanted the audio drama to be the [...] "direct opposite" [...] to the upbeat feel and happy ending of X-2. This wish for a more melancholy atmosphere resulted in them bringing Sin, the main antagonistic force in X, back into the story, as the team wanted to keep it involved in a similar fashion to Sephiroth, the main antagonist of Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. The drama's open ending was also intentional, as Kitase [...] "wanted to leave something up to the player's imagination." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{colors are}} red, black and white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The {{shoulders}} are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the 1992–93 season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as [...] "Christmas colors." [...] The Devils have yet to introduce a third jersey and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, [...] "I don't believe in it", Lamoriello said. [...] "I strongly believe {{that you have to have}} one identity as a team. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and that it means something special to wear one." [...] Unlike most teams, the Devils kept the same uniform design when the NHL switched to the [...] jerseys by Reebok for the 2007–08 season.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scenes in}} Inside Man {{required}} multiple-camera setups, {{which meant that}} Libatique had to instruct and work with multiple camera operators. Lee {{wanted to create a}} visual distinction between the characters Russell (Owen) and Frazier (Washington), while incorporating visual metaphors. Russell's scenes, in which he masterminds the bank heist, were shot with a Steadicam to suggest that the character is in control. Frazier's scenes, in which he is tasked with handling the hostage situation, were filmed with multiple hand-held cameras to display the character's confusion. Libatique explained, [...] "I said, 'We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> sense of control and largely centered frames with Clive’s character, and we want to have movement with Denzel’s.' Having three operators on the same character, I’d watch all three. In a handheld shot, a long lens has a little bit of movement and a wider lens is inherently smoother. I would actually talk to the operator and tell him not to be so steady. It was the first time I’d worked with so many operators where I wasn’t one myself." [...] Telephone conversations between Russell and Frazier were shot using two cameras simultaneously filming the actors performing on two different sets of a soundstage at Steiner Studios. [...] Steadicam operator Stephen Consentino estimated that 80% of the film was shot with hand-held cameras or a Steadicam. A total of seven cameras were used to film the scene where the hostages are finally released. A Technocrane was used for a crane shot that would cover the following moment, in which the hostages are placed in buses.|$|E
