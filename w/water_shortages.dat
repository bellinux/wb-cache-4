5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period. Despite this, {{the gross domestic}} product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> Due to the heavy damage, the name Mitch was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.|$|E
40|$|In {{this letter}} we analyse the {{temporal}} development of physical population-driven water scarcity, i. e. <b>water</b> <b>shortage,</b> {{over the period}} 0 AD to 2005 AD. This was done using population data derived from the HYDE dataset, and water resource availability based on the WaterGAP model results for the period 1961 - 90. Changes in historical water resources availability were simulated with the STREAM model, forced by climate output data of the ECBilt-CLIO-VECODE climate model. The water crowding index, i. e. Falkenmark water stress indicator, was used to identify <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> in 284 sub-basins. Although our results show a few areas with moderate <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> (1000 - 1700 m 3 /capita/yr) around the year 1800, <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> began in earnest at around 1900, when 2 % of the world population was under chronic <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> (1000 m 3 /capita/yr). By 1960, this percentage had risen to 9 %. From then on, {{the number of people}} under <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> increased rapidly to the year 2005, by which time 35 % of the world population lived in areas with chronic <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b> In this study, the effects of changes in population on <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> are roughly four times more important than changes in water availability as a result of long-term climatic change. Global trends in adaptation measures to cope with reduced water resources per capita, such as irrigated area, reservoir storage, groundwater abstraction, and global trade of agricultural products, closely follow the recent increase in global <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b> © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|R
30|$|Additionally, for any {{specific}} TDP, {{the probability of}} the shortage ratio being higher than 0 {{is defined as the}} risk of irrigation <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> in this study. With this definition, we could then assess the risks of irrigation <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> for IMD- 2 under the current situation and with implementation of the mitigation measure. Such assessments can be conducted with regard to individual TDPs. Taking the 6 th TDP as an example, the probability of experiencing irrigation <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> (shortage ratio > 0) in IMD- 2 is 0.83 and 0.58 for the current situation and the situation with proposed mitigation measure, respectively. The mitigation measure is able {{to reduce the risk of}} irrigation <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> in IMD- 2 for the 6 th TDP by 0.25. We can also consider the risk of more severe irrigation <b>water</b> <b>shortage.</b> For example, shortage ratio exceeding 0.3 is considered as severe <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> in the JID and may prompt reduced water supply. By implementing the proposed mitigation measure, the risk of severe <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> in IMD- 2 for the 6 th TDP can be reduced from 0.72 to 0.52. Thus, the proposed spatiotemporal simulation approach not only can take into account the spatial and temporal variations/co-variations of the multi-site streamflows but also facilitates probabilistic assessment of effectiveness of drought mitigation measures. As a final note, we like to emphasize that it is possible to comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation measures by considering the overall reduction in the risk of the severe <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> during the crop growth period.|$|R

In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and <b>water</b> <b>shortages,</b> significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs. In addition, river flooding resulted in the closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.|$|E

Between 1940 and 1965, 6million people moved to south Florida: 1,000people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> in times of drought.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alma {{was a rare}} June major {{hurricane}} in the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season. It was {{the earliest}} Atlantic hurricane in the calendar year in fifteen years, {{as well as the}} earliest continental U.S. hurricane strike since 1825. Alma developed on June4 over Central America, and while moving through Honduras, it dropped heavy rainfall that killed at least 73people in the city of San Rafael. Offshore northern Honduras, the system produced heavy rainfall in Swan Island. Alma moved northeastward and intensified into a hurricane on June6. It crossed western Cuba, causing heavy crop damage and <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> Alma destroyed over 1,000houses, and damage was estimated around $200million (1966USD). The storm killed 12people in the country.|$|E
40|$|Water {{resources}} are precious but limited natural possessions and significant to people’s livings. If the water resources {{could not be}} allocated well, the related problems will grow. The <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> problems are not only related to rainfall, geographic landform, climate, populations, and economic activities, but also allocation, supply, and management of water resources. Hence, <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> has become an important issue in our country. This study aims to discuss the factors of <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> from the viewpoints of political-economics, nature, and management. Natural factors cover special geographic structure, geological structure, and climate change. Management factors include sediment deposit, water turbidity, soil conservation, water nutrition, pipeline leaking, water pollution, water waste, and water organizations. From the management perspective, the importance of <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> factors is assessed to understanding the critical factors. The analytic hierarchy process {{was used to evaluate}} the <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> factors to promote the rationalization of strategy formulation. The results show that higher important facts are water waste, soil conservation, and pipeline leaking...|$|R
40|$|Production {{benefits}} of improved allocation of irrigation water are {{often difficult to}} measure. In situations of irrigated rice cultivation, both ex post estimates of such benefits and ex ante estimates of the maximum potential {{benefits of}} further improvements in allocation of a given water supply are possible using a conceptual framework which (1) functionally relates weekly water supplies to weekly measures of average <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> on individual paddy fields; (2) aggregates the weekly <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> measures into a seasonal <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> index; and (3) relates, via a production function, the seasonal <b>water</b> <b>shortage</b> index to yields.

Instead, mine accounts invariably show them being paid a fixed daily rate and employed only as and when they were needed. When poor weather conditions made surface-level work impossible, <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> meant water-powered machinery could not operate, or accidents in the mines caused a temporary closure, the bal maidens would be suspended.|$|E
5|$|The {{brunt of}} the {{tropical}} cyclone's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal. A total of 6,240people were killed {{as a result of}} the storm, with 5,708in Bangladesh and 538in West Bengal. Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region. Along the coast of Bangladesh, strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70% of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops, with an estimated 200,000tonnes (220,000tons) of crops being lost. Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh; in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital city, debris-laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b>|$|E
5|$|By day six, 22 September, {{the battle}} {{had settled into}} a routine of mortaring and small probing attacks at times {{supported}} by armoured vehicles and sniper fire. The Poles, dug in south of the river, relieved part of {{the pressure on the}} division, as some German forces were diverted to confront them. The following day began in a similar way to previous days with a mortar and artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and armour trying to find a gap in the perimeter. The KOSB, Glider Pilots and the 21st Independent Company who were all defending the brigade area were repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, food and <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> also took their toll on the men, with foraging parties subjected to sniper fire. On day eight, 24 September, although German attacks continued, the enemy were engaged by artillery of the XXX Corps south of the river and aircraft from the Royal Air Force.

Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month.

5|$|For 10days, Myanmar's {{government}} did not report about the cyclone, which usually under-reports on storms that affect the country. There was also little to no advanced warning of the storm. The storm destroyed over 2,650homes and severely damaged another 1,385, leaving around 25,000people homeless, mostly in Pauktaw. Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged, including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations. About 300schools were damaged or destroyed, including 44 in Sittwe. The storm also damaged or destroyed 133religious buildings and 176government buildings. Across the region, high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply. About 2,000cattle were killed, and many rice mills were knocked down, causing a 70% increase of food prices. Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away, which contributed to food shortages, while damaged wells caused <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> During the storm, 84ships were lost at sea, {{in addition to a}} lost ocean liner, while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged, along with several fishing piers.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the monsoon {{as a source of}} water.

This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal famine of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 famine, in which over five million people died; the 1899 famine, in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal famine of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E

5|$|The nuckelavee's {{breath was}} thought to wilt crops and sicken livestock, and it was {{considered}} responsible for epidemics and drought. Seaweed burning to create what was known {{at the time as}} kelp began on Stronsay in 1722. The product– soda ash– was an alkali mainly used to treat acidic soil, although as time went on its commercial importance in soap and glass manufacture increased. The pungent smoke emitted during the process was believed to enrage the nuckelavee, resulting in a wild rampage of plague, the deaths of cattle and the destruction of crops. The nuckelavee was said to have infected horses on Stronsay with the deadly disease known as mortasheen, to demonstrate its fury and exact its revenge against the islanders for burning seaweed; the infection subsequently spread to all the other islands involved in the industry. The creature was also blamed for prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, leading to <b>water</b> <b>shortages</b> and poor harvests.|$|E
5|$|Alma caused {{significant}} {{crop damage}} in western Cuba; it destroyed 13,400acres (5,400hectares) of bananas and 18,090acres (7,320hectares) of corn fields. There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in <b>water</b> <b>shortages,</b> prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and supply shortages.|$|E

5|$|Workers in Cairns had {{restored}} {{power and}} water supplies {{within a few}} days of Joy's passage. After the initial flooding from Joy ended, there was additional rainfall in February1991 that caused flooding across the region. Residual flooding cost the coal industry about 60million due to loss of production and hindered exporting. While Rockhampton was still isolated by flooding, a helicopter airdropped food to hundreds of stranded families, after the town experienced food and <b>water</b> <b>shortages.</b> Transportation to Rockhampton was not normalised until 20January, when the airport and incoming roads were reopened. The city of Rockhampton later created a flood plain management policy {{as a result of the}} effects from Joy. The floods helped fill the drainage basin of the Peter Faust Dam within a few weeks, speeding up a process which would have otherwise taken several years. Months after the storm, the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service collected reports on environmental impacts from the flooding; they included some beneficial aspects such as new locations for animal breeding, and alleviation of drought conditions. The Queensland government upgraded a portion of the Bruce Highway near Rockhampton to reduce flooding in similar storms.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding.

To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes.
