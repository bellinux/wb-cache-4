5|$|The Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship was defended at Survivor Series {{as part of}} {{a working}} {{agreement}} between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW) owner Jim Cornette. The Rock 'n' Roll Express, who held the belts going into the event, had been feuding with The Heavenly Bodies over the title for over a year. The rivalry had been violent at times, including a barbed <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> match and a Texas deathmatch.|$|E
5|$|Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club {{member who}} bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, {{expanding}} the facilities {{to include a}} small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped with a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> resembling a lighthouse lantern, {{and the end of}} a jetty {{on the north side of}} the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
5000|$|When {{applied to}} the fusor Lawson's {{analysis}} is used as an argument that conduction and radiation losses are the key impediment to reaching net power. Fusors use a voltage drop to accelerate and collide ions, resulting in fusion. [...] The voltage drop is generated by <b>wire</b> <b>cages,</b> and these cages conduct away particles. Polywell are improvements on this design, designed to reduce conduction losses by removing the <b>wire</b> <b>cages</b> which cause them. [...] Regardless, {{it is argued that}} radiation is still a major impediment.|$|R

25|$|In fusors, the {{potential}} well {{is made with}} a <b>wire</b> <b>cage.</b> Because most of the ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high conduction losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even.|$|E
25|$|The polywell {{attempts}} to confine the ions and electrons through two different means, borrowed from fusors and magnetic mirrors. The electrons {{are easier to}} confine magnetically because they have so much less mass than the ions. The machine confines ions using an electric field {{in the same way}} a fusor confines the ions: in the polywell, the ions are attracted to the negative electron cloud in the center. In the fusor, they are attracted to a negative <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> in the center.|$|E
25|$|Like people, fancy mice {{can become}} obese if they overeat {{and do not}} get enough {{physical}} activity. This can lead to them developing life-threatening cardiovascular disorders and diabetes as well as arthritis. Activity aids such as tubes and wheels are great for ensuring mice get enough exercise, as well as mental stimulation. Mice also love to climb, and a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> with horizontal bars is perfect for this. A mouse set loose for exercise should be carefully observed, as they tend to scurry into a hiding spot and {{can be difficult to}} retrieve.|$|E
50|$|Wire-top cages {{typically}} are designed {{in such a}} way that there is some option for the hamster to climb on some of the <b>wire.</b> Plastic <b>cages</b> do not have bars on which the hamster can climb, but can be expanded with plastic tubes for climbing. <b>Wire</b> <b>cages</b> can expose a hamster to drafts, and additionally, some <b>wire</b> <b>cages</b> permit the hamster to throw bedding material through the wires as it burrows, digs, and plays. Pens with solid walls contain all the bedding, and additionally, prevent drafts of air from disturbing the hamster. Syrian hamsters are larger than Chinese and dwarf hamsters, so they need a larger pen and hamster accessories than those smaller hamsters. Hamster tubes come in two sizes also - smaller ones suit dwarf and Chinese hamsters of any age, while larger tubes are comfortable for Syrian hamster adults but too big for small hamsters to use.|$|R

2500|$|Fixed spool reels {{are cast}} by opening the bail, {{grasping}} {{the line with}} the forefinger, and then using a backward snap of the rod followed by a forward cast while releasing the line with the forefinger at the same time. [...] The forefinger is then placed {{in contact with the}} departing line and {{the leading edge of the}} spool in order to slow or stop the outward cast. [...] On the retrieve, the left hand normally operates the crank handle, while the large rotating <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> or bail (either manually or trigger-operated) serves as the line pickup, restoring the line to its original position on the spool.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proscenium}} arch housed a [...] drop curtain. The arch itself was not {{integral to the}} theatre but was constructed with a lightweight, plastered curtain wall made of wood. The drama was entirely lit with gaslight controlled by a man at a gas table, who could light a lamp through an electric spark and vary {{the intensity of the}} light through gas flow. Arrayed {{on the side of the}} {{proscenium arch}} were gas-lit border lamps, equipped with tin reflectors that cast light backstage and onto the borders. Each border lamp was in a <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> intended to keep the canvas borders at least a foot (...) away from the gas lamps within. Personnel were forbidden to ignite gaslights with matches or smoke anywhere on the stage.|$|E
2500|$|Auburn's first real, live-eagle mascot, War Eagle II, was {{mentioned}} in the New York Times, which noted then that [...] "War Eagle" [...] was already established as Auburn's battle cry. In November 1930 a golden eagle swooped down on a flock of turkeys in Bee Hive, Alabama, southwest of Auburn, Alabama, and became entangled in a mass of pea vines. Fourteen individuals and businesses scraped together $10 and purchased the eagle from the farmer who owned the pea patch. Cheerleaders DeWit Stier and Harry [...] "Happy" [...] Davis (who later became executive secretary of the Alumni Association) helped care for the new bird. It was put in a strong <b>wire</b> <b>cage</b> and taken to the Auburn football game against the University of South Carolina in Columbus, Georgia on Thanksgiving Day.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{electrostatic}} confinement fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the Fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode <b>wire</b> <b>cage.</b> Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric {{field in the}} process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss {{in the form of}} light radiation. Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a [...] a penning trap and the polywell. The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-2004, Big Show was {{reinstated}} by new General Manager Theodore Long, as he interfered {{during a}} Lumberjack match between Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle. Big Show {{had a choice}} to face either Guerrero or Angle at No Mercy, choosing to fight Angle, turning him face. Big Show defeated Angle at the event. In the weeks before the match, {{he claimed to have}} [...] "lost his dignity" [...] when Angle tranquilized {{him in the middle of}} the ring using a dart gun and shaved his head.

2500|$|Through {{the early}} 1970s, as its ratings grew and its meagre budget was increased, Hey Hey {{evolved into a}} {{freewheeling}} live light entertainment / comedy variety program. Regular segments included [...] "What Cheeses Me Off" [...] (which aired viewer complaints on virtually any subject), [...] "Media Watch Press" [...] (to which viewers contributed humorous newspaper misprints, almost invariably smutty), [...] "Red Faces" [...] (a New Faces–Gong Show-style talent competition) [...] and [...] "Chook Lotto", a parody of variety show barrel competitions, in which the numbers in a farcical lotto game were chosen using numbered frozen chickens spun in a large <b>wire</b> <b>cage.</b> The team also performed live revue-style send-ups of current TV shows such as The Sullivans, or chaotic parodies of soap operas, police shows and other popular TV genres. Like Kennedy's, the humour was of the wink-wink, nudge-nudge variety—viewers became accustomed to Blackman's voice-over snigger—and the satire was broad and skit-level, rather than sharp and disturbing. The show aimed to please its lower-middle-class demographic and succeeded well.|$|E

2500|$|The Thought Police capture Winston {{along with}} Julia in their rented room. The two are then {{delivered}} to the Ministry of Love (Miniluv) for interrogation. Mr. Charrington, the shopkeeper who rented the room to them, reveals himself as a Thought Police agent. O'Brien is also {{an agent of the}} Thought Police. He is part of a special sting operation used by the police to find and arrest suspected thoughtcriminals. Winston is placed in a prison cell with Parsons, who had been reported by his children and believes himself to be guilty. O'Brien interrogates and tortures Winston with electroshock, telling Winston that he can [...] "cure" [...] himself of his [...] "insanity"—his manifest hatred for the Party—through controlled manipulation of perception. Winston is held in the prison for an unspecified length of time, and confesses to crimes that O'Brien tells him to say that he has committed, but O'Brien understands that Winston has not betrayed Julia. After awakening from a nightmare in which he confesses his love for Julia, O'Brien sends him to Room 101 for the final stage of re-education, a room which contains each prisoner's worst fear.
