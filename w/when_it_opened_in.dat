5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum {{on the site of}} an abandoned coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to be the site of the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>opened</b> <b>in</b> 2012.|$|E

A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in the Hat.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{a second}} Narrows Bridge were mooted during the 1970s, but did not eventuate. By 1998, the {{original}} bridge was carrying 155,000 vehicles per day, {{with an average of}} 2,700 cars per lane between 7:30am and 8:30am, and was thought to be the busiest section of freeway in the country. This quantity of traffic far outstripped the expected capacity of the bridge <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>opened</b> <b>in</b> 1959. The solution to the traffic problem most favoured by road planners in 1998 was to widen the existing bridge by building a smaller second traffic bridge just west from it and joining their decks to form a contiguous roadway. This would increase the number of traffic lanes from seven to 10. The widening was expected to cost $50 million.|$|E
5|$|State {{grants and}} a {{municipal}} guarantee were secured in 1980, with construction {{starting in the}} fall. The arena was built around the existing artificial rink.

Storhamar Ishall became the 11th indoor ice hockey rink in Norway <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>opened</b> <b>in</b> August 1981. The venue was to be partially financed through renting it out during the summer, including to an annual town fair. These ideas fell through and the municipality was forced to take over the venue.|$|E

5|$|The asylum was {{established}} by Edward Long Fox and considered {{state of the art}} <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>opened</b> <b>in</b> 1806, having been built on moral treatment ideas pioneered at the York Retreat, which had opened in 1796. Fox had an extensive private practice in Bristol and served as a physician at Bristol Infirmary before taking over a madhouse at Cleeve Hill in 1792. He had a range of different businesses locally and was able to pay £4,000 for the Brislington Estate. The site had previously been Brislington Common, which had been enclosed in 1780. The site, on the main road between Bristol and Bath, now the A4, enabled him to attract wealthy clients from both cities.|$|E
5|$|When the Glynneath bypass {{was built}} in the 1970s, the canal was culverted above Ysgwrfa lock, to allow the road to be straightened, and reduced in width beyond that, to allow the road to be widened.

This road was {{superseded}} by the A465 dual carriageway <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>opened</b> <b>in</b> 1996, and has become the B4242 road.
