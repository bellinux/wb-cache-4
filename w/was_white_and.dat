5|$|By 1 March, over {{two-thirds of}} BuzzFeed users polled responded that the dress <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> gold. Some people have {{suggested}} that the dress changes colours on its own. Media outlets noted that the photo was overexposed and had poor white balance, causing its colours to be washed out, giving rise to the perception by some that the dress is white and gold rather than its actual colours.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian {{from her own}} mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on other Native Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The mythological kelpie {{is usually}} {{described}} as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools of rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters, One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse, a trait also shared by the nykur of Iceland. An Aberdeenshire variation portrays the kelpie as a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> could entice victims onto its back by singing.|$|E

5|$|The coif was {{the main}} symbol of the Order of Serjeants-at-Law, and is where their most {{recognisable}} name (the Order of the Coif) comes from. The coif <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> made of either silk or lawn. A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his coif, {{not even in the}} presence of the King, except as a judge when passing a death sentence. In that situation he would wear a black cap intended to cover the Coif, although it is often confused with the coif itself. When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants, who were not allowed to cover the coif. Wigmakers got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig, representing the coif.|$|E

25|$|As an attorney, Jefferson {{represented}} {{people of}} color as well as whites. In 1770, he defended a young mulatto male slave in a freedom suit, {{on the grounds that}} his mother <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> freeborn. By the colony's law of partus sequitur ventrum, that the child took the status of the mother, the man should never have been enslaved. He lost the suit. In 1772, Jefferson represented George Manly, the son of a free woman of color, who sued for freedom after having been held as an indentured servant three years past the expiration of his term. (The Virginia colony at the time bound illegitimate mixed-race children of free women as indentured servants: until age 31 for males, with a shorter term for females.) Once freed, Manly worked for Jefferson at Monticello for wages.|$|E

25|$|Little else {{is known}} {{of the history of}} the {{structure}} from 1777 to 1836, although the vestry book records that George Washington resigned from the vestry in 1782, and that Rector Massey ceased his regular duties shortly thereafter due to ill health. Furthermore, Washington is known to have stopped attending regular services at Pohick by this time, having instead shifted his attention to Christ Church in Alexandria as his preferred house of worship; even so, he kept up payments on his pew at the church, and purchased that of his cousin Lund as well. In 1801 John Davis wrote a surviving account of a service at Pohick Church; it indicates that at the time of his visit approximately half the congregation <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> half black. Davis also attended a number of services preached by Weems, and found them well-attended.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1915, she was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and spent the following two years in sanatoria, where she decided to become a writer. It was discovered during that time, however, that she had bronchitis, not TB. In 1917, she began writing for the Fort Worth Critic, critiquing dramas and writing society gossip. In 1918, she wrote for the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, Colorado. In the same year, Katherine almost died in Denver during the 1918 flu pandemic. When she was discharged from the hospital months later, she was frail and completely bald. When her hair finally grew back, it <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> remained that color {{for the rest of her}} life. Her experience was reflected in her trilogy of short novels, Pale Horse, Pale Rider (1939), for which she received the first annual gold medal for literature in 1940 from the Society of Libraries of New York University.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1985, {{another victim}} was found near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on interstate 75. Although her murder {{occurred}} three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, {{she was already}} in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely {{between the ages of}} 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt and jeans. The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when murdered by an undisclosed method. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.|$|E

25|$|PIA {{launched}} its new livery in early April 2010. An Airbus A310, Boeing 777–200 and Boeing 747–300 {{were the first}} aircraft to wear the new look. The livery was unveiled at the PIA headquarters on a Boeing 777 model. The livery consisted of a green and gold strip running around {{the bottom of the}} fuselage and continuing right up until the tail cone. The forward/upper portion <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> at the rear, it was an off white/beige color. The bottom part of the tail blended into the upper fuselage as it too is white, {{with the rest of the}} tail painted with a large wavy Pakistan flag, which takes up the whole tail, in a dark green color. At the front of the fuselage 'PIA' was written in a billboard style in dark green and underneath 'Pakistan' was written in golden color. Just behind the cockpit there is a stylized Urdu PIA logo as well as on the engines.|$|E
25|$|When P. exigua catch prey, {{they return}} to the nest with a solid, usually glossy mass, held in their mouthparts. If the size of prey is {{relatively}} large, the wasp may hold the crop with its anterior legs. Wasps were reported to share this food with other adults and offer the protein in a macerated form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel to substrate sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This new layer remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 a {{dissertation}} {{compared the}} results of a survey of 231 OA members in the Washington, DC area of North America undertaken in 2001 with the findings from surveys of OA members taken in 1981, twenty years previously. The 2001 survey showed that 84% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 15% as bulimic, and 1% as anorexic. The 1981 survey had found that 44.5% of OA members identified as binge eaters, 40.7% as bulimic, and 14.8% as anorexic. The survey also found an increase in the percentage of males in OA from 9% in 1981 to 16% in 2001. Both figures are generally in line with estimates made by the American Psychological Association that the male to female ratio of those with eating disorders ranges from 1:6 to 1:10. The researcher stated that the typical OA member in Washington <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> highly educated. The typical OA member surveyed in 2001 worked in a full-time capacity and homemakers only comprised 6% of the 2001 OA population, in contrast to 30% of those surveyed in 1981. This reflects the trend for increasing numbers of females to be employed outside of the home. Further, 80% of the 2001 participants had attained a college degree, compared to 59% of those surveyed in 1981. The percentage of OA members who were divorced or separated had risen from 10% in 1981 to 21% in 2001, also reflecting trends amongst the general population.|$|E

500|$|Despite these findings, {{baseball}} historians still credit Walker {{with being}} {{the first in the}} major leagues to play openly as a black man. On the subject of White, John R. Husman wrote: [...] "He played baseball and lived his life as a white man. If White, who was also of white blood, said he <b>was</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> he was not challenged, he was white in his time and circumstances". To clear up the confusion between Walker and Robinson, Husman also pointed out that, while the two ball players endured their own trials with racism in baseball, Walker undoubtedly preceded Robinson in the major leagues.|$|E

He had a thin, tapering snout, a long thin tail, and rather thin, but powerful legs, with a lank body, – the hair short and smooth." [...] wrote Jukes. [...] "These are the most abundant dogs in the country...They are no means handsome, but are generally more intelligent and useful than the others...I observed he once or twice put his foot in the water and paddled it about. This foot <b>was</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> Harvey said he did it to [...] "toil" [...] or entice the fish. The whole proceeding struck me as remarkable, more especially as they said he had never been taught anything of the kind." ...|$|E
