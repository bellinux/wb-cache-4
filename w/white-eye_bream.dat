50|$|<b>White-eye</b> <b>bream</b> (Ballerus sapa) is a {{fish species}} of the family Cyprinidae. It is {{widespread}} in many large rivers in Europe and Asia in drainages of the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, and Aral Sea. It was introduced to several rivers in northern Russia, in Rhine (in 1995) and invasive in Vistula drainage, coming from the Black Sea basin through the Dnieper-Bug Canal. Freshwater fish are up to 35 cm long.|$|E
50|$|For {{the fish}} {{species in the}} park, the {{periodic}} flooding of the Mureș River is a blessing; this process provides new spawning grounds, as well as generating new food and protection. The ichthyofauna in the park has a rich diversity and contains more fish species than any other section of the Mureș River. It is only in {{this section of the}} Mureș River that some species exist: <b>white-eye</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis sapa), zarte (Vimba vimba), crucian carp (Carassius carassius), brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus), striped ruffe (Gymnocephalus schraetser), zingel (Zingel zingel).|$|E
40|$|The lower Morava and Dyje rivers belong {{among the}} large lowland rivers on the {{southeast}} of the Czech Republic flowing into the Danube 69 km downstream of their confluence. Despite their high nature value and environment protection, both rivers suffered from heavy pollution from the sixties to the eighties of the last century. Significant improvement of their water quality {{during the last two}} decades resulted in the partial recovery of former assemblages of both benthic macroinvertebrates and fish. Recently, altogether 262 and 137 taxa of macrozoobenthos were recorded at the Dyje and Morava rivers, respectively. In the River Dyje, 3 and 21 non-native and threatened (according to IUCN categories) invertebrate species, respectively, were ascertained, whilst in the River Morava their numbers were 2 and 10, respectively. The fish assemblage consisted of 23 and 24 species, respectively, plus one hybrid in each of the rivers, bleak being by far the most abundant fish. In the sections under study, several rare and/or protected species were also recorded. Two of them, ide (Leuciscus idus) and burbot (Lota lota) belong among vulnerable fish species and four others, <b>white-eye</b> <b>bream</b> (Abramis sapa), striped ruffe (Gymnocephalus schraetser), streber (Zingel streber) and zingel (Zingel zingel), are considered as critically endangered species. Currently, both lower stretches of the rivers Morava and Dyje have been heavily invaded by round goby, Neogobius melanostomus...|$|E
40|$|The cyprinid genus Ballerus {{includes}} two species differing in skeletal characters (lateral line scale and gill raker counts) and feeding habits. The <b>white-eye</b> <b>bream</b> B. sapa is benthivorous and has lower numbers of lateral line scales and gill rakers than its sister species, the blue bream B. ballerus, which is planktivorous. The former species exhibits several times higher triiodothyronine (T 3) level in serum {{compared to the}} latter. Thyroid hormones (THs) control development of skeletal and non-skeletal structures in fish, thus the observed difference in T 3 level might contribute to morphological divergence of the two Ballerus species. We report the phenotypic and transcriptomic effects of experimental increase of thyroid level in B. ballerus during its early development. The numbers of scales and gill rakers appeared to be significantly decreased in TH-treated fish, approaching the limits of these characters in B. sapa. Illumina RNA-seq analysis demonstrated high number of differentially expressed genes between control and TH-treated B. ballerus in brain and liver (1212 genes at FDR < 2 %). Most of these genes encode proteins involved in energetic metabolism, transcription factors or binding proteins, and some morphogens. Many homeobox genes (up to 14) were also under effect of THs. We also detected 44 genes involved in lateral line development and 53 genes involved in gill arch and gill raker patterning. Some of detected genes are responsible for cell cycle and organ size (Hippo signaling pathway) being very promising for search of hormonal bases of developmental heterochronies. Our experiment shows that the divergence in pattern of TH secretion could result in evolutionary transformation of morphological characters involved in resource partitioning because the increased gill raker number in naturally TH-deficient B. ballerus is apparent adaptation to its planktivorous mode of feeding...|$|E
