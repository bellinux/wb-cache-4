5|$|After his {{translation}} to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to {{his brother}} Æthelmær, but retained the bishopric of <b>Winchester.</b> Canterbury and <b>Winchester</b> were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained <b>Winchester</b> out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury {{may not have been}} secure. Besides these, he held the abbey of Gloucester and the abbey of Ely and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of <b>Winchester</b> made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one benefice at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both <b>Winchester</b> and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.|$|E
5|$|By 1046 Stigand {{had begun}} to witness {{charters}} of Edward the Confessor, showing that he was once again in royal favour. In 1047 Stigand was translated to the see of <b>Winchester,</b> but he retained Elmham until 1052. He may have owed the preferment to Earl Godwin of Wessex, the father-in-law of King Edward, although that is disputed by some historians. Emma, who had retired to <b>Winchester</b> after regaining Edward's favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either alone or in concert with Godwin. After his appointment to <b>Winchester,</b> Stigand was a witness to all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052.|$|E

5|$|Route 37 {{was defined}} as the {{proposed}} <b>Winchester</b> By-Pass by 1963, and was included in the statewide Arterial Network when it was created in 1964. When I-81 opened past <b>Winchester</b> in November 1965, it included an interchange south of <b>Winchester,</b> taking traffic between I-81 and US 11 along a short connecting road. The north half of the bypass, from US 50 west of <b>Winchester</b> north and east to US 11 north of the city, opened in the late 1960s, and the semicircle was completed in the late 1970s, with the linking of Route 37 to the existing I-81/US 11 connection. A new bridge carrying southbound SR 37 over I-81 was built, but otherwise the diamond interchange was not modified. The only change to the major bypass since it was constructed has been a new trumpet interchange serving the <b>Winchester</b> Medical Center; construction began in September 2000 and was completed in November 2001. A single ramp from SR 37 north to Cives Lane, allowing traffic {{at the north end of}} the bypass to access US 11 south, was built in about 2000.|$|E

Henry called a legatine council, a church council convened by a papal legate, at <b>Winchester</b> to discuss the issue, which ended in nothing being done, although both sides threatened excommunication and stated they would appeal to Rome and the papacy for support.
