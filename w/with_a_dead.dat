5|$|The Paladin Collector's Edition, {{a limited}} {{edition of the}} game, has a {{remote-controlled}} plane, the graphic novel Splinter Cell Echoes, a Billionaire's Yacht co-op map, an Upper Echelon pack <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dead</b> Coast map, gold sonar goggles, and a limited-edition poster. Splinter Cell: Blacklist - Spider Bot, a 2D puzzle game tie-in, was released for Android and iOS platforms on June 10, 2013 and is available on Google Play and the App Store respectively. Homeland, downloadable content for the game, was released on September 26, 2013. It added a crossbow, several new costumes, and two new missions which can be completed alone or with another player.|$|E

5|$|Neverwinter Nights 2 is {{composed}} of three distinct acts. The game's first act begins {{in the village of}} West Harbor, where the player's character was raised as an orphan by the elven ranger Daeghun. After a festival, the town is attacked by a group, led by a githyanki, in search of an unnamed object. Afterward, the character is sent to retrieve a mysterious silver shard from a nearby cave, which was left there years earlier after the defeat of the King of Shadows. The character then sets out for Neverwinter, meeting other adventurers along the way, several of whom are available for recruitment. In Neverwinter, Daeghun's half-brother Duncan offers a more comprehensive explanation of the situation. In Neverwinter, Duncan instructs the party to speak with Aldanon, a sage who reveals the shard's connection <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> warlock and his descendant, a farmer named Shandra Jerro. However, the githyanki kidnap Shandra and the player character must rescue her. At the end of Act I, the party dispatches the githyanki, rescues Shandra, and learns of the origin of the shards.|$|E

40|$|The robust self-tuning {{regulator}} of a {{class of}} linear systems, which can be described by the input-output Auto-Regressive Moving Average with exogenous (ARMAX) mathematical model with unknown and time-varying parameters, at bounded external disturbances is developed. A scheme of polynomial approximation {{has been applied to}} approximate the unknown and time-varying parameters of systems. The modified recursive extended least squares RELS estimation algorithm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>dead</b> zone is proposed and applied to estimate the unknown and time-varying parameters intervening in the ARMAX mathematical model. The formulation of the explicit schemes of self-tuning regulation problem is resolved by using the minimum variance output or the generalized minimum variance output. The obtained control law, which is an optimal solution of minimizing a correspondent criterion, permit to reduce the effect of noise upon the output of system. An example of numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the explicit schemes of self-tuning regulator and presents the performances by using the modified recursive extended least squares estimation algorithm <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>dead</b> zone in <b>a</b> step of the parametric estimation of a linear time-varying systems. General terms Modified recursive extended least squares estimation algorithm RELS <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relative <b>dead</b> zone, explicit schemes of minimum variance self-tuning regulator, explicit schemes of generalized minimum variance self-tuning regulator.

This would seem to be taken in part from the 1891 report by the Canadian sealing schooner Maud S. According to the Auckland Star, the Glasgow story also repeated the first story about the ship being discovered in 1913 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> crew on board.|$|E

Hagen tells Dominic {{they need to get}} a senator on their side; Pat Geary (Chris Edgerly), who has a weakness for prostitutes, and frequents a local brothel. They set Geary up so he awakens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> prostitute, and Tom and Dominic promise him the girl will disappear, as long as he offers his friendship to the Corleones.

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 7 May 1917, near Douai, 11 British {{aircraft}} from No.56 Squadron led by Ball in an S.E.5 encountered German fighters from Jasta11. A running dogfight in deteriorating visibility resulted, and the aircraft became scattered. [...] Cecil Arthur Lewis, a participant in this fight, described it in his memoir Sagittarius Rising. Ball was last seen by fellow pilots pursuing the red Albatros D.III of the Red Baron's younger brother, Lothar von Richthofen, who eventually landed near Annœullin with a punctured fuel tank. Cyril Crowe observed Ball flying into a dark thundercloud.

500|$|Martin Stevens {{and colleagues}} in 2006 made what they {{believed}} was the first experimental test that [...] "disruptive coloration is effective even when some colour patches do not match the background and have a high contrast with both the background and adjacent pattern elements (disruptive contrast)". They used [...] "moth-like targets", some matching the lightness of the background oak tree bark, other mismatching it, each <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dead</b> mealworm. If the mealworm was removed it was assumed a bird predator had taken it: this could be distinguished from visits by other predators. They found that disruptive coloration provided the best protection from bird predators when the pattern was matched to background luminance, but even when elements in a pattern did not match, disruptive patterns were still better at reducing predation than either non-disruptive patterns or plain (unpatterned) control targets.|$|E
