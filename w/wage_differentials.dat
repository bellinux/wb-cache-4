25|$|The {{economic}} transformation also altered income structure. A noticeable shift was {{the reduction in}} <b>wage</b> <b>differentials.</b> The increased wealth produced by an advanced economy was distributed to wage earners via the system of broad income agreements that evolved in the postwar era. Organized {{sectors of the economy}} received wage hikes even greater than the economy's growth rate. As a result, blue-collar workers' income came, in time, to match more closely the pay of lower level white-collar employees, and the income of the upper middle class declined in relation to that of other groups.|$|E

The raw <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between public and private sector is positive across the entire distribution for both genders irrespective of area of residence.

25|$|Retention {{of nurses}} by sending (often developing) {{countries}} {{can be addressed}} by improving working conditions, minimizing <b>wage</b> <b>differentials,</b> and promoting medical tourism. Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, there is growing evidence that physicians in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities. The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP. Others have suggested programs which require domestic service or employment upon graduation.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{one year}} earlier, the same Congress {{had passed the}} Equal Pay Act of 1963, which {{prohibited}} <b>wage</b> <b>differentials</b> based on sex. The prohibition on sex discrimination {{was added to the}} Civil Rights Act by Howard W. Smith, a powerful Virginia Democrat who chaired the House Rules Committee and who strongly opposed the legislation. Smith's amendment was passed by a teller vote of 168 to 133. Historians debate Smith's motivation, whether it was a cynical attempt to defeat the bill by someone opposed to civil rights both for blacks and women, or an attempt to support their rights by broadening the bill to include women. Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because the clause was opposed by labor unions. Representative Carl Elliott of Alabama later claimed, [...] "Smith didn't give a damn about women's rights...he was trying to knock off votes either then or down the line because there was always a hard core of men who didn't favor women's rights," [...] and the Congressional Record records that Smith was greeted by laughter when he introduced the amendment.|$|E
2500|$|As the Civil War raged in the U.S., Virginia Penny of Louisville, Kentucky was {{finishing}} up her research project and publish the ground-breaking book, [...] Hoping to offer hard facts about what {{women in the}} workforce would encounter, Penny had interviewed thousands of employers, using both a survey via the postal mail and in person – when she would also interview workers. Much of her site visits were conducted in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. She distilled her research to list over 500 jobs that were open to {{women as well as}} the information about the jobs and potential availability for women. She also indicated when employers offered their reasons for <b>wage</b> <b>differentials</b> based on gender. She dedicated her book [...] "to worthy and industrious women in the United States, striving to earn a livelihood," [...] and the book garnered much attention by reviewers and scholars across the country. She sold her rights to the book to another publisher who put it out instead as an encyclopedia, , in 1863. It sold better once it was re-titled again in 1870 as How Women Can Make Money, Married or Single. In total, the several different versions of the book ended up with 36 editions published between 1862 and 2006, and six editions of the adaptation in German (first published in 1867).|$|E
30|$|Next {{we examine}} the gender <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> in NSC and SC/ST groups separately. The {{decomposition}} of the gender <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> for both NSC and SC/ST {{is presented in the}} Table  2. Interestingly, we note that the gender <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> in NSC group is higher than the same in SC/ST group in the rural sector but is smaller in the urban sector. Across the two sectors, the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> in each group (NSC or SC/ST) is higher in the rural sector than in the urban sector. A large part of the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is explained by the discrimination component for both NSC and SC/ST in both the sectors. These findings remain consistent irrespective of the reference being the male wage structure or the female wage structure.|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{literature}} on the link between <b>wage</b> <b>differential,</b> international trade and productivity growth. The theoretical and empirical research is mainly based on the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson framework and on the cases of a large country. More comprehensive theoretical models are needed to guide further empirical research. This paper contributes to the debate by providing a dynamic intertemporal general equilibrium (DIGE) model incorporating endogenous skill formation. The result tends to support the argument that trade has a responsibility for <b>wage</b> <b>differential.</b> A cut in government education investment tends to raise <b>wage</b> <b>differential.</b> Productivity growth at best causes <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> in the short run.

40|$|Even after {{controlling}} for observable workers' characteristics and for occupation and industry-specific effects, a substantial <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> remains between large and small firms. What underlies the remaining <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is unclear. Direct evidence on pension plan coverage and on lay-off rates by firm size is inconsistent with the "bad working conditions" hypothesis. The union avoidance hypothesis {{does not seem to}} explain an important portion o f the <b>wage</b> <b>differential.</b> As suggested by efficiency wage models, part of the remaining <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> may be due to firms' heterogeneity. Similarly, perhaps large firms pay higher wages simply (partly) beca use they employ workers with more unobserved abilities. Because differen t explanations of the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> may lead to different policy implications, determining the source of the wage-firm size effect is an important question for future research. ...|$|R
2500|$|Harsh {{immigration}} statutes introduced {{during the}} presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing were reversed, while an immigration law was passed (1981) to limit the grounds for expelling foreigners to facilitate family reunions and amnesty 130,000 illegal immigrants. A 1982 law introduced new rights for helper spouses, while the anti-discriminatory Professional Equality Law (1983), which defined equality {{between men and women}} [...] "in sweeping terms," [...] required all businesses to furnish statistics on the situation of women in the workplace. This legislation marked a new departure in anti-discriminatory efforts and, reinforced by a series of measures taken by the Rocard government in 1989, brought an end to <b>wage</b> <b>differentials</b> hidden by different job descriptions. Decentralising laws were also passed which transferred responsibilities for urban planning to municipalities and economic planning to the regions. In addition, various measures were introduced to improve socio-economic conditions in low-income neighbourhoods. Aid for the improvement of older HLM housing was increased, with the allocation for 1982 being about 40% higher than in 1981. A collaborative ‘interministerial’ approach to employment and the social rehabilitation of ‘at risk’ youth was adopted, and in 1983 the Banlieue 89 project was instigated for social and educational measures on estates in the educational priority areas. As a result of such policies, urban grants (as a proportion of local authority revenues) significantly increased during {{the first three years of}} the Mitterrand presidency, especially in municipalities controlled by the Left. In 1982, the Missions locales pour l’insertion professionnelle et sociale des jeunes were established, local advice centres that targeted young people (essentially in the 16-25 age group) experiencing major difficulties in finding work. A military reform law, passed in July 1983, enabled those who were opposed to the usage of arms on grounds of conscience to be accepted for civilian service.|$|E

The evidence from quantile regression shows that there is a negative <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> for higher quantiles, but no significant difference in wages for lower quantiles.

30|$|When {{accounting}} {{for differences in}} worker characteristics in specification (2) the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> decreases by about the half to − 0.193 log points (− 15.3  %). The <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> further decreases to − 0.158 log points (− 11.7  %) in specification (3), which includes workers’ occupations. Specification (4) contains also firm size categories and the firm’s industry, in which a worker is employed. The impact of these firm characteristics on the estimated <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is small, because it decreases only by about 0.005 to − 0.153 log points (− 11.3  %). The last specification (5) accounts for firm heterogeneity through the inclusion of firm fixed effects and estimates the within-firm <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between workers in FTCs and in permanent contracts. The within-firm <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is − 0.127 log points (− 9.4  %), which is about 0.03 log points smaller than in specification (3) that does not control for firm characteristics.|$|R

50|$|Becker's theory {{states that}} {{discrimination}} cannot {{exist in the}} long run because it is costly. However, discrimination seems to persist {{in the long run}}; it declined only after the Civil Rights Act, as it was seen in the economic history. Regardless, it is argued that Becker’s theory holds for occupational segregation. For instance, men are more likely to work as truck drivers, or the female customers are more likely to choose to be served by women lingerie salespersons because of preferences. However, this segregation cannot explain the <b>wage</b> <b>differentials.</b> In other words, occupational segregation is an outcome of group-typing of employment between different groups but consumer discrimination does not cause <b>wage</b> <b>differentials.</b> Thus, customer discrimination theory fails to explain the combination of employment segregation and the <b>wage</b> <b>differentials.</b> However, the data points out the jobs associated with women suffer from lower pay.|$|E
50|$|This non-neoclassical {{model was}} first {{developed}} by Bergmann. According to the model, {{outcome of the}} occupational segregation is <b>wage</b> <b>differentials</b> between two genders.

According to the evidence, in general female dominated jobs pay less than male dominated jobs. The pay is low because of the high number of women who choose female dominated jobs or they do not have other opportunities.|$|E
40|$|Union-non-union wage differentials: {{individual}} level and organizational level effects ARNE MASTEKAASA ABSTRACT The wage difference between unionized and non-unionized employees {{is assumed to}} be small in Norway (and in other Scandinavian countries), due to a high degree of unionization, spill-over effects, and standard rate policies. Previous research nevertheless indicates that there is a union member—non-member <b>wage</b> <b>differential,</b> at least for blue-collar workers. For white-collar workers the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is smaller or even negative. This paper argues that in an economy with widespread spill-over and standardization, the union-non-union <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> could be due to (1) effects of union strength (as measured by the degree of unionization) at the establishment or industry level, or (2) selection effects at the {{individual level}}. Degree of unionization or selection effects may also explain why the union-non-union <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> is larger for blue-collar than for white-collar employees. In the private sector, the blue-collar-white-collar difference in the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> can be accounted for by degree-of-unionization effects. In the public sector, there seems in addition to be some positive selection for union membership. Unionization also serves to narrow the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between blue-collar and white-collar workers, in part by keeping white-collar wages down...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{deepening}} {{may affect}} {{the evolution of the}} <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between skilled and unskilled workers differently in countries with different labor market institutions. If labor market institutions raise the relative wage of unskilled workers in Germany, firms have incentives to invest relatively more into capital equipment complementary to unskilled workers. Instead in the US, where wage-compressing institutions are weaker, firms invest more in high-skilled workers. We provide evidence consistent with this view based on an industry panel for West Germany and the US between the 1970 s and 1990 s. We show that capital equipment per worker is less positively associated with the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> in West Germany than in the US. This descriptive evidence is robust to many alternative measures for capital and skills. Our estimates imply that capital deepening in Germany in the 1980 s is associated with a reduction in the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> of about 10 - 20 % in most industries. In the US instead, capital deepening is associated with an increase of the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between 5 and 15 % in most industries...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the effect of {{industrial}} and occupational segregation on the <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> between resident and migrant workers in China. It extends the work of Meng and Zhang (2001) by considering the possible employment segregation of resident and migrant workers by both industry and occupation. I contend that industry segregation {{is at least as}} important as occupational segregation for Chinese migrant workers, as most migrant workers in China have come from the countryside to fuel the booming labor-intensive manufacturing and construction industries in the cites. Due to the hukou policy (a household registration system) in China, migrant workers normally face more constraints in searching for jobs in other sectors. My empirical study confirms that the proportion of the resident-migrant worker <b>wage</b> <b>differential</b> that is explained by industrial segregation is much larger than that explained by occupational segregation.
