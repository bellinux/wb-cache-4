500|$|The {{funding of}} {{political}} parties, independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated {{in comparison with}} developed western democracies. Applicable legislation encompasses cash receipts, provision of free services (except the labour of volunteers), and products {{and other forms of}} support (including membership fees). The legislation also stipulates that the government budget provides funding for political parties and non-partisan political representatives in the amount of 0.05 percent of the previous year's budget expenditures. Additional funds are appropriated in local government budgets. The funds are distributed to elected members of parliament and councils, and the political parties with which they are affiliated receive 10 percent of the funds. Each election candidate (or slate) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election-campaign donations, other related funding, and all campaign-related expenditures. The maximum donation to a single party, candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated. In cases of individuals it is set at 30,000kuna ( [...] 4,050euro), regardless of purpose. Companies and other legal persons are limited to the same amount in local elections; 100,000kuna ( [...] 13,500euro) for parliamentary or European Parliament elections and 200,000kuna ( [...] 27,000euro) for presidential elections to any one candidate, party or slate (<b>whichever</b> <b>is</b> <b>applicable).</b> Total campaign expenditures are also limited to 8million kuna ( [...] 1.08million euro) per candidate in presidential elections, 1.5million kuna ( [...] 202,000euro) per candidate (or slate) in European Parliament or parliamentary elections, 500,000kuna ( [...] 67,600euro) per candidate in Zagreb mayoral elections and 400,000kuna ( [...] 54,000euro) per candidate in county-prefect or mayoral elections in cities of 35,000 residents or larger and in county seats. Mayoral election-campaign expenditures in other cities and towns is also limited, depending on the local government's population: 250,000kuna ( [...] 33,800euro) if the population exceeds 10,000 residents, 100,000 kuna ( [...] 13,500euro) in population units of 3,000–10,000 and up to 50,000kuna ( [...] 6,750euro) in smaller self-governing units.

40|$|Background and Aims: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) {{block is}} a popular {{technique}} for post-operative analgesia in abdominal surgeries. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the relative efficacy of bupivacaine versus ropivacaine for post-operative analgesia using ultrasound-guided TAP block in laparoscopic cholecystectomies. Methods: Sixty adults undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised to receive ultrasound-guided TAP block at the end of the surgical procedure with either 0. 25 % bupivacaine (Group I, n = 30) or 0. 375 % ropivacaine (Group II, n = 30). All patients were assessed for post-operative pain and rescue analgesic consumption at 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h time points. Means for normally distributed data were compared using Student′s t-test, and proportions were compared using Chi-square or Fisher′s exact test <b>whichever</b> <b>was</b> <b>applicable.</b> Results: Patients receiving ultrasound-guided TAP block with ropivacaine (Group II) had significantly lower pain scores when compared to patients who received the block with bupivacaine (Group I) at 10 min, 30 min and 1 h. However, both the drugs were equivalent for post-operative analgesia and 24 h cumulative rescue analgesic requirement (median [interquartile range]) (75. 00 [75. 00 - 75. 00] in Group I vs. 75. 00 [75. 00 - 93. 75] in Group II, P = 0. 366). Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided TAP block with ropivacaine provides effective analgesia in the immediate post-operative period up to 1 h as compared to bupivacaine.

Possible correlates tested included gender, age group, class standing, and major area of study. Slippery Rock University students who were enrolled in the ten sections of either the introductory programming course (n = 71) or the computer literacy course (n = 122) in the spring semester of 1994 were tested {{at the beginning and end}} of the courses.

40|$|Integrating ever {{increasing}} amount of renewable generating resources to interconnected power systems has created new {{challenges to the}} safety and reliability of today‟s power grids and posed new questions to {{be answered in the}} power system modeling, analysis and control. Automatic Generation Control (AGC) must be extended to be able to accommodate the control of renewable generating assets. In addition, AGC is mandated to operate in accordance with the NERC‟s Control Performance Standard (CPS) criteria, which represent a greater flexibility in relaxing the control of generating resources and yet assuring the stability and reliability of interconnected power systems when each balancing authority operates in full compliance. Enhancements in several aspects to the traditional AGC must be made {{in order to meet the}} aforementioned challenges. It is the intention of this paper to provide a systematic, mathematical formulation for AGC as a first attempt in the context of meeting the NERC CPS requirements and integrating renewable generating assets, which has not been seen reported in the literature to the best knowledge of the authors. Furthermore, this paper proposes neural network based predictive control schemes for AGC. The proposed controller is capable of handling complicated nonlinear dynamics in comparison with the conventional Proportional Integral (PI) controller which is typically most effective to handle linear dynamics. The neural controller is designed in such a way that it has the capability of controlling the system generation in the relaxed manner so the ACE is controlled to a desired range instead of driving it to zero which would otherwise increase the control effort and cost; and most importantly the resulting system control performance meets the NERC CPS requirements and/or the NERC Balancing Authority’s ACE Limit (BAAL) compliance requirements <b>whichever</b> <b>are</b> <b>applicable...</b>|$|R

The eastern Ligurian Sea has very intense short waves anomaly fields and a sea bed that varies greatly in depth.

The present technique, which has been fine-tuned over 4 years of experimentation in environmental researchs, aims to provide a simple and efficient means to reduce the distortion of geomagnetic anomalies field caused by the variation of distance between survey plane and magnetic outcrop source position. The compensation procedure is based on evaluation, by comparison of two measurements carried out at different altitudes, of the mean vertical increment typical of each anomaly field principal frequency component bands. The component anomaly fields are then corrected by application of the corresponding vertical increments and lastly, the anomaly geomagnetic field reduced to the sea-bed is computed as Inverse Fourier Transform of a spectrum built as synthesis of the component anomaly fields' spectra. The results obtained have shown a notable increase in definition of anomaly field intensity without the production of appreciable distortions or false geomagnetic echoes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{altitude}} on individual storm precipitation {{in some of}} the San Dimas experimental watersheds is investigated. It is found that there is a well- defined increase of storm precipitation with altitude for storms greater than one inch. This increase is a linear function of storm depth. Using 41 storms of different magnitudes, a precipitation -altitude relationship is derived for a small area in the San Dimas Experimental Forest. The regionalization of this relationship and its transferability are tested by analyzing differences (errors) between computed and observed storm precipitation values in each case. In testing the regionalization of the precipitation- altitude relationship by computing mean areal storm precipitation over a larger area the standard error of estimate is around 11 percent. In transfering the same relationship the results are not as good and give a standard error of 16 percent. For individual points, however, the error is much higher. A rainfall- runoff model is used as a tool for evaluating the effect of precipitation errors, on simulated streamflow, in a watershed of 4. 5 square miles. For annual flows, errors range between 3. 4 and 12. 3 percent while errors in simulated monthly flows are as high as 22 percent. It is also evident that there is a strong dependence of the error magnitude on the state (wet, dry, etc.) of the preceding year or months, <b>whichever</b> <b>is</b> <b>applicable.</b> An error propagation is observed as a result of consistently over -estimating the precipitation input to the model.
