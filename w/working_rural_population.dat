40|$|Tito {{has spoken}} and {{written about the}} {{problems}} of agriculture and village in the context of wider economic and social questions. However, his views and attitudes towards various questions had a significant influence upon the determining of directions of development of Yugoslav agriculture as well as the character of measures of agricultural policy. Constantly Tito has pointed out to the importance of agriculture in the total economic development of this country, bearing in mind the favourable natural and socio-economic conditions for the development of this field of material production. He has accentuated the part played by the village and rural population in the Yugoslav revolution, he has pointed out to the importance of unity between the <b>working</b> <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> and the working class in building up of the country and the socialist society, to the prospects of rural population and small commodity production in the process of socialist transformation of small commodity production. Rural households as its carriers cannot be expropriated. In the process of socialist transformation of agriculture Tito has ascribed particular importance to integration and co-operatives as to organizations, which should and can enable the development of large-scale production in the village, and which reestablish and develop the self-management socialist social relations. For a successful development of agriculture and agricultural production the volume of investments in this field of production is particulary important as well as the effective utilization of means and the presence of staff — professionally qualified and ideologically and politically clearly decisive for the development of agriculture and transformation of village upon self- -management socialist basis. Tito has seen the prospects of Yugoslav agriculture in the development of large-scale, specialized, higly-productive commodity production, which is realized through the simultaneous development of self-management socio- -economic relation, where working people independently decide upon the conditions and results of their work...|$|E

Using consumption expenditure data that span the entire population, other studies 25 have also documented an improvement in all parts of the distribution. Taken together, there is clear evidence that economic growth in the post-reform period (after the early 1990 s) has been accompanied by a reduction in poverty. 26 At the same time, according to official estimates, in 2011 / 12, 25.7  % of the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> was below the poverty line.

The main reason for restricting our analysis to wage earners is that the EUS does not collect earnings data for self-employed individuals. Kijima (2006) imputes the earnings of the self-employed using Mincerian equations estimated on the sample of regular wage/salaried workers. We refrain from this imputation as it imposes identical returns to covariates for both sets of workers, an assumption that may not be true.|$|R
40|$|While {{urbanization}} has accelerated, the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> in China {{has started}} decreasing in recent years. However, {{the expansion of}} rural settlement has not been sufficiently curbed. The questions of why this has happened and who has driven the land-use change (LUC) of rural settlement in China have aroused great interests among researchers. In this paper, {{it is suggested that}} population is not always a positive driving force for the LUC of rural settlement in China. Furthermore, socio-economic driving forces other than urbanization, population and industrialization are analyzed. On a national scale, the major driving forces are the per-capita rural housing area and the cultivated land area. On a regional scale, the main driving forces in the eastern China are the house-building capacity of rural households and the per-capita rural housing area; while in the central China, the main driving forces are rural housing investment, the proportion of primary industry employees in the <b>rural</b> <b>working</b> <b>population,</b> and the cultivated land area. For the western China, the main driving forces are <b>rural</b> register <b>population</b> and cultivated land area...|$|R

This corresponds to about 104 million paid workers in 2004 / 05 and about 118 million in 2011 / 12.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{proposed}} {{study was to explore}} the compromises that working women make in as a result of living in rural, Nebraska communities. The phenomenon of compromise is not new to the field of vocational development and, in fact, it {{has been found to be}} an integral part of the career development process (Gottfredson, 1981; Super, 1995). Despite its widespread acknowledgement in the field, the concept of compromise has never been applied to the <b>population</b> of <b>rural</b> women. Understanding the effects of rural factors on career development is important, as rural communities constitute 20 % of the United States population (U. S. Census Bureau, 2000). Research has suggested that, in comparison to non-rural areas, individuals from rural areas tend to be less educated, earn less income, and possess stronger traditional values (Conrad, 1997). One way rural women adjust to the idiosyncrasies of rural culture is by making compromises in order to continue living in and working in or near rural communities. This study explored this experience using a phenomenological, qualitative design. Eight women were interviewed for the study and the following themes were induced: (a) Limited Opportunities; (b) Higher Education Barriers; (c) Few Job Perks; (d) Focus on Relationships; (e) Religion Provides Guidance; (f) Motherhood Changes Perspective; (g) Time on the Road; (h) Change of Career Plans; and (i) Emotional Distress. These themes are important to the field of psychology, and in particular, counseling psychology as they depict the experiences of <b>working</b> <b>rural</b> women. Further implications for mental health professionals <b>working</b> with <b>rural</b> <b>populations</b> are also addressed. Limitations of the study, future directions, and the researcher’s reflections are also included. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1940, he was {{appointed}} diocesan director of the Catholic Action youth movement and the very next year, its national director (1941–1944). That same year, in 1941, Hurtado's sociology-oriented mind led to his authoring of the book Is Chile a Catholic Country? The book published statistics revealing a lack of priests assigned to the <b>working</b> class and <b>rural</b> <b>populations,</b> including detailing parishes that had 10,000 laypeople assigned for one priest covering huge geographic areas. His solution was to increase and better educate the clergy, however, this never came to be. Almost half of Chile's clergy were foreigners (including missionaries from the United States and Canada) who did circuits of towns administering the sacraments (i.e., going to one town one week, then another the next week, etc.) Most Chileans regarded devotion to the Virgin and the saints as more important than attending Mass or consuming the Eucharist, which they could not do regularly.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{two years}} of {{research}} in Taiwan and mainland China, this paper argues that the introduction of corporate social responsibility capacity building programs into Chinese civil society has significantly altered NGOs’ relation to legal notions of social and human rights. While increased reference to law and legal instruments is common in popular struggles for social justice, the CSR paradigm can lead to very different forms of rhetoric and practice, shifting responsibility for avoiding violations {{of the law in}} transnational supply chains to supplier factories and indeed to workers themselves. Furthermore, the urban-based “civilizational project” aimed at teaching new norms of behavior and attitude to the largely <b>rural</b> <b>working</b> class <b>population</b> in contemporary China intersects with Western-sponsored capacity building programs to promote labor-rights consciousness in particular ways, producing loci for the spread of notions such as personal development and family counseling in lieu of rights advocacy...|$|R

Simultaneous cross-sectional epidemiological study among inhabitants of Revda town and nine rural settlements of Nevijansk farmland in the Sverdlovsk region. Results, questionnaire-based survey showed that {{the prevalence of}} joint pain and complaints of joint swelling was higher in the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> (44, 9 % and 16, 7 % correspondingly) compared to town population (26, 4 % and 6, 7 % correspondingly), p< 0, 05. Prevalence of OA in town (11, 4 %) and in <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> (11, 2 %) was similar. Higher prevalence of joint complaints in <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> is attributed to higher rate of soft tissue and vertebral involvement, and platypodia. Prevalence of OA in women was almost 3 times higher than in man (town women — 17, 8 %, town men — 3, 7 %; rural women — 15, 7 %; rural men — 5, 4 %). Age-specific features were also identified. Prevalence of OA in <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> was higher in age group under 50 years (3, 18 % in town population compared to 7, 66 % in <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> for age group 41 - 50 years), but after 70 years prevalence of OA became significantly (p< 0, 05) higher in town population (40, 34 % in town population compared to 20, 51 % in <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> forage group 71 - 80 years), and started to decrease in <b>rural</b> <b>population.</b> Conclusion.
