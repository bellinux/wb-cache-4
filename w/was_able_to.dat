50|$|As {{children}} refine their motor skills, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> {{help themselves}} by completing daily activities independently. For example, {{children between the}} ages of 2 and 3 <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> put on and take off simplistic articles of clothing. They <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with zippers, use spoons, string together beads with large holes, and open doors with doorknobs. When children are between the ages of 3 and 4, they <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate clothing with larger buttons, use scissors to cut paper, and <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> copy simple lined shapes using a pencil. At 4 to 5 years of age, children <b>are</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> dress and undress themselves without assistance. They <b>are</b> also <b>able</b> <b>to</b> manipulate a fork, and have gained the dexterity to cut around shapes with a pair of scissors. And by age 6, a child <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut softer foods with a knife and <b>is</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> tie his or her own shoes.
