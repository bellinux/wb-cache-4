5|$|The slight {{radioactivity}} of rubidium {{was discovered}} in 1908, but that <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the theory of isotopes was established in 1910, and {{the low level of}} activity (half-life greater than 1010years) made interpretation complicated. The now proven decay of 87Rb to stable 87Sr through beta decay was still under discussion in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|After {{her high}} school graduation, she planned to attend Alcorn State University, which {{did not have a}} women's {{basketball}} team. However, she was asked by Melvin Hemphill, the recruiter for coach Margaret Wade, who was restarting a collegiate women's team, if she would attend Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi. This <b>was</b> <b>before</b> Title IX, so there were no sports scholarships for women. She attended school on a combination of academic scholarships and work study funds.|$|E

6000|$|What are the {{properties}} we expect of instants? First, they must form a series: of any two, one must <b>be</b> <b>before</b> the other, {{and the other}} must <b>be</b> not <b>before</b> the one; if one <b>is</b> <b>before</b> another, and the other before a third, the first must <b>be</b> <b>before</b> the third. Secondly, every event must be at {{a certain number of}} instants; two events are simultaneous if they are at the same instant, and one <b>is</b> <b>before</b> the other if there is an instant, at which the one is, which is earlier than some instant at which the other is. Thirdly, if we assume that there is always some change going on somewhere during the time when any given event persists, the series of instants ought to be compact, i.e. given any two instants, there ought to be other instants between them. Do instants, as we have defined them, have these properties? ...|$|R

5|$|Due to the damage, {{the name}} Ione was retired {{and will never}} be used for an Atlantic {{hurricane}} again.

5|$|In {{the third}} over after the lunch break, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time in the series by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when he was on 13. Including a county match against Yorkshire, it was the fourth time Hutton had caught Bradman in the leg trap from a glance. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he <b>was</b> <b>before</b> World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said {{this was the first time}} Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession.|$|E
5|$|Joan Elizabeth Strothers {{was born}} on 26 February 1916 in Swansea, Wales, the {{daughter}} of an optician, Charles William Strothers, and his wife, Margaret Beatrice, née Millington. She was educated at Swansea Girls' High School, and in 1934 won an open scholarship to Newnham College, Cambridge. In 1935, she rowed for the ladies' university eight, in the first real Women's boat race against Oxford. She gained an honours degree in physics, which was not awarded because it <b>was</b> <b>before</b> women were allowed Cambridge degrees. In her seventies, in 1987, she was honoured with the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa by the University of Strathclyde.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's team {{arrived in}} Australia {{towards the end}} of 1945, but the armed {{services}} and Australian Board of Control ordered them to play another series against the various Australian states. Johnson had sought fixtures for his team in Australia, but this <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the Evatt had added the matches in the subcontinent. He implored the administrators to recognise that the players were already overworked, but was ignored. The Services performed poorly; after playing out consecutive draws against Western Australia and South Australia, they were crushed by an innings by both Victoria and New South Wales, before drawing against Queensland and Tasmania, the smallest state in the country.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again the}} Byzantines' {{military}} power was depleted and Andronicus III {{was forced into}} diplomacy as his grandfather <b>was</b> <b>before</b> him; {{in return for the}} safety of the remaining Byzantine settlements in Asia Minor, tribute would be paid to the Ottomans. Unfortunately for the Byzantine Empire, this did not stop the Ottomans from laying siege to Nicomedia in 1333; the city finally fell in 1337.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{cost for}} {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated at}} $2.5billion, which was estimated to take four years. The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost for rebuilding roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it <b>was</b> <b>before</b> Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking.|$|E

In the Patriots’ 56-year history, they have an overall regular season record of 476 wins, 383 losses, and 9 ties, plus an overall postseason record of 32 wins and 19 losses. In the 2016 NFL season, the Patriots reached their 9th Super Bowl, setting the record for most Super Bowl appearances by any organization of all time.|$|E
5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it would allow the astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E
5|$|The Counties (Detached parts) Act 1844 was {{originally}} designed to eradicate exclaves or 'islands' and amalgamate the area with the surrounding county; Worcestershire however, still possessed many 'outliers' to the south east. This <b>was</b> <b>before</b> enactment of the Provisional Order Confirmation (Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire) Act 1931 which nearly completed the task of amalgamating Worcestershire's islands into their surrounding county, except for Dudley. This act transferred Blockley, Daylesford and Evenlode to Gloucestershire, whilst Warwickshire gained Alderminster, Tidmington and Tredington. The whole of Shipston-on-Stour Rural District was also merged into Warwickshire and subsequently amalgamated with Brailes Rural District.|$|E

5|$|The Eucharist {{was a key}} {{center of}} {{controversy}} in the Reformation as it not only focused differences between the reformers and the church but also between themselves. For Zwingli {{it was a matter}} of attacking a doctrine that imperiled the understanding and reception of God's gift of salvation, while for Luther {{it was a matter of}} defending a doctrine that embodied that gift. It is not known what Zwingli's eucharistic theology <b>was</b> <b>before</b> he became a reformer and there is disagreement among scholars about his views during his first few years as a priest. In the eighteenth article of The Sixty-seven Articles (1523) which concerns the sacrifice of the mass, he states that it is a memorial of the sacrifice. He expounds on this in An Exposition of the Articles (1523).|$|E

Drew Barrymore returned as Jillian, and Lauren Conrad and Audrina Patridge guest starred as themselves. In her second guest appearance on the series, Conrad played a smart version of herself, which she proclaimed as being fun to play. She took the recording sessions seriously and did not do any improvisation with her lines. The show's staff was ultimately impressed with her performance, and series creator Seth MacFarlane praised her stamina and how prepared she <b>was</b> <b>before</b> the recording sessions. The episode also featured live-action sequences with talk show hosts Jay Leno, Craig Ferguson and Jimmy Fallon.|$|E
5|$|The {{season begins}} with Veronica's life {{returning}} {{to the way it}} <b>was</b> <b>before</b> Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the 09ers. However, her tough personality and work as a private investigator keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. 09ers Dick and Cassidy are abandoned by their father, who flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. The brothers are forced to deal with their stepmother, Kendall (Charisma Carpenter), who is only interested in their father's money. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive and takes a romantic interest in Jackie.|$|E
