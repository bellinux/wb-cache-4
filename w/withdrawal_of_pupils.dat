40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which a sustained, coherent, on-site professional development approach, incorporating a school-based facilitator, can support the staff of a large urban primary school in the implementation of a research-validated approach to comprehension instruction. Informed by international research on effective professional development, the study promotes a differentiated approach, incorporating modelled lessons, one-to-one consultations, reflective dialogue and the development of an authentic community of practice. This research also explores changes in teacher knowledge and practice as a result of this professional development and examines its impact on pupil learning and engagement. Qualitative in nature, this case study design explores the multiple perspectives of teachers, the principal and pupils across the first two years of the implementation process. Data gathered from questionnaires, semi-structured individual and group interviews, audio and video recording of lessons, in addition to researcher observations, was coded to facilitate the emergence of conceptual categories. The complexity of implementing school-wide initiatives is highlighted by the study, with time, multiple reform efforts and the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> impacting on teachers’ ability and motivation to engage in educational reform efforts. The findings indicate that within a community of practice, teachers gradually assumed more control over their own learning, but that this is contingent on effective leadership and scaffolding from the facilitator. The study also suggests that modelled lessons and one-to-one consultations are integral features in developing an atmosphere of trust in which teachers are comfortable sharing concerns and anxieties. Teachers valued the explicit and structured nature of comprehension strategy instruction introduced, and a dialogic approach which emphasised the collaborative development of personal interpretation of text was observed in many classrooms. Teacher scaffolding was identified as an area in need of further support. The emergence of higher-order thinking skills was noted among all pupils, leading teachers to reconsider their perspectives of younger and weaker readers. Findings also indicate that through the use of Comprehension Process Motions, children in the infant classroom are capable of thinking strategically with minimal teacher prompting. In addition, increases in pupil engagement and perceptions of themselves as readers were noted. In conclusion, the findings of this study reinforce the need for sustained, inschool support through the medium of informed, on-site facilitation in the development of a collaborative approach to the implementation of new initiatives. The development of active and engaged readers of all ages and the emergence of higher-order thinking skills emphasise the need for a whole-school approach to comprehension instruction. N...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{developments}} in special education in Taiwan have led to an appraisal of present provision particularly for pupils with learning difficulties in ordinary schools. The writer's present position as a teacher with responsibility for a special class in an ordinary elementary school led her to become interested in developments in collaboration between learning support and classroom teachers in England. The award of a Rotary International Scholarship provided an opportunity to study, at first hand, die attitudes and practices of a sample of teachers in two local authorities in the north-east of England. Since {{the publication of the}} Warnock Report (1978), there has been considerable interest in different forms of integration and provision for pupils with learning difficulties in primary schools. Considerable change has taken place in the provision for children who have not been statemented but have learning difficulties, most often in language and reading development. In most cases, these children are supported by specialist teachers from a local authority support service. Among the various changes which have taken place has been a through examination {{of the role of the}} support teachers, and in particular the advocacy of a move from <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>pupils</b> with learning difficulties, for specialist teaching, to an increase in collaboration between class teachers and support teachers in the class room. The main aim of the study has been to explore teachers' attitudes and perceptions and preferences regarding these changes firstly through a review of the literature. This literature search was used to identify a series of issues which might be of greatest concern. Secondly, these issues were incorporated into a questionnaire to provide data in five areas : personal details of respondents, perceptions of existing support service, interaction between class teachers and support teachers, attitudes towards changing roles in the support system and most effective ways of supporting for pupils with learning difficulties and their class teachers. The questionnaire was distributed to a sample paired support and classroom teachers in two local authorities. The results revealed a broad degree of satisfaction with the arrangements described by the teachers, the need for more support and improved finding. There was a wider variation in attitude, preference and degree of consensus regarding m class support and collaboration and withdrawal, and a number of more specific issues such as : the influence of the support teacher on the rest of the class, the problems which the class teacher and die support teacher faced in their collaboration, die influence of the support teacher on the class teacher and the influence of the class teacher on the support teacher, the preferable methods of collaboration, the reasons for teachers to chose different support patterns, the main strengths and weaknesses of the changing support model and the best ways of support for class teachers and pupils with L-D from the teachers' point of view. The diesis concludes with a broad discussion of the implications of the study, an evaluation of the empirical study and possible directions for future investigation...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} have shown {{an effect of}} nCPAP-therapy in lowering bloodpressure in patients with OSA and hypertension. Various reasons lead to interruption of nCPAP-therapy in everyday conditions. Until today the effects on bloodpressure and heartrate variability <b>of</b> such <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was unclear. In a study on 18 patients with OSA and hypertension, treated over several months to years with nCPAP-therapy, we investigated {{the influence of a}} 7 to 10 days <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy on bloodpressure and heartrate. We investigated data of 12 patients. As a methode of measuring bloodpressure and heartrate variability we used ambulatory- 24 h-bloodpressure-monitoring (ABDM). Effects <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy was documented by repeated polysomnography. We focused on comparing the mean bloodpressure in 24 hours before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy and after restarting nCPAP-therapy. We seperately compared bloodpressure during the day and at night. Patients were used as their own controls, so we could compare the results before and after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy. The <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy caused an immediate onset of sleeapnoea. Ceasing of therapy produced a significant rise in systolic 24 -h-bloodpressure of 4 mmHg and a significant rise in diastolic 24 -h-pressure of 2 respective 3 mmHg. The rise in bloodpressure was considerered as clinically not relevant. The variability of bloodpressure {{can be used as a}} hint for the close association of OSA and regulation of bloodpressure. Change of heartrate was only significant during the day on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy but frequency was always below 100 /min [...] Therefore the risk for patients through extensive rising in heartrate is considered low. These results led us to the assumption that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> nCPAP-therapy of 7 to 10 days in patients with OSA and arterial hypertension causes a certain rise in bloodpressure which probably is not clinically relevant. This means that the risk of a cardiovascular event caused by a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> therapy is low...|$|R
40|$|Background - The process <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> {{treatment}} in Critical Care environments has created ethical and moral dilemmas {{in relation to}} {{end of life care}} in the UK and elsewhere. Common within this discourse is the differing demands made on health professionals as they strive to provide care for the dying patient and family members. Despite reports that <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment is a source of tension between those nurses and doctors involved in the process, the role of the nurse in facilitating <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment has received relatively little attention. Objectives – To illustrate how differing dying trajectories impact on decision-making underpinning <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment processes, and what nurses do to shape <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. Design - Qualitative methods of enquiry using clinical vignettes and applying Charmaz’s grounded theory method. Methods and settings - Single audio-recorded qualitative interviews with thirteen critical care nurses from four Intensive Care specialities: Cardiac; General; Neurological and Renal were carried out. Interviews were facilitated by an end-of-life vignette developed with clinical collaborators. Findings – Across critical care areas four key dying trajectories were identified. These trajectories were shaped by contested boundaries associated with delayed or stalled decision-making around how <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should proceed. Nurses provided end of life care (including collaborative and action-oriented skills) to shape the dying trajectory of patients so as to satisfy the wishes of the patient and family, and their own professional aims. Conclusions - Differing views as to when <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment should commence and how it should be operationalised appeared to be underpinned by the requirements of the role that health professionals fulfil, with doctors focusing on making <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment decisions, and nurse’s being tasked with operationalising the processes that constitute it. Multidisciplinary teams need a ‘shared’ understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, aims, and motivations when planning and implementing the dying trajectory <b>of</b> <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> treatment. <br/...|$|R
