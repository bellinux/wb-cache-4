25|$|Medicare {{differs from}} private {{insurance}} available to <b>working</b> <b>Americans</b> {{in that it}} is a social insurance program. Social insurance programs provide statutorily guaranteed benefits to the entire population (under certain circumstances, such as old age or unemployment). These benefits are financed in significant part through universal taxes. In effect, Medicare is a mechanism by which the state takes a portion of its citizens' resources to guarantee health and financial security to its citizens in old age or in case of disability, helping them cope with the enormous, unpredictable cost of health care. In its universality, Medicare differs substantially from private insurers, which must decide whom to cover and what benefits to offer to manage their risk pools and guarantee their costs don't exceed premiums.|$|E
500|$|Automobile {{manufacturing}} {{became the}} largest industry segment in the US, {{and the largest}} ever created; the US auto industry was many {{times larger than the}} automotive industries {{of the rest of the}} world combined. By 1960, one-sixth of <b>working</b> <b>Americans</b> were employed directly or indirectly by the industry, but automation and imports eroded the need for such a large workforce within a couple of decades. [...] The 1950s were the pinnacle of American automotive manufacturing and helped shape the United States into an economic superpower.|$|E

The American manufacturing economy switched from producing war-related items to consumer goods at the end of World War II, {{and by the end of}} the 1950s, one in six <b>working</b> <b>Americans</b> were employed either directly or indirectly in the automotive industry. The United States became the world's largest manufacturer of automobiles, and Henry Ford's goal of 30 years earlier—that any man with a good job should be able to afford an automobile—was achieved. A new generation of service businesses focusing on customers with their automobiles sprang up during the decade, including drive-through or drive-in restaurants and more drive-in theaters (cinemas).|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{started work}} in 1925 with the Forest Service, {{where he worked}} until 1928. Although {{he had hoped to}} go to Alaska, he was {{assigned}} that year to the Northern Rocky Mountain Experiment Station at Missoula, Montana. Marshall's research at the experimental station focused on the dynamics of forest regeneration after fires. He had to fight a widespread fire after a July storm started more than 150fires in Idaho's Kaniksu National Forest. He was put in charge of supporting and provisioning one of the crews led by the Forest Service. As he later recalled, Marshall worked [...] "18 to 20hours a day as time-keeper, Chief of Commissary, Camp Boss, and Inspector of the fire line". [...] Spending time with loggers and fire fighters, and seeing the conditions under which they worked, Marshall learned vital lessons about labor issues and natural resource use. At the experimental station, Marshall became interested in the unsafe conditions for many <b>working</b> <b>Americans.</b> He began to develop [...] liberal and socialist philosophies.|$|E

2500|$|After {{spending}} {{over two}} decades fighting {{for the rights of}} workers to organize and thrive, Barasch saw the need for an independent organization that would continue to advance the education and rights of <b>working</b> <b>Americans</b> outside the labor arena. In particular, Barasch believed that for United States citizens to adapt and live successfully in the context of change they must be educated on their rights and civic responsibilities as Americans, have the ability to critically evaluate and obtain accurate information from the media, and take ownership of their health and live longer, more active lives. In 1964, Barasch created the [...] as an educational and charitable organization based on his beliefs focused on a mission of improving the lives of working men and women through education and legal advocacy. He also helped organize the Union Mutual Benefit Association to promote and protect the interest of retirees and organized many health and welfare conferences.|$|E
2500|$|Women {{also took}} on new roles {{in sport and}} entertainment, which opened to them {{as more and more}} men were drafted. The All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League [...] was the {{creation}} of Chicago Cubs owner Philip Wrigley, who sought alternative ways to expand his baseball franchise as top male players left for military service. In 1943, he created an eight team League in small industrial cities around the Great Lakes; team names included the Kenosha Comets, the Rockford Peaches, and the Fort Wayne Daisies. Night games offered affordable, patriotic entertainment to <b>working</b> <b>Americans</b> who had flocked to wartime jobs in the Midwest hubs of Chicago and Detroit (although better paid than in the prewar Depression, most industrial war workers were on gas and tire rationing, limiting them to local recreation options.) The League provided a novelty entertainment of girls who played hardball as well as men, executing traditional baseball skills of sliding and double-plays while wearing short, feminine uniform skirts. Players as young as fifteen were recruited from farm families and urban industrial teams, chaperoned on the road and subject to strict rules of behavior that included mandatory makeup and feminine hair styling, no drinking or smoking, no swearing, no fraternization with men, and no wearing pants in public; moreover, the League only recruited white players. Fans supported the League {{to the extent that it}} continued well past the conclusion of the war, lasting through 1953. During the 1980s, the League was formally inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, and became the subject of a popular mainstream film directed by Penny Marshall, A League of their Own.|$|E
