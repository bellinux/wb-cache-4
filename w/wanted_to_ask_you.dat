2500|$|In 1994, Joe Little {{was due to}} co-present an {{edition of}} the {{programme}} from the RTÉ studio in Castlebar, County Mayo, during the European Parliament election of that year, when it was realised belatedly {{that it could not}} be heard in Dublin. Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: [...] "There was one other question I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> [...] ". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany.|$|E
