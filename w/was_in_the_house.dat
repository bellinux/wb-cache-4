The report alleged the ruse Somerset used was the Prince's fondness for buhl furniture: he invited him to inspect a buhl cabinet which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> and that the Prince remained there no more than five minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, any {{possible}} ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain {{was no longer in}} the House. It said it did not require that McCain amend his existing financial disclosure forms for his House years, on the grounds that McCain had now fully reimbursed Keating's company.|$|E

25|$|Dan Lee Webb, who {{had been}} in Lansing, Michigan {{delivering}} 86,400 M-80s during the event, surrendered at the Polk County Jail two days later. He was charged with eleven counts of involuntary manslaughter and illegally manufacturing and possessing explosives and jailed under $300,000 bond. His wife Linda Sue, who <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> when the barn exploded, was held on a $50,000 bail as a material witness. She told her defense attorney that she believed that her husband was in the New York-New Jersey area {{at the time of the}} blast. On April 19, 1984 Dan Lee Webb received a ten-year federal prison sentence for manufacturing explosives without a license. On May 1, 1984, he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charges and received a ten-year prison sentence. He served it concurrently with the federal sentence and in addition was fined $10,000.|$|E
25|$|At the June 1994, {{grand jury}} hearing, Ross Cutlery {{provided}} store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305mm) stiletto knife {{six weeks before}} the murders. The knife {{was determined to be}} similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that store employees had sold their story to The National Enquirer for $12,500. The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating the knife had never been used. The police searched Simpson's Rockingham estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and it was promptly recovered.|$|E

500|$|A {{member of}} the Democratic Party's {{relatively}} conservative Blue Dog faction while in the House, Gillibrand {{has been seen as}} moving her political positions and ideology increasingly leftward towards that of a more liberal progressive since her appointment to the Senate. In both cases, her views were significantly defined by the respective constituency she served at the time—a conservative congressional district versus the generally liberal state of New York, especially as defined by New York City. For example, although she had been quiet on the U.S. military's [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] policy when she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> during her first 18 months in the Senate, Gillibrand was {{an important part of the}} successful campaign to repeal it.|$|E

500|$|According to Wallenstein, {{historians and}} other writers [...] "have had great {{difficulty}} {{coming to grips}} with Mason in his historical context, and they have jumbled the story in related ways, misleading each other and following each other's errors". Some of this is due to conflation of Mason's views on slavery with that of his desire to ban the African slave trade, which he unquestionably opposed and fought against. His record otherwise is mixed: Virginia banned the importation of slaves from abroad in 1778, while Mason <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Delegates. In 1782, after he had returned to Gunston Hall, it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves young enough to support themselves (not older than 45), but a proposal, supported by Mason, to require freed slaves to leave Virginia within a year or be sold at auction, was defeated. Broadwater asserted, [...] "Mason must have shared the fears of Jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together".|$|E
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
500|$|Donald P. Baker of The Washington Post {{commented that}} Mathias' lasting {{reputation}} {{would be that}} of a maverick. Though {{he was elected to}} the House in 1960 as a moderate/conservative, his life in the Congress moved him to the center, and he frequently deviated from the party line and sided with Democrats. The fact that he [...] "went out of his way to disassociate himself from [...] " [...] in the 1980 elections had hindered his chances at a chairmanship. Mathias also established a record on civil rights, having played an important role in passing a fair housing bill while he <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> and also in establishing a national holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He held liberal views on abortion, defense spending, and the Equal Rights Amendment, and, along with Senator John Warner of Virginia, was one of the sponsors of a bill to authorize the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. In discussing Mathias' retirement, Tom Wicker of The New York Times commented that [...] "he was fair, flexible, concerned, able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility". When Wicker asked him which senators he respected the most, Mathias listed J. William Fulbright (D), Jacob Javits (R), John Sherman Cooper (R), Cliff Case (R), Phil Hart (D), Mike Mansfield (D), and George Aiken (R), because [...] "each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility... They'd simply come to the conclusion that this was the right thing for the country." ...|$|E

500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, I reckon she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E
