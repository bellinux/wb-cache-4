25|$|After Jacobo Arbenz came {{to power}} in 1951, he {{extended}} political freedom, allowing Communists in Guatemala to participate in politics. This move by Arbenz let many opponents in Ubico’s regime to recognize themselves as Communists. By 1952, Arbenz supported a land reform, and took unused agricultural land, about , from owners who had large properties, and made it available to rural workers and farmers. These lands were to be taken from the United Fruit Company with compensation; however, the UFC believed the compensation was not enough. Meantime, Arbenz allowed the Communist Party to organize and include leaders notably his adviser who were leftist. The propaganda effort that was led by United Fruit Company against the revolution in Guatemala persuaded the U.S. government to fight against communism in Guatemala. The United States clutched on small details to prove the existence of widespread Communism in Guatemala. The Eisenhower administration at the time in the U.S. were not happy about the Arbenz government, they considered Arbenz to be too close to Communism; there have been reports that Arbenz’s wife was a Communist and part of the Communist Party in Guatemala. Even though it was impossible for the U.S. to gather evidence and information about Guatemala’s relations to the Soviet Union, Americans <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Communism existed in Guatemala. Many groups of Guatemalan exiles were armed and trained by the CIA, and commanded by Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas they invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954. The Americans called it an Anti-Communist Coup against Arbenz. The coup was supported by CIA radio broadcasts and so the Guatemalan army refused to resist the coup, Arbenz was forced to resign. In 1954 a military government replaced Arbenz' government and disbanded the legislature and they arrested communist leaders, Castillo Armas became president.|$|E

At the same time, the unaccountable liking I had for the man stirred to life. The act she described had been so characteristic.|$|E

And because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> it wasn't very hard to believe it. There was the empty cage. Of course Farmer Brown's boy wouldn't have gone to the trouble of {{trapping}} Shadow unless he intended {{to get rid of him}} for good.|$|E
60|$|For {{some years}} after my marriage, I too was for leaving them alone. I {{developed}} a dread and dislike for romance, for emotional music, {{for the human}} figure in art--turning my heart to landscape. I wanted to sneer at lovers and their ecstasies, and was uncomfortable until I found the effective sneer. In matters of private morals these were my most uncharitable years. I didn't {{want to think of}} these things any more for ever. I hated the people whose talk or practice showed they were not of my opinion. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> their views were immoral and objectionable and contemptible, because I had decided to treat them as at that level. I was, in fact, falling into the attitude of the normal decent man.|$|E

60|$|Madeline was stirred with an {{anger toward}} the brutal cowboy {{that was as}} strong as her sorrow for the loyal old cattleman. And it was when Stillwell gave up that she {{resolved}} to take a hand. The persistent faith of Stillwell, his pathetic excuses {{in the face of}} what must have been Stewart's violence, perhaps baseness, actuated her powerfully, gave her new insight into human nature. She honored a faith that remained unshaken. And the strange thought came to her that Stewart must somehow be worthy of such a faith, or he never could have inspired it. Madeline discovered that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> somewhere deep down in the most depraved and sinful wretch upon earth there was some grain of good. She yearned to have the faith in human nature that Stillwell had in Stewart.|$|E
60|$|The {{case was}} simple. Sally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Tracy's {{preference}} was disinterested; {{so she was}} always applying little tests {{of one sort or}} another, hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did not know that these experiments were being made upon him, consequently he walked promptly into all the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted in apparently casual references to social distinction, aristocratic title and privilege, and such things. Often Tracy responded to these references heedlessly and not much caring what he said provided it kept the talk going and prolonged the seance. He didn't suspect that the girl was watching his face and listening for his words as one who watches the judge's face and listens for the words which will restore him to home and friends and freedom or shut him away from the sun and human companionship forever. He didn't suspect that his careless words were being weighed, and so he often delivered sentence of death when it would have been just as handy and all the same to him to pronounce acquittal. Daily he broke the girl's heart, nightly he sent her to the rack for sleep. He couldn't understand it.|$|E
60|$|She {{sat down}} to drink her tea. Not being a crying woman, she {{suffered}} quietly. She felt that Miltoun would be coming to her. She did not know at all what she should say when he did come. He could not care for her so much as she cared for him! He was a man; men soon forget! Ah! {{but he was not}} like most men. One could not look at his eyes without feeling that he could suffer terribly! In all this her own reputation concerned her not at all. Life, and her clear way of looking at things, had rooted in her the conviction that to a woman the preciousness of her reputation was a fiction invented by men entirely for man's benefit; a second-hand fetish insidiously, inevitably set-up by men for worship, in novels, plays, and law-courts. Her instinct told her that men could not feel secure in the possession of their women unless they could believe that women set tremendous store by sexual reputation. What they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> they did believe! But she knew otherwise. Such great-minded women as she had met or read of had always left on her the impression that reputation for them was a matter of the spirit, having little to do with sex. From her own feelings she knew that reputation, for a simple woman, meant to stand well in the eyes of him or her whom she loved best. For worldly women--and there were so many kinds of those, besides the merely fashionable--she had always noted that its value was not intrinsic, but commercial; not a crown of dignity, but just a marketable asset. She did not dread in the least what people might say of her friendship with Miltoun; nor did she feel at all that her indissoluble marriage forbade her loving him. She had secretly felt free as soon as she had discovered that she had never really loved her husband; she had only gone on dutifully until the separation, from sheer passivity, and because it was against her nature to cause pain to anyone. The man who was still her husband was now as dead to her as if he had never been born. She could not marry again, it was true; but she could and did love. If that love was to be starved and die away, it would not be because of any moral scruples.|$|E

5000|$|The {{fact that}} the concept existed and had a name showed how {{important}} film still was to American culture, VanAirsdale said. For all the media hand-wringing about television usurping film's grip on our culture's imagination, no one complains about Breaking Bad losing an Emmy to Homeland the way they still yelp {{on and on about}} Crash thwarting Brokeback Mountain for a Best Picture Oscar ... Movie lovers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the academy shares our tastes. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Oscar history reflects an objective sense of aesthetic justice rather than ritual orgies of self-congratulation. We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> every autumn <b>that</b> our cinemas are more than just clearinghouses for expressions of ego and grandiosity. Mostly we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a phrase like Oscar bait is somehow beneath a film culture so obsessed with anointing the best and greatest and top 10 of everything and handing out Academy Awards in the first place. We can't have it both ways, and anyway, why would we <b>want</b> <b>to?</b> As the oldest surviving tradition connecting Hollywood to its audience, Oscar bait is all the movies have left to insulate them from the dull, encroaching disposability of the culture around us. The only empty foolishness I can see is to not enjoy it—to not cherish it—while we still can.|$|R

[...] He stopped {{instantly}} as she momentarily recoiled from him, but {{the very}} brusqueness of his action had dislodged a tear from his dark eyes that fell warm {{on the back of}} her hand, and seemed to blot out the indignity. [...] "Listen, Miss," [...] he went on hurriedly, as if to cover up his momentary unmanliness. [...] "I knew the bear was missing to-night, and when I heard the horses scurrying about I reckoned what was up. I knew no harm could come to you, for the horses were unharnessed and away from the wagon. I pelted down that trail ahead of them all like grim death, calkilatin' to get there before the bear; they wouldn't have understood me; I was too high up to call to the creature when he did come out, and I kinder hoped you wouldn't see him. Even when he turned towards the wagon, I knew it wasn't YOU he was after, but suthin' else, and I kinder hoped, Miss, that you, being different and quicker-minded than the rest, would see it too. All the while them folks were yellin' behind me to fire--as if I didn't know my work. I was half-way down--and then you screamed! And then I forgot everything,--everything but standing clear of hitting you,--and I fired. I was that savage that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he'd gone mad, and would have touched you, till I got down there and found the honey-pot lying alongside of him. But there,--it's all over now! I wouldn't have let on a word to you only I couldn't bear to take YOUR THANKS for it, and I couldn't bear to have you thinking me a brute for dodgin' them." [...] He stopped, walked to the fire, leaned against the chimney under the shallow pretext of kicking the dull embers into a blaze, which, however, had only the effect of revealing his two glistening eyes as he turned back again and came towards her. [...] "Well," [...] he said, with an ineffectual laugh, [...] "it's all over now, it's all in the day's work, I reckon,--and now, Miss, if you're ready, and will just fix yourself your own way so as to ride easy, I'll carry you down."

5000|$|The {{psychologist}} Cyril Burt {{is known}} for his studies on the effect of heredity on intelligence. Shortly after he died, his studies of inheritance and intelligence came into disrepute after evidence emerged indicating he had falsified research data. Tucker's paper (1994) is illuminative on both how [...] "critical reading" [...] was performed in the discovery of the falsified data as well as in many famous psychologists [...] "non-critical reading" [...] of Burt's papers. Tucker shows that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted Cyril Burt's research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> IQ is hereditary and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. This paper thus demonstrates how critical reading (and the opposite) may be related to beliefs as well as to interests and power structures.|$|E
