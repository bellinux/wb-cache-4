5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the salamander's habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation salamanders breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation salamanders breed in spring and early summer. In the higher climates especially, salamanders <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Congress {{required}} jurisdictions seeking bailout {{to produce}} evidence of minority registration and voting rates, including how these rates have changed over time and {{in comparison to the}} registration and voting rates of the majority.

The court will retain jurisdiction for the following 10 years and may order the jurisdiction back into coverage if the jurisdiction subsequently engages in voting discrimination.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the species}} is {{primarily}} fossorial, it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel. Dandelions seem to be its favorite food, and are also used as nesting material. During breeding season males <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> the tunnels of females, and males and females may make purring (or cooing) sounds when they are together. Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing, with the young twittering in response.|$|E

5|$|Brown bats do {{not claim}} feeding areas like a territory, however {{individuals}} frequently {{return to the}} same feeding sites where they have previously made successful catches. When hunting swarms, brown bats usually select {{no more than two}} species. They feed on more species when they are scattered.

When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, the game <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E

5|$|The Su-25UBM is a twin seat variant {{that can}} be used as an {{operational}} trainer, but also has attack capabilities, and can be used for reconnaissance, target designation and airborne control. Its first flight was on 6 December 2008 and it was certified in December 2010. It <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> operational use with the Russian Air Force later. The variant has a Phazotron NIIR Kopyo radar and Bars-2 equipment on board. Su-25UBM's range is believed to be 1,300km and it may have protection against infra-red guided missiles (IRGM), a minimal requirement on today's battle fields where IRGMs proliferate.|$|E
5|$|The mind of William Bell (Leonard Nimoy) still {{possesses}} Olivia's (Anna Torv) body {{after several}} failed attempts to extract it to recently deceased corpses. Walter (John Noble) and William {{believe that they}} have less than a day before Olivia's mind will be lost. They realize that Olivia is unaware that she has been possessed by William's mind, and instead has likely locked her ego away, making it difficult to contact her by normal means. Walter comes up with a plan: he and Peter (Joshua Jackson) <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> Olivia's mind with the aid of LSD to locate her ego and help it to regain dominance in her mind, while Walter hopes to download William's mind into a computer.|$|E
5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> a phase of its life in which it is called a red giant. Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the red giant branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its red giant life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E

5|$|Arriving at {{the ruins}} of Los Angeles, Marcus {{encounters}} Kyle and a mute child named Star (Berry) during a violent skirmish with Skynet's machines. Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then {{make their way to}} John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is indeed a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain; Marcus <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he lets him live.|$|E
5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro wants to take the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011 a new {{reform of}} the Stability and Growth Pact was initiated, aiming at {{straightening}} the rules by adopting an automatic procedure for imposing of penalties in case of breaches of either the 3% deficit or the 60% debt rules. By {{the end of the}} year, Germany, France and some other smaller EU countries went a step further and vowed to create a fiscal union across the eurozone with strict and enforceable fiscal rules and automatic penalties embedded in the EU treaties. On 9 December 2011 at the European Council meeting, all 17 members of the eurozone and six countries that aspire to join agreed on a new intergovernmental treaty to put strict caps on government spending and borrowing, with penalties for those countries who violate the limits. All other non-eurozone countries apart from the UK are also prepared to join in, subject to parliamentary vote. The treaty <b>will</b> <b>enter</b> into force on 1 January 2013, if by that time 12 members of the euro area have ratified it.|$|E
