5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or <b>wet</b> <b>soil</b> substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with distilled, reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E
5|$|Flash {{flooding}} in Pennsylvania resulted in 2,600emergency 911 calls and around 100rescues for cars or houses. The flooding destroyed 12homes, and damaged 336, {{over half of}} them severely. <b>Wet</b> <b>soil</b> downed trees and power lines, causing power outages to 109,000PECO Energy customers. High floodwaters damaged 22bridges and closed 2indefinitely, while the flooding closed several roads, including a portion of U.S. Highway 1 in Chadds Ford. Damage in Pennsylvania totaled to $3.5million (2003 USD, $3.8million 2006USD). The impacts were severely compounded the following week by Hurricane Isabel across the region.|$|E
5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high in <b>wet</b> <b>soil,</b> where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E

5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, {{the storm}} produced a moderate storm surge, causing tidal flooding. In {{a city in}} the northeastern portion of the state, the surge breached a levee, which flooded many homes in the town. Moderate winds combined with <b>wet</b> <b>soil</b> knocked down trees, which then hit a few houses and power lines, and left hundreds of thousands without electric power. Two people drowned from rough surf in Florida. Further inland, tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage. Throughout its path, Tropical Storm Bill caused around $50million in damage (2003USD) and four deaths.|$|E
5|$|Studies on {{the ecology}} of the Chittenango ovate amber snail are fairly recent. It is an herbivorous species which lives in the fresh spray zone of the Chittenango Falls, in {{partially}} sunlit areas with lush herbaceous growth. Several parameters appear to be influential in its habitat selection, namely humidity, substrate, temperature, vegetation, and water quality. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is a hermaphroditic species, and its mating season is from May through July. It lays egg clusters, each one containing an average of 8 to 14 eggs, at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, <b>wet</b> <b>soil.</b> Maturity is reached in five to eight months, and its life span is roughly 2.5 years. Some of its predators include insects, amphibians, mammals, birds, and occasionally other snails.|$|E
5|$|The snails mate from May through July, and {{lay eggs}} from June through July. They are hermaphroditic; however, {{it is unclear}} if self-fertilization is possible. The eggs, {{numbering}} 8 to 14, are approximately 2mm in diameter, spherical, transparent, and very distinctive within a cluster. Generally, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis eggs are not {{found to have a}} heavy gelatinous layer surrounding the entire cluster, which is associated with egg masses of Succinea sp. B. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis egg clusters are deposited at the base of plants, under matted vegetation, or in loose, <b>wet</b> <b>soil.</b> The young snails hatch in 2 to 3 weeks, measuring barely 2mm. It is still unclear when the snails mature, although Grimm (1981) believes they reach maturity in five to eight months, or the spring following hatching. At the end of their first full year of growth, snails observed by Aloi and Ringler (1982) averaged around 10mm. By the end of the following year, the adult snails were observed to reach a length of approximately 21mm; they then die, completing a life span of about 2.5 years. This life span is similar to those in captive populations (Rosamond Gifford Zoo, unpublished data).|$|E

Utricularia are cultivated for their flowers, {{which are often}} {{compared with those of}} snapdragons and orchids, especially amongst carnivorous plant enthusiasts.|$|E
25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or <b>wet</b> <b>soil</b> may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse on the ground is more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep running up and down a tree with nesting materials.|$|E
25|$|These {{are large}} robust flies with massive eyes that often show colored patterns. Antennae are {{characteristic}} with three dissimilar segments projecting forward from head. Wings {{are large and}} strong with complex venation, and often with complex patterns of brown on clear background. These flies are adapted to hunt widely for their hosts during daytime. Females take repeated small blood meals from their hosts to support development of a large batch of eggs. Eggs are laid on <b>wet</b> <b>soil</b> where larvae develop, sometimes over {{one or two years}} by feeding on soil organisms. Males do not feed on blood. Hosts of females include all species of mammalian livestock animals and horses. Tabanid flies have large mouthparts comprising three pairs of cutting / slashing elements that pierce skin in a superficial wound. Blood flowing from this is imbibed through a sponge-like element of the mouthparts, the labella (similar to that shown in photograph of Calliphora).|$|E

500|$|Parsnip canker is {{a serious}} disease of this crop. Black or orange-brown patches occur around the crown and {{shoulders}} of the root accompanied by cracking and hardening of the flesh. It {{is more likely to}} occur when seed is sown into cold, <b>wet</b> <b>soil,</b> the pH of the soil is too low, or the roots have already been damaged by carrot fly larvae. Several fungi are associated with canker, including Phoma complanata, Ilyonectria radicicola, Itersonilia pastinaceae, and I.perplexans. In Europe, Mycocentrospora acerina has been found to cause a black rot that [...] kills the plant early. Watery soft rot, caused by Sclerotinia minor and S.sclerotiorum, causes the taproot to become soft and watery. A white or buff-colored mold grows on the surface. The pathogen is most common in temperate and subtropical regions that have a cool wet season.|$|E
500|$|The natural {{breeding}} habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs, gorges and caves up to 3,700m (12,000ft) above sea level, but this martin also breeds in lowlands, especially if rocks or buildings are available, {{and may be}} found far from water. This species readily uses man-made structures {{as a substitute for}} natural precipices, and has bred on houses in southern Israel since the 1970s. In Egypt it may breed near monuments like Abu Simbel or in desert towns such as Aswan. It uses towns, bridges and cliffs in Ethiopia, and tower blocks [...] in Arabia. In the breeding season, the martin needs mud or <b>wet</b> <b>soil</b> to construct its nests, and this is normally readily found near human habitations. This species appears to be scarce in some forested and coastal areas with high humidity, in which the red-rumped swallow tends to be the common hirundine.|$|E
2500|$|These {{are small}} to minute flies (a typical vernacular name is [...] "no-see-ums").

2500|$|At {{the lower}} {{elevations}} {{of the forest}} (below [...] above sea level) stands the Bosque Tabonuco forest which {{is dominated by the}} majestic Tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa) that can reach up to [...] and grows primarily in protected sites at low elevations. The Tabonuco forest has many of the characteristics for which tropical rain forests are noted. The forest canopy has three levels: an upper level that may be as much as 35% Tabonuco, a lower canopy, and an under story. The second most prominent tree in this forest type, the Montillo (Sloanea berteroana), has large buttress roots, typical of many rain forest trees. Such roots help support the heavy canopy of large trees growing in very <b>wet</b> <b>soil.</b> The forest floor is only scarcely vegetated, but the forest canopy is rich with aerial plants: bromeliads, orchids, vines, and arboreal ferns. The tabonuco type dominates in the subtropical wet life zone.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the cherry}} {{can be a}} {{difficult}} fruit tree to grow and keep alive. [...] In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid ("cherry blackfly", Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), {{which in turn is}} the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, brown rot of the fruit, root rot from overly <b>wet</b> <b>soil,</b> crown rot, and several viruses.|$|E
