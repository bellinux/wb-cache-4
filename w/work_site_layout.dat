In order to study the space utilization of construction sites, research of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning has been carried out and many studies have attempted to solve <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning problems.

40|$|Genetic {{algorithms}} (GAs) {{have been}} introduced into <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning as reported {{in a number of}} studies. In these studies, the objective functions were defined so as to employ the GAs in searching for the optimal <b>site</b> <b>layout.</b> However, few studies have been carried out to investigate the actual closeness of relationships between site facilities; it is these relationships that ultimately govern the <b>site</b> <b>layout.</b> This study has determined that the underlying factors of <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning for medium-size projects include work flow, personnel flow, safety and environment, and personal preferences. By finding the weightings on these factors and the corresponding closeness indices between each facility, a closeness relationship has been deduced. Two contemporary mathematical approaches - fuzzy logic theory and an entropy measure - were adopted in finding these results in order to minimize the uncertainty and vagueness of the collected data and improve the quality of the information. GAs were then applied to searching for the optimal <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> in a medium-size government project using the GeneHunter software. The objective function involved minimizing the total travel distance. An optimal layout was obtained within a short time. This reveals that the application of GA to <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning is highly promising and efficient. Site-layout, entropy, genetic algorithm, decision-making,...|$|R

40|$|The Ten Thousand Islands (TTI) {{region of}} {{southwest}} Florida contains extensive prehistoric shell middens and mounds called shell works. Though shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> comprise {{some of the}} largest and most complicated prehistoric shell constructions in the world, prior to this study, none had been thoroughly examined in their spatial, temporal and functional contexts, and shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> remain very poorly understood. This thesis aims to define the archaeological characteristics of shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> within the TTI region, including their spatial patterns, function, geographic extent, and temporal affiliation. Though shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> are complex, complicated sites that are analogous to palimpsests, I argue that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> are more than just large shell midden accumulations, amalgamations of shell mounds, or assemblages of features; they are distinct, socially constructed prehistoric landscapes. In order to understand these complex histories, I contend that they need to be examined on several complementary temporal and spatial scales, and I incorporate a multi-scalar landscape approach. This includes examining shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> as individually constructed features and sites, as human centered social landscapes, and within a larger, regional settlement pattern context. Central to my thesis is the hypothesis that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> reflect changes in social complexity. I posit that shell <b>work</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the region are arranged in spatially similar patterns, ranging from small, simple shell midden rings, to massive islands completely constructed out of complex arrangements of shell. I test the theory that similarity or diversity in <b>site</b> <b>layouts,</b> and the presence or absence of certain architectural features reflects changes in community and social organization over time, and thus, social complexity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Planning {{construction}} <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> involves identifying, sizing and {{positioning of}} temporary facilities on site, and accordingly {{it has a}} significant impact on the safety and efficiency of construction operations. Although existing <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning models are capable of optimizing travel costs of resources on site, they do not consider safety as an important and independent objective in planning <b>site</b> <b>layouts.</b> This paper presents an enhanced <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning model that enables simultaneous optimization of construction safety and travel cost of resources. The model integrates two recently developed safety performance criteria that are designed to improve the safety of crane operations, and enhance the control of hazardous material on site. The optimization model is designed to consider all relevant decision variables, optimization objectives and practical constraints in this <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> problem, and is implemented using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. As such, the developed model enables construction planners to search for and identify optimal locations of all temporary facilities on site in order to minimize construction safety and cost simultaneously. These new capabilities should prove useful to construction planners and can lead to significant improvements in the safety of construction operations and the cost of constructed facilities...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the serious}} tasks in the {{construction}} planning was the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning as it had a considerable effect on construction sites. However, in practice <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning was often ignored or overlooked due to its complexity. Project Managers often performed a <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning based on experience, ad-hoc rules and first-come-first-serve approach which may lead to inefficient <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> that had {{a negative effect on}} construction projects. Therefore, the automated systems can be considered as the most effective methods to develop an efficient <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> as they fully covered all concerns that cannot be taken into account by manual methods. Although, a lot of automated <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning systems had been developed to support this serious planning task. However, they remained having serious limitations and drawbacks such as a single objective, integrating with regular facilities and site areas only, 2 D <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> representation, inefficient approaches to reflect the dynamic nature of construction sites, ignoring space reuse and facilities relocation, equal area space search, generating static layout, did not cover end users’ requirements, highly complex for users, ignoring the user interaction and lacking of flexibility in the system design. This revealed the need to develop new automated systems to cover the limitations and drawbacks of the existing automated systems and offer the end users’ requirements. Furtherer more, the quantitative study of survey returned by twelve participations from the Egyptian sites guided this research to list the end users’ requirements. These results led to identifying MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as the suitable tool and technique to overcome the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning limitations and shortcomings as well as offer the end users’ requirements. Therefore, this research had developed an automated dynamic <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> planning system (ASLS) which had positive impacts on the construction industry in terms of: (1) improving the <b>site</b> <b>layout</b> and space planning (2) maintaining the construction projects cost and time; (3) improving the overall safety of construction sites; and (4) protecting the surrounding environment. The automated system subjected to a validation process through two construction projects based in Egypt to examine its accuracy and effectiveness. The validation process results proved its accuracy and effectiveness in developing optimal <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> for construction projects. In addition, an evaluation process was used to examine its functionality, completeness, performance, usability and user acceptance through functional (black-box) test, structural (white-box) test and users’ trial. The functional (black-box) and structural (white-box) tests results verified its completeness and performance. The users’ trial results indicated its usability in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction and revealed that it was acceptable to use and efficient as it saved time. This research concluded that the developed automated system (ASLS) was effective and outperformed existing automated systems in generating global <b>site</b> <b>layouts</b> while satisfying the layout constraints by offering a number of new capabilities. Furthermore, this research contributed to knowledge by creating an innovative dynamic space search method and formulation of a novel objective function that minimized the harmful effect of construction activity on the surrounding neighboring.

Nevertheless, work space is neglected or not explicitly represented, and spatial conflicts are not considered in simulation tools. Accordingly, finding possible solutions to spatial conflicts is not integrated within the simulation. Spatial conflicts should be considered and properly resolved because they affect construction performance in terms of safety and productivity, especially when spatial constraints are crucial to the project. A conflict-free simulation provides a better means for the practitioners to check the simulation results and compare various solutions.
