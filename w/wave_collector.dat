It enhances rate of heat transfer from the absorber plate to the over flowing air stream. Various roughness geometries {{have been designed to}} study thermo hydraulic performance of black coated metallic (Al alloy) absorbers under standard testing condition.

At a primary electron energy of 1000 eV, the secondary electron emission yield of smooth CU is about 350 % greater than the lowest value obtained for sputter-textured pyrolitic graphite. The reflected primary electron index of smooth Cu is a factor of 80 greater.

40|$|This study forms part of {{research}} into the optimization of the shape of awave energy collector to improve energy extraction using genetic algorithms. The <b>wave</b> energy <b>collector</b> geometry uses a parametric description based upon bi-cubic B-spline surfaces, generated from {{a relatively small number}} of control points to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. The collector shapes that are optimized have either one or two planes of symmetry. An elementary cost function is used to determine the performance of each candidate solution. The collectors move in two degrees of freedom (surge-and-pitch), and are optimally tuned to absorb the greatest power from a number of incident regular waves, the results being weighted according to a generalized occurrence distribution. High velocities and large collector volumes are penalized. A benchmark collector shape, against which the optimized shapes are compared, is identified. The overall optimization strategy entails performing repeated runs of the algorithm for a fixed number of generations, then restarting the optimization with the run that produces the best result. An appraisal of the results is made, looking at the performance of all the shapes assessed as well as those deemed the best...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} {{of a point}} absorber <b>wave</b> energy <b>collector</b> (WEC) were investigated using the University of New Hampshire (UNH) developed finite element computer program Aqua-FE and tank testing. The WEC design considered here makes use of a buoy rigidly connected to a long, vertical inertia tube which is open {{at the top and}} bottom. A piston-rod assembly is enclosed and connected to the power take-off (PTO) mechanism. Due to inertia of water within the tube, relative motion between the piston and buoy-inertia tube structure occurs, and this drives the PTO. The Aqua-FE model was then used to design a slack mooring system sufficient for holding the WEC on station while minimizing interference with its energy absorption function. The Aqua-FE model was created and validated by comparison to wave tank measurements made using a 1 / 9. 4 scale physical model in experiments conducted in the UNH 36. 6 m long by 3. 66 m wide by 2. 44 m deep wave tank. The mathematical model was then applied to predict full scale response to seas representing extreme storms expected at UNH 2 ̆ 7 s offshore test site south of the Isles of Shoals, NH. Predicted mooring loads were used to specify mooring system hardware. The Aqua-FE model for this system was evaluated using scale model results for free-release tests in heave (vertical displacement), pitch (angular motion), as well as heave in a series of single frequency waves. Wave periods, Froude-scaled to full size, spanned the range of periods observed at the UNH site...|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} results are compared for two high performance, octave bandwidth TWT's that use depressed collectors (MDC's) {{to improve the}} efficiency. The computations were carried out with advanced, multidimensional computer programs that are described here in detail. These programs model the electron beam {{as a series of}} either disks or rings of charge and follow their multidimensional trajectories from the RF input of the ideal TWT, through the slow wave structure, through the magnetic refocusing system, to their points of impact in the depressed <b>collector.</b> Traveling <b>wave</b> tube performance, <b>collector</b> efficiency, and collector current distribution were computed and the results compared with measurements for a number of TWT-MDC systems. Power conservation and correct accounting of TWT and collector losses were observed. For the TWT's operating at saturation, very good agreement was obtained between the computed and measured collector efficiencies. For a TWT operating 3 and 6 dB below saturation, excellent agreement between computed and measured collector efficiencies was obtained in some cases but only fair agreement in others. However, deviations can largely be explained by small differences in the computed and actual spent beam energy distributions. The analytical tools used here appear to be sufficiently refined to design efficient collectors for this class of TWT. However, for maximum efficiency, some experimental optimization (e. g., collector voltages and aperture sizes) will most likely be required...|$|R

40|$|Alpine heavy {{precipitation}} events often affect small catchments, although the circulation pattern {{leading to the}} event extends over the entire North Atlantic. The various scale interactions involved are particularly challenging for the numerical weather prediction of such events. Unlike previous studies focusing on the southern Alps, here a comprehensive study of a {{heavy precipitation}} event in the northern Alps in October 2011 is presented with particular focus {{on the role of}} the large-scale circulation in the North Atlantic/European region. During the event exceptionally high amounts of total precipitable water occurred in and north of the Alps. This moisture was initially transported along the flanks of a blocking ridge over the North Atlantic. Subsequently, strong and persistent northerly flow established at the upstream flank of a trough over Europe and steered the moisture towards the northern Alps. Lagrangian diagnostics reveal that a large fraction of the moisture emerged from the West African coast where a subtropical upper-level cut-off low served as an important moisture <b>collector.</b> <b>Wave</b> activity flux diagnostics show that the ridge was initiated as part of a low-frequency, large-scale Rossby wave train while convergence of fast transients helped to amplify it locally in the North Atlantic. A novel diagnostic for advective potential vorticity tendencies sheds more light on this amplification and further emphasizes the role of the ridge in amplifying the trough over Europe. Operational forecasts misrepresented the amplitude and orientation of this trough. For the first time, this study documents an important pathway for northern Alpine flooding, in which the interaction of synoptic-scale to large-scale weather systems and of long-range moisture transport from the Tropics are dominant. Moreover, the trapping of moisture in a subtropical cut-off near the West African coast is found to be a crucial precursor to the observed European high-impact weather...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY More {{and more}} {{countries}} and regions {{are trying to}} switch their fossil fuel-based energy systems into renewable ones. This transition is taking place because countries are trying to lower the environmental damage done to ecosystems and human health, and to lessen the dependency on fossil fuels. There are, however, still economical, technical and environmental problems prevent-ing this transition from happening. The small size {{and the fact that}} an islands’ energy system is isolated do not speak in favor of a fast transition. The relatively high fossil fuels prices and the relatively high threat from climate change and other fossil fuel related disasters do. In this report an overview of the current island energy system studies in literature has been made, and the effects of using a combination of renewable energy sources, fossil fuels, energy storage systems and a possible submarine cable on an islands’ electricity system are studied. Approximated optimal energy systems are designed for the Faroe Islands and the island Unguja. The energy systems are optimized either from an environmental or from an economical point of view. A model is designed to simulate the energy systems of the case islands. The output of this model shows the total CO 2 -equivalent life cycle emissions and the total costs of the islands’ electricity system. Approximated optimal solutions result from scenarios modeled to study the behavior of different energy system configurations. An environmental optimal solution with and without biomass has been designed, because of the controversy of first generation biomass and the fact that indirect biomass effects have not been taken into account,. 95 - 96 % lower emissions and 27 - 28 % lower costs result from applying the Faroe Islands’ optimal environmental solution, depending on whether the use of biomass was allowed. This solution consists of (biomass,) diesel generators, pumped hydro storage, hydroelectric dams, onshore wind turbines and <b>wave</b> energy <b>collectors.</b> A costs reduction and an emissions reduction of respectively 57 % and 84 % result from the economical optimization on the Faroe Islands. The related energy system consists of the same technologies used in the environmental optimization. An emissions reduction of 85 - 87 % and a costs increase of 2286 - 2840 % result from applying Unguja’s environmental optimum, depending on whether biomass was applied or not. This solu-tion consists of (biomass,) diesel generators, Li-Ion batteries, onshore wind turbines and con-centrated solar collectors. 30 % lower costs and 6 % lower emissions result from Unguja’s eco-nomical optimization. In this energy system a submarine cable is applied. While optimizing, buffering electricity and the controllability of the electricity outputs proofed to be important. Buffering and applying controllable outputs is from an environmental and eco-nomical point of view preferred to installing large amounts of uncontrollable overcapacity. Buff-ering options, like batteries, can more easily be designed in combination with predictable RES patterns. The environmental inputs available on the island and the characteristics of the current electricity system heavily {{determine the extent to which}} the RES are able to lower the costs and the emissions. The approximated environmental and economical optimal results show large differences in costs and emissions. No research is preformed on a possible consensus situation. The approximated economical results from both case islands show an improvement in CO 2 -equivalent life cycle emissions, indicating a possibility for environmental improvement without making economical concessions. Possible future policies like a carbon tax could help linking emissions and costs, creating more space for a total optimization including both environmental and economical factors. ...|$|R
40|$|Traveling {{wave tube}} (TWT) technology, first {{described}} by Rudolf Kompfner {{in the early}} 1940 s, has been {{a key component of}} space missions from the earliest communication satellites in the 1960 s to the Cassini probe today. TWTs are essentially signal amplifiers that have the special capability of operating at microwave frequencies. The microwave frequency range, which spans from approximately 500 MHz to 300 GHz, is shared by many technologies including cellular phones, satellite television, space communication, and radar. TWT devices are superior in reliability, weight, and efficiency to solid-state amplifiers at the high power and frequency levels required for most space missions. TWTs have three main components -an electron gun, slow <b>wave</b> structure, and <b>collector.</b> The electron gun generates an electron beam that moves {{along the length of the}} tube axis, inside of the slow wave circuit. At the same time, the inputted signal is slowed by its travel through the coils of the helical slow wave circuit. The interaction of the electron beam and this slowed signal produces a transfer of kinetic energy to the signal, and in turn, amplification. At the end of its travel, the spent electron beam moves into the collector where its remaining energy is dissipated as heat or harnessed for reuse. TWTs can easily produce gains in the tens of decibels, numbers that are suitable for space missions. To date, however, TWTs have typically operated at fixed levels of gain. This gain is determined by various, unchanging, physical factors of the tube. Traditionally, to achieve varying gain, an input signal s amplitude has had to first be modulated by a separate device before being fed into the TWT. This is not always desirable, as significant distortion can occur in certain situations. My mentor, Mr. Dale Force, has proposed an innovative solution to this problem called direct digital modulation. The testing and implementation of this solution is the focus of my summer internship. The direct digital modulation of a TWT removes the need for a separate amplitude modulation device. Instead, different levels of gain are achieved by varying the electron beam current. The lower the current, the less kinetic energy is available to be transferred to the signal. To vary the current, a grid is placed in-between the electron gun and the slow wave circuit. By changing the voltage across the grid, the electron beam current can be controlled. Grid technology has mostly been used in pulse applications such as radar, where only two voltage states are necessary. For direct digital modulation, however, a continuous range of voltages is required...|$|R
