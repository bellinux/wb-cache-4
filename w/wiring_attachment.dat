Travelling over 300 mph, 75 ft from the ground, the Model Z suddenly pitched up, {{the right wing}} folded beyond the flying <b>wire</b> <b>attachment</b> point, most likely due to aileron flutter stressing the wing spar and causing it to fail. The plane crashed alongside a railroad track in a huge ball of flame and smoke. Lowell Bayles' body was thrown 300 ft from the disintegrated plane.|$|R

Then, the effect of the tripping <b>wire</b> <b>attachment</b> on the flow- and heat transfer characteristics is discussed in comparison with the case that no tripping wire is attached.

5000|$|The {{very first}} watch that {{somebody}} adapted {{to wear on}} a wrist is unknown. The first series of purpose-made wrist watches was produced by Girard-Perregaux in 1880 for the German Navy. During World War I numerous companies, including Omega, Longines, and others produced wrist watches for the military. These watches were of virtually identical style with an enamel dial, wide white numerals, and a luminescent radium hour hand. Often they did not bear {{the name of the}} manufacturer, though the movement, originally designed in the 1890s for ladies’ pendant watches, was marked [...] "Swiss". From pocket watches those trench watches inherited hinged front and back covers. The lugs for a strap looked like a thick <b>wire</b> <b>attachment</b> to the classical round shape of pocket watches rather than an integrated part of the body of the later and modern wrist watches.|$|R
40|$|A unique children’s upper-limb {{prosthesis}} prototype with {{an improved}} suspension and electronic interconnect has been developed. Silicone liners provide effective suspension for prostheses. However, {{they have been}} problematic for the upper extremity myoelectric application. Recently, we fit a child using a silicone liner and hardwired, remote electrodes. During this fitting, a number of challenges were encountered, including wire breakage, difficulty of electrode and <b>wire</b> <b>attachment,</b> and difficulty donning/doffing the prosthesis due to mechanical hindrance from the wires and the modifications made to accommodate them. Consequently, we developed an electromechanical quick-connect attachment. It enables the user to easily connect/disconnect the prosthetic shell and hand system to/from the liner, yet still provides for the mechanical suspension/connection between liner and prosthesis and provides for the electrical connection of sensor electrodes with control electronics. For adults and children with upper-extremity limb loss, this development makes the use of silicone sleeve systems more practical...|$|R

The Patient was then referred to a tertiary care hospital, where esophagoscopy confirmed the location of the denture, but the surgeon there was unable to remove it. Eighteen days after she had swallowed her denture, she was referred to our hospital. Attempts at removal via rigid esophagoscopy were unsuccessful, but the denture was successfully removed via a cervical esophagotomy. A Gastrograffin swallow performed 1 week postsurgically showed no extravasation of the contrast medium, and subsequent follow-ups were unremarkable. We conclude that cervical esophagotomy is a safe method for removing foreign bodies impacted in the cervical esophagus when they cannot be removed endoscopically...|$|R
50|$|A polysomnogram will {{typically}} {{record a}} minimum of 12 channels requiring {{a minimum of}} 22 <b>wire</b> <b>attachments</b> to the patient. These channels vary in every lab and may be adapted to meet the doctor's requests. There is {{a minimum of three}} channels for the EEG, one or two measure airflow, one or two are for chin muscle tone, one or more for leg movements, two for eye movements (EOG), one or two for heart rate and rhythm, one for oxygen saturation and one each for the belts which measure chest wall movement and upper abdominal wall movement. The movement of the belts is typically measured with piezoelectric sensors or respiratory inductance plethysmography. This movement is equated to effort and produces a low-frequency sinusoidal waveform as the patient inhales and exhales. Because movement is equated to effort, this system of measurement can produce false positives. It is possible, especially during obstructive apneas, for effort to be made without measurable movement.|$|R
40|$|A comparative, {{theoretical}} {{study of}} intrinsic and conventional sheathed, beaded thermocouple frequency responses {{has been carried}} out for a limited range of heat impulses in order to highlight differences in their responses for measurements in liquid sodium flows such as are met in exit plenums of nuclear reactor sub-assemblies. The mathematical model consists of a thin impulse layer surrounding the thermocouple, all of which is immersed in a pool of sodium. Only axisymmetric cases are considered for ease of computation but different positions and thicknesses of the impulse layer are included in the study. In the range of normally occurring frequencies of temperature fluctuations in the exit plenum of reactor sub-assemblies, the intrinsic thermocouple is seen to have almost a perfect response but only if the heated layer is in contact with the <b>wire</b> <b>attachment</b> point of the couple. This is attributed to the fact that sodium surrounding the thermocouple and impulse layer dominates the heat diffusion due to its very high thermal conductivity. The sheathed, beaded thermocouple has a poor frequency response even in the range of normally occurring frequencies...|$|R
5000|$|A Polysomnography test (PSG) {{records the}} {{biological}} changes during sleep through monitoring the brain (Electroencephalography, EEG), eye movement (Electrooculography, EOG), heart rhythm (Electrocardiogram, ECG), and muscle activity (Electromyography, EMG). Typically a complete PSG requires {{a minimum of}} 12 channels and 22 <b>wire</b> <b>attachments</b> and produces a “score” or report. Sleep stages are identifiable through comparison of the EEG, EOG and EMG channels with stages 1 and 2 being defined as light sleep, 3 being slow wave sleep and 4 being REM sleep. Additionally a PSG can reveal “arousals” or sudden shifts in brain wave activity. [...] Analyzing the resulting amount of REM sleep in combination with patient reported dream experience has been the method of choice for recent dream studies. In particular researchers can wake the patient mid-REM sleep and ask for dream experience, which in normal patients would enhance their recollection and dream count. Absence of dream experience suggests the presence of CWS and this test method can also help to illustrate whether the patient is suffering from an inability to recall visual images or complete dream loss.|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{thin film}} sensors are being {{developed}} to provide accurate surface temperature, heat flux and strain measurements for components used in hostile propulsion environments. These sensors are sputter deposited and microfabricated directly onto the test articles with no additional bonding agent. The thickness of the sensors {{is only a few}} micrometers which creates minimal disturbance of the gas flow over the test surface. Thus thin film sensors have the advantage over conventional wire- based sensors by providing minimally intrusive measurement and having a faster response. These thin film sensors {{are being developed}} for characterization of advanced materials and structures in hostile, high-temperature environments, and for validation of design codes. This paper presents the advances of three high temperature thin film sensor technologies developed at NASA Lewis Research Center: thermocouples, heat-flux gages and strain gages. The fabrication techniques of these thin film sensors which include physical vapor deposition, photolithography patterning and lead <b>Wire</b> <b>attachment</b> are described. Sensors demonstrations on a variety of engine materials, including superalloys, ceramics and advanced ceramic matrix composites, in several hostile, high-temperature test environments are presented. The advantages and limitations of thin film sensor technology are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to determine the variables which affect the stability of a stud-welded vibrating wire strain gage. The lack of previously published information {{and the nature of the}} instrument required an origonal design. When undesirable conditions were noted, an attempt has been made to eliminate such conditions through a change in design of gage components or installation techniques. Two basic configurations have been studied, differing in the manner in which wire tension is maintained. Both types were subjected to zero drift observations and calibration tests. The results of these tests indicate that the classic method of <b>wire</b> <b>attachment,</b> that of squeezing the wire ends between a pair of anvils or pins, aggravates the natural tendency of the wire to relax under tension and introduces a drift error which is difficult to predict. The second configuration, developed during the investigation, is similar to that utilized in tuning a piano or violin. Eliminating the deformation of the wire cross section greatly reduces relaxation and hence the error introduced by drift. Both configurations proved to be very accurate and dependable for short term tests...|$|R

[...] Mr. Watson, five miles away in Somerville, promptly answered in the affirmative, and soon was heard a voice singing [...] "America". [...] Going to another instrument, connected by wire with Providence, forty-three miles distant, Mr. Bell listened a moment, and said, [...] "Signor Brignolli, who is assisting at a concert in Providence Music Hall, will now sing for us." [...] In a moment the cadence of the tenor's voice rose and fell, the sound being faint, sometimes lost, and then again audible. Later, a cornet solo played in Somerville was very distinctly heard. Still later, a three-part song came over the wire from Somerville, and Mr. Bell told his audience [...] "I will switch off the song {{from one part of}} the room to another so that all can hear." [...] At a subsequent lecture in Salem, Massachusetts, communication was established with Boston, eighteen miles distant, and Mr. Watson at the latter place sang [...] "Auld Lang Syne", the National Anthem, and [...] "Hail Columbia", while the audience at Salem joined in the chorus.|$|R
40|$|Eldana saccharina Walker (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) moths can be {{monitored}} in sugarcane using a modified Robinson light trap {{but there are}} several shortcomings associated with this particular technique. Amongst these are the necessity for a power source and the nonselectivity of the catch. There is ongoing research at SASRI towards developing a pheromone trap for this major pest. In field trials the standard white or yellow Delta ™ insect trap was recently tested with and without crude pheromone lures made from excised abdomens of laboratory bred E. saccharina males. In addition, {{because it has been}} known by entomologists for many years that catch in light traps are considerably higher near the period of new moon than near full moon, the performance of white and yellow standard traps and specially modified white and yellow reflective traps, was tested in relation to lunar periodicity. Delta traps would be suitable to use in sugarcane. Specific features rendering this trap particularly suitable include: readily available commercially (www. insectscience. co. za); small and portable (110 x 200 x 280 mm); made from coryx (plastic) which is durable and resistant to the vagaries of the weather; a <b>wire</b> <b>attachment</b> on the top allows the trap to be set at canopy height, and a sticky liner within the trap retains the catch for easy counting...|$|R
40|$|The {{safety of}} the driving {{experience}} and manoeuvrability of a vehicle can be improved by detecting the strain in tyres. To measure strain accurately in rubber, the strain sensor needs to be flexible {{so that it does}} not deform the medium that it is measuring. In this work, a novel flexible bond wire capacitive strain sensor for measuring the strain in tyres is developed, fabricated and calibrated. An array of 25 micron diameter wire bonds in an approximately 8 mm × 8 mm area is built to create an interdigitated structure, which consists of 50 wire loops resulting in 49 capacitor pairs in parallel. Laser machining was used to pattern copper on a flexible printed circuit board PCB to make the bond pads for the <b>wire</b> <b>attachment.</b> The <b>wire</b> array was finally packaged and embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which acts as the structural material that is strained. The capacitance of the device is in a linear like relationship with respect to the strain, which can measure the strain up to at least ± 60, 000 micro-strain (± 6 %) with a resolution of ~ 132 micro-strain (0. 013 %). In-tyre testing under static loading has shown the ability of the sensor to measure large tyre strains. The technology used for sensor fabrication lends itself to mass production and so the design is considered to be consistent with low cost commercialisable strain sensing technology...|$|R

40|$|Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) {{are being}} {{developed}} for use as enabling materials for advanced aeropropulsion engine and high speed civil transport applications. The characterization and testing of these advanced materials in hostile, high-temperature environments require accurate measurement of the material temperatures. Commonly used wire Thermo-Couples (TC) can not be attached to this ceramic based material via conventional spot-welding techniques. <b>Attachment</b> of <b>wire</b> TC's with commercially available ceramic cements fail to provide sufficient adhesion at high temperatures. While advanced thin film TC technology provides minimally intrusive surface temperature measurement and has good adhesion on the CMC, its fabrication requires sophisticated and expensive facilities and is very time consuming. In addition, the durability of lead <b>wire</b> <b>attachments</b> to both thin film TC's and the substrate materials requires further improvement. This paper presents a newly developed attachment technique for installation of free filament wire TC's with a unique convoluted design on ceramic based materials such as CMC's. Three CMC's (SiC/SiC CMC and alumina/alumina CMC) instrumented with type IC, R or S wire TC's were tested in a Mach 0. 3 burner rig. The CMC temperatures measured from these wire TC's were compared to that from the facility pyrometer and thin film TC's. There {{was no sign of}} TC delamination even after several hours exposure to 1200 C. The test results proved that this new technique can successfully attach wire TC's on CMC's and provide temperature data in hostile environments. The sensor fabrication process is less expensive and requires very little time compared to that of the thin film TC's. The same installation technique/process can also be applied to attach lead wires for thin film sensor systems...|$|R

40|$|My thesis {{research}} has focused on the biomedical applications of microfluidic devices, including accommodating liquid intraocular lens, wirelessly powered dielectrophoresis microfluidic platform, and evaporative microarray for molecular in-vitro diagnosis. In the first part, I developed an accommodating intraocular lens that can largely improve cataract patients' living quality by enabling patients to focus on far distance as well as near distance. Compared to natural eyes, today's commercially available accommodating IOLs produce a much limited tuning range. The large performance gap is attributed to the fundamental difference between crystalline lens and the optic-shift IOLs in the operation principles. In the thesis we designed and made a fluidic IOL that can change its curvature as the crystalline lens does. Both mechanical performance and optical quality are tested under the physiological conditions of aged eyes, promising complete restoration of vision accommodation. In the second part, I reported the first microfluidic device integrated with a printed RF circuit so that the device can be wirelessly powered by a commerciallyavailable radio -frequency identification (RFID) reader. The device eliminates the need for <b>wire</b> <b>attachments</b> and external instrument, so the operators can use the device in essentially the same manner as they do with microscope slides. The integrated circuit can be fabricated on a flexible plastic substrate at very low cost using a roll- to-roll printing method. Electrical power at 13. 56 MHz transmitted by a RFID reader is inductively coupled to the printed RFIC and converted into 10 V DC (direct current) output, which provides sufficient power to drive a microfluidic device to manipulate biological particles such as beads and proteins via the DC dielectrophoresis (DC-DEP) effect. In the third part, I developed a mathematical model for microarray probe/target reaction. The analysis was based on any chemical reaction between target molecules suspended in solution react and probes immobilized on a solid substrate, so {{it can be used to}} analysis hybridization efficiency in genomic microarray, as well as binding efficiency in protein microarray. The model indicated that besides diffusion, electrical repelling force between negatively charged probe and target molecules is the main cause for low hybridization efficiency. Based on the model, we further proposed a novel evaporative microarray, which can reduce the target solution thickness down to 80 [mu]m and theoretically enrich the concentration of molecules up to 1000 fold before target/probe chemical reaction. Preliminary data demonstrated the feasibility of integration of evaporation with microarray using black silicon templat...|$|R

40|$|Management of deep sternal wound {{infection}} (SWI), {{a serious}} complication after cardiac surgery with high {{morbidity and mortality}} incidence, requires invasive procedures such as, debridement with primary closure or myocutaneous flap reconstruction along with use of broad spectrum antibiotics. The purpose of this clinical series is to investigate the presence of biofilm in patients with deep SWI. A biofilm is a complex microbial community in which bacteria attach to a biological or non-biological surface and are embedded in a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance. Biofilm related infections represent a major clinical challenge due to their resistance to both host immune defenses and standard antimicrobial therapies. Candidates for this clinical series were patients scheduled for a debridement procedure of an infected sternal wound after a cardiac surgery. Six patients with SWI were recruited in the study. All cases had marked dehiscence of all layers of the wound down to the sternum with no signs of healing after receiving broad spectrum antibiotics post-surgery. After consenting patients, tissue and/or extracted stainless steel wires were collected during the debridement procedure. Debrided tissues examined by Gram stain showed large aggregations of Gram positive cocci. Immuno-fluorescent staining of the debrided tissues using a specific antibody against staphylococci demonstrated the presence of thick clumps of staphylococci colonizing the wound bed. Evaluation of tissue samples with scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging showed three-dimensional aggregates of these cocci attached to the wound surface. More interestingly, SEM imaging of the extracted <b>wires</b> showed <b>attachment</b> of cocci aggregations to the wire metal surface. These observations along with the clinical presentation of the patients provide the first evidence that supports the presence of biofilm in such cases. Clinical introduction of the biofilm infection concept in deep SWI may advance the current management strategies from standard antimicrobial therapy to anti-biofilm strategy...|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{combination}} tool (essentially {{the same}} as the M-1943 but {{with the addition of a}} folding pick) remained in the inventory with the M1956 equipment, but a new cover came into use. The new cover was similar in shape to the earlier M1943 cover, reflecting the shape of the head of the folding shovel and incorporating an opening at the bottom for the straight wooden handle. The rounded triangular flap at the top of the cover closed by means of a blackened metal snap in place of a lift-the-dot fastener, and was attached to the pistol belt or attachments on the side of the Field Pack with two slide keepers in place of a wire hanger. Another distinct feature was the addition of a means of attaching a bayonet directly to the Entrenching Tool Cover, saving space on the pistol belt. All bayonets in the inventory at the time, as well as the later models for the M14 and M16, which utilized the same scabbard, used <b>wire</b> hanger <b>attachments,</b> and the E-Tool cover featured a leather-reinforced tab with metal eyelets from which to hang the bayonet, as well as a web strab with metal snap to hold the scabbard against the cover, and keep it from bouncing. The E-Tool Cover also featured leather reinforcement along the top opening to prevent the continual removal and replacement of the E-Tool blade from degrading the canvas. Placement of the E-Tool and cover was generally {{the same as}} for the canteen, taking its place on the pistol belt on the other side of the Field Pack or on the Field Pack's side attachment points. With the introduction of larger rucksacks (see Complementary Equipment) in lieu of and supplementing the Field Pack, the E-Tool and cover was often moved to attachment points on these items, preventing the awkward bounce of the handle against the leg, and freeing space on the pistol belt.|$|R
