Impressions and photographs were also taken of the woman’s injured nose. These samples along with other models and casts were evaluated using a variety of techniques, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional comparisons, and acetate overlays. Three experts testified that the bite marks on the woman’s nose were indeed made by Marx and he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.|$|E

He was educated at three independent schools for boys: Redcliffe School, a day school in Chelsea's Redcliffe Square, Sussex House School, a day school in Chelsea's Cadogan Square, and the City of London School, a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London's financial district (known as the City of London). Attending school became difficult for Radcliffe after the release of the first Harry Potter film, with some fellow pupils becoming hostile, though he says it <b>was</b> <b>people</b> just trying to [...] "have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter" [...] rather than jealousy.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the target}} {{audience}} of Burning Rangers <b>was</b> <b>people</b> who enjoyed action games, the developers also wanted to attract fans of other Sonic Team games. Ohshima stressed that he was aiming at a wider audience and {{not the type of}} person who only played Sonic the Hedgehog, adding that [...] "players should recognise the Sonic Team touch immediately" [...] with Burning Rangers. The working title was Firefighter, but it was dropped as the team wanted a [...] "cooler" [...] sounding name. Naka felt that [...] "burning" [...] had a [...] "go for it!" [...] connotation in Japanese, and fit with the disaster-rescue theme. He was initially unsure about having [...] "ranger" [...] in the title as he felt that a ranger referred to park rangers in western culture. The team thought that the image of a [...] "ranger" [...] also brought to mind the Power Rangers franchise, and after consulting speakers of other languages, Burning Rangers was chosen as the game's name.|$|E
500|$|According to the series' {{director}} Gorō Taniguchi, {{the idea}} for s-CRY-ed originated in 1999 {{when he was working}} on the series Infinite Ryvius. One of Infinite Ryviuss themes <b>was</b> <b>people</b> communicating with each other. The series' staff wanted to show people already on their own paths, focusing more on individualism. With the storyline beginning in the early 21st century, Taniguchi said the cast would already have adapted to the new times allowing s-CRY-ed to take more themes from Infinite Ryvius. The title s-CRY-ed is basically a combination of one English word and Japanese. The first lower-case [...] "s" [...] is a representation of the Japanese word su which means something in its natural form and not artificial. [...] "Cry" [...] comes from the English, and the last [...] "ed" [...] represents a person. Combined as [...] "s-CRY-ed" [...] the Sunrise studio staff wanted it to express the idea of how people react or interact when they are in their most natural state. They had devised the word when the project was in its early phases of production, and while {{it was meant to be}} a temporary name, the staff ended up using it as the title.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early {{for what it}} <b>was.</b> <b>People</b> reacted {{negatively}} and the press didn't help.

[...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{considered}} the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas" [...] and [...] "Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, [...] "The general rule <b>was</b> <b>people</b> hated musicals". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey {{would prove to be}} real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said [...] "really bummed me out". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press.|$|E
500|$|Author T. C. McNult has {{referred}} to the Stork Club during its existence as [...] "the most celebrated nightspot in the world"; while author Ed McMahon has called it the [...] "most realistic nightclub of all", a name [...] "synonymous with fame, class, and money, in no particular order". [...] Society writer Lucius Beebe wrote in 1946: [...] "To {{millions and millions of}} people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and epitomizes the de luxe upholstery of quintessentially urban existence. It means fame; it means wealth; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk". The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time, but the real purpose of the Stork Club, according to journalist Ed Sullivan, <b>was</b> <b>people</b> watching other people, particularly non-celebrities watching celebrities. Author Mearl L. Allen, however, highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground, and that [...] "many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time", and the likes of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball could often be seen conversing with executive types. Mark Bernardo, author of Mad Men's Manhattan: The Insider's Guide, has said: [...] "In some ways, the Stork Club was ahead of its time—courting celebrities by picking up their tabs, hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids, and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room, where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans, all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names". The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years, and dining orders could {{take a long time to}} be dealt with.|$|E

2500|$|Financially {{secure from}} his writing, Voelker {{resigned}} from the Michigan Supreme Court, telling Governor Williams, [...] "other people can write my opinions, but none can write my books. I have learned that I can't do both so regretfully I must quit the court." [...] He continued writing, publishing several books on fishing or legal themes. The first wasTrout Madness in 1960, followed by the political drama Hornstein’s Boy in 1961. He returned to fishing with Anatomy of a Fisherman in 1964, a picture book that included the soliloquy [...] "Testament of a Fisherman", which to {{a vast number of}} trout anglers, Voelker’s piece best exemplifies the love of this sport. Voelker continued to write about fishing or the courtroom through 1960s and 1970s. He authored a column called “The Traver Treatment” in the Detroit News Sunday Magazine in 1967-68. His last book <b>was</b> <b>People</b> Versus Kirk in 1981, and the last short story of his that was published was titled “Dangling Angling Genes” and appeared in the May–June 1990 issue of Rod & Reel magazine. Several of his fishing books were anthologies of short stories he had written, some of which had already been printed in magazines like Field & Stream.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, the Chao {{brothers}} and their cousin Santiago Casariego founded the multiracial band Mano Negra. Manu Chao said in Alt.Latino in 2011, [...] "Mano Negra started {{playing in a}} subway in Paris before the band started to be known and selling records. We started in a subway for a living. This is what made the musicians of Mano Negra. And so the people using the subway in Paris was very eclectic. There <b>was</b> <b>people</b> {{from a lot of}} different countries, different cultures. So {{we have to be able}} to play all kind of music to please all the people in a subway. So that was a perfect school to learn a lot of different styles of music." [...] Starting on a smaller label, the group released a reworked version of the Hot Pants single [...] "Mala Vida" [...] in 1988, which quickly became a hit in France. The group soon moved to Virgin Records, and their first album Patchanka was released the following year. Though the group never gained much fame in the English-speaking market, popularity throughout the rest of the world soon followed, reaching the Top 5 in the Netherlands, Italy and Germany. The band achieved some fame in South America with 1992's Cargo Tour, where it played a series of shows in port cities, performing from a stage built into their tour ship's hold. Mano Negra also performed a tour through much of Colombia in a retired train, the [...] "Ice Express". [...] Still, rifts began to grow among band members during the port tour and the following year's train tour; many band members, including Manu's brother Antoine, had left the group by the end of 1994. Following that year's release of their final album, Casa Babylon, Manu Chao moved the band to Madrid, but legal problems with former band mates led Chao to disband the group in 1995.|$|E
