25|$|By {{the third}} round things started to get interesting. Amelita, David and Hayley took up the {{challenge}} in the Australian-themed episode. Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> and that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Hoang of CMJ {{praised the}} episode's visuals, {{highlighting}} {{the incorporation of}} the short film Murmuration by Liberty Smith and Sophie Windsor Clive. Chris Martins of Spin magazine enjoyed the colorful and psychedelic visuals. He found the episode appealing to stoner culture, ending his review stating that the special is [...] "tailor-made for late nights in haze-filled dorm rooms." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum reviewed the special positively, calling the episode an [...] "oddly patriotic work that pulls {{in all sorts of}} American iconography". Rachel Haas of Paste magazine praised the special being released close to Independence Day, stating [...] "this suite would possibly soundtrack the coolest, weirdest fireworks show ever." [...] Leor Galil of the Chicago Reader featured the video for his [...] "12 O'Clock Track", praising Hughes' manipulation of Cityscape Chicago by cinematographer Eric Hines. However, given the tracks' length, he argued the episode would best be enjoyed [...] "through a nice pair of speakers at a barbecue instead of spending that time <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> affixed to a computer screen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} grew uncomfortable with their success, {{with much of}} the burden of Pearl Jam's {{popularity}} falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for [...] "Jeremy", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for [...] "Black" [...] in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that [...] "Before music videos first came out, you’d listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, and you’d come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression." ...|$|E

[...] It originally began as a [...] "gathering for Indigo kids" [...] but developed into a [...] "movement of Integrity, Love and Unity" [...] which is [...] "trying to be the best you can be, taking responsibility for your reality and living <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> open. It's not some religious preachy thing, rather being a passenger in this dimension, trying {{to make the most of}} your experience and striving for perfection while understanding it's okay not to be perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Emily Temple of American Songwriter {{praised the}} record as [...] "impossibly optimistic," [...] writing that [...] "The music is charismatic and chaotic, full of shouts, clanging and bright guitars — {{listen to it}} <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> closed and you’ll see {{everything}} short of sparkling blue stars." [...] Alternative Press called the music on In Light [...] "enthralling," [...] summarizing that [...] "Givers have created a debut that will surely set them atop the indie-rock world, if not only for their strict adherence to trying everything possible and succeeding gloriously at it all." [...] Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is [...] "best absorbed in small portions, allowing you to savor the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes," [...] feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Music parsed the record, describing it as [...] "an exhilarating first listen: you just don’t know what’s going to happen next." ...|$|E
