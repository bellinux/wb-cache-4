6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} {{considered}} {{what it must}} be like to be a man who doesn't exist? I mean to be a man with a fictitious character that he has to keep up at the expense not merely of personal talents: To be a new kind of hypocrite hiding a talent in a new kind of napkin. This man has chosen his hypocrisy very ingeniously; it was really a new one. A subtle villain has dressed up as a dashing gentleman and a worthy business man and a philanthropist and a saint; but the loud checks of a comical little cad were really rather a new disguise. But the disguise must be very irksome to a man who can really do things. This is a dexterous little cosmopolitan guttersnipe who can do scores of things, not only shoot, but draw and paint, and probably play the fiddle. Now a man like that may find the hiding of his talents useful; but he could never help wanting to use them where they were useless. If he can draw, he will draw absent-mindedly on blotting paper. I suspect this rascal has often drawn poor old Puggy's face on blotting paper. Probably he began doing it in blots as he afterward did it in dots, or rather shots. It was the same sort of thing; he found a disused target in a deserted yard and couldn't resist indulging in a little secret shooting, like secret drinking. You thought the shots all scattered and irregular, and so they were; but not accidental. No two distances were alike; but the different points were exactly where he wanted to put them. There's nothing needs such mathematical precision as a wild caricature. I've dabbled a little in drawing myself, and I assure you that to put one dot <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> is a marvel with a pen close to a piece of paper. It was a miracle to do it across a garden with a gun. But a man who can work those miracles will always itch to work them, if it's only in the dark." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2005, Hammond curated Shezad Dawood's Paradise Row. [...] Dawood {{bought a}} {{run-down}} Georgian house in Paradise Row, Bethnal Green and renovated the property with the interior being white throughout. It was then {{put up for}} sale through an estate agent, Blake Stanley, the result being simultaneously an art exhibition and a conventional property vending. [...] Hammond said, [...] "Fantasy is really important, {{both in terms of}} architecture and <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to live. Architecture is all about a projection of <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to live, <b>it's</b> about imagining space that doesn't actually exist yet."

[...] Lapham went on, as he scanned his newspaper, {{to give his}} ideas of public questions, in a fragmentary way, while Corey listened patiently, and {{waited for him to}} come back to business. He folded up his paper at last, and stuffed it into his coat pocket. [...] "There's one thing I always make it a rule to do," [...] he said, [...] "and that is to give my mind a complete rest from business while I'm going down on the boat. I like to get the fresh air all through me, soul and body. I believe a man can give his mind a rest, just the same as he can give his legs a rest, or his back. All he's got to do is to use his will-power. Why, I suppose, if I hadn't adopted some such rule, with the strain I've had on me for the last ten years, I should 'a' been a dead man long ago. That's the reason I like a horse. You've got to give your mind to the horse; you can't help it, unless you want to break your neck; but a boat's different, and there you got to use your will-power. You got to take your mind right up and put it <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it.</b> I make it a rule to read the paper on the boat----Hold on!" [...] he interrupted himself to prevent Corey from paying his fare to the man who had come round for it. [...] "I've got tickets. And when I get through the paper, I try to get somebody to talk to, or I watch the people. It's an astonishing thing to me where they all come from. I've been riding up and down on these boats for six or seven years, and I don't know but very few of the faces I see on board. Seems to be a perfectly fresh lot every time. Well, of course! Town's full of strangers in the summer season, anyway, and folks keep coming down from the country. They think it's a great thing {{to get down to the}} beach, and they've all heard of the electric light on the water, and they want to see it. But you take faces now! The astonishing thing to me is not what a face tells, but what it don't tell. When you think of what a man is, or a woman is, and what most of 'em have been through before they get to be thirty, it seems as if their experience would burn right through. But it don't. I like to watch the couples, and try to make out which are engaged, or going to be, and which are married, or better be. But half the time I can't make any sort of guess. Of course, where they're young and kittenish, you can tell; but where they're anyways on, you can't. Heigh?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{controls}} {{in the game}} allow you to have full stick control on both offense and defense. On the offensive side you can control your dekes by moving the right analog stick. This does a deke in the direction the analog stick was pushed. Also on offense when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to deke out a goalie you hold the preset button(ex: for Advance hold L1+O)and move the stick with the left analog stick and then release to shoot. This provides for exciting dekes, but also on offense you can protect the puck from poke-checking defensemen by hold circle and choosing <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to protect <b>it</b> with the analog stick. On the other side the defensive stick control allows you to skate backwards and also swing your stick across the ice to hit the puck away from the opposing player.|$|R

Today, the Library is using modern communication technology to make its unparalleled collections and other authoritative health information available directly to the general public. The NLM, which is currently located {{on the campus of}} the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, had its start more than 160 years ago in the office of the U. S. Army Surgeon General. Index Medicus, begun in 1879, is still published by the NLM and is found in many medical libraries around the world. MED-LINE, the on-line database of references and abstracts to journal articles (including Effective Clinical Practice), appeared almost 30 years ago. It has been called “the Model T of online databases”: Although it usually got <b>you</b> <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to go, <b>it</b> required a pioneering spirit to master its intricacies and the patience of Job to deal with its idiosyncrasies. Even so, the NLM received more requests than it could handle from medical librarians who wanted to be trained so that they could provide literature-search services for health professionals and scientists in hospitals, universities, and laboratories. The original system covered 239 journals, and the NLM boasted that it was “capable of supporting up to 25 simultaneous users. ” 1 In the past few years, the Library has made tremendous efforts to make its contents more accessible to health professionals and the general public through the Internet. In this Policy Matters, I review the origins of this effort and describe four of our Web sites (Table 1). I conclude with the Library’s recent efforts to provide Internet access to people in the United States who are not connected.

5000|$|On directing, Stewart {{noted on}} Lazarus's show that [...] "The Daily Show" [...] {{influenced}} his directing process {{more than his}} acting gigs did.

Below a large viewing screen {{on one end of the}} set was a series of art panels containing illustrations of previous ships bearing the name Enterprise.
