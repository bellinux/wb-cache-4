5|$|By 2000, {{deliveries}} were delayed, and in June all trams <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{of service}} {{for three weeks}} to modify the gearboxes. In October, ten of thirteen trams <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service due to radial run-out. The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E
5|$|Many NSB Class 69 units <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> from {{traffic in}} 2013-2015, {{replaced}} by Class 75 units.|$|E

50|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} the festival is the Garuda Vahanam, where the main deity placed on the idol of Garuda <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession on a richly decorated palanquin that resembles the one on which Lord Vishnu <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> during the Theerthavari at the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The Garuda Vahanam <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on all the Saturdays of the Purattasi month.|$|R
50|$|During the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large {{procession}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{covering the}} town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on every full moon day.|$|R
50|$|The map {{pool was}} changed for this major. Dust II <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{of the active}} map pool and Valve reintroduced Inferno, which has been revamped since it <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Station 2 {{generating}} units <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{of operation}} in 1978, but {{as late as}} 2009 the building was used for such purposes as a waste water treatment facility for the adjacent operational units, office and warehouse space, and transmission and fiber optic lines.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{was carried}} out in Ruthwaite Cove, and the remains of several levels and some shallow open {{workings}} are visible near Ruthwaite Lodge. These excavations were made in a search for lead-bearing galena, and are believed to have been worked in the 16th century. Further leases <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in 1784 and 1862; the last known operation was in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo, {{which publishes}} the Pokémon video games, asked for changes {{to be made}} to the English {{adaptation}} of the episode. Some graphic sequences involving punching <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out,</b> including one where Misty slaps Ash on the cheek. The script was translated by Paul Taylor. Veronica Taylor, who provided the English voice of Ash in this episode, said she enjoyed the script and recording Ash's lines.|$|E
50|$|However, if it <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> since 1 April 2013, it {{can only}} be {{recovered}} if it <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> to cover the costs of an expert's report in a claim for clinical negligence.|$|R

5|$|The Severn Beach Line {{declined}} {{over the}} latter half of the twentieth century, with passenger numbers falling significantly. Goods services at Shirehampton ended in 1965, and all staff were withdrawn in 1967. The second platform and signal box <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of use in 1970, with the station buildings sold off and later destroyed by fire. Services had decreased to ten per day each direction by 2005, but have since increased to twenty-four trains per day.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, the new El 13 {{locomotives}} were delivered, and locomotive-hauled express trains {{replaced the}} multiple units. From 28 May 1967, Class 66 {{was moved to}} serve the Vestfold Line. It operated in services to Skien until 3 June 1973, after which it only served to Larvik. During the summer of 1975, they could also be seen operating OsloV – Nelaug, and during the fall of 1976 on OsloV – Drammen. The units <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service on 21 May 1977. A single motor car, 66.01, has been preserved by the Norwegian Railway Museum, who has stationed it at Elverum Station.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, all twelve T2000 units <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service, {{before the}} last of the much older T1300. Kollektivtransportproduksjon, the {{successor}} of Oslo Sporveier, stated that procuring spare parts was becoming nearly impossible and that the small size of the series forced high maintenance costs. The initial orders for MX3000 trains did not call for sufficient numbers to replace the T2000. Kollektivtransportproduksjon has estimated the cost of renovating the units so they can run for 15 more years at NOK50 million. Alternatively, the city council has been recommended by Kollektivtransportproduksjon to purchase 15 new MX3000 three-car trains for NOK250 million.|$|E
50|$|Andrew J. Higgins <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{of active}} service on 6 May 1996 {{and placed in}} reserve in the National Defense Reserve Fleet in Suisun Bay at Benicia, California, where she {{remained}} until September 2009. She was the first ship of her class to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service.|$|R
5000|$|Easter {{is celebrated}} in Cabana {{similar to the}} festivities in Ayacucho, Peru. Easter is celebrated for an entire week. Starting on Palm Sunday in which the Cabanistas recall the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem sitting on a donkey. On Holy Wednesday, the statues of Jesus and Maria <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession, recalling the famous {{encounter}} between these two religious characters. On Holy Thursday, after Mass, where the priest wash the feet to the brotherhood members of Holy Thursday, the statue of Jesus crucified <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession. Good Friday at 3 pm the cabanistas recall the death of Jesus {{and later in the}} night the image of Jesus in his coffin <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession. On Holy Saturday the image of Jesus alive <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession ...|$|R

5|$|In 2015, Ben Serotta helped {{redesign}} {{the bicycle}} {{to include a}} new seat, a simpler gear shifting mechanism, fewer and brighter lights, and a European-style center kickstand. All of Citi Bike's bicycles were to be renovated to include this new design. However, in 2016, a thousand of the newly redesigned Citi Bikes <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service due to {{a part in the}} front wheel degrading faster than expected. In early 2017, as part of a pilot program with a firm named Blaze, 250 bikes received anterior laser lights that project a teal silhouette on the ground to warn drivers and pedestrians in their path.|$|E
5|$|KSS {{decided to}} convert its lines to {{electric}} traction as well. The first electric trams ran on 29 September 1899, and the conversion {{was completed by}} 15 January 1900. At the time of electrification, KSS had 57 horsecars; 38 of these were later converted to trailers, while 19 were decommissioned. The John Stephenson and Skabo trailers <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service in 1917–18, and sixteen of these were sold to the Bergen Tramway and Trondheim Tramway—the latter rebuilding them to meter gauge. One of the original Stephenson cars has been preserved at the Oslo Tramway Museum.|$|E
5|$|The T2000 {{operated}} on Line 1 of the T-bane, and replaced the aging HkB 600 teak wagons {{used on the}} Holmenkoll Line. The units were equipped with both third rail and overhead wire collectors, so they could operate on the Common Line and on the Holmenkoll Line. The trains were a prototype for a new design intended to replace the aging T1000 stock, but the MX3000 was chosen instead, as the T2000 did not perform satisfactorily. The T2000 <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1863 by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, {{with a single}} track and platform. The line was doubled in 1874 when the Clifton Extension Railway opened, then {{expanded}} to four tracks and platforms in 1891. There were buildings on all platforms and a goods yard to the west. Service levels reduced significantly over {{the second half of}} the twentieth century. The goods facilities were closed in 1965, staff were withdrawn in 1967 and the eastern two platforms <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service by 1974.|$|E
5|$|This video, {{which was}} {{directed}} by Diane Martel, features Beyoncé walking through a performance hall in modern-day street clothes, performing the song. Once she arrives onstage and at the song's bridge, she appears in costume as Deena, dressed in a 1970s-era gown. Intercut into the video are scenes from Dreamgirls, most of which depict Deena's relationship with Curtis. These clips, however, <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in the director's cut version of the video; this version appeared on the B'Day Anthology Video Album. In her first outfit, Beyoncé is seen wearing a Wonder Woman T-shirt.|$|E
5|$|Although never {{losing its}} significance, the cathedral {{subsequently}} suffered centuries of virtual neglect. In 1441 it was restored as catholicosate and remains as such to this day. Since then the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin {{has been the}} administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church. Etchmiadzin was plundered by the Safavids in 1604, when relics and stones <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the cathedral to New Julfa {{in an effort to}} undermine Armenians' attachment to their land. Since then the cathedral has undergone a number of renovations. Belfries were added {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century and in 1868 a sacristy was constructed at the cathedral's east end. Today, it incorporates styles of different periods of Armenian architecture. Diminished during the early Soviet period, Etchmiadzin revived again in the second half of the twentieth century, and under independent Armenia.|$|E

5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east of their intended landing points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1949, {{the average}} {{size of the}} design team working on the Mark 1 and its predecessor, the SSEM, had been about four people. During that time 34patents <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> based on the team's work, either by the Ministry of Supply or by its successor, the National Research Development Corporation. In July 1949, IBM invited Williams to the United States on an all-expenses-paid trip to discuss the Mark 1's design. The company {{subsequently}} licensed several of the patented ideas developed for the machine, including the Williams tube, {{in the design of}} its own 701 and 702 computers. The most significant design legacy of the Manchester Mark 1 was perhaps its incorporation of index registers, the patent for which was taken out in the names of Williams, Kilburn, Tootill, and Newman.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route {{was given}} its own {{identity}} {{on the tube}} map as the Circle line. In June 1957, the reversing bay track {{was taken out of}} use and the track bed was later filled to connect the two island platforms. The eastbound MR platform (Number 1) and westbound DR platform (Number 4) <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of use in January 1966 and March 1969 respectively. The tracks for these platforms were also removed and platform 4 was subsequently demolished in the early 1970s to allow escalators to be provided to the Piccadilly line. The widened island platform is now served by the District and Circle lines in both directions. Following the closure of platforms 1 and 4, platform 3 was renumbered as 1. The current arrangement has trains running in opposite directions to the original layout. During service disruption or engineering works, trains can also run Eastbound from Platform 1. The arcaded station entrance and shops, the brick retaining walls to the sub-surface platforms and the Exhibition Road pedestrian tunnel are Grade II listed structures.|$|E
