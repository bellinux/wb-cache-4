500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? <b>Would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come so far? ... <b>Would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E
500|$|Andronikos' {{decision}} aroused considerable {{opposition and}} criticism from contemporary scholars and officials {{almost from the}} outset, and historians like Pachymeres and Nikephoros Gregoras dwell long on the disastrous long-term effects of this short-sighted decision: piracy flourished, often augmented by the crews of the disbanded fleet who took service under Turkish and Latin masters, Constantinople was rendered defenceless towards the Italian maritime powers, {{and more and more}} Aegean islands fell under foreign rule—including Chios to the Genoese Benedetto Zaccaria, Rhodes and the Dodecanese to the Hospitallers, Lesbos and other islands to the Gattilusi. As Gregoras commented, [...] "if [...] had remained masters of the seas, as they had been, then the Latins would not have grown so arrogant , nor would the Turks ever have gazed upon the sands of the [...] sea, [...] nor <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to pay to everyone tribute every year." [...] After 1305, bowing to popular pressure and the need to contain the Catalan Company, the Emperor belatedly tried to rebuild the navy of 20 vessels, but although a few ships were built and a small fleet appears to have been active {{over the next couple of}} years, it eventually was disbanded again.|$|E
500|$|After surrendering, Diệm called Lodge by {{telephone}} {{for the last}} time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup was just starting. However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke {{for the last time}} around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered. When Diệm called, Lodge [...] "put [...] on hold" [...] and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, [...] "We just can't get that involved." [...] Dunn said, [...] "I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them." [...] Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done with them if they had lived? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Between {{the first}} and fourth centuries AD, the Didache, Barnabas and the Apocalypse of Peter {{strongly}} condemned and outlawed abortion. The first-century Didache equates [...] "the killing of an unbord child and {{the murder of a}} living child". To defend that Christians are not [...] "cannibals", in his Plea for Christians (c. 177) to Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Church Father Athenagoras of Athens writes: [...] "What reason <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to commit murder when we say that women who induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account of it to God?" [...] Tertullian, another Church Father, provides an identical defense in his Apology to Emperor Septimus Severus (197): [...] "In our case, murder being once for all forbidden, we may not destroy even the fetus in the womb, while as yet the human being derives blood {{from other parts of the}} body for its sustenance. To hinder a birth is merely a speedier man-killing." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2007, President Bush held a {{press conference}} and was asked about his {{commutation}} of Libby's prison sentence. Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. <b>Would</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E
