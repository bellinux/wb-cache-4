500|$|On June 23, 2008, it was {{announced}} Solo would be the starting goalkeeper for the U.S. team at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In a reversal of roles from the 2004 Olympics, Briana Scurry {{did not make the}} team, though she was an alternate. On August 21, the U.S. women's team won the gold medal by defeating Brazil 1–0 in extra time, in no small measure due to Solo's performance as she stopped an energetic Brazilian attack, making save after save. After the team won gold, Solo appeared on NBC Today Show, and she stated in a 2012 article appearing in ESPN The Magazine that she was drunk while on air. [...] "When we were done partying, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of our dresses, got back into our stadium coats and, at 7 a.m. with no sleep, went on the Today show drunk." ...|$|E
500|$|The third single, [...] "All My Life", was {{released}} on March 17, 1998, and was the duo's most successful song. JoJo wrote the song about his daughter but originally intended it for another artist. In an interview with MTV, he said, [...] "The song was originally supposed to be used for… another artist, a female artist on A Records.

2500|$|It was Ferrari's eighth one-two {{finish of}} the season. Barrichello said [...] "To win, it was very, very, very good... I {{got to the}} last corner, I didn't {{know what to do}} and nothing has been said. Michael was just very kind to, you know, let us finish equally. I guess I pointed a little bit in front, but, you know, what can we say?" [...] Schumacher said [...] "The end of the race was not planned... We tried to cross the line {{together}} but failed by a tiny bit and in fact we did not know who had won until <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the cars. I just felt Rubens deserved to win this race." ...|$|E
2500|$|Galima Bukharbaeva, a {{journalist}} for IWPR, witnessed a [...] "mass of dead and wounded. At first, {{one group of}} armoured-personnel carriers approached the [...] square, and then another group appeared. They opened fire without mercy on everyone indiscriminately, including women and children. The crowd began to run in all directions. We dove into a ditch and lay there for a while. I saw at least five bloody corpses next to me. The rebels who are holding the provincial administration opened fire in response. They intend to stand to the end! When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> of the ditch, we ran along the streets into the neighbourhood and now we're {{looking for a place}} where there's no shooting.

2500|$|Tagore {{was deemed}} over-rated by some. Graham Greene doubted that [...] "anyone but Mr. Yeats can still take his poems very seriously." [...] Several {{prominent}} Western admirers—including Pound and, {{to a lesser}} extent, even Yeats—criticised Tagore's work. Yeats, unimpressed with his English translations, railed against that [...] "Damn Tagore <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> three good books, Sturge Moore and I, and then, {{because he thought it}} more important to know English than to be a great poet, he brought out sentimental rubbish and wrecked his reputation. Tagore does not know English, no Indian knows English." [...] William Radice, who [...] "English" [...] his poems, asked: [...] "What is their place in world literature?" [...] He saw him as [...] "kind of counter-cultur", bearing [...] "a new kind of classicism" [...] that would heal the [...] "collapsed romantic confusion and chaos of the 20th entury."
