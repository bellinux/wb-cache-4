5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell <b>Waller</b> had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that <b>Waller</b> had shot him without cause. One son added that Davis had said <b>Waller</b> had continued to shoot after Davis had already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between <b>Waller</b> and Davis. <b>Waller</b> stated that Davis had refused to let him take the <b>Waller</b> family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; <b>Waller</b> then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|Born on 4 April 1900 in Benalla, Victoria, Hector MacDonald Laws <b>Waller</b> {{was the son}} of William Frederick <b>Waller,</b> a grocer, and {{his wife}} Helen <b>Waller</b> (née Duncan).

5|$|During {{and after}} the battle, <b>Waller</b> {{captured}} at least 500 men, around 100 of these re-enlisting with him. Additionally, more than 100 Royalist soldiers were killed. Together, the men lost represented nearly half of Hopton's infantry forces in the south. <b>Waller,</b> on the other hand, lost around ten men and gained much reputation for his success. <b>Waller</b> put his prisoners to work dragging the horse carcasses from the church, dismantling the scaffoldings inside, and burying their fallen comrades near the northern wall of the building. All of the captured men were then marched to Farnham tied together in pairs.|$|E

5|$|HMAS <b>Waller,</b> {{the third}} of the RAN's Collins-class {{submarines}} to enter service, was commissioned on 10July 1999. The attendees included John <b>Waller,</b> Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS Perth. On 13March 2010, a memorial to <b>Waller</b> was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, {{he was one of}} thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and two soldiers, including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name <b>Waller</b> (among others) should continue to be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.|$|E

The <b>Waller</b> Division of the RAN Recruit School at HMAS Cerberus, Victoria, was named in his honour until his name {{transferred}} to a division at RAN College in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Hopton was {{severely}} depressed by his defeat at Alton, more than seemed appropriate given its military import. On the Parliamentarian side, the morale boost enjoyed by <b>Waller</b> was significant, and on 15 December, the House of Commons of England ordered Sir Arthur Haslerig and Sir Gilbert Gerard {{to draft a}} letter to <b>Waller</b> commending him for his success. The Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Alton allowed <b>Waller</b> to advance south-east, and upon Arundel where he began a successful siege on the Royalists garrisoned there. Hopton was unable to break the siege with his few remaining foot soldiers, and the 1,000 horse he received from Oxford were unhelpful. After the Siege of Arundel, both armies were forced to retire for the winter due to the harsh weather.|$|E

5|$|Odell <b>Waller</b> (1917 – July 2, 1942) was an African American {{sharecropper}} from Gretna, Virginia {{executed for}} the fatal shooting {{of his white}} landlord, Oscar Wheldon Davis, on July 15, 1940. <b>Waller</b> unsuccessfully maintained at his trial that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E

5|$|With the WDL, Murray became {{active in}} the case of Odell <b>Waller,</b> a black Virginia {{sharecropper}} sentenced to death for killing his white landlord, Oscar Davis, during an argument. The WDL argued that Davis had cheated <b>Waller</b> in a settlement and as their argument grew more heated, <b>Waller</b> had shot Davis in legitimate fear of his life. Murray toured the country raising funds for Waller's appeal. She wrote to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt on Waller's behalf. Roosevelt in turn wrote to Virginia Governor James Hubert Price, asking him to guarantee that the trial was fair; she later persuaded the president to privately request Price to commute the death sentence. Through this correspondence, Murray and Eleanor Roosevelt began a friendship that would last until the latter's death two decades later. Despite the efforts of the WDL and the Roosevelts, however, the governor did not commute Waller's sentence. <b>Waller</b> was executed on July 2, 1942.|$|E

5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing he would lose the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell <b>Waller,</b> convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, <b>Waller</b> was executed as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Willamette {{renamed the}} {{building}} {{in honor of the}} Reverend Alvan (Alvin) F. <b>Waller</b> who was instrumental in getting the hall built. Then on December 17, 1919, another fire swept through <b>Waller</b> Hall while school was on break for Christmas. This second fire completely gutted the five-story building, but the exterior walls remained intact. The Mansard roof and square tower were destroyed in the fire. The university rebuilt the hall the following year, and used the original plans that included the round cupola but omitted the Mansard style roof and the square tower topping the structure. Architect Fred A. Legge oversaw the rebuilding and re-design of the hall. A campaign launched in 1920 by the university was set to raise $100,000 to be used for the reconstruction of <b>Waller,</b> plus completing the new Lausanne Hall and adding a central heating plant.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 and 2009, {{personnel}} shortages {{reduced the}} number of submarines able to be deployed to three; the maintenance cycles of Sheean, Rankin, and Dechaineux, and problems with Collins and <b>Waller</b> further reducing this to one, Farncomb, in mid-2009. Farncomb was docked for repair after a generator malfunction in February 2010, by which point Collins and <b>Waller</b> were active (the former on limited duties because of defects), and Dechaineux was slated to re-enter service by May 2010. Workforce shortages and malfunctions on other submarines during the preceding two years impacted heavily on the maintenance of Sheean and Rankin, with RAN and ASC officials predicting {{that they will not be}} active until 2012 and 2013, respectively. In June 2011, The Australian newspaper claimed despite two submarines (<b>Waller</b> and Dechaineux) designated as operational, neither was in sailable condition. The initial findings from the Coles Review revealed significant, systemic problems with the submarines and noted the need for their management to be reformed. A 2014 statement by Vice Admiral Ray Griggs indicated that up to four submarines had been operational on most occasions since 2012.|$|E
