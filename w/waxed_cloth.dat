6000|$|To secure Buried Letters from Damp.--They may {{be wrapped}} in <b>waxed</b> <b>cloth</b> or paper, if {{there be no}} fear of the ravages of insects. Lead plate is far more safe: {{it can be made}} easily enough by a {{traveller}} out of his bullets. (See [...] "Lead.") A glass bottle (with something that insects cannot eat, such as lead-plate, sealing-wax or clay, put carefully over the cork) or an earthen jar may be used. The quill of a large feather will hold a long letter, if it is written in very small handwriting and on thin paper, and it will preserve it from the wet. After the letter has been rolled up and inserted in the quill, the open end of the latter may be squeezed flat between two stones, heated sufficiently to soften the quill (see [...] "Horn") but not so hot as to burn it, and then, for greater security against wet, the end of the quill should be twisted tight. Wax affords another easy means of closing the quill.|$|E
60|$|Luis did not blanch {{at these}} portentous words, {{but he looked}} earnest and grave. Opening the draw, he took out the {{parchment}} and laid it upon the table. The admiral now seized a pen, beckoning to his companion to take another, and both commenced writing {{as well as the}} incessant motion of the light caravel would allow. The task was arduous, but it was clearly executed. As Columbus wrote a sentence, he repeated it to Luis, who copied it word for word, on his own piece of parchment. The substance of this record was the fact of the discoveries made, the latitude and longitude of Española, with the relative positions of the other islands, and a brief account of what he had seen. The letter was directed to Ferdinand and Isabella. As soon as each had completed his account, the admiral carefully enveloped his missive in a covering of <b>waxed</b> <b>cloth,</b> Luis imitating him in all things. Each then took a large cake of wax, and scooping a hole in it, the packet was carefully secured in the interior, when it was covered with the substance that had been removed. Columbus now sent for the cooper of the vessel, who was directed to inclose each cake in a separate barrel. These vessels abound in ships; and, ere many minutes, the two letters were securely inclosed in the empty casks. Each taking a barrel, the admiral and our hero now appeared again on the half-deck. So terrific was the night that no one slept, {{and most of the people}} of the Niña, men as well as officers, were crowded together on the gratings near the main-mast, where alone, with the exception of the still more privileged places, they considered themselves safe from being swept overboard. Indeed, even here they were constantly covered with the wash of the sea, the poop itself not being protected from rude visits of this nature.|$|E

However, the updated mask was not a success, and his original design, with modifications to allow gas channels remained in use in the German-speaking world into the 1950s. The continued use of the mask was due to a combination of factors; a number of influential surgeons spurned the use of tracheal intubation for anaesthesia, and the mask did not require as much training to use. As a consequence, anaesthesia was generally applied by relatively inexperienced doctors and nurses.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} Africa's {{place in the}} world is negotiated in different forms of material engagement with Dutch <b>Wax</b> <b>cloth</b> [...] designing, advertising, selling, buying, and tailoring-along the cloth's trajectory between the Netherlands and Togo. Derived from a manual Javanese textile printing technique, Dutch <b>Wax</b> <b>cloth</b> has been machine-printed in the Netherlands since the late 19 th century, and was introduced to West Africa in the early 20 th century. Lomé, Togo was a hub for its distribution throughout West and Central Africa for much of the 20 th century. The cloth's visual and material attributes were historically developed through exchanges between West African consumers and European manufacturers and Dutch Wax has since been integrated into both dress practices and processes of social reproduction in Togo, as in much of West Africa. Further, in recent years, the cloth's producer has been rebranding itself from a textile manufacturer for Africa into a global luxury design and fashion brand. As such, Dutch <b>Wax</b> <b>cloth</b> has and continues to not only mediate but also embody West African participation in the global. By examining how Dutch Wax is "done" in various sites of practice along its path-how it is given form, and what is produced alongside these forms-this multi-sited ethnography brings to light how Africa's relationship to and place in the global is negotiated in the practices of designers, advertisers, sellers, buyers, and tailors across the Netherlands, Togo, and "the global. " I argue that the view of Africa-in-the-world (Ferguson 2006) that emerges in each of these sites of practice and across all five is one that is characterized by a tenuous play between absence and presence, visibility and invisibility, inclusion and exclusion. Even as it offers a seductive alternative to past discourses about a "hopeless," "crisis-ridden," "old Africa," the "New Africa" remains decidedly layered and multiple. by Amah Melissa Edoh.

During this time he began to experiment with texturing his paintings with such material as paraffin <b>wax,</b> <b>cloth,</b> wood and sand. In New York he produced transcendentalist art which he referred to as “atavistic.” Mural commissions at this time include the U.S. Federal Building in Fort Worth, Texas (1966), the Hoffman La Roche Corporate Towers in Nutley, New Jersey (1964), Public School 306 in Brooklyn, New York (1967) and the U.S. Federal Customs Building in Foley Square, New York City in 1968.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 18th century (1754) the stud farm was moved to Brunswick and {{families}} of the nearby forestry workers were housed in the stalls. In 1799 the castle was given to the Forestry Master and was later used as a <b>wax</b> <b>cloth</b> factory. Over the years the substance of the building and its contents were allowed to decay and the building was soon beyond repair. In 1830 the ruins and a few outhouses were sold to a brick kiln owner for 3,000 Taler who had them torn down. In 1846 the local forestry started to replant trees on the site in order to restore it to its former state. The number of people living in and around Langeleben at that time amounted to about 115 people.|$|R

We unravel the designs and discourses of the corporate company and textile producer Vlisco, based in the Netherlands, as well as the practices and ideas of fashion designers in Ghana who make abundant use of <b>wax</b> <b>cloth</b> fabrics. Of central concern in this article is how a corporate company and fashion designers in their designs and narratives unite an understanding of (fashion) identity as both ‘African’ and cosmopolitan, as an individual and collective expression.

50|$|That Fentener van Vlissingens fabrics came to West Africa {{is rather}} logical. Once the Dutch East Indies banned {{imitation}} batiks, Fentener van Vlissingen had {{to search for}} a new market to sell his goods. Since the start, the company has produced and sold hand-printed textiles both domestically and abroad. Around 1852, the VOC Dutch East Indies trade routes became involved in the export of the hand-printed Vlisco fabrics. The fabrics were used for bartering during stopovers in Western Africa. Since the Dutch had been dealing in European luxury goods with West-Africans since the late middle ages, it seemed a logical step to move selling activities to that region. Another reason is that the fabrics sold in Indonesia had become popular among Ghanaian soldiers who served in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and returned home between 1837 and 1872.By the time the 20th century rolled around, West- and Central Africa were growing into a blooming textile market and by the 1930s the <b>wax</b> hollandais <b>cloths</b> designs were being adapted to local tastes.|$|R
50|$|Textiles {{are often}} dyed, with fabrics {{available}} {{in almost every}} colour. The dyeing process often requires several dozen gallons of water for each pound of clothing. Coloured designs in textiles can be created by weaving together fibres of different colours (tartan or Uzbek Ikat), adding coloured stitches to finished fabric (embroidery), creating patterns by resist dyeing methods, tying off areas of cloth and dyeing the rest (tie-dyeing), or drawing <b>wax</b> designs on <b>cloth</b> and dyeing in between them (batik), or using various printing processes on finished fabric. Woodblock printing, still used in India and elsewhere today, is the oldest of these dating back to at least 220 CE in China. Textiles are also sometimes bleached, making the textile pale or white.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the fabrication of microfluidic cloth-based analytical devices (μCADs) using a simple wax patterning method on cotton cloth for performing colorimetric bioassays. Commercial cotton cloth fabric is proposed {{as a new}} inexpensive, lightweight, and flexible platform for fabricating two- (2 D) and three-dimensional (3 D) microfluidic systems. We demonstrated that the wicking property of the cotton microfluidic channel can be improved by scouring in soda ash (Na(2) CO(3)) solution which will remove the natural surface wax and expose the underlying texture of the cellulose fiber. After this treatment, we fabricated narrow hydrophilic channels with hydrophobic barriers made from patterned wax to define the 2 D microfluidic devices. The designed pattern is carved on wax-impregnated paper, and subsequently transferred to attached cotton cloth by heat treatment. To further obtain 3 D microfluidic devices having multiple layers of pattern, a single layer of <b>wax</b> patterned <b>cloth</b> can be folded along a predefined folding line and subsequently pressed using mechanical force. All the fabrication steps are simple and low cost since no special equipment is required. Diagnostic application of cloth-based devices is shown {{by the development of}} simple devices that wick and distribute microvolumes of simulated body fluids along the hydrophilic channels into reaction zones to react with analytical reagents...|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{methods of}} holding a [...] reduced fracture involved using splints. [...] These are rigid strips laid parallel {{to each other}} alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. [...] Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during the immobilization. [...] The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and egg mixture as did Medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg white, flour, and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1517–1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of <b>wax,</b> cardboard, <b>cloth,</b> and parchment that hardened as they dried.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The enzyme urease (EC. 3. 5. 1. 5) {{from jack}} bean meal was immobilized by various techniques, such as {{entrapment}} in calcium alginate gel spheres in aqueous suspension, lac impregnated muslin cloth as dry films and by embedding in paraffin <b>wax</b> impregnated muslin <b>cloth.</b> The {{activity of the}} free and immobilized enzymes {{as a function of}} pH, temperature, storage stability, kinetic parameters and periodic use were compared. The immobilized enzyme showed good storage stability. After repeated use, the alginate beads turned brown and deteriorated, hence the storage stability was not good. The paraffin films were preserved dry because during wet preservation, the film slightly softened and the protein leached out slightly. The alginate beads had moderate mechanical stability. The lac films were tougher than the paraffin wax films in terms of mechanical stability. The K m and V max values were altered after immobilization. The K m values for calcium alginate and lac were low, while it was larger in paraffin film as compared to the free enzyme. This {{may be due to the}} fact that immobilization on calcium alginate and lac in presence of CaCl 2 and methanol exposed certain active sites of the urease. While immobilization on paraffin masks the active sites and may lead to reduced binding of the substrate...|$|R

It was a qualitative study with the main research subjects were the principal, teachers, and students. Methods used to collect data were interview, observation, and documentation. The analysis of data started from (1) data reduction, (2) data display, and (3) drawing conclusion. The validity of data was check used credibility, and transferability tests. The findings showed that (1) teachers were active in the aesthetic-based cultural art learning at SMP 2 Purworejo. This activeness could be seen from teachers’ activities in preparing all instructional equipment such as musical instrument, drawing, coloring and dance CDs. Teachers packed learning with multi-method conducted in the form of individual and group learning. The concept of aesthetics was given together with the materials of art, music, theater, and dance through the instructional media. It is at once an aspect of assessment by teachers including the aspect of competence appreciation and recreation or creative arts and culture. (2) Students were active in the aestheticbased cultural art learning at SMP 2 Purworejo. This activeness was shown by doing practical activities both individual and group. Students exhibited art works of their creation that contained the appreciation and creative values like making table cloth patterned lurik batik with a combination of animals and plants pictures. Students in groups organized ensemble music with modern pop music arrangement. (3) The aesthetic-based art and culture learning at SMP 2 Purworejo ran interactively. There are one-way and two-way interactions. The one-way interaction existed when the teacher explained the difficult materials and students asked to give attention such as the material of tuning guitar with fingers. Two-way interaction pattern occurred when the students and teacher conducted a question and answer activity and also group practice. In making batik, teachers made groups and divided tasks to each member of the groups. Students prepared several equipments such as table <b>cloth,</b> <b>wax,</b> canting, chairs and so forth. While other students made batik with the mix of sido mukti, animal and plants patterns. ...|$|R
