500|$|In August 2009, M. Suganth of The Times of India {{rated the}} film 4.5 out of 5. Naman Ramachandran {{considered}} Rajinikanth's Kali an effective {{portrayal of a}} challenging, complex character. He praised Balu Mahendra's cinematography, especially his use of natural light. In December 2014, Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times wrote: [...] "On watching [...] recently, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the brilliance of [...] acting ability. In both, he essays shades of deep grey, and yet there was something captivating about Rajinikanth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Solomon {{charged that}} the [...] "so-called 'left'" [...] was [...] "making its {{position}} clear" [...] with the Declaration of Principles. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the flag it had unfurled," [...] he declared, [...] "It was the banner of thinly veiled communism." [...] While he declared that [...] "the Declaration of Principles must be decisively rejected in the referendum," [...] he nevertheless strongly hinted that a factional split was in the offing. Merely defeating the proposed Declaration of Principles was [...] "not enough," [...] he concluded, [...] "The Socialist Party must be made safe for Socialism, for social democracy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{said the}} closure allowed Francis {{to settle a}} {{confrontation}} started by his predecessor that [...] "created an uproar among American Catholics," [...] who energetically defended the nuns {{in the face of}} Vatican interference, signing petitions and sending letters to the Vatican. Father James Martin, who wrote frequently about the conflict as an editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said: [...] "What you see with the sisters is true courage, which is being faithful to the church authority and also to who they are." [...] On April 17, 2015, the editorial board of The New York Times editorialized that, [...] "The Vatican's misguided investigation of American Catholic nuns seemed thoroughly steeped in chauvinism from its inception three years ago by the church's male-dominated bureaucracy. Rome's move against widely respected churchwomen was puzzling and provocative in an era of scandal by male priests committing child rape and being repeatedly shielded by their male superiors....There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the message that the reforming spirit of Francis's fresh broom had poked sharply into another corner of the Vatican. The extraordinary effort to have the Vatican take control of the sisters' main communal voice – the Leadership Conference of Women Religious – ended with none of the aggressive bombast of Rome's initial announcement of the inquiry under Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI." ...|$|E

60|$|Sid was all right, Sid was, {{and there}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about that.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about Mr. Magnet. Marjorie had {{accepted}} him, whatever else {{she had felt}} or done.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his innuendo, and Saxon {{felt her}} cheeks flaming.|$|E
60|$|Philip hesitated. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the earnestness {{with which}} the youth spoke.|$|E
60|$|The {{tone was}} positive. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> it. Her mind was made up.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{wide awake}} again, she started up. Yes there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about it! And {{yet it was}} very odd.|$|R
60|$|He {{read the}} note again. <b>No.</b> There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> 'Thomson <b>is</b> {{not in the}} House.' There could <b>be</b> <b>no</b> two {{meanings}} about that.|$|R
6000|$|... "And it is {{to happen}} to-morrow?always to-morrow? Is it the same date always? There has <b>been</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> and <b>no</b> confusion?" ...|$|R
60|$|Tom planted himself {{across the}} narrow path in an {{attitude}} which there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking.</b>|$|E
60|$|Bob {{shook his}} head, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> {{the look on}} his face as he did so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here! Here!" [...] {{he screamed}} out twice. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his astonishment, his shocked incredulity--something like frightened disgust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something is wrong, that is certain," [...] {{came from}} Gilbert. He eyed the Chinaman closely. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think there}} <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> in the pirate's account of that key, {{and of the}} buried treasure?" [...] asked the deacon, anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about this? The word pounds is not {{a mistake}} for ounces?--although even that would {{represent}} a very large sum." ...|$|R
60|$|Before Ormsgill could answer, the old {{man made}} a sign, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his tone of authority.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head sadly and the big tears stood in her eyes. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> her earnestness now.|$|E
60|$|A glance was {{sufficient}} to show how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> them.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-morrow or {{the next}} day," [...] he {{repeated}} firmly, [...] "the reprieve will be signed. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> There will <b>be</b> none." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{the whip}} cracked. And then, {{as if at}} a signal, a vast, protracted, {{unanimous}} bawl poured up into space, a spout of sound, like a gigantic, invisible flower. [...] "That wasn't applause. But, you know, that wasn't applause," [...] I heard myself muttering. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the sound of human mockery. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> that brutal wrench at the heart, under one's very ribs. I leapt round where I stood, {{in a kind of}} giddiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> doctor; there <b>were</b> {{the black}} marks on my thighs, but I think I have pretty well sweated {{it out of}} me." ...|$|R
60|$|Gladwyne colored {{and moved}} abruptly. He had {{imagined}} {{that she was}} his for the asking, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> her cutting scorn.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the man's sincerity, or {{the urgency}} and {{importance}} of his business; {{from his point of}} view at any rate. I stepped forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "With the {{greatest}} {{pleasure in the}} world, Madame," [...] he answered, and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> his sincerity. As he spoke, Mademoiselle {{turned her back on}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite sure. There can <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> about it," [...] replied Jenkins, from whose speech, {{strange to}} say, the lisp and drawl had {{suddenly}} disappeared.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake</b> this time. Letting {{the animal}} go, she fled, red-handed, into the {{innermost}} recess of the cottage, followed by her horrified friends.|$|R
60|$|Richard {{was careful}} {{that there should}} <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistakes,</b> and it <b>is</b> perhaps needless to state that he had both eyes wide open for damaged books.|$|R
6000|$|... “What are {{you going}} to do with her?” he panted. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the grim trend of {{mischief}} in those flushed by sternly composed young faces.|$|E
60|$|Her {{hair was}} just passably tidy, {{and she was}} a little effaced by a red blouse, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the genuine {{brightness}} of her welcome.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a meaning}} {{in his words}} that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistaking.</b> The old man, looking round at the faces, saw that the mate’s was very pale.|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake,</b> I hope," [...] Francois said as, {{a quarter}} of a mile before they reached it, they met the three men-at-arms coming down.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter?" [...] asked Phil Jones, as {{he stood}} by, {{watching}} me turn my pockets inside out {{to make sure that}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No, George, no, don't say so. There has <b>been</b> <b>no</b> <b>mistake.</b> A {{man should}} own nothing. I {{have thought about}} it and am sure of it." ...|$|R
