DARPA has funded efforts to harness energy from leg and arm motion, shoe impacts, and blood pressure for low level power to implantable or <b>wearable</b> <b>sensors.</b> The nanobrushes are {{another example of a}} piezoelectric energy harvester. They can be integrated into clothing. Multiple other nanostructures have been exploited to build an energy-harvesting device, for example, a single crystal PMN-PT nanobelt was fabricated and assembled into a piezoelectric energy harvester in 2016. Careful design is needed to minimise user discomfort. These energy harvesting sources by association affect the body. The Vibration Energy Scavenging Project is another project that is set up to try to scavenge electrical energy from environmental vibrations and movements. Microbelt can be used to gather electricity from respiration. Besides, as the vibration of motion from human comes in three directions, a single piezoelectric cantilever based omni-directional energy harvester is created by using 1:2 internal resonance. Finally, a millimeter-scale piezoelectric energy harvester has also already been created.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} quantitative dynamics analysis of human lower limb using developed <b>wearable</b> <b>sensor</b> systems that can measure reaction force and detect the following gait phases: initial contact, loading response, mid stance, terminal stance, pre-swing, initial swing, mid swing and terminal swing. Since conventional camera-based motion analysis system and reaction force plate system require costly devices, vast space as well as time-consuming calibration experiments, the wearable sensor-based system is much cheaper. Gyroscopes and two-axis accelerometers are incorporated in this <b>wearable</b> <b>sensor</b> system. The former are attached {{on the surface of}} the foot, shank and thigh to measure the angular velocity of each segment, and the latter are used to measure inclination of the attached leg segment (shank) in every single human motion cycle for recalibration. Ground reaction forces during human walking are synchronously measured using a <b>wearable</b> force <b>sensor</b> integrated in a shoes mechanism. Finally, experiment has been performed to compare the measurement results from the <b>wearable</b> <b>sensor</b> system with the data obtained from an optical motion analysis system and a force plate. The results showed that the measurement of human lower limb orientations and reaction forces for human dynamics analysis could be reliably implemented using the <b>wearable</b> <b>sensor</b> systems.
