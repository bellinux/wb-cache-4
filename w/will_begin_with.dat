25|$|Furthermore, {{unlike many}} online games, Eve does not feature racial bonuses; that is, {{characters}} {{of different races}} do not gain intrinsic advantages for flying ships designed by their own race. While a character <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> more advanced skills in his own race's ships, a character of another race can reach the same proficiency through training. Thus, players are encouraged to use starships that meet their preferred style of play, and the game does not place incentives for playing as one race over another. However, the ships of different races receive unique bonuses to certain things.|$|E

25|$|The Conservative Party {{believes}} {{that in the}} 21st century defence and security are interlinked. It has pledged to break away from holding a traditional Strategic Defence Review and have committed to carrying out a more comprehensive Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) immediately upon coming into office. This review will include both defence and homeland security related matters. The Labour Government last conducted a review in 1998. To prevent a long gap in the future it also pledged to hold regular defence reviews every 4–5years, and if necessary will put this requirement into legislation. Party officials claim that the SDSR will be a major improvement, and will ensure that Britain maintains generic and flexible capability to adapt to any changing threats. It will be a cross-departmental review that <b>will</b> <b>begin</b> <b>with</b> foreign policy priorities and will bring together all the levers of domestic national security policy with overseas interests and defence priorities.|$|E
