60|$|The {{meeting was}} a very long one, and I was much {{fatigued}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> {{there in}} a couple of hours' time, I thought, for a moment, that I was looking into a mirror.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned,</b> {{these three}} were {{in much the}} same {{position}} I had left them in; I believe no word had passed.|$|E
60|$|RUFIO. I {{hope you}} will have {{the good sense to}} follow your own advice <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to Rome, Caesar.|$|R

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> in the evening, Boothland--as I may now indeed call it, for Scheria {{has ceased}} to be--was one black smoking cinder.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to camp we {{were told}} that the half of our soldier-crab baits had been sucked off by bonefish. Did not believe that.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> {{from this}} trip, there again took place that ceremonious {{reception}} of our captain {{on board the}} vessel he commanded, which always had struck me as exceedingly diverting.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall {{we go back}} to Steyning, my lord, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> home?" [...] Osgod {{asked as}} they stood by the bulwark {{together}} watching the passing shores.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} {{her at the}} tea-table, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the drawing-room. Girls are out of place at dinner-parties." [...] So he {{answered}} me--not very graciously.|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{soon as we}} get to town we can get {{cleaned up}} a little better," [...] said Dave. [...] "So we won't look quite like tramps <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to the Hall." ...|$|R
60|$|Our day {{proved to}} be as {{delightful}} as we had anticipated, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned,</b> hungry and tired, we were perfectly charmed to find that Mrs. Old John had our supper ready for us.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to {{the tomb}} in the deep, dead stillness that {{followed}} the storm, the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away. They were waiting for our return. Saumarez most of all.|$|E
6000|$|... "For a week reports {{continued}} favourable. One {{night we}} went to the opera to hear a celebrated prima donna. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> home Miriam and I were sitting in her room, chatting over the events of the evening.|$|E

6000|$|... "By {{right of}} that," [...] I answered, {{pointing}} to the Union Jack which Stephen still had in his hand. [...] "Also we will pay you for them <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return,</b> according as they have served us." ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{obliged to}} go over this carry twice, our load was so great. But the carries were an {{agreeable}} variety, and we improved the opportunity to gather the rare plants which we had seen, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> empty-handed.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{handful of}} marauders," [...] replied Kadour ben Saden. [...] "They {{attacked}} {{two of our}} number who had dropped behind, but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to them the fellows soon dispersed. They left two dead. None of my party was injured." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned,</b> he {{observed}} {{a much larger}} track near the same place, where some animal's foot had sunk into a small hollow in the rock, partly filled with grass and earth, and he exclaimed with surprise, [...] "What that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The moon is up; by Heaven {{a lovely}} eve! [...] Long streams of light, o'er glancing waves expand, [...] Now lads on shore may sigh and maids believe: [...] Such be our fate <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to land! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} an {{opportunity}} of doing so, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return.</b> Monsieur Kennedy will, of course, dine with us. After the service that he has rendered to us, {{we have a right to}} consider him as belonging to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, my lord,' said Lady Annabel, 'both Venetia {{and myself}} are much engaged now; and I {{do not wish}} her to read while she is in London. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to Cherbury she will have {{abundance}} of time, if desirable.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Thy little {{footsteps}} on the sands Of a remote and lonely shore; The twinkling of thine infant hands, Where now the worm will feed no more; Thy mingled look of love and glee [...] 5 <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to gaze on thee-- ...|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to {{the hotel}} after {{a tour of the}} block, we saw Kendricks in our corner of the {{verandah}} with Miss Gage. They were both laughing convulsively, and they ran down to meet us in yet wilder throes of merriment.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust it}} will, Jack; I hope, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> to New York, {{to see you}} among us, anchored, as you would call it, {{for the rest of}} your days under my aunt's roof, or under my own, should I ever have one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is the idea, exactly," [...] said Louise, [...] "and {{the only}} thing that reconciles me to the discomforts.

6000|$|... "'Surely, oh Revered One,' said he, 'these {{people and}} their {{treasure}} have been delivered into our hands. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>return</b> with it to the holy place, who of all the Koraish will fail to see the finger of God which has led us?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is clean}} beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> from Tunbridge Wells last night, {{and you were}} in general {{agreement}} with our results. What has happened since then {{to give you a}} completely new idea of the case?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{only is it}} {{our right}} to bend every effort to escape--it is a solemn duty from which we should not shrink even though {{we know that we}} should be reviled and {{tortured}} by our own peoples <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> to them.|$|E
60|$|By this time, I confess, I {{felt almost}} like a criminal. Never in my life had danger loomed so near--not even <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>returned</b> with the Arabs from the oasis. For then we feared for our lives alone; now, we feared for our honour.|$|E
