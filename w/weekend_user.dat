However, instead of being stuck with the same team through a whole season, daily fantasy sports contests last just one day (or {{in the case of}} NFL, one <b>weekend).</b> <b>Users</b> can play head-to-head or in larger field tournaments. Both cash leagues and free contests are available for play.|$|R
40|$|Addiction {{is deemed}} {{as one of}} the major {{negative}} outcomes that result from intensive use of information technology. Previous research suggests that social networking applications, such as microblogs, are possibly more addictive due to their particular features. Taking an inductive approach, we attempt to explore the relationships between usage patterns and addiction dimensions on microblog platforms. Based on the literature in the use and gratification theory, we focus on the different usage patterns between weekdays and weekends. Using multiple data collection methods, a data set was obtained consisting of 158 microblog users. Our analysis shows that the use of microblog is usually more intensive on weekdays than on weekends. Furthermore, it is shown that heavy <b>weekend</b> <b>users</b> tend to feel more gratified and {{are most likely to be}} addicted. Contrarily, balanced users that do not display significant difference between weekdays and weekends are usually not addicted, regardless their usage amounts...|$|R
50|$|In 1981 Arthur Edward Imperatore, Sr., a {{trucking}} magnate, {{purchased a}} 2.5 mi {{length of the}} Weehawken, New Jersey waterfront, where the company is based, from the bankrupt Penn Central for $7.5 million, with the plan to redevelop the brownfield site as had others along {{the west bank of}} the Hudson River waterfront and to restore ferry service to it. In 1986 he established New York Waterway, with a route across the river between Weehawken Port Imperial and Pier 78 on the West Side of Midtown Manhattan. Three years later, it began operation between Hoboken Terminal and Battery Park City. During the course of the next decade numerous routes across the Hudson were added. In February 2011 it was contracted to operate a route calling at slips in Brooklyn and Queens as well as the East River terminals. Subsidized by the City of New York, the service was originally intended for commuters, but after a few months became popular with <b>weekend</b> <b>users</b> and tourists.|$|R

BT—at the time not known for being {{receptive}} to new technologies or changes in its business model—had previously dismissed the idea, and its change in policy represented a significant progression for {{the company and the}} telecommunications industry as a whole. The timing of the announcement also ensured that BT's customers {{would be more likely to}} take advantage of the unmetered access instead of participating in the boycott.|$|R

DOGTV has researched, created and {{produced more than}} 2,000 programs for dogs, each show is 3 to 6 minutes long, catering to dogs’ short attention span. In addition, DOGTV has recently introduced some shows for dog owners, which airs during <b>weekends,</b> including a <b>user</b> generated program which features home videos of dogs, titled “DOGSTAR!”. During the night, DOGTV airs Night-Time which features extra soothing music and visuals for the sleepy dog.|$|R

40|$|A {{correction}} method using {{machine learning}} aims {{to improve the}} conventional linear regression (LR) based method for correction of atmospheric pressure data obtained by smartphones. The method proposed in this study conducts clustering and regression analysis with time domain classification. Data obtained in Gyeonggi-do, {{one of the most}} populous provinces in South Korea surrounding Seoul with the size of 10, 000 [*]km 2, from July 2014 through December 2014, using smartphones were classified with respect to time of day (daytime or nighttime) as well as day of the week (weekday or <b>weekend)</b> and the <b>user’s</b> mobility, prior to the expectation-maximization (EM) clustering. Subsequently, the results were analyzed for comparison by applying machine learning methods such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR). The results showed a mean absolute error (MAE) 26 % lower on average when regression analysis was performed through EM clustering compared to that obtained without EM clustering. For machine learning methods, the MAE for SVR was around 31 % lower for LR and about 19 % lower for MLP. It is concluded that pressure data from smartphones are as good as the ones from national automatic weather station (AWS) network...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{the phenomenon of the}} second homes in the area around the middle stream of the river Luznice. The trend of second homes is closely connected mainly to rural tourism. Currently the number of people living in the countryside is decreasing, this leads to increasing depopulation of the countryside. Development of rural tourism and second homes, which can be described as a precursor of amenity migration can alleviate the depopulation of the Czech countryside. Those two terms: second homes and amenity migration are very frequently overlapped in our conditions so {{it is difficult to determine}} the clear border between them. The second housing represents the way of spending the free time and so it can by stated as a complex phenomena and processes connected to a recreational object, most frequently represented by a cabin or a <b>weekend</b> house. Some <b>users</b> of second homes may decide to move into their second houses permanently. In this case we call this the amenity migration. This type of migration is the movement of people from an urban area in to rural areas. The amenity migration can be understood as a migration for better environment, peace, the desire to be closer to nature and the desire for a better quality of life in general...|$|R
40|$|Makerspaces, however one may define them, are {{becoming}} more commonplace. As libraries have evolved from traditional book lenders into collaborative hubs, they have naturally adopted new technologies that increase their maker potential. This presentation will describe the adaptation of existing space at Michigan State University Main Library, focusing particularly on integration of the technology into academic courses. The makerspace evolved out of the Copy Center, which was once dedicated to simple 2 D printing and copying. It first expanded to contain microforms, lamination, large format printing, book and large-format scanning. More recently, it came to contain an Espresso Book Machine, 3 D printers, laser and vinyl cutters, and borrowable technology including Makey Makey, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino Sparkfun Inventor’s Kits to empower creative patrons. In the libraries makerspace we have partnered with several courses {{on a number of}} different types of projects. Students have created books for specific assignments (with tailored instruction from us) in journalism, studio art, and comics courses, and many departments or professors have put together anthologies, including Urban Planning, History, Anthropology, Engineering, Professional Writing, STEM, and our Residential College in Arts and Humanities. Sometimes, these contain student work, the professor’s own work, or a combination of content from all of the above and others—one even paired college art students with young campers. In the realm of 3 D printing, we have done projects alongside students and educators in Art, Art History and Design, Entrepreneurship, Interior Design, Packaging, Fashion Design, and Veterinary Medicine. We will describe these in detail, illustrating the extent of our involvement beyond creating the products that were requested, and our vision for future integrative endeavors. Each partnership with a faculty member or course has enabled us to learn and grow; from how to approach those that may be interested in integrating our services to their coursework, to best practices for doing so. Working directly with faculty and students, we have found creative solutions to a variety of challenges, {{not only in terms of}} production, but also copyright and licensing, to fit our patrons’ needs. As one space amidst a growing landscape of others, both on- and off-campus, we will also discuss the importance of filling our niche and the reason faculty might choose to partner directly with us instead of another space on campus. Specifically, we aim to catch overflow from other departments, and to provide service to the broad community of majors and university-unaffiliated patrons. Our operations run 8 am- 1 am most weekdays, as well as about 8 hours per day on <b>weekends,</b> accommodating more <b>users</b> than most spaces, without any sort of registration or additional tuition fee...|$|R
40|$|The High Uinta Primitive Area, Utah 2 ̆ 7 s {{most popular}} high {{mountain}} recreation area, {{has a reputation}} as an excellent trout and grayling fishery. Proposed for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System, the area faces several management dilemmas. The primary problem being that managers must protect the resource from the effects of heavy recreational use without destroying the primitive and aesthetic dimensions of wilderness environment. It appears that much impact on the more accessible lakes is due to fishing use. The objectives of the study were: (1) to determine the proportions of angling to non-angling groups; (2) to describe certain characteristics of these anglers; (3) to examine the importance of fishing and factors affecting fishing enjoyment; and (4) to determine the angler 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge and experience with adjacent de facto wilderness alternatives. The method of data collection was an interview questionnaire administered on Highline trail leading into the Primitive area and Notch Mountain trail leading to de facto wildlands. A conservative stratified sampling scheme was used to obtain proper representation of weekday, <b>weekend</b> and holiday <b>users</b> of both areas. Results were coded and punched for computer organization and tabulation. The results indicate that slightly more than half the groups contacted were comprised of one or more fishermen planning to fish the study area; with slightly greater proportions of anglers using the Primitive area. Over half the anglers were visiting the areas {{for the first time and}} were motivated by the desire to 2 ̆ 2 escape 2 ̆ 2 from routine, get outdoors, and enjoy mountain scenery. Fishing was not an important motive but was a preferred activity. Anglers of the study areas fished more than average Utah fishermen and preferred high mountain lake and stream fisheries. Anglers reported high catch rates and mostly rated the fishing as 2 ̆ 2 good 2 ̆ 2. Hypothetical catch reductions did not bother anglers because as many stated, 2 ̆ 2 fishing was secondary 2 ̆ 2. However, the dissatisfactions of less successful anglers and the angler 2 ̆ 7 s desire to maintain the fishery through stocking still reveal some importance in fishing activity. Anglers also appeared to be somewhat intolerant with increased crowd levels. Most anglers were inexperienced and ignorant of de facto alternatives. It appeared that decisions regarding such alternatives were partially based on Notch Mountain standards. Also, the accessibility and high amounts of dayuse suggest that different kinds of experiences may be sought in the Notch Mountain area...|$|R
