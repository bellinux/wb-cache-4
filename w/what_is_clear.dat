5|$|Wighard (or Wigheard; died between 664 and 667) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop-elect of Canterbury. What {{little is known}} about him comes from 8th-century writer Bede, but {{inconsistencies}} between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric. His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

50|$|It is {{uncertain}} therefore if the concern regarding pollution at the Works was unfounded or exaggerated but <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> from the archival material {{was that the}} Council was eager {{to get rid of}} their asset.

25|$|Fred and John Lillywhite, as well {{as their}} elder brother, James (b. 1825), all went into {{business}} as sports outfitters. Perhaps because of this multiplicity of Lillywhites, latter day accounts of their non-cricketing activities sometimes conflict as to who did what. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Fred was a manager, probably from 1848 to 1855, in the firm of Lillywhite Brothers, a tobacconist and sports outfitter in Islington, then on the outskirts of London.|$|E

25|$|The {{legacy of}} the life lived by John Stephens is quite complicated. William Powell {{is not alone in}} his {{negative}} characterization of Stephens. Much local folk history characterizes Stephens as, at best, a misguided miscreant, and at worst a criminally craven opportunist. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> from all accounts is that Stephens did work extensively with the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League. It is such associations – as well as his political organization of the black population – that cause the wide divergence in popular opinion surrounding his legacy.|$|E
25|$|The Aboriginal {{history from}} this area is not {{especially}} well recorded. There was a mountain clan, the Ja-itma-thang, centred on the Omeo area, but this clan would have interacted regularly with nearby tribes, including the Gunai or Kurnai of Gippsland proper. Population levels are uncertain, but were likely highly underestimated by European settlers, especially with consideration given {{to the fact that}} observation in the mountains and forests of Gippsland is far more difficult than in the more open parts of Australia. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that like elsewhere, population levels quickly declined following European occupation due to both disease and conflict, and people from this clan are no longer found in the area.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a {{standard}} gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps {{it would have been}} cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster {{at about the same time}} as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{according}} to Hopfe, [...] "All {{theories of the}} origin of Mithraism acknowledge a connection, however vague, to the Mithra/Mitra figure of ancient Aryan religion." [...] Reporting on the Second International Congress of Mithraic Studies, 1975, Ugo Bianchi says that although he welcomes [...] "the tendency to question in historical terms the relations between Eastern and Western Mithraism", it [...] "should not mean obliterating <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> to the Romans themselves, that Mithras was a ‘Persian’ (in wider perspective: an Indo-Iranian) god." ...|$|R

Mephistopheles appears unable to keep the pact, since he prefers not to fulfill Faust's wishes, but rather to separate him from his former existence. He never provides Faust what he wants, instead he attempts to infatuate Faust with superficial indulgences, and thus enmesh him in deep guilt.|$|R
25|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Harappan {{society was}} not entirely peaceful, with the human {{skeletal}} remains demonstrating {{some of the highest}} rates of injury (15.5%) found in South Asian prehistory. Paleopathological analysis demonstrated that leprosy and tuberculosis were present at Harappa, with the highest prevalence of both disease and trauma present in the skeletons from Area G (an ossuary located south-east of the city walls). Furthermore, rates of cranio-facial trauma and infection increased through time demonstrating that the civilization collapsed amid illness and injury. The bioarchaeologists who examined the remains have suggested that the combined evidence for differences in mortuary treatment and epidemiology indicate that some individuals and communities at Harappa were excluded from access to basic resources like health and safety, a basic feature of hierarchical societies world-wide.|$|E
25|$|The role of Stephen III {{in these}} events is {{somewhat}} obscure. According to the historian Horace Mann, Stephen was an impotent observer, {{and that the}} responsible agent was in reality the Chartularius, Gratiosus. However, according to Louis Marie DeCormenin, Stephen was the key person responsible for issuing the orders, and took great delight in destroying his rival and his supporters. A middle position {{was taken by the}} historian Ferdinand Gregorovius, who observed that Stephen, while he may not have instigated or ordered the atrocities, did not seek to prevent them either, either through self-interest or the weakness of his position. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> however, is that the recent creation of the Papal States had seen the traditional rivalries of the ruling families of Rome transformed into a murderous desire to control this new temporal power in Italy, dragging the papacy with it.|$|E
25|$|In 1160, Malcolm {{returned}} to Scotland having spent months campaigning {{in the service}} of the English on the Continent. After successfully dealing with a considerable number of disaffected magnates at Perth, the Chronicle of Holyrood and the twelfththirteenth-century Chronicle of Melrose reveal that he launched three military expeditions into Galloway. The circumstances surrounding these invasions is unclear, although <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Fergus submitted to the Scots before the end of the year. Specifically, according to Gesta Annalia I, once the Scots subdued the Gallovidians, the conquerors forced Fergus to retire to the abbey of Holyrood, and hand over his son, Uhtred, as a royal hostage. The Chronicle of Holyrood and the fifteenth-century Ordinale of Holyrood corroborate Fergus' monastic retirement, with the former source further recording Fergus' grant of the lands of Dunrod to the abbey.|$|E
25|$|This {{process is}} {{expected}} to continue, as new organisms arrive through accidental or intentional introductions. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> less <b>clear</b> <b>is</b> {{the extent to which}} previous introductions pave the way for future invasions. This may occur in one of three ways.|$|R
50|$|The {{larger problem}} was that by 1979, {{combined}} ZIRPA and ZANLA strength inside Rhodesia totalled at least 12,500 guerrillas and {{it was evident that}} insurgents were entering the country at a faster rate than the Rhodesian forces could kill or capture. In addition, 22,000 ZIPRA and 16,000 ZANLA fighters remained uncommitted outside the country. Joshua Nkomo's ZIPRA forces were preparing their forces in Zambia with the intent of confronting the Rhodesians through a conventional invasion. Whether such an invasion could have been successful in the short term against the well trained Rhodesian army and air force <b>is</b> questionable. However, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that the insurgency was growing in strength daily and the ability of the security forces to continue to control the entire country was coming under serious challenge.|$|R

25|$|In later {{books of}} the Old Testament, Aaron and his kin are not {{mentioned}} very often except in literature dating to the Babylonian Exile and later. The books of Judges, Samuel and Kings mention priests and Levites, but do not mention the Aaronides in particular. The book of Ezekiel, which devotes much attention to priestly matters, calls the priestly upper class the Zadokites after one of King David's priests. It does reflect a two-tier priesthood with the Levites in subordinate position. A two-tier hierarchy of Aaronides and Levites appears in Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles. As a result, many historians think that Aaronide families did not control the priesthood in pre-exilic Israel. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that high priests claiming Aaronide descent dominated the Second Temple period. Most scholars think the Pentateuch reached its final form early in this period, which may account for Aaron's prominence in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers.|$|E
25|$|The {{fall of the}} Mauryas {{left the}} Khyber Pass unguarded, and a wave of foreign {{invasion}} followed. The Greco-Bactrian king, Demetrius, capitalized on the break-up, and he conquered southern Afghanistan and parts of northwestern India around 180BCE, forming the Indo-Greek Kingdom. The Indo-Greeks would maintain holdings on the trans-Indus region, and make forays into central India, for about a century. Under them, Buddhism flourished, and one of their kings, Menander, became a famous figure of Buddhism; he was {{to establish a new}} capital of Sagala, the modern city of Sialkot. However, the extent of their domains and the lengths of their rule are subject to much debate. Numismatic evidence indicates that they retained holdings in the subcontinent right up to the birth of Christ. Although the extent of their successes against indigenous powers such as the Shungas, Satavahanas, and Kalingas are unclear, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Scythian tribes, renamed Indo-Scythians, brought about the demise of the Indo-Greeks from around 70BCE and retained lands in the trans-Indus, the region of Mathura, and Gujarat.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{of large numbers}} of bodies grouped together suggests the resistance was more protracted than originally thought, and a number of desperate last stands were made. Evidence shows that many of the bodies, today marked by cairns, were found in several large groups around the camp – including one stand of around 150 men. A Zulu account describes a group of the 24th forming a square on the neck of Isandlwana. Colonial cavalry, the NMP and the carabiniers, who could easily have fled as they had horses, died around Durnford in his last stand, while nearby their horses were found dead on their picket rope. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that the slaughter was complete in the area around the camp and back to Natal along the Fugitive's Drift. The fighting had been hand-to-hand combat and no quarter was given to the British regulars. The Zulus had been commanded to ignore the civilians in black coats and this meant that some officers, whose patrol dress was dark blue and black at the time, were spared and escaped.|$|E

6000|$|Our {{friend had}} in fact already hesitated, though not on the hint of his companion's doubt, in which there were depths of {{critical}} reserve. He had just made out, in the now full picture, something and somebody else; another impression had been superimposed. A young girl in a white dress and a softly plumed white hat had suddenly come into view, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> presently <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that her course <b>was</b> toward them. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearer</b> still <b>was</b> that the handsome young man at her side was Chad Newsome, and <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearest</b> of all <b>was</b> that she was therefore Mademoiselle de Vionnet, that she was unmistakeably pretty--bright gentle shy happy wonderful--and that Chad now, with a consummate calculation of effect, was about to present her to his old friend's vision. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clearest</b> of all indeed was something much more than this, something at the single stroke of which--and wasn't it simply juxtaposition?--all vagueness vanished. It was {{the click of a}} spring--he saw the truth. He had by this time also met Chad's look; there was more of it in that; and the truth, accordingly, so far as Bilham's enquiry was concerned, had thrust in the answer. [...] "Oh Chad!"--it was that rare youth he should have enjoyed being [...] "like." [...] The virtuous attachment would be all there before him; the virtuous attachment would be in the very act of appeal for his blessing; Jeanne de Vionnet, this charming creature, would be exquisitely, intensely now--the object of it. Chad brought her straight up to him, and Chad was, oh yes, at this moment--for the glory of Woollett or whatever--better still even than Gloriani. He had plucked this blossom; he had kept it over-night in water; and at last as he held it up to wonder he did enjoy his effect. That was why Strether had felt at first the breath of calculation--and why moreover, as he now knew, his look at the girl would be, for the young man, a sign of the latter's success. What young man had ever paraded about that way, without a reason, a maiden in her flower? And there was nothing in his reason at present obscure. Her type sufficiently told of it--they wouldn't, they couldn't, want her to go to Woollett. Poor Woollett, and what it might miss!--though brave Chad indeed too, and what it might gain! Brave Chad however had just excellently spoken. [...] "This is a good little friend of mine who knows all about you and has moreover a message for you. And this, my dear"--he had turned to the child herself--"is the best man in the world, who has it in his power to do a great deal for us and whom I want you to like and revere as nearly as possible as much as I do." ...|$|R
500|$|Abercrombie's next {{error was}} an {{apparent}} over-reliance on {{the analysis of}} Matthew Clerk. His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that Abercrombie, in his stated desire for haste, {{did not want to}} act on Clerk's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill, and then sought to blame Clerk, claiming he was merely acting on the engineer's advice. Clerk was one of the battle's casualties, so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame. Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote, on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill, [...] "There was one hill in particular, which seem'd to offer itself as an ally to us, it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French {{in a very short time}} from their breast work [...] this was never thought of, which (one wou'd imagine) must have occur'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into Idiotism as to be oblig'd to wear a bib and bells." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter was reputed for his bravery, {{bordering}} on recklessness, and was confident of success, {{as evidenced by}} his haughty reply to the 500 mercenaries. Walter's pride and arrogance, combined with his numerical advantage and his innate belief in the superiority of heavy noble cavalry over infantry, led him to fatally underestimate his opponent and order a charge across even such an adverse terrain. Impatient for action, according to Muntaner Walter formed a cavalry line of 200 Frankish knights [...] "with golden spurs", followed by the infantry, and placed himself with his banner in the vanguard. The Frankish attack failed, but the reason is unclear; Muntaner's description is short and provides no details, while Gregoras states that the heavy Frankish cavalry got completely stuck in the mud, with the Almogavars, lightly armed with swords and darts, dispatching the knights, encumbered by their heavy armour. This is the commonly accepted version among scholars as well. The Chronicle of the Morea {{on the other hand}} implies that the battle was hard-fought, which as military historian Kelly DeVries notes seems to contradict Gregoras, and that the marsh possibly simply reduced the impact of the charge instead of bogging it down entirely. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> is that the Catalans held, and that the Duke and most of his men fell. As the two lines clashed, the Turkish auxiliaries, reassured {{that this was not a}} ruse, descended from their camp upon the Athenian army, panicking and routing what remained of it.|$|E
500|$|According to Duff Hart-Davis, the British {{mercenary}} leader Jim Johnson {{had originally}} considered buying their own aircraft, a Lockheed Constellation 749. He then flew to Teheran {{to try to}} persuade the Iranians to do an air drop. Hart-Davis further claims that success was finally achieved by an adviser to the mercenaries, the MP Neil [...] "Billy" [...] McLean, who privately (without the British government's knowledge) flew to Tel Aviv to meet Moshe Dayan, defense minister, and Meir Amit, head of Mossad. According to [...] "Haaretz" [...] newspaper, Tony Boyle contacted David Karon, the head of the Middle East department in the Tevel (Cosmos) section of the Mossad, and met with IAF commander Ezer Weizman and his officers. It was decided that the airdrops would be made. Haaretz suggested the crew of the airdrops were British; while according to Hart-Davis the crew were Israeli (including the pilot named Arieh Oz), with Tony Boyle on board as an observer. Three decades after the war, former Mossad director, Shabtai Shavit, and Ariel Sharon both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen, though both remained vague concerning the nature and scale of the involvement. The airlifts were originally codenamed [...] "Operation Gravy", but were later renamed [...] "Operation Porcupine". The IAF's largest transport plane, a Stratofreighter, was recruited for the British operation. According to Jones, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>clear</b> however {{is that some of the}} mercenary air drops to the royalists (code-named [...] "Mango") were organized by the British using an aircraft, which were contracted privately from IAF to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops.|$|E
5000|$|Possibly {{the best}} known action {{involving}} RP-3s {{was that of the}} Falaise pocket of mid-August 1944.

Amongst the waves of light, medium and fighter bombers attacking the German columns the Typhoons of 2 TAF attacked with their rockets, claiming hundreds of tanks and [...] "Mechanised Enemy Transport". After the battle Army and 2nd TAF Operational Research Sections studying the battleground {{came to the conclusion that}} far fewer vehicles (17 in total) had been destroyed by rocket strike alone. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>was</b> that in the heat of battle it was far harder for pilots to launch the weapons while meeting the conditions needed for accuracy.
