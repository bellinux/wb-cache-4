25|$|The {{depiction}} of the Indigenous warrior in the painting—kneeling <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> on his fist, looking at General Wolfe—has been analyzed in various ways. In art, the touching of one's face with one's hand {{is a sign of}} deep thought and intelligence (thus Rodin's The Thinker). Some consider it an idealization inspired by the noble savage concept (Fryd, 75). Original items of clothing that were used as a model for portraying the warrior in the painting {{can be found in the}} British Museum's collection (as well as additional First Nation artefacts used in other paintings by West).|$|E
25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift her tail and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway asked Pound to blue-ink {{his short}} stories. Although Hemingway was 14 years younger, the two forged a lifelong {{relationship}} of mutual respect and friendship, {{living on the}} same street for a time, and touring Italy together in 1923. [...] "They liked each other personally, shared the same aesthetic aims, and admired each other's work", writes Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers, with Hemingway assuming the status of pupil to Pound's teaching. Pound introduced Hemingway to Lewis, Ford, and Joyce, while Hemingway in turn tried to teach Pound to box, but as he told Sherwood Anderson, [...] " [...] habitually leads <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> and has the general grace of a crayfish or crawfish".|$|E

2500|$|NFL {{executive}} Bill Granholm {{recalled that}} it was Hirsch's ability to make the overhead or over-the-shoulder catch that set him apart: [...] "He would run down the field <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> {{high in the air}} -- with his head all the way back. Under a long pass, he didn't look left or right as they do today -- he looked up and back at the ball as it came to him [...] over his head[...] [...] [...] e put his head between the ball and the defensive back. That's how he caught so many bombs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Southey's {{personal}} appearance, {{there is}} something eccentric, even off-putting: he [...] "walks <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> erect {{through the streets of}} London, and with an umbrella sticking out under his arm, in the finest weather." [...] "With a tall, loose figure, a peaked austerity of countenance, and no inclination to embonpoint, you would say he has something puritanical, something ascetic in his appearance." [...] Hazlitt hopes the negative aspects of his character will dissipate, wishing that Southey live up to his own ideal as expressed in his poem [...] "The Holly-Tree" [...] so that [...] "as he mellows into maturer age, all [...] asperities may wear off...." ...|$|E
2500|$|She said, [...] "Indeed, {{he never}} used to pray or fast more {{than the rest of}} you, but I never saw a servant of God who feared Him more than Umar. He devoted his body and his soul to the people. All day he would sit tending to their affairs, and when night came he would sit up while {{business}} remained. One evening when he had finished everything, he called for his lamp - from which he used to buy the oil from his own money - and prayed two prostrations. Then he sat back on his folded legs, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> in his hands, and the tears ran down from his cheeks, and this didn't stop until dawn, when he rose for a day of fasting.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, McCaughey was {{assigned}} to the RUC Special Patrol Group, a specialist [...] "anti-terrorist" [...] unit, based in Armagh. McCaughey co-operated extensively with the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade and carried out a number of attacks on their behalf, along with SPG colleagues. He [...] "expressed virulently anti-Catholic views ... and made it known ... that he had strong links to the UVF. A Special Branch recommendation that he be excluded after his probationary period was overridden by an inspector's report that described him as 'one of the best, if not the best, constables attached to my section (of the B Specials)'". McCaughey said of his RUC Special Patrol Group unit: ”Our colour code was Orange and it was Orange by nature and several of us were paramilitaries. Our proud boast was that we would never have a Catholic in it. We did actually have a Catholic once, a guy called Danny from Dungannon. The day after he joined we had him dangling out from the back of a Land Rover <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> inches from the road. He lasted a week”. In 1977 he was charged with stealing a table from the Mayor of Lisburn Elsie Kelsey's home. McCaughey had been on escort duty for Ulster Unionist Party politician John Taylor, who was attending a party in the house at the time.|$|E
