5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be {{represented as a}} set of files—could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs. The 9wm <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> was inspired by 8½, the older windowing system of Plan 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E

50|$|Dynamic <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> can {{dynamically}} {{switch between}} tiling or floating window layout. A variety of dynamic <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> for X are available.|$|R
5000|$|Tiling <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> that don't use layouts {{are called}} [...] manual tiling <b>window</b> <b>managers.</b> They let the user decide where windows should be placed.|$|R
50|$|Some tiling <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> provide title bars {{which are}} purely for {{informative}} purposes and offer no controls or menus. These <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> {{do not allow}} windows to be moved around the screen by using a drag action on the titlebar and may also serve {{the purpose of a}} status line from stacking <b>window</b> <b>managers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Desktop <b>Window</b> <b>Manager</b> is {{included}} in all editions of Windows Vista except the Starter edition.|$|E
25|$|A <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> {{controls}} the placement and appearance of application windows. This {{may result in}} desktop interfaces reminiscent of those of Microsoft Windows or of the Apple Macintosh (examples include GNOME 2, KDE, Xfce) or have radically different controls (such as a tiling <b>window</b> <b>manager,</b> like wmii or Ratpoison). Some interfaces such as Sugar or Chrome OS eschew the desktop metaphor altogether, simplifying their interfaces for specialized applications. Window managers range in sophistication and complexity from the bare-bones (e.g., twm, the basic <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> supplied with X, or evilwm, an extremely light window-manager) to the more comprehensive desktop environments such as Enlightenment and even to application-specific window-managers for vertical markets such as point-of-sale.|$|E
25|$|The <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> handles user {{interaction}} with multiple client windows much like other X window managers.|$|E
50|$|A {{window border}} {{is a window}} {{decoration}} component provided by some <b>window</b> <b>managers,</b> that appears around the active <b>window.</b> Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> may also display a border around background windows. Typically window borders {{can be used to}} provide window motion enabling the window to be moved or resized by using a drag action. Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> provide useless borders which are purely for decorative purposes and offer no window motion facility. These <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> do not allow windows to be resized by using a drag action on the border.|$|R

50|$|All <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> {{that have}} {{overlapping}} windows {{and are not}} compositing <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> are stacking <b>window</b> <b>managers,</b> although {{it is possible that}} not all use the same methods. Stacking <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> allow <b>windows</b> to overlap by drawing background windows first, which is referred to as painter's algorithm. Changes sometimes require that all windows be re-stacked or repainted, which usually involves redrawing every window. However, to bring a background window to the front usually only requires that one window be redrawn, since background windows may have bits of other windows painted over them, effectively erasing the areas that are covered.|$|R
25|$|The December CTP {{was also}} the last build of Windows Vista that {{supported}} the bypassing of the WDDM driver model requirement, hence allowing the Desktop <b>Window</b> <b>Manager</b> (UXSS {{at the time of}} the build) to run using software vertex emulation. Because of this change post the 5270 builds, the well known keys 'UseMachineCheck' and 'EnableMachineCheck do not allow running the Desktop <b>Window</b> <b>Manager</b> in software emulation mode.|$|E

25|$|Wayland is {{a display}} server {{protocol}} {{intended as a}} replacement for the X11 protocol; , it has not received wider adoption. Unlike X11, Wayland does not need an external <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> and compositing manager. Therefore, a Wayland compositor takes the role of the display server, <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> and compositing manager. Weston is the reference implementation of Wayland, while GNOME's Mutter and KDE's KWin are being ported to Wayland as standalone display servers. Enlightenment has already been successfully ported since version 19.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> provide titlebar buttons {{which provide}} the {{facility}} to minimize, maximize, roll-up or close application <b>windows.</b> Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or taskpanel, {{rather than in}} the titlebars.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Window</b> <b>managers</b> use {{a program}} called a window {{decorator}} to provide the window borders with the usual minimize, maximize and close buttons. Unlike many <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> which have only one window decorator, Compiz users {{have a choice of}} three: ...|$|R
50|$|Tiling <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> paint all <b>windows</b> {{on-screen}} {{by placing}} them {{side by side}} or above and below each other, so that no window ever covers another. Microsoft Windows 1.0 used tiling, {{and a variety of}} tiling <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> for X are available.|$|R
25|$|In {{preliminary}} design documents for the Chromium OS open source project, Google described a three-tier architecture: firmware, browser and <b>window</b> <b>manager,</b> and system-level software and userland services.|$|E

25|$|The {{architecture}} of Windows NT's kernel {{is considered a}} hybrid kernel because the kernel itself contains tasks such as the <b>Window</b> <b>Manager</b> and the IPC Managers, with a client/server layered subsystem model.|$|E
5000|$|Title bar buttons are {{included}} in the titlebar of some <b>window</b> <b>managers,</b> and provide the facility to minimize, maximize, rollup or close application <b>windows.</b> Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> may display the titlebar buttons in the taskbar or task panel, rather than in a titlebar.|$|R
5000|$|Some <b>window</b> <b>managers</b> {{provide a}} taskbar that shows running {{applications}}. The taskbar may show all applications that are running {{including those that}} have been minimized, and may provide the facility to switch focus between them. The taskbar may be incorporated into a menubar on some <b>window</b> <b>managers.</b>|$|R

25|$|Many users use X with {{a desktop}} environment, which, {{aside from the}} <b>window</b> <b>manager,</b> {{includes}} various applications using a consistent user-interface. Popular desktop environments include GNOME, KDE Software Compilation and Xfce. The UNIX 98 standard environment is the Common Desktop Environment (CDE). The freedesktop.org initiative addresses interoperability between desktops and the components needed for a competitive X desktop.|$|E
25|$|The WIMP {{style of}} {{interaction}} uses a virtual input device {{to represent the}} position of a pointing device, most often a mouse, and presents information organized in windows and represented with icons. Available commands are compiled together in menus, and actions are performed making gestures with the pointing device. A <b>window</b> <b>manager</b> facilitates the interactions between windows, applications, and the windowing system. The windowing system handles hardware devices such as pointing devices, graphics hardware, and positioning of the pointer.|$|E
25|$|Apple, Digital Research, IBM and Microsoft used many of Xerox's {{ideas to}} develop products, and IBM's Common User Access {{specifications}} {{formed the basis}} of the user interfaces used in Microsoft Windows, IBM OS/2 Presentation Manager, and the Unix Motif toolkit and <b>window</b> <b>manager.</b> These ideas evolved to create the interface found in current versions of Microsoft Windows, and in various desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems, such as macOS and Linux. Thus most current GUIs have largely common idioms.|$|E
