40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) play {{an increasingly}} important role in maintaining geographically close romantic relationships (GCRR). However, knowledge about SNS use in long-distance romantic relationships (LDRR) is still lacking. The present study examined {{the relative importance of}} SNS in maintaining LDRR compared to GCRR, particularly with regard to the use of SNS to express involvement (via relational maintenance behaviors) and to gauge a partner's involvement (via partner surveillance and jealousy) in the relationship. An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N= 272). Results showed that participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR reported higher levels of relational maintenance behaviors through SNS than participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR. Also, as compared to participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR, participants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR used SNS more for partner surveillance and experienced higher levels of SNS jealousy...|$|R

While uncertainty about Stauskas', Robinson's and McGary's returns remained speculation, projections abounded: 9 by Yahoo!

During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the way {{they looked at the}} songs they had initially written.

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Markgraf sank at 16:45. The British soldiers in the guard detail panicked {{in their attempt to}} prevent the Germans from scuttling the ships; they shot and killed Markgrafs captain, Walter Schumann, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifeboat, and an enlisted man. In total, the guards killed nine Germans and wounded twenty-one. The remaining crews, totaling some 1,860 officers and enlisted men, were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Torres, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; {{she had almost}} died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with {{her mother was a}} hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
