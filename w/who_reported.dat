However, in some medical circles, it can instead be more commonly known as Macklin's Syndrome after L. Macklin, in 1939, and M.T. and C.C. Macklin, in 1944, who cumulatively went on to describe the pathophysiology in more detail.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine the {{following}} question: What is the relationship between parental interest and control over their adolescent children, and juvenile delinquency? Two hypotheses were tested: (1) fewer adolescents <b>who</b> <b>report</b> greater parental control will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents <b>who</b> <b>report</b> less parental control; and (2), fewer adolescents <b>who</b> <b>report</b> greater parental interest will report engaging in delinquent behavior than adolescents <b>who</b> <b>report</b> less parental control. Approximately 7, 000 high school students responded to a four-page questionnaire containing self-report questions onjuvenile delinquency, parental control, and parental interest. Results indicated little, if any, support for the two;hypotheses. However, when using individual items which were combined to create the overall rating scales, almost every relationship was significant. The author discusses the reasons for these results.

5|$|The eastern {{section of}} the Notitia is dated to c. 395, at the death of Theodosius I. At this time, {{according}} to the Notitia, in the East there were 2 imperial escort armies (comitatus praesentales), each commanded by a magister militum praesentalis, the highest military rank, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> direct to the emperor. These contained units of mainly palatini grade. In addition, there were 3 diocesan comitatus, in East Illyricum, Thraciae and Oriens dioceses, consisting mostly of comitatenses-grade troops. Each was commanded by a magister militum, who also reported direct to the emperor.|$|E

During their travels, the group encountered the Caddo, who gave the Frenchmen a map depicting their territory, that of their neighbors, {{and the location of}} the Mississippi River. The Caddo often made friendship pacts with neighboring peoples and extended their policy of peaceful negotiation to the French. While visiting the Caddo, the French met Jumano traders, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> on the activities of the Spanish in New Mexico. These traders later informed Spanish officials of the Frenchmen they had seen.|$|E

No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations, and no trace of a burial could be found. For this reason, it is unclear whether the pyramid was used to bury a pharaoh or was abandoned following the premature death of the king.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [50]- 59) This {{study examined}} the relationship between aversive parental disciplinary techniques and aggressive behavior by the child. Social learning theory stresses the importance of children learning through imitating or modeling the behavior of others. Because parents are the most influential models during a child's early formative years, it is likely that parents who use aversive disciplinary techniques will have children who will display more aggressive behavior. In addition, this aggressive pattern continues to play a part in the psychological makeup of the individual child after reaching adulthood. The questionnaire used in this study was distributed at Northern Illinois University to 13 classes in education, business, and human and family resources in 1985. The questionnaire was adapted from the Conflict Tactics Scale and provided information to test the following hypotheses: Hypothesis I: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they engaged in more aggressive behavior as children compared with adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. Hypothesis II: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they experienced more sibling conflict compared to adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. Hypothesis III: Adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that their parents used more aversive control measures select more aggressive responses to parental and interpersonal hypothetical situations compared with adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> their parents used less aversive control measures. The chi-square and Somer's d statistics were used to analyze the data. The results supported the hypotheses that adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that their parents used more aversive control measures recall that they engaged in more aggressive behavior as children and experienced more sibling conflict. Also, the study provides some support for the hypothesis that adult children <b>who</b> <b>report</b> that their parents used more aversive control measures are more aggressive as adults. Recommendations for future studies include using a different population sample including respondents other than college students and refining the instrument to increase reliability. M. S.

5|$|This battle {{occurred}} on September 21–22, 1864. General Sheridan considered this battle {{a continuation of}} the Battle of Opequon near Winchester. General Early's Confederate army was pursued from Winchester to Fisher's Hill, where the rebels had strong fortifications and an advantageous location given the terrain. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment was still part of the 2nd Brigade led by Colonel Powell, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> to General Averell. In this battle, the regiment initially engaged in some skirmishing while dismounted—the terrain made it difficult to fight while mounted.|$|E
5|$|A {{follow-up}} study conducted 14 {{months after the}} original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction. Even after 14 months, those <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness/Intellect; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the {{benefits and harms of}} hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.|$|E

5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, the North Vietnamese had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, the North Vietnamese claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> to the North Vietnamese military authorities.

5|$|During the Contact period, it {{is known}} that certain {{military}} positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E

Late that night, a German frontline unit reported seeing six British machines shoot down a lone German aircraft that fell within the British trenches. Heldmann refused to believe Voss was killed in aerial combat; he claimed Voss had to have been shot after crawling from the wreckage.|$|E

5|$|Little is {{recorded}} about Caion's roots, {{other than that}} he was a devout Roman Catholic, and a regular presence at Saint Joseph Cathedral. He had a very early debut in cultural journalism. After 1897, when he was 15, his literary chroniclers saw print in several newspapers, under various pseudonyms such as C. A. I. Nică Burdușel, Ion Filionescu, Marin Gelea, Isac Șt. Micu, Roman Mușat, among others. In January 1898, he was employed by Adevărul daily, covering the Romanian tour of Sâr Péladan. Péladan, a writer, mystic and self-styled mage, failed to impress the young reporter, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> on his various claims with a note of irony. Also then, he affiliated with Macedonski's eclectic art magazine Literatorul (known during the period as Revista Literară). Interested in the Roman Empire, he published with Literatorul a comparative biography of Julius Caesar and Augustus, republished as a book by Carol Göbl of Bucharest.|$|E
5|$|Marseille had {{a narrow}} escape on 13 May 1942, when his Bf 109 was damaged during a dogfight with 12 Kittyhawks (Mk I) from No. 3 Squadron RAAF, {{southeast}} of Gazala {{and over the}} Gulf of Bomba ("Gazala Bay"). With a wingman, Marseille bounced the Kittyhawks. After he downed one of the Australian pilots, Flying Officer Graham Pace in AL172, Marseille's Bf 109 took hits in the oil tank and propeller, likely from Flying Officer Geoff Chinchen, <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> damaging one of the Messerschmitts. Marseille nevertheless managed to shoot down another Kittyhawk (Sergeant Colin McDiarmid; AK855), before nursing his overheating aircraft back to base. The repairs to Marseille's Bf 109 took two days. The aerial victories were recorded as numbers 57–58.|$|E
5|$|On rivers, actuariae {{could operate}} year-round, except during periods when the rivers were ice-bound or of high water (after heavy rains or thaw), when the river-current was dangerously strong. It {{is likely that}} the {{establishment}} of the empire's frontier on the Rhine-Danube line was dictated by the logistical need for large rivers to accommodate supply ships more than by defensibility. These rivers were dotted with purpose-built military docks (portus exceptionales). The protection of supply convoys on the rivers was the responsibility of the fluvial flotillas (classes) under the command of the riverine duces. The Notitia gives no information about the Rhine flotillas (as the Rhine frontier had collapsed by the time the Western section was compiled), but mentions 4 classes Histricae (Danube flotillas) and 8 other classes in tributaries of the Danube. Each flotilla was commanded by a praefectus classis <b>who</b> <b>reported</b> to the local dux. It appears that each dux on the Danube disposed of at least one flotilla (one, the dux Pannoniae, controlled three).|$|E
