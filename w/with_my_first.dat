25|$|In the 1928 letter, he recounted what {{happened}} during those early attempts: “At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty miles an hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside directly after it left the ground. So I never flew <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> experimental plane, but no-one else did with their first for that matter”.|$|E

2500|$|Her final {{performances}} {{included the}} 2003 Sydney Cabaret Convention where she received two standing ovations for her {{performances of the}} jazz anthem [...] "Something Cool" [...] and Stephen Sondheim's [...] "Send in the Clowns". Dr David Schwartz, writing for Cabaret Hotline Online said in his review, [...] "It is hard to describe her to you without sounding as if I {{were a little bit}} insane. Her performance provided me with one of those life-changing and totally defining cabaret experiences that was instantly committed to memory, along <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> exposure to Mabel Mercer, Julie Wilson, Sarah Vaughan, Sylvia Syms {{and a host of other}} greats. Gery Scott's set represented that rare moment in cabaret when the singer and her song are indistinguishable. This sort of alchemy comes only after many years; to witness it is to be blessed". [...] She was also special guest in a 2003 Sondheim review, and two fund raising concerts for fellow performers in 2004.|$|E
