But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> says about me, they won’t — I can write something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E
500|$|The merger between Square and Enix, {{which had}} been under {{consideration}} since at least 2000 according to Yasuhiro Fukushima, Enix chairman at the time, was delayed because {{of the failure of}} the film and Enix' hesitation at merging with a company that had just lost a substantial amount of money. Square Pictures announced in late January 2002 that they were closing down, largely due to the commercial failure of The Spirits Within. The film's CGI effects have been compared favourably with later CGI films such as James Cameron's 2009 film Avatar. [...] In 2011, BioWare art director Derek Watts cited The Spirits Within as a major influence on the successful Mass Effect series of action role-playing games. In the first episode of the Square Enix published 2015 video game Life Is Strange, when the lead interacts with a TV, she mentions the idea of watching the film, and says [...] "I don't care <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> says, that's one of the best sci-fi films ever made." [...] Although the film was loosely based on a video game series, there were never any plans for a game adaptation of the film itself. Sakaguchi indicated the reason for this was the lack of powerful gaming hardware at the time, feeling the graphics in any game adaptation would be far too much of a step down from the graphics in the film itself. A novelization was written by Dean Wesley Smith and published by Pocket Books in June 2001. The Making of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, a companion book, was published by BradyGames in August 2001. Edited by Steven L. Kent, the 240 page color book contains a foreword by director Sakaguchi and extensive information on all aspects of the film's creation, including concept art, storyboards, sets and props, layout, motion capture and animation, as well as a draft of the full script.|$|E

Baber and Fatima, who represent conservative views within Islam, are balanced by conservative radio host Fred Tupper among the non-Muslims, while Amaar and Rayyan, who represent Islamic liberalism, are balanced by the liberal Anglican Rev. Magee. The more moderate Yasir and Sarah, who try to be good Muslims but aren't particularly strongly defined by their faith, are balanced among the non-Muslims by Mayor Popowicz, who doesn't care <b>what</b> <b>anybody's</b> religious beliefs are {{as long as they}} vote for her on election day.|$|R

He helped guide India to their first series win in England in 1971 and was a major reason behind the development of such outstanding cricketers as Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri.

It's not {{a far cry from}} what I thought it would be." [...] He added that he {{preferred}} his 2004 version, and that the sound of The Smile Sessions disappointed him because of its unfinished state. Linett argued that The Smile Sessions may be more accurate to Brian's vision than if he had completed the album in 1967, surmising that [...] "he would have been happier if he had had a bigger canvas to present this," [...] referencing the overwhelming amount of material that would have had to have been condensed into a two-sided vinyl LP, and Brian's ambition to [...] "expand the boundaries of what a pop record was beyond <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> was doing at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{entering}} the studio, Gunnulfsen met Harnage at a Versa show. She {{asked him for}} pointers on production. He [...] "first got me into making electronic music", according to Gunnulfsen. Previously, she was [...] "afraid" [...] of the band's more electronic side. She also feared it was [...] "too out-of-the-box", potentially out-casting them from the music scene. PVRIS began recording material with Harnage producing the proceedings. He helped teach the band [...] "not give a shit <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> thought", according to Gunnulfsen. For one week in the studio, Harnage and Gunnulfsen were sifting through demos and deciding which of the material to work on. The group had 30 demos to work with. The demos were either [...] "rock-based" [...] or [...] "weird and electronic". Harnage and Gunnulfsen went with the latter, building upon them.

2500|$|Yeasayer's {{two main}} lyricists, Keating and Wilder, shared writing duties for the 10 songs on Odd Blood. Keating, whose {{grandfather}} was a boxer in the late 1930s and early 1940s, was inspired to write [...] "Ambling Alp" [...] after reading about American boxer Joe Louis. The track's title comes from the nickname of one of Louis' adversaries, Italian Primo Carnera, while the lyrics, including the lines [...] "Stick up for yourself son / Never mind <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> else done", are {{from the perspective of}} Louis' father. Keating wrote [...] "I Remember" [...] as a love song about a woman—later to be his wife—he met and kissed on a plane; he has noted that for the time he overcame his fear of flying. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] is Keating's attempt to mix the late 1970s drug-fueled paranoia of David Bowie with the current 24-hour news cycle and [...] "the sort of absurd, psychotic rants" [...] of Fox newscasters Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity.|$|E

[...] She just doesn't care <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> thinks; she's so committed to what she thinks is right, and everyone else be damned. [...] But she has a heart of gold, and she's very strong. [...] To be a female as strong as she was, in the kind of world she came from, was wonderful, I think." [...] Lauding the character, Adams says that it's Ishka's backbone that helps her grow as an actress and as a person.

2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E
2500|$|... "God Only Knows" [...] is {{frequently}} cited for referencing [...] "God" [...] in its title, {{a decision that}} Wilson and Asher agonized over, fearing it would not get airplay as a result. As Wilson's then-wife Marilyn describes, [...] "The first time I heard it, Brian played it {{for me at the}} piano. And I went, 'Oh my God, he's talking about God in a record.' It was pretty daring to me. And it was another time I thought to myself, 'Oh, boy, he's really taking a chance.' I thought it was almost too religious. Too square. At that time. Yes, it was so great that he would say it and not be intimidated by <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> else would think of the words or what he meant." [...] Asher explains that he and Brian [...] "had lengthy conversations during the writing of 'God Only Knows', because unless you were Kate Smith and you were singing 'God Bless America', no one thought you could say 'God' in a song. No one had done it, and Brian didn't want to be the first person to try it. He said, 'We'll just never get any air play.' Isn't it amazing that we thought that? But it worked." [...] Wilson added that although he feared putting the word [...] "God" [...] in the title of the song, he eventually agreed to keep it, firstly, [...] "because God was a spiritual word", and secondly, because the Beach Boys would [...] "be breaking ground".|$|E

2500|$|The first single, [...] "Never Again", was {{released}} on April 13, 2007 in the U.S., and despite debuting in the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 thanks to strong digital sales, it never achieved substantial airplay and was pulled from many stations {{only a couple of}} weeks following its release. Otherwise, the album opened successfully; its opening week sales comparable to those of Clarkson's first two albums. It was suggested that so much controversy would have hindered the sales of Clarkson's then-new album. M. Tye Corner of AOL Music had opined early on that the controversy could [...] "affect sales a bit in the first few weeks and when the record c out." [...] In spite of the controversy surrounding My December, the album garnered fairly positive reviews from music professionals and critics. The album scored 64/100 on Metacritic, indicating generally positive reviews. Slant Magazine reviewed My December mostly positive, with the album receiving a 3.5/5 star review. An excerpt from the review, in response to the disappointing performance of [...] "Never Again", read: [...] "But who cares about hits—or appeasing the kids—when the songs are this good?" [...] The Times wrote: [...] "Clarkson has the moxie to rock without worrying about <b>what</b> <b>anybody</b> else thinks...
