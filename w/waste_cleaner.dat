In about 20 minutes, {{the main part of}} the garbage (organic matter), is converted into a kind of biomass, very clean, that you can touch with your hands, storable, and valid for composting, for gassification, or power generation (the calorific power is about 3.500 kcal/kg). The rest of materials like plastic or metals, are very easy to select once garbage has been processed into the <b>Waste</b> <b>Cleaner.</b> The advantages of this technology are really impressive: It makes possible the goal of zero landfill, the volume of the garbage is reduced more than 80%, the operational costs are significantly reduced, no emissions, the employees work in very clean conditions, it increases a lot the efficiency in respect to other technologies, and is very fast (20 minutes are enough). The Plant of ECOHISPÁNICA is in the city of Rivas Vaciamadrid (Madrid), one of the most prestigious cities in Spain in environment and new technologies. Visits from more than 80 countries have been received in the Plant in the last 2 years.

40|$|Environmental {{degradation}} {{caused by}} the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico can be greatly reduced by using natural products, such as cotton, in lieu of synthetics to absorb and recover oil from the ocean. Cotton and many cotton byproducts are much more efficient than synthetics in absorbing oil. Agricultural engineers reported in 1994 that cotton fiber can absorb about 40 times its weight in oil, as compared to synthetics that currently absorb 10 to 20 times their weight. The oil absorbed by cotton along with the cotton itself will degrade naturally in the environment, {{which is not the}} case for synthetics. Additionally, cotton fiber and its fibrous byproducts can be reused to absorb additional oil. Research by agricultural engineer and ASABE Fellow Wm. Stanley Anthony at the U. S.

Gin waste products containing more lint fiber by weight were more effective than those whose composition was dominated by non-lint materials such as hulls and seed cotton <b>cleaner</b> <b>waste.</b> With chemical modifications such as the addition of acetic anhydride, the absorptive capacity can be increased. Furthermore, cotton can be reused through several cycles after removal of absorbed oil although the oil absorption decreases (Deschamps et al., 2003).

40|$|After {{several decades}} of rapid urbanisation, {{population}} growth and industrialisation, most developing countries have now become home to the rapidly increasing informal sector’s polluting activities. With marked failures {{in their use of}} traditional Command and Control (CAC) legislation, limited technical and fiscal environmental protection resources coupled with weak environmental protection, complimentary judicial and legislative institutions, it has become necessary for these countries to look somewhere else for environment regulation policy. This study evaluates potential contributions of public-led voluntary agreements programs in the control of informal sector pollution in Lusaka’s Soweto and City markets in Zambia. The study employs Binary Logistic Models to establish factors critical to the successful implementation of environmental management voluntary agreements in the two markets. It also uses the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to assess and estimate traders’ Willingness to pay (WTP) for proposed improvements to cleanliness in the markets. The main empirical data for the study was collected by means of a questionnaire survey of 93 traders in the two markets and supplemented by semi-structured interviews. The study finds that indeed voluntary agreements have a potential to control informal sector pollution in developing countries like Zambia. The study also finds that while the informal sector significantly contributes to urban pollution, they are hamstrung by lack of capacity to control their own pollution. The absence of adequate regulatory enforcement and appropriate incentives in terms of <b>waste</b> bins and <b>cleaners</b> in these markets seriously militate against the sector’s limited efforts in implementing positive environmental management in these markets. The traders’ mean willingness to pay (WTP) for the proposed improvement to cleanliness in the two market is K 483, 384 per trader per year while the total WTP of all the traders in the two markets is K 1, 208, 460, 000 or K 1. 2 billion per year. As a proportion of the traders’ average annual income, the mean WTP amounts to 0. 8 %. The study concludes that deliberate interventions with the aim of enhancing their capacity are necessary. In this regard specific recommendations have been made for policy intervention in specific key areas, namely; the provision of appropriate incentives in form of increasing the number of <b>waste</b> bins and <b>cleaners</b> in the markets together with supporting organisational structure and efficient services in terms of frequent removal of waste from the markets by the local authority; the expansion and strengthening of the physical presence of regulatory and enforcement agents in these markets and finally; the building of a shared understanding among the traders of the need for maintaining a clean and environmentally conducive market area through continued sensitisation programs in these markets CopyrightDissertation (MSc(Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

40|$|Abstract Background Medical {{waste is}} {{infectious}} and hazardous. It poses serious threats to {{environmental health and}} requires specific treatment and management prior to its final disposal. The problem is growing with an ever-increasing number of hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic laboratories in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. However, research on this critical issue has been very limited, {{and there is a}} serious dearth of information for planning. This paper seeks to document the handling practice of waste (e. g. collection, storage, transportation and disposal) along with the types and amount of wastes generated by Health Care Establishments (HCE). A total of 60 out of the existing 68 HCE in the study areas provided us with relevant information. Methods The methodology for this paper includes empirical field observation and field-level data collection through inventory, questionnaire survey and formal and informal interviews. A structured questionnaire was designed to collect information addressing the generation of different medical wastes according to amount and sources from different HCE. A number of in-depth interviews were arranged to enhance our understanding of previous and existing management practice of medical wastes. A number of specific questions were asked of nurses, hospital managers, doctors, and cleaners to elicit their knowledge. The collected data with the questionnaire survey were analysed, mainly with simple descriptive statistics; while the qualitative mode of analysis is mainly in narrative form. Results The paper shows that the surveyed HCE generate a total of 5, 562 kg/day of wastes, of which about 77. 4 per cent are non-hazardous and about 22. 6 per cent are hazardous. The average waste generation rate for the surveyed HCE is 1. 9 kg/bed/day or 0. 5 kg/patient/day. The study reveals that there is no proper, systematic management of medical waste except in a few private HCE that segregate their infectious <b>wastes.</b> Some <b>cleaners</b> were found to salvage used sharps, saline bags, blood bags and test tubes for resale or reuse. Conclusion The paper reveals that lack of awareness, appropriate policy and laws, and willingness are responsible for the improper management of medical waste in Dhaka City. The paper also shows that a newly designed medical waste management system currently serves a limited number of HCE.

The choice is between individual treatment of the relevant elements and a grouped treatment of all actinides together, between a homogeneous mode where all actinides are co-processed and a heterogeneous mode where minor actinides are separately treated; regarding separation the two main options are aqueous and dry reprocessing, which should {{not be seen as}} competitors but as solutions to be implemented depending on the boundary conditions governing the deployment of a new reactor system. Separation mechanisms involved in the various process options should be well understood and necessary complete basic data sets should be provided to make best use of simulation and modelling tools to develop efficient and reliable separation schemes. Although some scale-up experiments were already performed, all of the advanced separations processes proposed today need considerable additional efforts to reach industrial maturity. Also safeguarding schemes have to be developed in this context, {{especially in the case of}} dry processes. Last not least more conclusive and reliable fuel cycle back-end solutions need to be proposed and the links between the various disciplines involved in a successful P&T scenario, first of all fuel fabrication, irradiation and reprocessing, have to be considerably re-inforced.

40|$|The {{professional}} public {{have registered}} and increased incidence of injuries to children caused by chemical substances {{during the last}} years. The issue has recently been neither given appropriate publicity in media nor solved sufficiently, however, {{with respect to the}} high frequency and seriousness of injuries, it deserves to be given more significant attention. The research study focused on detailed mapping of the causes and circumstances of the occurrence of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract injuries in children caused by chemical substances. The research sample comprised of children less than 18 years old who suffered injuries caused by a chemical substance in the monitored period, while being hospitalized in connection with such an injury at the Nemocnice České Budějovice, a. s., Nemocnice Most, o. z., and Fakultní nemocnice Motol, Prague, hospitals. The research study included 90 children (out of which 44 girls and 46 boys). The youngest hospitalized child was five months old, the oldest was seventeen. The required data were collected in a prospective manner (May 1, 2008 - October 31, 2008) and in a retrospective manner (January 1, 2006 { [...] } April 30, 2008). I obtained the research result though the secondary data analysis (medical documentation) and the analysis of products (those that where staded in the medical documentation to have been packed in an original package). The results of the secondary analysis of the medical documentation refer to the fact that 94 per cent of all the injuries caused by chemical substances were induced by children in their domestic environment. Damage to the organism was caused by agents commonly used in Czech households (<b>waste</b> pipe <b>cleaners,</b> dishwasher tablets, cooker cleaners, etc). It is understandable that packals of these products attract children's attention because producers have selected rich colours (yellow, blue, violet, pink) only for their products as a part of their fight-for-customers strategy. Many products have not been fitted with safety cap closures and in combination with unsuitable storing {{there was nothing left to}} prevent an injury. The appearance of new detergents, such as for example dishwasher tablets, on the market is accompanied with the risk of occurrence of new injury types that need to be drawn attention to. In my opinion, sufficient public healt educational campaigns should lead to the decreasing of the number of injuries. Information campaign should be organised in a manner addressing the highest possible number of parents and persons taking care of children. I consider efficient to place information leaflets on the websites of organisations and institutions working with children population, to use TV spots and to distribute information leaflets of brochures to paediatric surgeries and nursery schools. The leaflets should contain information not only about proper household storing of such products, but also several pieces of advice in the case when an injury has already been suffered...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} focus on recycling in Sweden during recent years. This focus {{can be attributed}} to external environmental factors such as tougher legislation, but also to the potential gains for raw materials suppliers. Recycling centres are important components in the Swedish total recycling system. Recycling centres are manned facilities for waste collection where visitors can bring, sort and discard worn products as well as large-sized, hazardous, and electrical waste. The aim of this paper was to identify and describe the main flows and layout types at Swedish recycling centres. The aim was also to adapt and apply production theory for designing and managing recycling centre operations. More specifically, this means using lean production principles to help develop guidelines for recycling centre design and efficient control. Empirical data for this research was primarily collected through interviews and questionnaires among both visitors and employees at 16 Swedish recycling centres. Furthermore, adapted observation protocols have been used in order to explore visitor activities. There was also close collaboration with a local recycling centre company, which shared their layout experiences with the researchers in this project. The recycling centres studied had a variety of problems such as queues of visitors, overloading of material and improper sorting. The study shows that in order to decrease the problems, the recycling centres should be designed and managed according to lean production principles, i. e. through choosing more suitable layout choices with visible and linear flows, providing better visitor information, and providing suitable technical equipment. Improvements can be achieved through proper planning of the layout and control of the flow of vehicles, with the result of increased efficiency and capacity, shorter visits, and <b>cleaner</b> <b>waste</b> fractions. The benefits of a lean production mindset include increased visitor capacity, waste flexibility, improved sorting quality, shorter time for visits and improved working conditions.

40|$|Today {{there are}} a {{multitude}} of federal, regional, state and local programs providing assistance to small business. Many of these agencies have embraced pollution prevention as the preferred environmental protection strategy and are integrating it into the services they provide to industry. However, to remain effective in providing their services these programs require reliable and authoritative sources of information about pollution prevention, <b>waste</b> reduction, <b>cleaner</b> production technologies, design for the environment, and environmentally sustainable practices. Information is critical to induce businesses to undertake pollution prevention projects. Companies {{need to understand the}} various P 2 alternatives and their ramifications prior to making any changes in their facilities. In an attempt to encourage industry to implement pollution prevention, state and local environmental agencies established P 2 assistance programs. These programs provide companies with technical reports, case studies, on-site assistance, referrals to industry experts, newsletters, and vendor information. P 2 assistance programs have found that obtaining current and reliable information on P 2 strategies is challenging. When they can't find information they need, local P 2 programs often develop it themselves. Often they end up producing material that programs {{in other parts of the}} country have already published. Pollution prevention programs have long recognized the value of a national network that links P 2 information sources with the needs of local assistance providers. In 1995 the National Pollution Prevention Roundtable (NPPR) published Organizing a National Pollution Prevention Network, which outlined some of the issues that surround the dissemination of P 2 information. The report recommended a structure involving regional centers that would be linked together to create a national network. EPA piloted the development and coordination of two regional centers. These regional centers were responsible for working directly with and coordinating among the state and local pollution prevention programs, establishing regional priorities and serving as a point of contact for the regions. This structure was proposed so that P 2 information: ??? Is maintained at the local level; ??? Is made readily accessible and easy to search; ??? Is updated and of high-quality; ??? Identifies primary/expert sources of information; ??? Is integrated into a sector- and process-specific synthesized format; and ??? Addresses the needs of local and state agencies. In February 1997 the NPPR Information and Technology Transfer Workgroup issued a report titled "Establishing a National Pollution Prevention Network", which reaffirmed the structure proposed in the 1995 report and proposed a cost estimate for network operations. This report also provided an overall vision for a national P 2 information network and an estimated scope of work for network operations. "Recommendations for a National Information Network" builds on these reports and provides detailed information on (1) the lessons learned from two regional centers, (2) the challenges facing the existing network, (3) the existing infrastructure for a national P 2 information network, (4) the recommendations for needed improvements and support and (5) the recommendations for the national P 2 information network. The purpose of this report is to detail the experiences of two regional centers in their efforts to develop interstate and inter-regional programs and present recommendations for future efforts in this area. published or submitted for publicationnot peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In the {{laboratory}} {{under the direction}} of Prof. Roberto Ballini (where I carried out my PhD work), an “in-progress” research project has been under way for the past few years. This project, in the field of eco-friendly chemical processes, aims to develop new synthetic methods which could reduce <b>waste</b> and guarantee <b>cleaner</b> reactions. In the team, my task involved studying new reduced environmental impact processes in C-C and C-X bonding. These new processes have been achieved through solid heterogeneous catalysis and domino reactions, and both these methods are in accordance with Green Chemistry guidelines “Green Chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduces or eliminates the use and generation of hazardous substances” In this context, by means of solid heterogeneous catalysis, it is possible to reduce complicated work-up to a simple filtration or to a direct loading onto chromatographic column, avoiding the usage of aqueous layer, extraction with organic solvents and, above all, the application and the formation of salts, like Na 2 SO 4 and NH 4 Cl. Further, the catalyst is weakly corrosive, shows very low toxicity, provides reaction without the use of any solvent (i. e. the most toxic element in a reaction) and, sometimes, it can be recycled. Domino reactions, defined as: “the processes of two or more bond forming transformations under widely identical conditions in which the subsequent reactions take place at the functionalities obtained in the former transformation”, offer several advantages, in terms of environmental protection and lowering of costs, that lead to an advance toward eco-friendly systems. In fact, the possibility of producing two or more bonds in the same reaction conditions, instead of isolating every intermediate, diminishes the number of steps and consequently entails a reduction of work-up and purification processes. At the end, besides shortening the whole operation span, it provides a cut in the usage of solvents and reagents with evident decreasing of pollution. Thesis work As mentioned above, the main task of my PhD has been to cooperate to development of new synthetic processes in order to produce new C-C and C-X bonds under eco-friendly conditions. For this purpose aliphatic nitro compounds, thanks to the strong electron-withdrowing power of the nitro group, that guarantees the access – using weak conditions – to stabilized carbanions and the possibility of using the same group as leaving group, have proved to be good starting materials,compatible with low environmental impact processes. ...|$|R
