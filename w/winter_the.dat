5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In <b>winter,</b> <b>the</b> climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the <b>winter.</b> <b>The</b> Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E
