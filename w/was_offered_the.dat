5|$|Renoir {{originally}} {{wanted the}} entire cast of La Bête Humaineincluding Fernand Ledoux, Simone Simon, Jean Gabin and Julien Carettefor the film.

Simon <b>was</b> <b>offered</b> <b>the</b> role of Christine but wanted 800,000 francs, which was {{a third of the}} film's entire budget. Simon's salary request was vetoed by NEF administrator Camille Francois. Ledoux <b>was</b> <b>offered</b> <b>the</b> role of Schumacher.

Claude Dauphin <b>was</b> <b>offered</b> <b>the</b> role of the Marquis de la Chesnaye; he refused it and instead acted with Simon in Raymond Bernard's Cavalcade d'amour. Renoir then cast Marcel Dalio as the Marquis. Years later Dalio asked Renoir why he had been cast after having typically played burlesque or traitorous roles. Renoir told Dalio he was the opposite of the cliché of what a Marquis was, and that Dalio was the only actor he knew that could portray the character's insecurity. Renoir's brother Pierre was cast as Octave and Carette was cast as Marceau.|$|E
