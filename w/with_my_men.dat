6000|$|... "I {{was one of}} the three, countess; but {{the tale}} is a long one, and can be told after we have done with the Imperialists. Now, sir," [...] he went on, turning to the count, [...] "I am at your orders, and will take post <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> at any point that you may think fit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scurvy trick that 'd been," [...] muttered Bland. [...] "You did right. All the same, Duane, I {{want you}} to stop quarreling <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men.</b> If {{you were one of}} us--that'd be different. I can't keep my men from fighting. But I'm not called on to let an {{outsider}} hang around my camp and plug my rustlers." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Sir Mellegrans said: [...] "Well, lady, {{it shall}} be as you wish, for these men of yours fight not like men but like devils, {{wherefore}} I am glad to end this battle {{for the sake of}} all. So bid your knights put away their swords, and I will do likewise <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men,</b> and so there shall be peace between us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Rajah, we {{will ride}} on. We will {{say no more}} about this little affair, and I will ask Colonel Forde to forgive your ill {{behaviour}} in leaving him. But mind, if at any future time you attempt to disobey his orders, or to retire from the camp, I will blow out your brains; even if I have to follow you, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men,</b> {{into the heart of}} your own palace." ...|$|E
6000|$|The German {{company at}} once disbanded and scattered. The Huguenot noble said to Lionel: [...] "I {{fear that the}} news is true; listen to the shouts and cries in the town behind us. I will march <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> {{and see if there}} is any chance of beating back the Spaniards; if not it were best to lay down our arms and ask for quarter. Will you try to hold this gate until I return?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here I am," [...] yapped Vixen, [...] "under the gun tail <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man.</b> You big, blundering {{beast of}} a camel you, you upset our tent. My man's very angry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This great mixed {{multitude}} was {{put under}} the direction of a Conservator of Forests, a man celebrated for his exploits and daring adventures in the field, and it was as a friend of his that I joined the hunt <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man,</b> Pat Quin there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I thought Mr. Lintot’s civility {{not to be}} neglected, so {{gave the}} [...] boy a small bag {{containing}} three shirts and an Elzevir Virgil, and, [...] mounting in an instant, proceeded on the road, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man</b> before, [...] <b>my</b> courteous stationer beside, and the aforesaid devil behind.|$|R
60|$|The {{smoke from}} the fire was forcing me further and further back down the {{corridor}} toward the waters which I could hear surging through the darkness. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> had gone the last torch, nor was this corridor lighted by the radiance of phosphorescent rock as were those of the lower levels. It was this fact that assured me that I was {{not far from the}} upper pits which lie directly beneath the temple.|$|E
60|$|Noon arrived, but no cavalry. My companions {{had promised}} that if {{disappointed}} they would start before nightfall and march till morning. But when the camels were sent for, one, as usual if delay was judged advisable, had strayed: {{they went in}} search of him, so as to give time for preparation to the caravan. I then had a sharp explanation <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men,</b> and told them in conclusion that it was my determination to cross the Prairie alone, if necessary, on the morrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, I {{must go back}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> to join a {{party who}} {{are on their way}} to fight the English. I should have gone there direct, but met the others {{starting}} on this marauding expedition, which was so much to the taste of my men that I could not restrain them from joining. I shall see you at Jooneer, as soon as matters are finished with the English; then I shall, after staying a few days there, rejoin Scindia, in whose service I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, Sir knight; I thank you. But {{why should}} I, who am but a merchant, thrust myself upon your noble company? Let me stop outside <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man,</b> Petros, and dine with your {{people in that}} barn, where I see they are making ready their food." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{was but a}} yard {{between the}} two mighty ships as the first {{grappling}} irons were hurled. I rushed to the deck to be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> as they boarded. Just as the vessels came together with a slight shock, I forced {{my way through the}} lines and was the first to spring to the deck of Zat Arrras' ship. After me poured a yelling, cheering, cursing throng of Helium's best fighting-men. Nothing could withstand them in the fever of battle lust which enthralled them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expect that}} we shall have {{fighting}} with the blacks, on our way back. Those parties the two fellows who got away went to fetch will, likely enough, bar our way. If {{it were not for}} that, I should ride on by myself; but my duty is to stop <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> until, at any rate, we have passed the place where the blacks are likely to attack us. That done, I shall push on. It is annoying, indeed, to think that that fellow must have passed us somewhere on the way, yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|The same {{afternoon}} I sent my pinnace {{on board}} him for my drunken cockswain, {{and with the}} pinnace I sent the captain three dozen bottles of English beer, and a quarter cask of Canary, which was the best present I had to make him; and sent {{every one of his}} other seamen a piece of eight per man; and, indeed, the assistance I had from the ship deserved it; and to the mate, who acted so bravely <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> on shore, I sent fifty pieces of eight.|$|E

60|$|My nephew {{was ready}} to sail about the {{beginning}} of January 1694--5, and I <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man</b> Friday went on board in the Downs the 8th, having, besides that sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo {{of all kinds of}} necessary things for my colony, which if I did not find in good condition, I resolved to leave so.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I was out hunting <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man</b> and a woman, {{the wind}} arose and blew us hither. We claim your hospitality, and {{hope you will}} help us to get back again to Poloeland. If you do so we will reward you well, for white men are {{powerful}} and rich. See, here are gifts for Grabantak, and for his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Me? I {{should say}} not! It's like this: I don't mind dealing <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> {{if they think}} they've got any grievances--though Lord knows what's come over workmen, nowadays--don't {{appreciate}} a good job. But still, if they come to me honestly, as man to man, I'll talk things over with them. But I'm {{not going to have}} any outsider, any of these walking delegates, or whatever fancy names they call themselves now--bunch of rich grafters, living on the ignorant workmen! Not going to have any of those fellows butting in and telling ME how to run MY business!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I bear {{you later}} tidings," [...] Cuthbert said, [...] "than those you have received. I was {{on board the}} ship with King Richard. We were wrecked upon the Island of Corfu and there hiring a small ship, we {{proceeded}} to Zara. King Richard determined {{to make his way}} across the Tyrol to this place; but he thought that it would attract attention to him were he accompanied by so large a party. Therefore he, with Sir Baldwin of Béthune, and a few followers, started north, while I <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> kept west through the north of Italy, and then crossed by the pass over Trent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{fear for}} me, Daggett. I look for my reward {{in the bright}} eyes and {{pleasant}} smiles of as excellent a girl as Long Island can produce. Mary never fails to reward me in that way whenever I do right. It is right to stand by you just now--to do as I would be done by: and I 'll do it. Set the thing down as decided, but make your bargain <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men.</b> And now, Daggett, what say you to climbing yonder mountain to-day, by way of getting a good survey of our territories, {{as well as to}} take a look at the state of the ice?" ...|$|E

Take a fool's advice, and sit it out <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man.</b> I'll make a jest to excuse you to the King if he {{remember}} to ask for you. That's more than I would do for Archbishop Anselm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I myself, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own <b>men,</b> {{will keep}} watch. Should they muster for another attack, my horn will summon you {{again to the}} wall.|$|R
6000|$|After {{the first}} king-bird was obtained, I went <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> into the forest, {{and we were}} not only rewarded with another in equally perfect plumage, but I was enabled {{to see a little}} of the habits of both it and the larger species. It frequents the lower trees of the less dense forests: and is very active, flying {{strongly}} with a whirring sound, and continually hopping or flying from branch to branch. It eats hard stone-bearing fruits as large as a gooseberry, and often flutters its wings after the manner of the South American manakins, at which time it elevates and expands the beautiful fans with which its breast is adorned. The natives of Aru call it [...] "Goby-goby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, lad; {{directly}} I {{heard of}} the victory of Dunbar, I said to myself, this will bring the Scots upon us in force. Douglas will never {{put up with the}} defeat, and will make every effort to turn the tables. I shall send all there is worth taking away, to a shepherd's hut among the fells; and shall, as soon as I hear that Douglas's preparations are well-nigh complete, journey with your mother to Alnwick, and leave her there. I shall return, and <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men</b> will drive the cattle and horses to places where there is little chance of the Scots finding them; and will then, after leaving three or four men to look after them, come back to Alnwick.|$|E
6000|$|... "Allah {{help the}} Goer, but the Return is Rolling:" [...] this adage was ever upon the End of Time's tongue, yet my fate was {{apparently}} {{an exception to}} the general rule. On the 25th January, we were delayed by the weakness of the camels, which had been half starved in the Girhi mountains. And as we were about to enter the lands of the Habr Awal [5], then at blood feud <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>men,</b> all Habr Gerhajis, probably a week would elapse before we could provide ourselves with a fit and proper protector. Already I had been delayed ten days after the appointed time, my comrades at Berberah would be apprehensive of accidents, and although starting from Wilensi we had resolved to reach the coast within the fortnight, a month's march was in clear prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} so received. And now-- But {{perhaps it will}} be best that you should arrange all this <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>man</b> of business. Mr. Moreton shall be instructed. Mr. Moreton lives near my place in Barsetshire, but is now in London. If you will call on him he shall tell you what I would suggest. I hope {{you will find that}} your affairs will be comfortable. And now as to the time." ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. You are {{not content}} with an escort. You want respectable, {{trustworthy}} men. You should have brought a division of London policemen <b>with</b> you. <b>My</b> <b>men</b> are neither respectable nor trustworthy.|$|R
