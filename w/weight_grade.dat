The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the applicability of the WLGS by confirming its prognostic validity, evaluating its relationship to cachexia domains, and exploring its ability to predict cachexia progression. Methods An international, prospective observational study of patients with incurable cancer was conducted. For each patient, <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> was scored 0 – 4. <b>Weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 0 represents a high BMI with limited weight loss, progressing through to <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade</b> 4 representing low BMI and a high degree of weight loss. Survival analyses were used to confirm prognostic validity. Analyses of variance were used to evaluate the relationship between the WLGS and cachexia domains [anorexia, dietary intake, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and physical and emotional functioning]. Cox regression was used to evaluate if the addition of cachexia domains to the WLGS improved prognostic accuracy. Predictive ability of cachexia progression was assessed by estimating proportion of patients progressing to a more advanced <b>weight</b> loss <b>grade.</b> Results One thousand four hundred six patients were analysed (median age 66 years; 50 % female, 63 % KPS ≤ 70). The overall effect of the WLGS on survival was significant as expressed by change in − 2 log likelihood (P < 0. 001) and persisted after adjustment for age, sex, and cancer type and stage (P < 0. 001). Median survival decreased across the <b>weight</b> loss <b>grades</b> ranging from 407 days (95 % CI 312 – 502) —weight loss grade 0 to 119 days (95 % CI 93 – 145) —weight loss grade 4.

40|$|Different {{molecular}} <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of poly(DL-lactic acid) {{were applied}} as release controlling excipients in tablets for oral drug administration. The role of molecular weight and glass transition in {{the mechanism of}} water-induced volume expansion and drug release of PDLA tablets was investigated. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) {{was used to determine}} the glass transition temperature of both dry and hydrated PDLA samples. The absorption rate and total amounts of sorbed water by the polymer were determined by dynamic vapour sorption (DVS). Expansion behaviour of PDLA tablets was measured using thermal mechanical analysis (TMA). At 95 % relative humidity all molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of PDLA sorbed 1. 1 - 1. 3 % w/w water, as was determined with DVS. MDSC showed glass transition temperature reductions of 10 - 11 °C for all molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grades</b> of PDLA in water. Volume expansion studies using TMA showed that the molecular relaxation time and equilibrium porosity of the tablets increased with molecular weight. The mean relaxation time increased exponentially with the temperature interval Tg-T. The onset temperature of shape recovery of hydrated tablets was approximately 8 °C lower than for dry samples. Drug release was only slightly affected by molecular weight. It is concluded that volume expansion of compressed PDLA tablets is related to the glass transition behaviour, originates from water-induced and thermally stimulated shape memory behaviour and is therefore highly dependent on the molecular weight of PDLA. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

30|$|A feature-extraction neuron-fuzzy {{classification}} model (FENFCM) {{has been}} proposed by Nai Ren Guo et al. [56] that enabled the extraction of feature variables and has provided the classification results. This classification model has been integrated with a standard fuzzy inference system and a neural network with supervised learning. The FENFCM automatically generated the fuzzy rules from the numerical data and triangular functions that were used as membership functions both in the feature extraction unit and in the inference unit. To adapt the proposed FENFCM, two modificatory algorithms are applied: first, they utilized evolutionary programming to determine the distribution of fuzzy sets for each feature variable of the feature extraction unit; second, the weight-revised algorithm is used to regulate the <b>weight</b> <b>grade</b> of the principal output node of the inference unit; finally, the FENFCM was validated using two benchmark data sets, the Wine database and the Iris database.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the microstructure of semi-crystalline polymers and their intrinsic deformation and fracture behaviour. For this purpose, the deformation and failure of well-characterised PET, PE and PP samples have been investigated thoroughly. Compression tests on amorphous and cold crystallised PET showed that the strain hardening remained unchanged, despite the development of a crystalline phase by cold crystallisation. This suggests a direct relation between entanglements and strain hardening, similar to amor-phous polymers, and the slip of crystallites after yielding. True stress-strain curves of annealed PE confirm that strain hardening is not affected by the degree of crystallinity. However, melt crystallisation and a lower molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grade</b> for PE and PP resulted in a distinctly lower strain hardening modulus. This observation confirms that entanglements affect the strain hard-ening behaviour, since melt crystallisation and a reduction in molecular weight promotes a loss of entanglements during lamellar folding.

Their release data were analyzed according to various release kinetic models. Results: The release rate of diclofenac decreased with increase in polymer content and was dependent on the HPMC type used, with the lower release rate observed in formulations containing the higher molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grade</b> HPMC K 15 M. Formulations containing the higher molecular weight HPMC (F 4, F 5 and F 6) showed higher water uptake than those containing the lower molecular weight polymer (F 1, F 2 and F 3) (p < 0. 001).

This study analyzes the basis for individual lots of feeder cattle before and after cash settlement. Basis equations were estimated by breed, sex, <b>weight,</b> <b>grade,</b> and season. These equations were used to predict basis. The results indicate basis variability was not reduced and hedger ability to forecast basis, in general, was not improved significantly under cash settlement compared to physical delivery. Key words: feeder cattle basis, cash settlement, futures markets. Cash settlement for feeder cattle futures began with the September 1986 contract. The Chi-cago Mercantile Exchange (CME) instituted cash settlement basically for three reasons. First, physical deliveries under the old system averaged approximately 25 % of average month-end open positions during 1978 to 1985 (Paul). These deliveries caused the CME grad-er-scheduling problems at delivery points, dis-satisfied traders over grades assigned to deliv-ered cattle, and increased costs for traders and the CME. Second, because of multiple delivery points, long traders never knew where delivery would occur, hence both long speculation and long hedging were discouraged (Cohen and Gorham). Third, local market basis relation-ships were volatile, reducing hedging effec-tiveness and interest (Ernst). Hence, the CME introduced cash settlement {{as a means of}} elim-inating physical deliveries, encouraging long participation by speculators and hedgers, and increasing hedge participation by reducing ba-sis variation.

40|$|Hydrophilic {{matrices}} are {{a principal}} technology used for extended release (ER) oral dosage forms {{and a recent}} review concluded that their development is currently {{one of the most}} important challenges in pharmaceutical research. High molecular weight polyethylene oxides (PEOs) have been proposed as an alternative to hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) for the manufacture of controlled release matrix tablets. It is known that PEO's are prone to oxidative degradation which can occur by chain scission and can be catalyzed by metal ions. In this study, we investigated the stability of PEO matrix tablets, of different molecular weight, containing diltiazem hydrochloride, when stored at 40 °C. The results show that there were dramatic increases in the release rate of the diltiazem following storage over only a few weeks, resulting in immediate release profiles after eight weeks, even for the highest molecular <b>weight</b> <b>grade.</b> We employed Gel permeation chromatography (GPC), viscosity and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques to try and determine the underlying causes of these dramatic shifts in dissolution profiles on storage. The results showed that there were significant decreases in the molecular weight of the PEO's during storage. The second part of the study looked at the addition of three different levels of vitamin E succinate to the tablets. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of the added antioxidant to reverse the significant reductions in molecular weight seen using GPC, viscosity and DSC. Importantly the addition of the antioxidant was able to stabilize the release profile of the diltiazem especially when present at a 1 % level. Researchers and those working in pharmaceutical development should be aware of the potential stability risks when making matrix tablets containing PEO's and may wish to consider the addition of an antioxidant to the tablet formulation...|$|E

Referring to {{the weight of the}} eggs, the eggs of class A are divided into four grades: XL, L, M and S. Our research focused on the M <b>weight</b> <b>grade</b> eggs, because they are the most represented ones in our conditions. The following external indicators of egg quality were analyzed: shape index (%), egg weight (g), shell weight (g), shell strength (kg/cm 2) and thickness (mm). Furthermore, the following indicators of inner egg quality were tested: weight of albumen and yolk (g), yolk colour, Haugh units (HU), albumen height (mm), pH of albumen and pH of yolk. Results of our research provided the following conclusions: based on evaluation of energy and protein value, eggs of the manufacturer B had better nutritive value than eggs of the manufacturer A. The results of research into quality of eggs on the 7 th day of storage proved that there was statistically significant difference (P< 0. 001) between the A and B egg manufacturer if referring to the egg weight, shape index, shell thickness, shell weight and strength, as well as albumen weight.
