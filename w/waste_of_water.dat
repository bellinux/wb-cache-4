500|$|After the Central Valley Project Improvement Act in 1991 and the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan in 1995, {{much more}} water was {{required}} to meet target environmental flows in the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers and the Delta, which conflicts with the original language of the 1962 act authorizing the dam, which stated that only [...] "excess water" [...] could be appropriated for these uses. One of the new requirements was for spring and autumn [...] "pulse flows" [...] intended to help migration of anadromous fish (Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in particular). This policy has been criticized by local irrigation districts as a <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> during dry years, as fish populations have continued to struggle despite the additional flows. Reclamation officials argue that the flows are needed to meet state and federal requirements, {{as well as the}} earlier Endangered Species Act of 1972. As a result, the Melones Project is now only able to meet all its contracts in above average water years. Local water users have coined the somewhat derisive nickname of [...] "green dam" [...] because the policy has shifted to favor fish rather than farmers.|$|E
2500|$|Until recently, {{the use of}} siphon-type cisterns was {{mandatory}} in the UK to avoid the potential <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by millions of leaking toilets with flapper valves but due to EU harmonisation the regulations have changed. These valves can sometimes {{be more difficult to}} operate than a [...] "flapper"-based flush valve because the lever requires more torque than a flapper-flush-valve system. This additional torque required at the tank lever {{is due to the fact}} that a user must forcefully lift a certain amount of water up into the siphon passageway in order to initiate the siphon action in the tank.|$|E

2500|$|As with a flight, it is {{possible}} on a broad canal {{for more than one}} boat to be in a staircase at the same time, but managing this without <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> requires expertise. On English canals, a staircase of more than two chambers is usually staffed: the lockkeepers at Bingley (looking after both the [...] "5-rise" [...] and the [...] "3-rise") ensure that there are no untoward events and that boats are moved through as speedily and efficiently as possible. Such expertise permits miracles of boat balletics: boats travelling in opposite directions can pass each other halfway up the staircase by moving sideways around each other; or at peak times, one can have all the chambers full simultaneously with boats travelling in the same direction.|$|E
