2500|$|Another {{feature of}} ASHP {{external}} heat exchangers is {{their need to}} stop the fan {{from time to time}} for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the <b>work</b> <b>cycle</b> results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The acoustic effect of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, [...] "noise emergence" [...] is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.|$|E

30|$|Data were {{collected}} for 579 <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> comprising a {{total number of}} 2327 events. The homogeneity of the research sample was examined using variance analysis of the time taken to travel between successive worksites (travel between successive <b>work</b> <b>cycles</b> as described in Table 2). With regard to tasks performed by the harvester, the above-mentioned activity is characterised by the greatest variability within the group of all operational work times (Szewczyk and Kulak 2013). This particular activity was selected for the analysis due to its high level of variability. No statistically {{significant difference was found}} in the mean travel time within a worksite; therefore, subsequent analyses were performed using the entire research sample.|$|R

40|$|Energy and exergy {{analysis}} of a Brayton cycle with an ideal gas is given. The irreversibility of the adiabatic processes in turbine and compressor is taken into account through their isentropic efficiencies. The net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle,</b> the thermal efficiency and the two exergy efficiencies are expressed as functions of the four dimensionless variables: the isentropic efficiencies of turbine and compressor, the pressure ratio, and the temperature ratio. It is shown that the maximal values of the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle,</b> the thermal and the exergy efficiency are achieved when the isentropic efficiencies and temperature ratio are as high as possible, while the different values of pressure ratio that maximize the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle,</b> the thermal and the exergy efficiencies exist. These pressure ratios increase {{with the increase of}} the temperature ratio and the isentropic efficiency of compressor and turbine. The increase of the turbine isentropic efficiency has a greater impact on the increase of the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle</b> and the thermal efficiency of a Brayton cycle than the same increase of compressor isentropic efficiency. Finally, two goal functions are proposed for thermodynamic optimization of a Brayton cycle for given values of the temperature ratio and the compressor and turbine isentropic efficiencies. The first maximizes the sum of the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle</b> and thermal efficiency while the second the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle</b> and exergy efficiency. In both cases the optimal pressure ratio is closer to the pressure ratio that maximizes the net <b>work</b> per <b>cycle...</b>|$|R
