Other human diseases caused by related Treponema pallidum subspecies include yaws (subspecies pertenue), pinta (subspecies carateum), and bejel (subspecies endemicum). Diagnosis is usually made by using blood tests; the bacteria can also be detected using dark field microscopy. The Center for Disease Control recommends all pregnant <b>women</b> <b>be</b> tested.|$|E
5|$|The Spartan {{council of}} Elders, the gerousia, {{suggested}} that the Spartan <b>women</b> <b>be</b> sent to Crete for their protection. They were dissuaded from doing so by Arachidamia, the former queen and grandmother of the Eurypontid King Eudamidas II who convinced them that the women could assist in the city's defence. In order to guarantee the fighting men some rest, the women and the elderly began bolstering defences. Aware that Pyrrhus had elephants with him, the defenders dug a large trench and sunk wagons into the ground at its flanks in order to hinder the Epiriote advance. Moreover, messengers were sent both to summon Areus back and to request aid from Antigonus, despite the fact the Sparta and Macedon had traditionally been hostile. Pausanias, the Greek geographer, claims that Sparta received some aid from Messene and the pro-Spartan faction at Argos.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the growing}} number of women in the workforce, women's {{employment}} remained highly segregated based on perceptions of appropriate work for women. Up until the 1950s, domestic service was the largest category of female employment, with most other women engaged in government bureaucracy, social services, as well as other informal labor. Women's labor rights were not fully addressed until 1978, with the passage of a law declaring that <b>women</b> <b>be</b> paid equally for equal work, which was confirmed in the 1988 Constitution.|$|E

Unions that had represented large numbers of women workers before the war, such as the UE (electrical workers) and the Food and Tobacco Workers, had fairly good records of fighting discrimination against women.

25|$|Multiple Taiwanese Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to acts of oppression, {{such as when}} the Dutch ordered that aboriginal <b>women</b> <b>be</b> turned over to them for sex, and when they demanded that deer pelts and rice be given to them by aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village, sparking a rebellion in December 1652. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and two additional Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan. The aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} {{to many other}} cultures, a woman in Islam has always been entitled as per sharī'ah law to keep her family name and not take her husband's name. Therefore, a Muslim woman has traditionally always been known {{by the name of}} her family as an indication of her individuality and her own legal identity: there is no historically practiced process of changing the names of <b>women</b> <b>be</b> they married, divorced or widowed. With the spread of modern, western-style state bureaucracies across the Islamic world from the nineteenth century onwards, this latter convention has come under increasing pressure, and it is now commonplace for Muslim women to change their names upon marriage.|$|E

25|$|NET is weakly estrogenic (via {{conversion}} {{into its}} metabolite EE), {{and for this}} reason, {{it has been found}} at high dosages to be associated with high rates of estrogenic side effects such as breast enlargement in women and gynecomastia in men, but also with improvement of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. It has been suggested that very high dosages (e.g., 40mg/day, which are sometimes used in clinical practice for various indications) of NETA (and by extension NET) may result in an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) analogously to high dosages (above 50μg/day) of EE, and that even dosages of NETA of 10 to 20mg, which correspond to EE dosages of approximately 20 to 30μg/day, may in certain <b>women</b> <b>be</b> associated with increased risk.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that a third of}} all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant <b>women</b> <b>be</b> treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.|$|E
