50|$|The Great Fire of 1852 {{was a fire}} in Montreal {{that began}} on July 8, 1852, and left as many as 10,000 people {{homeless}} (at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> population was only 57,000) and destroyed almost half of <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> housing. <b>The</b> fire occurred at a time <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city's</b> recently constructed reservoir, located {{at the site of}} today's Saint-Louis Square, was drained and closed for repairs. The first fire broke out at a tavern on St. Lawrence Boulevard and spread quickly, fanned by strong winds and hot, dry summer weather.|$|R

5|$|Castelli {{moved to}} a farm in modern the Buenos Aires {{neighborhood}} of Núñez. The farm had some agriculture fields and a small brick factory. He lived next to other influential people like Cornelio Saavedra, Juan Larrea, Miguel de Azcuénaga, and attorney José Darragueira.

5|$|Espejo is {{considered}} the precursor of the independence movement in Quito. He died in 1795, but his ideas had a powerful influence on three of his close friends: Juan Pío Montúfar, Juan de Dios Morales and Juan de Salinas. They, along with Manuel Rodriguez Quiroga, founded the revolutionary movement of August 10, 1809, in Quito, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> declared independence from Spain.|$|E

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Preckwinkle pursued {{disclosure}} of Chicago Police Department officers who used excessive force. The United States District Court had {{ruled that the}} records be unsealed and {{made available to the}} public. However, on July 13, 2007, the city filed an emergency motion to stay the judge's order. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> argued in the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to against disclosure, it made the point that aldermen would have access to the information. Preckwinkle's August 23, 2007, request for disclosure was denied.|$|E
5|$|Sarria {{was honored}} in 2005 with the San Francisco LGBT Pride Celebration Committee's Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award. On May 25, 2006, Sarria's {{lifetime}} of activism was commemorated <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> of San Francisco renamed {{a section of}} 16th Street in the Castro to José Sarria Court.

5|$|The New Bedford Historic District is a National Historic Landmark District in New Bedford, Massachusetts, United States, {{west of the}} community's waterfront.

After its decline in the early and mid-20th century, through the efforts of local activist groups the {{district}} has since been preserved and restored to appear much as it was during that period.|$|E

5|$|The meatpacking {{district}} was served between 1908 and 1957 {{by a short}} Chicago 'L' line with several stops, devoted primarily to the daily transport of thousands of workers and even tourists to the site.

5|$|This {{fountain}} was relocated {{a number}} of times throughout its history: first in 1874 when the building near which it was built was demolished to build Palazzo Ferreria, in the 1960s <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>City</b> Gate was rebuilt, in 2000 when Saint James Cavalier was renovated and converted into a cultural centre, and again in the early 2010s during the City Gate Project. Due to these relocations and renovations, nothing remains of the original fountain.|$|E

5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Tulsa since 1989 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been given more power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T. Bynum who won the 2016 mayoral election and took office on December 5, 2016. Another Tulsa political figure, Jim Inhofe, who now represents Oklahoma in the United States Senate, served as the mayor of Tulsa early in his political career.|$|E
5|$|After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became {{essentially}} built out, {{growth in}} the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County.|$|E
5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E
25|$|The edge spans then build a metric {{on the set}} of vertices. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>cities</b> {{are viewed}} as points in the plane, many natural {{distance}} functions are metrics, and so many natural instances of TSP satisfy this constraint.|$|R
