25|$|Like other Slavs, the Great Moravian Slavs {{originally}} practised polytheistic religion {{with the}} cult of ancestors. Several cult places used prior the Christianization of Moravia are known from Moravia (Mikulčice and Pohansko). However, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> these objects, such as a ring ditch with a fire, a horse sacrifice, or human limbs ritually buried in a cemetery, meant for Great Moravians. An alleged cult object in Mikulčice was reportedly used until the evangelization of the Moravian elite in the mid-9th century and idols in Pohansko were raised {{on the site of}} a demolished church during the pagan backlash in the 10th century. The only one Slavic pagan shrine known from today's Slovakia is an object in Most in Bratislave dedicated probably to the god of war and thunder Perun. The shrine was abandoned in the mid-9th century and never restored.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} evidence indicates a construction {{date in the}} Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The scaenae frons (stage front) was certainly put up at this time, as the style of both sculpture and architectural ornament suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative on her part. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> stood here before the 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.|$|E

Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers seem to have been as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> these really were".|$|E

2500|$|Beethoven {{then turned}} to writing the string quartets for Golitsin. This series of quartets, known as the [...] "Late Quartets," [...] went far beyond what {{musician}}s or audiences were ready for at that time. One musician commented that [...] "we know there is something there, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it is." [...] Composer Louis Spohr called them [...] "indecipherable, uncorrected horrors." [...] Opinion has changed considerably {{from the time of}} their first bewildered reception: their forms and ideas inspired musicians and composers including Richard Wagner and Béla Bartók, and continue to do so. Of the late quartets, Beethoven's favourite was the Fourteenth Quartet, op. 131 in C minor, which he rated as his most perfect single work. The last musical wish of Schubert was to hear the Op. 131 quartet, which he did on 14 November 1828, five days before his death.|$|E
2500|$|A {{resurgence}} in violence by Pattani guerrilla groups began after 2001.

This new development disoriented and confused the Thai authorities, who kept groping in the dark as the identity of the new insurgents in the conflict remained a mystery. Thailand held relatively free elections in February 2005, but no secessionist candidates contested the results in the south.

2500|$|According to Chronicles, the Moabites {{formed a}} great and {{powerful}} confederacy with the surrounding nations, and marched against Jehoshaphat (...)

[...] The voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that the next day all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarreled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. Soon after this victory Jehoshaphat died after a reign of twenty-five years at the age of sixty (...)

2500|$|Pliny also {{remarks that}} [...] "he also {{discovered}} for what exact reason, although the shadow causing the eclipse must from sunrise onward be below the earth, it happened {{once in the}} past that the moon was eclipsed in the west while both luminaries were visible above the earth" [...] (translation H. Rackham (1938), Loeb Classical Library 330 p.207). Toomer (1980) argued that this must refer to the large total lunar eclipse of 26 November 139, when over a clean sea horizon as seen from Rhodes, the Moon was eclipsed in the northwest just after the Sun rose in the southeast. This would be the second eclipse of the 345-year interval that Hipparchus used to verify the traditional Babylonian periods: this puts a late date to the development of Hipparchus's lunar theory. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> [...] "exact reason" [...] Hipparchus found for seeing the Moon eclipsed while apparently it was not in exact opposition to the Sun. Parallax lowers the altitude of the luminaries; refraction raises them, and from a high point of view the horizon is lowered.|$|E
2500|$|The above account, however, is dated {{five years}} after Sulcoit in the Annals of Inisfallen, and {{is in fact the}} first entry {{following}} the lacuna beginning in mid 969, so <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> events have preceded it in the past two and a half years, assuming it is correctly placed. Ivar is first mentioned by name in the surviving annals in early-mid 969, which record that [...] "Beólán Litil and his son were killed by Ímar of Luimnech." [...] The identity of this person is not completely certain but he is assumed to be identical with the Uí Néill king of Lagore (Loch Gabor) or Southern Brega whose death, without cause given, is recorded in several other annals in the same year. [...] Clare Downham notes that this puts Ivar and the Limerick Norse active all the way out in the neighborhood of Dublin and says that Beolán was an ally of the King of Dublin, namely Olaf Cuaran. The Cogad also records this killing but provides no motive, simply mentioning it immediately after Ivar's return to Limerick, allegedly from Britain, with a second great fleet. After his alleged expulsion sometime following Sulcoit the author of the Cogad states Ivar and a certain [...] "Amlaíb, son of Amlaíb" [...] attempted the conquest of Britain, but without success, with Amlaib being killed by the king of Britain (unnamed). Having returned to Limerick and killed Beolán (or vice versa), Ivar is said to have then [...] "made many spoils and battles." [...] No other record of these survives, if this properly counts as one, and we must wait til 972 for the Annals of Inisfallen to pick up again.|$|E

40|$|How {{does the}} skeptic {{arrive at the}} {{conclusion}} that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything about the external world? According to the standard story, the skeptic starts with a particular radical skeptical hypothesis, such as that we are brains-in-vats, and argues that <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that it is false; she then uses the principle that knowledge is closed under known entailment to show that since <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that the skeptical hypothesis is false, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> that an arbitrarily chosen proposition about the world, such as that we have hands, is true.

2500|$|Michael F. Whiting, {{director}} of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center {{and an associate}} professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article [...] "DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective" [...] that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA [...] "have not given us anything that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they have somehow proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas." [...] Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, [...] "given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, because <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed {{at the conclusion of the}} Book of Mormon record." [...] Lastly, he concludes, [...] " [...] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost."
