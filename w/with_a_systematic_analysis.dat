40|$|Abstract. In {{scientific}} workflow systems, temporal consistency {{is critical}} to ensure the timely completion of workflow instances. To monitor and guarantee the correctness of temporal consistency, temporal constraints are often set and then verified. However, most current work adopts user specified temporal constraints without considering system performance, and hence may result in frequent temporal violations that deteriorate the overall workflow execution effectiveness. In this paper, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of such problem, we propose a probabilistic strategy which is capable of setting coarse-grained and finegrained temporal constraints based on the weighted joint distribution of activity durations. The strategy aims to effectively assign a set of temporal constraints which are well balanced between user requirements and system performance.

There are novel techniques using laser remelting for polishing surfaces using a constant laser beam power or for structuring surfaces using a modulated laser power. Basic properties, e. g. residual stresses, retained austenite, micro-stresses, microstructure, chemical composition and micro-hardness of the remelted near-surface layers are analyzed for different sets of procedural parameters such as laser power, laser beam diameter and number of repetitions. A carbon depleted area was found close to the remelted zone. The surface residual stresses tend from tensile to compressive and the content of retained austenite is lower when increasing both laser beam diameter and laser power. The formation of surface residual stresses is explained by a combination of shrinkage stresses and transformation stresses. The residual stresses tend from tensile to compressive with increasing number of repetitions, which can be explained by a preheating effect. A linear correlation between the measured surface hardness and the peak half width acquired by X-ray diffraction was found...|$|R

We have performed a dedicated experiment based on boron implanted into preamorphized Si with end-of-range defects placed far enough from the boron profile to avoid the interaction between end-of-range defects and resulting boron-interstitial clusters after recrystallization.

The inventory of buildings of interest is obtained from a survey carried out after the 1990 earthquake that struck Potenza and its hinterland, subsequently updated in 1999. About 12, 000 buildings were surveyed in Potenza, using the Italian first level survey form for damage and vulnerability evaluation. In the Italian methodology, a hybrid technique is set up to evaluate vulnerability, combining an analysis of building typologies with expert judgement.

Recently a large category of genomic structural variants, denoted as copy number variants (CNVs), were established to be a major contributor of the pathophysiology of autism. To date almost all studies have focussed only on the genes present in the CNV loci, but the impact of non-coding regulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) present in these regions remain largely unexplored. Hence we attempted to elucidate the biological and functional significance of miRNAs present in autism-associated CNV loci and their target genes by using a series of computational tools. We demonstrate that nearly 11 % of the CNV loci harbor miRNAs and a few of these miRNAs were previously reported to be associated <b>with</b> autism. <b>A</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the CNV-miRNAs based on their interactions with the target genes enabled the identification of top 10 miRNAs namely hsa-miR- 590 - 3 p, hsa-miR- 944, hsa-miR- 570, hsa-miR- 34 a, hsa-miR- 124, hsa-miR- 548 f, hsa-miR- 429, hsa-miR- 200 b, hsa-miR- 195 and hsa-miR- 497 as hub molecules.
