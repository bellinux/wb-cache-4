25|$|The stories {{converge}} {{again when}} dealing <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> after Stephens shot the chicken. All accounts have Wentworth merchant and postmaster Thomas A, Ratliffe, {{the owner of}} the chicken, complaining to the sheriff, and Stephens spent a night in jail. Upon release, he confronted Ratliffe, sporting a seven-shot revolver. During the altercation, the gun was discharged (whether intentionally or accidentally is again a matter where accounts vary), and two bystanders were wounded. Records do not indicate that Stephens ever spent further time in jail regarding this matter, but the dismissive nickname by which his enemies would refer to him {{the rest of his life}} was established.|$|E

During that time, he did have some problems with his brother Vince who was shown displeased <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at Cobra Pharmaceuticals and stated that their parents are in doubt about what happened. After Duke saves his parents and reunites with the other Joes, they arrive at the Hauser household where Connie wanted to treat them to a meal. Unfortunately, Vince had called Flint after he had warned Duke to stay away. Duke ends up defending his actions towards the other Joes and tells Flint upon the group's arrest to see that their families are protected.|$|E

Neither Reinboldt nor Burdge are [...] "Individual A" [...] named in the indictment, but Burdge believes that [...] "Individual A" [...] is familiar <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with her brother.

500|$|The actress went on {{to explain}} that the storyline showed how Toyah regretted her actions and that young female viewers could learn from her mistake. She added [...] "Anyone {{watching}} can see Dobber is just using Toyah and I hope the message gets across to other girls not to fall into the same trap." [...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed at no time did the viewers get the impression that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was drawn}} in the event's first heat on 19 September, {{finishing}} first {{out of three}} entered swimmers, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.72 seconds. The time established a new Equatoguinean swimming record in the discipline. Moussambani was the sole competing swimmer after the heat's two other competitors were disqualified for false starts. He used a large amount of energy in the first 50 metres, and as his legs stiffened, his pace reduced. Officials decided against retrieving him from the pool after he was observed to sink below the water shortly before finishing and he was cheered by the crowd throughout. Overall Moussambani finished 71st (and last) out of all athletes, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing one minute and 2.91 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later rounds. After completing the event, he said that it was [...] "a very special moment" [...] of which he would not forget and the crowd cheering motivated him to finish: [...] "Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics. I am really happy <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> it was all worth it. I want to come back next time for the 2004 games in Athens." [...] Moussambani earned admiration from {{millions of people around the}} world, received a large amount of publicity for his effort, and was given the nickname [...] "Eric the Eel" [...] by the press.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Toyah {{received}} a letter from Phil asking her to visit him in prison and in return he would plead guilty to raping her. Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her to come to terms <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened.</b> When Toyah {{came face to face with}} Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E

2500|$|According to Fagan, Clark was [...] "more {{concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> [...] {{rather than}} how or why." [...] The archaeologist John Mulvaney stated that, {{in contrast to}} the tendency of Childe and other archaeologists to focus on artefact typologies, Clark's [...] "vibrant world embraced landscape, economy and social themes, not simply labelled artefacts". This was reflected in the changing definitions of archaeology that Clark used; in 1927 he claimed that archaeology was [...] "the study of past distribution of culture-traits in time and space, and of the factors governing their distribution", while in 1939 he referred to it as [...] "the study of how men lived in the past".|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, the {{military}} regime of Burma set up a commission in charge of reviewing the place names of Burma in the English language. The aim of the commission was to correct the spelling of the place names of Burma in English, to discard spellings chosen by British colonial authorities in the 19th century, and adopt spellings closer to the actual Burmese pronunciation (compare <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in India with Calcutta/Kolkata and Calicut/Kozhikode). These renamings {{took the form of}} the [...] "Adaptation of Expressions Law", passed on 18 June 1989.

Although they cleared the air before he left, things weren't right between them, so to have him back with her now {{makes it all the}} more special. It's also Charlie that makes Kat realise that she needs to bond with Tommy. He makes her see that she can do this."
