500|$|I quaked {{a little}} as <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> quartet 'A Right-down Regular Royal Queen.' [...] But [...] numbers seemed to amuse the real Queen more than {{anything}} else in the opera, and, indeed, who could so well as she see the point of them? [...] The very fact of her choosing this opera from all the others to be played before her shows how vivid was her sense of fun, and how truly British was her willingness to laugh at herself. [...] There was... only one encore... nd who do you suppose was singled out for that honour? Who but I who write this, little Jessie Bond... for my song in the first act, 'When a Merry Maiden Marries.' ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{then moves}} on {{to talk about the}} {{symbolic}} nature of the images, noting: [...] "The concluding part of the 'secret' uses images which Lucia may have seen in devotional books and which draw their inspiration from long-standing intuitions of faith." [...] As for the meaning of the message: [...] "What remains was already evident when <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> reflections on the text of the 'secret': the exhortation to prayer as the path of 'salvation for souls' and, likewise, the summons to penance and conversion." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Eduard Prchal, {{described}} the events: [...] "I received {{the green light}} from the tower and <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> take-off run. I pulled the stick back and the aircraft started to climb. When I was at 150ft I pushed the controls of the aircraft forward to gain speed. Suddenly I discovered I {{was not able to}} pull the stick back. The steering mechanism was jammed or locked." [...] The aircraft then lost height rapidly. Prchal closed the four throttles and warned the others through the intercom [...] "Attention, crash". The aircraft crashed into the sea.|$|E

2500|$|Their {{statement}} {{concluded with}} [...] "We consider that calls to reconsider or even retract the report, {{as well as}} attempts at misrepresenting its nature and purpose, disregard the right of victims, Palestinian and Israeli, to truth and justice. They also ignore {{the responsibility of the}} relevant parties under international law to conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations. We regret the personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure placed on members of the fact-finding mission since <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> work in May 2009. This campaign has been clearly aimed at undermining the integrity of the report and its authors. Had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitise our conclusions, we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the Gaza conflict, the thousands injured, and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade.|$|E
60|$|W.A. Sir, <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> {{discourse}} in the following manner, which I shall exactly repeat according to my mean capacity, {{if you think it}} worth you while to honour it with your attention.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> work by {{stacking}} {{arms and}} setting {{to at the}} task of carrying the sheep to the shore, bundling them into the small boats, and then pulling out to the sloops.|$|E
30|$|Now, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> {{investigation}} by calculating the incomplete Caputo fractional derivatives of some elementary functions.|$|R
30|$|As <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> eighth year of publishing, I thought {{an update}} on the journal is timely.|$|R
3000|$|..., unless some {{statement}} is given. Now <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> discussion by giving some definitions and some known results.|$|R
60|$|Little Pansie's mother lived but a {{short time}} after {{the shock of the}} terrible catastrophe; and, as <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> story with saying, she was left with no better {{guardianship}} or support than might be found in the efforts of a long superannuated man.|$|E
60|$|Master Lord's {{home was}} not sumptuously furnished; {{but he was}} well {{outfitted}} with chests of drawers and cupboards such as housewives fancy, and among these <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> search, taking first that piece of furniture which was {{at the same time}} a desk for writing and a receptacle for books and papers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here was {{the very}} place to tie the ox; and {{accordingly}} a little before sunset the sick animal was led forth by Pharaoh and made fast there, little knowing, poor brute, for what purpose; and <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> long vigil, this time without a fire, for our object was to attract the lioness and not to scare her.|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> {{analysis}} with a concise review of some basic concepts and {{the models of}} a nonlinear dynamical system.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> {{investigation}} of the respective contributions of time change versus estimation methods by relying on simple visual inspections. We focus our meta-analysis on married women and single mothers.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> work in {{this section}} by {{introducing}} the proposed approach to characterise and measure naturalness. This is then followed by a definition of our case study and presentation of results.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> march, {{following}} the blood tracks {{up and down}} the steep sand-slopes. When we had been at it for about half-an-hour our spirits were cheered by catching sight of the lioness on a ridge five hundred yards away. Just then, too, some of the Zeus overtook us and joined the hunt, though without zeal.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> voyage {{yesterday}} a {{very little}} while {{after you left}} us, which was a great relief. The wind is S.E. this morning, and if it would keep so we should go along nobly. My dearest love to your aunt, and also to Katie and all the rest. I am in very good health, thank God, and as well as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In a word,' resumed the other, 'I do {{not find}} and cannot believe and {{therefore}} will not allow, {{that we are a}} model of wisdom, and an example to the world, and the perfection of human reason, and a great deal more to the same purpose, which you may hear any hour in the day; simply because <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> political life with two inestimable advantages.' ...|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> {{discussion}} with a detailed {{presentation of a}} method for extending volume preserving models to models with volumetric deformations. The extension naturally includes the original volume preserving model as a limiting case.|$|R
5000|$|Language is {{the most}} {{powerful}} and central tool in achieving our educational goal.

60|$|Accordingly, on {{the first}} Day of August, being Saturday, <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> March; and the English Voluntiers had the Favour of a Baggage Waggon {{appointed}} them. Count Souches, the Imperial General, with the Troops of that Nation, led the Van; the main Body was compos'd of Dutch, under the Prince of Orange. as Generalissimo; and the Spaniards, under Prince Vaudemont, with some Detachments, made the Rear Guard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear sir, that is {{just where}} you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always {{getting away from the}} present moment. Our mental existences, which are {{immaterial}} and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel down if <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{think it}} was about three weeks after these events that <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> southward trek. On the morning {{subsequent}} to our arrival at Marais's camp, Pereira {{came up to me}} when several people were present, and, taking my hand, thanked me in a loud voice for having saved his life. Thenceforward, he declared, I should be dearer to him than a brother, for was there not a blood bond between us? ...|$|E
30|$|Using the {{methodology}} and metrics described previously in Sects. 3 – 5, we present our empirical findings and analysis in this section. <b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> discussion with basic distribution analysis, followed by findings in {{each type of}} analysis within the talent flow analytics phase.|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> {{presenting}} <b>our</b> {{method by}} first defining constrained and unconstrained variables.|$|R
30|$|Now <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> work {{based on}} theory of {{fractional}} calculus; for {{details of the}} definitions and semigroup properties of Riemann-Liouville fractional calculus, one refers to [15 – 17]. In what follows, we give the definitions of the lower and upper solution of the system (1.1).|$|R
60|$|Here, by a {{moderate}} computation, we concluded ourselves 700 {{miles from the}} sea-coast where <b>we</b> <b>began.</b> <b>Our</b> black prince was this day set free from the sling his arm hung in, our surgeon having perfectly restored it, and he showed it to his own countrymen quite well, which made them greatly wonder. Also our two negroes began to recover, and their wounds to heal apace, for our surgeon was very skilful in managing their cure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} stay by you to-day, Jessie. All the men, except Moses, Oostesimow, Gaspard, and La Roche, are sent off to hunt and fish in the mountains, and I have kept these four to paddle about this neighbourhood, {{in order to take}} {{soundings}} and examine the coast more carefully; because, you see, it would be an unfortunate thing if <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> establishment in a place not well suited for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{next day}} we {{continued}} our examination in the house, having received in the interval fresh instructions from the Fiscal. <b>We</b> <b>began</b> <b>our</b> work in the bedroom communicating with the room in which Mrs. Macallan had died. It had been kept locked since the death. Finding nothing of any importance here, we went next to another room on the same floor, in which we were informed the prisoner was then lying ill in bed.|$|E

3000|$|<b>We</b> <b>begin</b> <b>our</b> {{analysis}} with the 1 -sparse.
