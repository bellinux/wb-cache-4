5|$|After the United States entered World WarI in 1917, 131 {{men from}} Children of Israel enlisted or were drafted; one was killed. By 1919, the congregation's family {{membership}} had reached 450, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $18,000 (today $). The congregational school, which still held classes once a <b>week,</b> <b>had</b> 14 teachers and 388 students. The following year, women {{were given the}} right to vote at all congregational meetings. Fineshriber left in 1924 to become head rabbi of Congregation Keneseth Israel in Philadelphia. During his tenure, Children of Israel's membership doubled, and the religious school grew from 100 to 550 students.

This was nearly double that of The College Dropouts first-week sales. It also debuted at number one on the charts in Canada. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart for the issue date of September 5. On the Billboard 200, Late Registration {{remained}} at number one for two consecutive weeks and, by its second <b>week,</b> <b>had</b> reached sales of 1.14 million copies.

5|$|NAD is also {{a direct}} target of the drug isoniazid, which {{is used in the}} {{treatment}} of tuberculosis, an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one <b>week</b> <b>had</b> improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed {{one another in the}} dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous <b>week</b> <b>had</b> not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E

5|$|Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, {{held the}} castle {{in support of}} Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army {{attacked}} from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London {{with the intention of}} attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter Sunday there was no fighting, though hostilities resumed on the Monday. Siege engines were set up and targeted the keep. As in 1215 the keep proved resistant to missiles, and after a <b>week</b> <b>had</b> not succumbed. According to one contemporary source, the besiegers were about to dig a mine beneath the tower, but the siege was abandoned on 26April when the earls received news of a relief force led by HenryIII and his son, Prince Edward.|$|E

25|$|Milwaukee, who {{had knocked}} off powerhouses Alabama and Boston College {{in the last}} <b>week,</b> <b>had</b> their Cinderella run come {{to an abrupt end}} against the tournament's top-seeded team.

Following this impressive run, Milwaukee coach Bruce Pearl accepted a job as the head basketball coach at the University of Tennessee.|$|E

25|$|When Abbas {{had ordered}} the hijackers to return the ship to Port Said, and the ship's captain had radioed Egyptian port {{officials}} – the problem fell onto Egypt's President Mubarak. The Egyptian government had competing interests he was attempting to balance. Mubarak wanted to maintain Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, the 1978 Camp David Accords, but also keep good relations with its fellow Arab states in the Middle East. The Israeli bombing of the PLO's Tunis headquarters the previous <b>week</b> <b>had</b> left many innocent Tunisians killed or wounded, adding to the pressures on Mubarak. He also wanted to maintain {{good relations with the}} USA to not jeopardize billions of dollars in foreign aid.|$|E
25|$|The second weekend saw the Tour in the Pyrenees, and {{the first}} attack on the field by {{eventual}} winner Alberto Contador, while the leadership {{was taken over by}} Rinaldo Nocentini. Thor Hushovd showed an ability to take points in stages that did not include flat sprint finishes that would be key to the contest for the points classification, and the main contenders for the mountains classification emerged. The journey towards the Alps the following <b>week</b> <b>had</b> a second pair of successive stage wins for Cavendish and a series of wins from riders in breakaways that held no threat to the general classification. An infringement in the sprint finish to stage 14 saw Cavendish relegated in finishing position, and Hushovd gaining the upper hand in the points classification.|$|E

25|$|As of December 12, 2012, hospitalizations (2,300 per week) {{and deaths}} (40 per <b>week)</b> <b>had</b> roughly tripled since Hurricane Sandy struck {{the island in}} what was {{expected}} to be a quiet cholera season. Cholera caused more deaths than all deaths related to the hurricane. In November 2010, the first cases of cholera were reported in the Dominican Republic and a single case in Florida, United States; in January 2011, a few cases were reported in Venezuela. The epidemic came back strongly in the 2012 rainy season, despite a localised delayed vaccine drive. In late June 2012, Cuba confirmed three deaths and 53 cases of cholera in Manzanillo, in 2013 with 51 cases in Havana. Vaccination of half the population is urged by the University of Florida to stem the epidemic.|$|E

Delta, despite winning, was also out of contention for the second round as he had 300 points after the match and the fourth place Flyer, who had yet to wrestle and receive points that <b>week</b> <b>had</b> 344, more points than the fan poll could give him. While Canelo Casas was only 23 points out of fourth place the fact that both the fifth and fourth place competitors, Disturbio and Flyer, had yet to wrestle and receive points Casas was all but eliminated from the tournament.|$|E
25|$|On 18 April, the County Championship began, but {{the first}} matches were {{dominated}} by rain; at Old Trafford, Lancashire and Hampshire played out 169.3 overs, compared to the minimum of 408 set out in ECB regulations, in a drawn game, while Gloucestershire overcame Somerset in Division Two despite 36 and 172 from Australian overseas player Cameron White. Excluding extras, the other ten players contributed with 197 runs, eleven less than White. The other five matches began a day later: Durham's first outing in Division One ended with victory, as Gordon Muchall hit 219 in the first innings and Kent were bowled out for 340 and 179 to leave Durham with a win by an innings and 56 runs, while Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, Sussex and Warwickshire all recorded draws. In Division Two, Surrey's first match after relegation saw them save the draw after following on against last year's wooden spoon winners Derbyshire, and Essex and Northamptonshire also drew. Two of the three university matches that <b>week</b> <b>had</b> two days rained out; the third, between Middlesex and Oxford UCCE was drawn.|$|E
