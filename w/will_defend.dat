5|$|Although {{generally}} a peaceful bird, which lives quite happily alongside humans, the willie wagtail <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> its nest aggressively. Willie wagtails {{are known to}} swoop at passers by, much like the Australian magpie. While attacks from willie wagtails are not as common or as formidable as the magpie, they do come as a great shock to recipients.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} a site for a nest, and both <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E

5|$|Amplexus {{lasts for}} 10 to 15 minutes. Once mated, the males <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> the females {{for a short}} period (around 15 minutes). After this period, the females begin to exhibit {{aggressive}} behavior and will drive off the males. They will then bend their fourth and fifth pereonites at a 90-degree angle. Once their genital openings (located on the fifth pereonite) are aligned {{with the opening of the}} brood pouches, they quickly deposit fertilized eggs into them. Females carrying fertilized eggs remain highly aggressive towards males throughout the brooding period, indicating maternal behavior intended to protect the developing embryo from male aggression.|$|E
5|$|Generally, yellow {{stingrays}} pay little heed to divers and can {{be approached}} closely. If stepped on or otherwise provoked, however, this ray <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> itself with its tail spine, coated in potent venom. The resulting wound is extremely painful, but seldom life-threatening. Small and docile, the yellow stingray adapts readily to captivity and has reproduced in the aquarium; it requires {{a large amount of}} space (at least 180gal or 684L) and a fine, deep substrate with minimal ornamentation.|$|E

Hal passionately vows to his unimpressed father that he <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> Henry and redeem his good name. The King's army, including Falstaff, parades through the streets and off to war. Before the battle, Henry meets with Worcester and offers to forgive all of Hotspur's men of treason if they surrender immediately. Hal vows to personally kill Hotspur. Worcester returns to his camp and lies to Hotspur, telling him that Henry intends to execute all traitors.|$|E
5|$|This kiwi {{is highly}} aggressive, and pairs <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep {{during the day}} in burrows. At night, they feed on {{invertebrates}} and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds {{in proportion to the}} size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.|$|E
5|$|Dominant bulls follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} bulls and predators. Only mature bulls have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. Bulls between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old bulls that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do bulls in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. Bulls that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E

5|$|Generally nocturnal, {{the round}} ribbontail ray can be solitary or gregarious, {{and is an}} active {{predator}} of small, benthic molluscs, crustaceans, and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos sustained by yolk, and later histotroph ("uterine milk") secreted by the mother; up to seven pups are born at a time. Although not aggressive, if provoked the round ribbontail ray <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> itself with its venomous tail spine, {{and it has been}} responsible for at least one fatality. It is valued by ecotourist divers and recreational anglers. This slow-reproducing species is threatened by commercial fishing, both targeted and as bycatch, and habitat degradation across much of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|In 1872, {{architect}} Elijah E. Myers of Springfield, Illinois, {{was commissioned}} {{to design the}} new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named Tuebor, which means I <b>will</b> <b>defend.</b> Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the United States Capitol in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings, the statehouses of Colorado and Texas, {{as well as the}} former territorial capitol building of Idaho, the most by any architect. The cornerstone was laid on October 2, 1873, with about 7,000 Lansing residents and some 30,000 to 50,000 visitors attending. Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878. The new capitol, with 139 rooms, was dedicated {{at the same time as}} the inauguration of Governor Charles Croswell January 1, 1879.|$|E
5|$|Many seabirds show {{remarkable}} site fidelity, {{returning to}} the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding {{for the first time}} usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as philopatry, is so strong that a study of Laysan albatrosses found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22m; another study, this time on Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E
5|$|Most non-human-related {{mortality}} involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive {{their first}} year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived {{to their first}} year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large gulls, corvids (including ravens, crows and magpies), wolverines (Gulo gulo), hawks, owls, eagles, bobcats (Lynx rufus), American black bears (Ursus americanus) and raccoons. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, {{and is the}} subject of biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to significantly affect the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs <b>will</b> <b>defend</b> one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. The trees are defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E
