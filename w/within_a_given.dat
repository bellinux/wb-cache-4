5|$|Demographers or sociologists of {{population}} study the size, composition and {{change over time}} of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study {{of population}} is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as Mobilities studies and {{is closely related to}} human geography. Demographers may also study spread of disease <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> population or epidemiology.|$|E
5|$|The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) was {{introduced}} in 1995 in the Human Development Report written by the United Nations Development Program in order to add a gender-sensitive dimension to the Human Development Index. The GDI takes into account not only the average or general level of well-being and wealth <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> country, but also how this wealth and well-being is distributed between different groups within society, especially between genders.

5|$|Nocturnally active, {{the prickly}} shark rests {{during the day}} in deeper {{offshore}} waters and performs a diel migration to shallower inshore waters at dusk. Individual sharks have a small home range and tend to remain <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> local area. This species consumes a variety of bony and cartilaginous fishes, and cephalopods. Since it moves slowly, it may use suction to capture prey. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing sizable litters. The prickly shark is not known to be dangerous to humans and has minimal economic value. It is caught incidentally by commercial deepwater fisheries, which are expanding and may potentially threaten its population. Thus, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 2014, the FCC voted 3–2 {{to approve}} the {{proposed}} ban on joint sales agreements and voted 5–0 {{to approve the}} proposed ban on coordinated retransmission consent negotiations {{between two of the}} four highest-rated stations <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> market; the JSA ban went into effect on June 19, 2014. Under the restrictions, the FCC would rule on waivers to maintain select existing JSAs within 90 days of the application's filing. The FCC also began a request for comment on policies to address other agreements, such as shared services agreements. The prohibition on television JSAs had been proposed as early as 2004, a year after the FCC voted to treat JSAs between radio stations as duopolies. Despite this fact, broadcasting companies criticized the ban, accusing the Commission of using it as a move to encourage participation in a spectrum incentive auction then set to occur in 2015, and stating that the ban would place them at a disadvantage during retransmission consent negotiations with pay television providers.|$|E
5|$|The {{moisture}} classification includes climatic {{classes with}} descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of −20 to −40), and arid (values below −40). Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation {{on an annual}} basis. A total of 33percent of the Earth's landmass is considered either arid or semi-arid, including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and {{a small part of}} southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia. Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter. This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore and mammal species numbers <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> area. The index is also used in studies of climate change.|$|E

40|$|While {{the basic}} {{elements}} of telomere biology are very similar across many taxa [1], there is diversity among species, and among tissues, in telomere dynamics. Not surprisingly, given that species differ in many other relevant aspects of their biology, including the pattern of activity of the telomere-restoring enzyme telomerase simple comparisons of average telomere length across species do not map directly onto interspecific variation in maximum lifespan [2 - 4]. In relatively long-lived species, telomerase is downregulated in most somatic cells, thought to have evolved as a mechanism to counteract an increased risk of tumour formation, particularly in endotherms [1]. One potential cost of this is that tissue renewal capacity is limited, resulting in somatic deterioration with age. However, <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>give...</b>|$|R
