5|$|In 1948 Britain's railways, {{and hence}} the canal, were nationalised, and became the {{responsibility}} of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British <b>Waterways.</b> Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all <b>waterways</b> within the jurisdiction of British <b>Waterways</b> were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder <b>waterways.</b> Remainder <b>waterways</b> were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{only the}} Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River {{were still being}} used for {{commercial}} traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The 1968 British <b>Waterways</b> Act had classified most <b>waterways</b> into commercial, cruising and remainder <b>waterways.</b> Remainder <b>waterways</b> were those for which {{the government of the}} time could see no economic future, and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell into this category, and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British <b>Waterways</b> policy document in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed to the British <b>Waterways</b> Board on 1 January 1963, {{and for the first}} time in over 100 years, it was managed by an {{organisation}} which was not under railway control. The Transport Act 1968 classified all <b>waterways</b> under the jurisdiction of British <b>Waterways</b> into commercial, cruising and remainder <b>waterways.</b> All of the remaining Shropshire Union network was designated as cruising waterway, with the potential for leisure use. By that time there was little commercial traffic. The branch to the River Dee at Chester had been unused since 1932–34, with the demise of steel traffic from Shotton steelworks to Ellesmere Port, and long distance carrying of tar from Ellesmere Port to the Midlands had ended in 1957–58.|$|E

5|$|They were {{initially}} {{managed by the}} British Transport Commission, but control passed to British <b>Waterways</b> {{with the passing of}} the Transport Act 1962, which also disbanded the Transport Commission. The Transport Acts of 1968 and 1983 divided British canals into Commercial <b>waterways,</b> which were still carrying commercial traffic, cruising <b>waterways,</b> which had potential for leisure use, and remainder <b>waterways,</b> for which no economic use could be seen at the time. The Stainforth and Keadby was designated as a commercial waterway, and traffic was restricted to working boats carrying freight. With the steady demise of freight traffic, British <b>Waterways</b> encouraged the use of the canals for leisure cruising, walking and fishing, and later recognised their environmental value. Following the cessation of coal carrying from Hatfield Main colliery, and the closure of Dunston's boatyard at Thorne, all use of the canal is now by leisure boaters. A further change of ownership took place in 2012 with the creation of the Canal & River Trust, which took over all of the assets of British <b>Waterways.</b>|$|E
5|$|British <b>Waterways</b> {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The ship would then transport them across the North Sea to continental <b>waterways,</b> without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British <b>Waterways</b> fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E

5|$|Following the Olympics, {{there was}} extermely {{limited access to}} the <b>waterways</b> through the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and {{reconstruction}} of Carpenters Road Lock was delayed. However, the £1.8 million project to rebuild it and fit new radial gates was almost completed by May 2017, when the new gates were craned into position. The Heritage Lottery Fund provided £680,000 towards {{the cost of the}} project, with other grants coming from the London Legacy Development Corporation and the Inland <b>Waterways</b> Association. As well as acting as a lock, the radial gates allow water to be distributed around the Bow Back Rivers for flood prevention purposes. The gates were due to be tested during the summer months, with a formal opening scheduled for the East London <b>Waterways</b> Festival in August. Public access to the <b>waterways</b> around the Olympic Stadium was also due to begin in June or July.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans {{was settled}} on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial <b>waterways</b> extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote waterborne commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these <b>waterways</b> causing the town's water table to lower drastically.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} right of navigation, or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian <b>Waterways</b> Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens <b>Waterways</b> Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian <b>Waterways</b> Association and the Inland <b>Waterways</b> Association.|$|E

5|$|The Superintendent of <b>Waterways</b> and Parks (Shuiheng duwei 水衡都尉) {{was also}} known as the Chief Commandant of <b>Waterways</b> and Parks, and was once a {{subordinate}} of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers. His salary-rank was equivalent to 2000–dan. The Superintendent of <b>Waterways</b> and Parks managed a large imperial hunting park located outside Chang'an, including its palaces, rest stops, granaries, and cultivated patches of fruit and vegetable gardens, which, along with game meat, provided food for the emperor's household. He also collected taxes from commoners using the park's grounds and transmitted these funds to the Minister Steward, who managed the emperor's finances. One of the Superintendent's subordinates supervised convicted criminals in their care of the park's hunting dogs.|$|E
5|$|A {{government}} {{white paper}} followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland <b>Waterways</b> Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that {{were no longer}} able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained charitable status in April and was incorporated under the Companies Act on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed British <b>Waterways,</b> which was created by the Transport Act of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland <b>waterways,</b> took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and riparian local authorities, restoration work began.|$|E
5|$|Bow Back Rivers or Stratford Back Rivers is {{a complex}} of <b>waterways</b> between Bow and Stratford in east London, England, which connect the River Lea to the River Thames. Starting in the twelfth century, works were carried out to drain Stratford Marshes {{and several of the}} <b>waterways</b> were {{constructed}} to power watermills. Bow Creek provided the final outfall to the Thames, and the other channels were called Abbey Creek, Channelsea River, City Mill River, Prescott Channel, Pudding Mill River, Saint Thomas Creek, Three Mills Back River, Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We aim at “heavy traffic direction” and “light traffic direction” in two-way <b>waterway</b> {{traffic and}} attempt to promote the transit {{capacity}} of two-way <b>waterway</b> system. Design/methodology/approach: We propose overtaking rules, head-on rules and a cellular automaton model for variable two-way <b>waterway</b> on AIS-based {{on the basis of}} NaSch (Nagel-Schreckenberg) model. Findings: By numerical simulation to the two situations which allow changing lane and prohibit changing lane, we obtain fundamental functions between traffic flux (speed) and density and find that changing lane can promote traffic flux and average speed of two-way <b>waterway</b> system under the premise of no impact to the traffic order, and when <b>waterway</b> ship traffic is dense, flux of <b>waterway</b> system has a visible promotion, and when traffic is sparse, average speed of <b>waterway</b> system adds significantly.

50|$|The Gulf Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> is {{the portion}} of the Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> located along the Gulf Coast of the United States. It is a navigable inland <b>waterway</b> running {{approximately}} 1050 mi from Carrabelle, Florida, to Brownsville, Texas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>waterway</b> {{consists}} of three non-contiguous segments: the Atlantic Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> (AIWW), extending from Portsmouth, Virginia (milepost 0.0) to Key West, Florida; {{a section of the}} Gulf Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> beginning at Tarpon Springs, Florida, and extending south to Fort Myers; and a second section of the Gulf Intracoastal <b>Waterway</b> extending from Brownsville, Texas, east to Carrabelle, Florida. These segments were intended to be connected via a dredged <b>waterway</b> from St. Marks to Tarpon Springs and the Cross Florida Barge Canal across northern Florida, but these projects were never completed due to environmental concerns. Additional canals and bays extend a navigable <b>waterway</b> to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
5|$|Changes in {{legislation}} aided the cause. From 1968, county councils {{could set}} up country parks, under the Countryside Act 1968, and the Transport Act 1968 enabled the British <b>Waterways</b> Board to allow local authorities to maintain or purchase inland <b>waterways.</b> By 1969, BWB had stated that {{they were prepared to}} hand over the canal to Devon County Council, together with some money for maintenance. With some representatives within the council wavering, the preservation committee organised a walk along the entire canal on 18 October 1969. Around 400 walkers set off, with the local member of Parliament firing a starting gun, and by the time Tiverton was reached, the party totalled about 1200 people.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{navigation}} {{was the subject}} of one of the last major attempts in the UK to attract commercial freight to the <b>waterways.</b> In 1983, it was upgraded to the 700-tonne Eurobarge standard by deepening the channels and enlarging the locks as far as Rotherham. Conisbrough lock was removed altogether, and the two Eastwood locks were combined into one. The new lock was initially named the Sir Frank Price Lock, after the chairman of the British <b>Waterways</b> Board who formally opened it on 1 June 1983. The expected rise in freight traffic did not occur, however. At Kilnhurst and Long Sandall, the new larger locks were built alongside the original locks, and so a comparison of the relative sizes can be made.|$|E
5|$|Having {{passed into}} the {{ownership}} of the Great Western Railway in 1888, the canal became {{the responsibility of the}} British Transport Commission when the railways were nationalised in 1948, and was formally closed in 1962.

5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the <b>Waterways</b> Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the <b>Waterways</b> Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland <b>Waterways</b> Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a Visitor Management Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British <b>Waterways,</b> who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E
