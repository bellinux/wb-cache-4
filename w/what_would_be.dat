5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected given {{the age of the}} species.

However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed, and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
