40|$|AbstractIn {{the era of}} fast {{transmission}} of knowledge and information, {{it is very important}} for organizations today to adopt or accept new technology, and find new ways of doing work in order to maintain or enhance their competitive position in the industry. The present study attempts to explore the engineers’ acceptance of <b>Webinars</b> as a training tool based on four beliefs about <b>Webinars</b> i. e. perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, computer self-efficacy and intention to use <b>Webinars</b> as a training tool. Data from 50 engineers in an electric company in the northern state of Malaysia with prior <b>Webinars</b> experience was obtained via survey method. The results showed that perceived ease of use (β = 0. 70, p< 0. 01) and computer self-efficacy (β = 0. 32, p< 0. 05) were positively related to the intention to use <b>Webinars</b> as a training tool whereas perceived usefulness was not significantly related to the intention to use <b>Webinars.</b> Furthermore, perceived ease of use (β = 0. 78, p< 0. 01) was found to be a significant predictor of perceived usefulness. This goes to show that ease of use and computer self-efficacy are the two main drivers of intention to use <b>Webinars</b> as a training tool. Implications of the findings for practitioners are discussed further...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} an attempt to {{contribute}} to the goals set by the Danish government and the national union of municipalities to improve the use of IT throughout the educational system in order to improve the pro- fessional and motivational level of education while remaining a flexible system which befits the individual student’s needs. Based on a case study of eBrock - a purely online vocational school within the educational in- stitution of Niels Brock - this project evaluates the use of educational live interaction in <b>webinars</b> as a way to achieve a reflexive and flexible learning process. By applying theories of e-learning, didactics and usability to em- pirical data acquired through interviews with staff and students as well as observational data from live <b>webinars,</b> the study identifies a certain orga- nizational ambiguity regarding the educational purpose of <b>webinars.</b> This ambiguity is found to be reflected in the students’ inconsistent percepti- on of <b>webinars</b> and their function, which is empowered by the fact that they’re recorded and used later as regular educational videos, ostensibly leading to a poor attendance. As a way to achieve the goals of <b>webinars</b> as an integrated part of the online learning process, while also remaining a flexible learning tool, we suggest several adjustments to the way <b>webinars</b> are approached by teachers and eBrock itself. These include changes to how the courses are being approached as a whole, as well as the specific use of the functionality of the <b>webinars...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study, compare and analyze students’ {{participation}} in synchronous <b>webinars,</b> directly F 2 F and their use of dialogue exchange and chat communications to develop an individual and collective meaning and understanding of the course content. Another aim is what possibilities flipped/inverted mini-lectures before follow-up <b>webinars</b> can provide as an expanded resource. One group of 15 students had synchronous <b>webinars</b> and one group of 22 students had flipped mini-lectures a week before follow-up <b>webinars.</b> The study joins the research tradition about sociocultural theories and computer supported collaborative learning, CSCL, as well the theoretical approach, termed Computer Self-Efficacy (CSE), concerned with individuals’ media and information literacy. Important conclusions from the results of collective synchronous <b>webinars,</b> flipped mini-lectures and chat communications are that they are important tools for students to be able to manage their learning activities and evaluate their participations, abilities and collaborative learning through communicative exchanges of knowledge. However, there are challenges for teachers to reach mutual engagement, common interests and joint creativity, but also use the role of technology in mediating interactions...|$|R
