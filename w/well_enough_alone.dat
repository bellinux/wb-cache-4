2500|$|Stanley came up {{with the}} name while he, Simmons and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss {{mentioned}} that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of [...] "What about Kiss?" [...] Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the [...] "SS" [...] look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over [...] "Wicked Lester" [...] on a poster outside the club where they were going to play. (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the [...] "S" [...] in Lester.) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a Sharpie and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it [...] "by eye." [...] The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, [...] "It got us this far, let’s leave <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b> Our number one rule has always been no rules.” ...|$|E
60|$|Allie resolutely {{refused to}} tell him and once more entreated Neale to let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> to keep her hidden from the mob, and not to seek Durade.|$|E

50|$|Josie, in her mid-70s, was {{referred}} to a homeshare programme by a hospital after a stroke severely affected her behaviour. The hospital was keen to discharge her if home support could be arranged. She was found a perfect match in Trevor, a young working man who needed accommodation and who handled Josie’s erratic ways with great diplomacy. Soon Josie adored him like a grandson and, keen to cook for him, regained all her independence skills. Trevor stayed with her for three years by which time Josie was <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to live <b>alone</b> again.|$|R
50|$|Born Oscar-Arthur Honegger (the {{first name}} was never used) to Swiss parents in Le Havre, France, he {{initially}} studied harmony and violin in Le Havre. After studying {{for two years}} at the Zurich Conservatory he enrolled in the Paris Conservatoire from 1911 to 1918, studying with both Charles-Marie Widor and Vincent d'Indy. He made his Paris compositional debut in 1916 and in 1918 wrote the ballet Le dit des jeux du monde, {{generally considered to be}} his first characteristic work. In 1926 he married Andrée Vaurabourg, a pianist and fellow student at the Paris Conservatoire, on the condition that they live in separate apartments. They lived apart for the duration of their marriage, with the exceptions of one year from 1935 to 1936 following Vaurabourg's injury in a car accident, and the last year of Honegger's life, when he was not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to live <b>alone.</b> They had one daughter, Pascale, born in 1932. Honegger also had a son, Jean-Claude (1926-2003), with the singer Claire Croiza.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Your {{mistress}} is not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to see visitors? Give {{her that}} card,' said the doctor, 'and say I expect her, {{the next time}} I call, to be <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to see me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|That few folks {{can turn}} ill luck into good luck. That {{the best thing}} for one to do is to let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b> That one cannot get {{happiness}} as one does cabbages--with [...] money. That happiness is the only good luck, after all! ...|$|E

6000|$|So, Carley, try to {{understand}} me, or at least be kind. You know they came very near writing, [...] "Gone west!" [...] after my name, and considering that, this [...] "Out West" [...] signifies for me a very fortunate difference. A tremendous difference! For the present I'll let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas, father!" [...] {{replied the}} crestfallen lover, [...] "there is that written on her brow which says {{she loves me}} <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to be my Valentine, {{especially}} since you wish it, but not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to be my wife." ...|$|R

60|$|ACQUAINTANCE, n. A person whom we know <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> {{to borrow}} from, but not <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to lend to. A degree of {{friendship}} called slight when its object is poor or obscure, and intimate {{when he is}} rich or famous.|$|R
6000|$|He began quite formally, {{and with}} a well-laid-out line of questions, {{but she was not}} the kind of witness to permit that. She broke out of his {{boundaries}} on the third query, and laughingly refused to discuss her losses. [...] "I am holding no one but myself responsible," [...] she said. [...] "I was greedy--I couldn't let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|In this {{instance}} {{it was the}} anthropoid that retired in stiff dignity to inspect an unhappy caterpillar, which he presently devoured. For a moment Tarzan seemed inclined to pursue the argument. He swaggered truculently, stuck out his chest, roared and advanced closer to the bull. It was with difficulty that Werper finally persuaded him to leave <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone</b> and continue his way from the ancient city of the Sun Worshipers.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Maynard {{was glad}} to end the {{discussion}} and to get away. In Margaret's appeal she heard a yielding, a final obedience to her wish. And {{she thought she had}} better let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b> The look in Margaret's clear blue eyes made her shrink; it would haunt her. But she felt no remorse. Any mother would have done the same. There was always the danger of that old love affair; there was new danger in these strange wild fancies of modern girls; there was never any telling what Margaret might do. But once married she would be safe and her position assured.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the Gwinnett Extended Care Center (GECC) opened.

60|$|I {{have ever}} been prone to seek {{adventure}} and to investigate and experiment where wiser men would have left <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b> It therefore now {{occurred to me that}} the surest way of learning the exact attitude of this beast toward me would be to attempt to leave the room. I felt fairly secure in my belief that I could escape him should he pursue me once I was outside the building, for I had begun to take great pride in my ability as a jumper. Furthermore, I could see from the shortness of his legs that the brute himself was no jumper and probably no runner.|$|E
60|$|But {{a pirate}} is very seldom {{a person of}} discretion, who knows when to leave <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> and so, instead of contenting {{themselves}} with robbing and capturing the vessels belonging to people whom their Charles Town friends and customers would look upon as foreigners, they boldly sailed {{up and down the}} coast, seeking for floating booty wherever they might find it, and when a pirate vessel commanded by an English captain and manned principally by an English crew, fell in with a big merchantman flying the English flag, they bore down upon that vessel, just {{as if it had been}} French, or Spanish, or Dutch, and if the crew were impertinent enough to offer any resistance, they were cut down and thrown overboard.|$|E
60|$|Patient! That {{had to be}} the burthen of {{the song}} on both sides. Carey was pushing back her hair with a fierce, wild sense of impatience with that calm {{assumption}} that fretted her beyond all bearing, and made her feel desolate beyond all else. She would have, she thought, done <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone</b> with her children, and scrambled into her new home; but the directions, however needful, seemed to be continually insulting her understanding. When she was advised as to the best butcher and baker, there was a ring in her ears as if Ellen meant that these were safe men for a senseless creature like her, and she could not encounter them with her orders without wondering whether they had been told to treat her well.|$|E
60|$|We {{have been}} looking and waiting for your being <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to propose {{yourself}} for a mouthful of fresh air. Are you <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> to come on Sunday?

6000|$|... "While I am in your service, Sir Percival," [...] I said, [...] "I hope I know my duty <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> not {{to inquire}} into your motives.

60|$|Our journey {{home was}} very much like our trip up the river, {{but there were a}} few exceptions. There was not so much firing, for I think the {{ammunition}} got pretty low; we saw more alligators, and the yellow-legged party, which had joined us at Pilatka, {{went all the way to}} St. Augustine with us. There was still another difference, and that was in Rectus. He was a good deal livelier,--more in the spirit that had hatched out in him in the cemetery at Savannah. He seemed to be all right with Corny now, and we had a good time together. I was going to say to him, once, that he had changed his mind about girls, but I thought I wouldn't. It would be better to let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> and he was a ticklish customer.|$|E
60|$|The {{truth of}} that was very soon in evidence. Cubby would not let <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> {{and he would not}} have a slack rope. I think he wanted to choke himself or pull my arms out. When I {{realized}} that Cubby was three times as strong as I was I began to see that my work was cut out for me. The more, however, that he jerked me and hauled me along, the more I determined to hang on. I thought I had a genuine love for him up to the time he had almost knocked my head off, but it was funny how easily he roused my anger after that. What would have happened had he taken a notion to go through the brush? Luckily he kept to the trail, which certainly was rough enough. So, with watching the cub and keeping my feet free of roots and rocks, I had no chance to look ahead. Still I had no concern about this, for the old hunter was at my heels, and I knew he would keep a sharp lookout.|$|E
