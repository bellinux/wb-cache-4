500|$|Dr. David Lowry, {{a nuclear}} {{historian}} from the United Kingdom, {{has called the}} project's proposals [...] "obscene", adding [...] "had they gone ahead, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have had the romantic image of Neil Armstrong taking [...] "one giant leap for mankind"." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] was pivotal to the {{creation}} of FutureSex/LoveSounds. After finishing the production of the song, Timbaland teased Timberlake. Timberlake responded: [...] "Let's do something <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> do. Let's go far left and just see what happens." [...] His answer motivated the collective, and they ended up producing ten songs for the album.|$|E
500|$|... "The {{combination}} {{of words and}} music hit a peak," [...] explained Gilmour. [...] "All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms." ...|$|E
5000|$|We in TRADOC...decided {{to put the}} TOW on the MICV {{because we}} {{realized}} that {{if we did not}} put the TOW on the MICV, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> probably <b>never</b> have a MICV. General Don Starry, Army magazine, 1987.|$|R

500|$|Ryan {{said that}} he was [...] "proud" [...] of the {{agreement}} because [...] "it reduces the deficit – without raising taxes". Some conservative Republicans objected to his budget proposal. Republican Raul Labrador criticized the [...] "terrible plan," [...] saying that [...] "it makes promises to the American people that are false. Today the Democrats realized they were right all along, that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> hold the line on the sequester." [...] Other conservatives were more positive: [...] "It achieves most of the things {{we would like to see}} when we have divided government," [...] said Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.).|$|E
500|$|While in the studio, Timbaland {{played on}} the stereo plenty of songs by American singer and {{musician}} Prince for them to listen to. Early in their sessions, they reportedly were [...] "fooling around" [...] and [...] "freestyling". One night, Danja was playing a guitar riff and {{caught the attention of}} Timberlake, who then started humming to the melody and later sung the lyrics. Timbaland, who was at their side, added drums onto the progressing sound. After an hour, with no lyrics written on paper, Timberlake recorded in the vocal booth a song that would become [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". Timberlake, having been teased by Timbaland, said to the latter: [...] "Let's do something <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> do. Let's go far left and just see what happens." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the tour}} for One Hot Minute, all {{songs from the}} album except “One Hot Minute”, “Tearjerker” and “Falling Into Grace” were played. Those three songs have never been played live by the band. As of 2016, “Pea” and “Aeroplane” are the only songs from One Hot Minute that the Red Hot Chili Peppers have played in full since Dave Navarro left the band. The band however did tease [...] "My Friends", “Let's Make Evil” and [...] "Walkabout" [...] during the I'm With You World Tour. Chad Smith was asked by fans during a February 2014 online {{interview}} about the band's reasons behind not performing the songs and he responded by saying [...] "We don't really feel that connected to that record anymore. No special reason, not to say <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> play those songs but we don't feel that emotionally connected to that music right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>we</b> {{thought you}} <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get here!" [...] cried Mrs. Wadsworth, in relief. [...] "We thought sure you had {{had some sort}} of {{accident}} on the road." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a July 2013 {{interview}} with Between the Earphones, Hopewell {{explained that the}} new songs the Crookes were writing sounded [...] "far more confident than we've ever been... we're trying things that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> even considered before and I’m really pleased with the results." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Anyway, {{all that}} doesn’t matter now. Saddam is gone, thanks to you. Was it worth it? Be assured it was. We {{all know that}} it got {{to a point where}} <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> been rid of Saddam without foreign intervention; I just wish {{it would have been a}} bit better planned." ...|$|R
500|$|Morrowind, {{following}} the tradition established by its predecessors in The Elder Scrolls series, is a free-form world, with few constricting boundaries on the player's actions. From {{the beginning of}} the game, players are put in a world where they are left to roam, steal, quest and explore, without necessarily {{following the}} main quest. Lead designer Ken Rolston, asked prior to Morrowinds release what he thought were the [...] "core, untouchable design elements" [...] of the Elder Scrolls series which [...] "set them apart from other games," [...] responded immediately: [...] "Free-form experience." [...] In Rolston's view, the game's central plot is a chance to introduce the player to a cross-current of conflicting factions, background themes, and to the characters of the game, rather than the primary focus of the player's experience. [...] "Every [...] game has to let you create the kind of character you want, and then do the things you want. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have a [...] force you to be a certain character or go down a certain path." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reply to}} a {{question}} in 1996 about his religious beliefs, Carl Sagan answered, [...] "I'm agnostic." [...] Sagan maintained {{that the idea of}} a creator God of the Universe was difficult to prove or disprove and that the only conceivable scientific discovery that could challenge it would be an infinitely old universe. Sagan's views on religion have been interpreted as a form of pantheism comparable to Einstein's belief in Spinoza's God. His son, Dorion Sagan said, [...] "My father believed in the God of Spinoza and Einstein, God not behind nature but as nature, equivalent to it." [...] His last wife, Ann Druyan, stated: When my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me—it still sometimes happens—and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

When I left he held my hand in both his and shook it warmly. His heart was too full of emotion to speak a word. He realized that the chances were <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> see each other again. He died several years ago.” ...|$|E

2500|$|After an AP {{reporter}} confronted Sci-Fi Channel president Bonnie Hammer {{at a press}} conference, Hammer {{admitted the}} hoax, saying {{it was part of}} a guerrilla marketing campaign to generate pre-release publicity for The Village. This prompted Sci-Fi's parent company, NBC Universal, to state that the undertaking was [...] "not consistent with our policy at NBC. <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> intend to offend the public or the press and we value our relationship with both." ...|$|E
2500|$|The press {{reported}} on 18 April 2010 that Ryan {{was approached by}} the producers of [...] "EastEnders" [...] to return for a month around the Christmas period that year, coinciding {{with the return of}} Zoe's on-screen mother Kat Slater and her husband Alfie Moon. A BBC spokeswoman denied this, saying, [...] "Speculation is rife about returning characters but this is not true. However, as with all characters, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> say never."

60|$|She was an orphan. We {{never saw}} her with any one, {{and there was no}} telling how long she had lived alone in the world. She must have learned early in her {{helpless}} childhood that safety lay only in flight. She was very wise and very discreet. It became a sort of game with Lop-Ear and me to try to find where she lived. It was certain that she had a tree-shelter somewhere, and not very far away; but trail her as <b>we</b> <b>would,</b> <b>we</b> could <b>never</b> find it. She was willing enough to join with us at play in the day-time, but the secret of her abiding-place she guarded jealously.|$|R
50|$|Indian {{security}} officials expressed shock at the apparent breach of security. An anonymous Indian official told The Economic Times, {{part of the}} Times of India media group,We are glad that {{it happened in the}} US. If such a security breach had happened out here in Hyderabad House, or even Vigyan Bhavan, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> heard the end of it and heads would have rolled. How such a breach in the most important official residence in the world happened is something all of us are very keen to know.|$|R
2500|$|Kurzweil says {{life in the}} {{universe}} is [...] "both rare and plentiful" [...] meaning for vast stretches there is nothing then piled into a small space it is everywhere. He suggests any form of life that invents technology will, if it survives, relatively quickly reach the point of merging with that technology, the same thing he predicts will happen to humans. Therefore, Kurzweil explains if we ever met another civilization, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> really be meeting with its technology. The technology would likely be microscopic in size because that is all that would be necessary for exploration. The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore <b>we</b> <b>would</b> likely <b>never</b> notice it.|$|R
2500|$|Gerbic {{spends much}} of her Wikipedia-related time helping new editors learn to perform basic tasks in Wikipedia. New editors to the GSoW users group are {{encouraged}} to identify notable references and add them to various related pages. Gerbic calls such edits [...] "backwards editing", which is the reverse of the more typical process where one subject is enhanced from multiple references. In an interview with Richard Saunders, she states {{that this kind of}} project is [...] "a perfect storm, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> {{have been able to do}} this without [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Muawiyah {{was very}} skilled at {{dealing with the}} Romans. Abdullah ibn Zubayr, who could see {{troubles}} ahead {{after the death of}} Muawiyah and was opposed to the appointment of Yazid, later said of Muawiyah: [...] "Truly the son of Hind deployed a dexterity and mental resourcefulness as one will never see after him. When we tried to impose something on him, an irritated lion with claws unsheathed would not show more audacity than him. He knew when to give into us, to even allow himself to be tricked when we tried to do that to him. He was the most artful of men, more crafty than a thief. I wished that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> lose him, just as a rock remaining on this summit" [...] pointing to the mountain of Abu Qubays outside Mekka.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his first}} {{summer in the}} Sierra as a shepherd, Muir wrote field notes that {{emphasized}} {{the role that the}} senses play in human perceptions of the environment. According to Williams, he speculated that the world was an unchanging entity that was interpreted by the brain through the senses, and, writes Muir, [...] "If the creator were to bestow a new set of senses upon us [...] [...] [...] <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> doubt that we were in another world[...] [...] [...] " [...] While doing his studies of nature, he would try to remember everything he observed as if his senses were recording the impressions, until he could write them in his journal. As a result of his intense desire to remember facts, he filled his field journals with notes on precipitation, temperature, and even cloud formations.|$|E
5000|$|Ebert added Coppola's film to {{his list}} of The Great Movies, stating: [...] "Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam film, one of the {{greatest}} of all films, because it pushes beyond the others, into the dark places of the soul.

25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen to us on Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|R
