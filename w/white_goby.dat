40|$|<b>White</b> <b>goby</b> (Glossogobius giuris Hamilton 1822) is an omnivorous, native {{fish species}} {{which can be}} found in Laguna de Bay and its tributaries, and in other bodies of water in the Philippines. Deteriorating water quality, {{unsustainable}} fishing practices, aquaculture and predation by introduced invasive species are threatening the population of <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> and other native fish species in Laguna de Bay. This study was conducted to correlate select physico-chemical parameters of lake water and zooplankton abundance, and to assess <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> population based on fishers’ perception. Water samples were collected in three sites in June, September and December 2014. Twenty one zooplankton species belonging to 12 families were identified. The most abundant and frequently encountered zooplankton species is Eurytemora affinis Poppe 1880. Zooplanktons were most abundant in June and lowest in September. Key informant interviews with local fishers revealed that <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> population was abundant in April to August while catch report showed that fish catch is abundant in June and least during December. The fish abundance in April to June could be attributed to high productivity especially in summer season. The fishers perceived that the population of <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> was declining mainly due to water pollution, aquaculture, and predation by invasive alien species. A multi-stakeholder sustainable watershed management should be adapted to improve the water quality and extinction of native fish species in Laguna de Bay...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{crustaceans}} {{are among}} the most harmful parasites of fishes. Certain species cause disease outbreaks and mortalities in aquaculture, facilities, and sometimes in natural systems, resulting in serious economic losses. Edible fishes from some Philippine lakes also show infestation by parasitic crustaceans. The branchiuran, Argulus indicus Weber, and the copepod, Lernaea cyprinacea Linnaeus, were recovered from the skin and base of the dorsal fin, respectively, of the mudfish Channa striata from Laguna de Bay. L. cyprinacea was also found on the <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> Glossogobius giurus in Naujan Lake. In La Mesa Reservoir, the gills of wild populations of tilapias Oreochromis niloticus and Tilapia zillii, <b>white</b> <b>goby,</b> and silvery theraponid Therapon plumbeus were infected with the copepod, Ergasilus philippinensis Velasquez. An isopod, Alitropus typus Edwards, was recovered from the buccal and gill cavities of several fishes from Lake Taal, namely; the mud gudgeon Ophiocara aporos, cardinal fish Apogon thermalis, silvery theraponid, and cage cultured Oreochromis niloticus. Previous reports and above finding indicate wide host specificity of the parasites. Of these four parasites, only Ergasilus philippinensis has not been reported to cause mass mortality in cultured fishes. Measures should be undertaken to prevent their introduction to other water bodies in which they do not yet occur...|$|E

40|$|An {{annotated}} list of 188 {{species of}} fishes recorded from San Miguel Bay, Philippines is presented. Of these, 48 % are euryhaline marine species. The most abundant fishes belong to marine species whose representatives {{are known to}} seek brackish waters, especially when young. Such fish fauna characterizes San Miguel Bay as an estuary. A brief discussion follows of the distribution with regard to salinity of the Philippine fish fauna as a whole. The fish species of San Miguel Bay can be arranged into the following trophic groups: piscivores (23 %), zooplankton feeders (18 %), meiobenthos feeders (22 %) and macrobenthos feeders (37 %). The same ichthyofauna can. also be split into the following groups: coastal pelagics (22 %), oceanic pelagics (3 %), soft-bottom demersals (55 %) and reef/hard-bottom demersals (20 %). The role of the Bay as a nursery ground for fishes is discussed [...] Annotated List of Fishes Recorded in San MiguelBay, 1868 - 1981 The first record of a fish from the San Miguel Bay area in the scientific literature {{is that of the}} [...] <b>white</b> <b>goby</b> Glossogobius giurius from the Libmanan River (Fig. 1) by Peters (1868). However, as is the case for Philippine fish taxonomy in general, most fish records from San Miguel Bay stem from the work of Albert W. Herre and his Philippine associates (notably Agustin F. Umali). Their work can be easilyaccessed(through Herre 1953) and most of it hasalso been reprinted in four handy volumes. * * From this lit~rature stems 86 (46 %) of. the first records of San Miguel Bay fishes...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{regression}} design that encompassed {{the continuum of}} oyster reef biomass density in Harris Creek, MD, from unrestored reefs to those restored reefs with the greatest oyster biomass, we examined finfish and crustacean utilization of these habitats. Of the eight sites studied, three had not been subject to any restoration activities and five had been planted in 2012 with juvenile oysters set on oyster shell. All sites were sampled in April, June, August, and October 2015. During each sampling period, we assessed abundance, total length and biomass of finfish and examined gut contents to assess the diets of selected finfish species. Of the species collected that were likely to use reefs as habitat or a foraging ground, only striped bass and white perch were sufficiently abundant to support robust statistical analyses. Regression analyses found no clear relationship between oyster biomass density and catch per unit effort, total length or biomass for striped bass or white perch. Analyses {{of the effects of}} sampling period and restoration status (restored versus non-restored sites) on fish utilization frequently found an effect of sampling period but rarely found an effect of restoration status. In all cases where differences were detected, they suggested greater utilization of non-restored sites. Overall, data were sparse and the power of statistical analyses was low. Analyses of striped bass and white perch diets suggest that they are using oyster reefs as a foraging ground. Although comparisons of the proportion of striped bass and white perch that contained prey in their stomachs found no difference between those caught on restored sites versus non-restored sites, gut contents of both species contained prey taxa that are likely more abundant on restored oyster reefs than nonrestored sites. As a percentage of total prey wet weight, polychaete worms were the most important component of striped bass diets in both April (50 %) and August (47 %). Of the polychaete worms identifiable to species, 100 % were Alitta succinea, a species found in much greater abundance and biomass on restored oyster reefs than on comparable non-restored sites (Kellogg et al. 2013, Rodney and Paynter 2006). White perch diets were dominated by the ascidian Molgula manhattensis (52 %), a species generally found in greater abundance on hard substrates including oyster reefs. Of the identifiable species of fish found in the stomachs of striped bass, 93 % by weight were naked gobies (Gobiosoma bosc) or striped blennies (Chasmodes bosquianus), two species found in greater abundance and biomass on restored oyster reefs than nonrestored sites in Chesapeake Bay (Kellogg et al. 2013, Rodney and Paynter 2006). For <b>white</b> perch, naked <b>gobies</b> accounted for 95 % of the identifiable fish species by weight. Direct comparisons of white perch and striped bass diets to the prey fields at each sampling site will be conducted as part of a companion project also funded by NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office (Award #: NA 13 NMF 4570209 : Integrated assessment of oyster reef ecosystem services: Macrofaunal utilization, secondary production and nutrient sequestration). This companion project will also provide data on abundance, biomass and distribution of small, reef-associated species including naked gobies, striped blennies, and oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau).
