5000|$|Thermal transmittance, {{also known}} as U-value, is the rate of {{transfer}} of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure, divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. It is expressed in <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> square <b>metre</b> <b>kelvin,</b> or W/m²K.

Although it has the same units as heat transfer coefficient, thermal transmittance is different in that the heat transfer coefficient is used to solely describe heat transfer in fluids while thermal transmittance is used to simplify an equation that has several different forms of thermal resistances.|$|R

In the cooling Earth’s core, the thermal conductivity of iron alloys defines the adiabatic heat flux and therefore the thermal and compositional energy available to support the production of Earth’s magnetic field via dynamo action 1, 2, 3. Attempts to describe thermal transport in Earth’s core have been problematic, with predictions of high thermal conductivity 4, 5, 6, 7 at odds with traditional geophysical models and direct evidence for a primordial magnetic field in the rock record 8, 9, 10. Measurements of core heat transport are needed to resolve this difference. Here we present direct measurements of the thermal conductivity of solid iron at pressure and temperature conditions relevant to the cores of Mercury-sized to Earth-sized planets, using a dynamically laser-heated diamond-anvil cell 11, 12. Our measurements place the thermal conductivity of Earth’s core near {{the low end of}} previous estimates, at 18 – 44 <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>metre</b> <b>per</b> <b>kelvin.</b> The result is in agreement with palaeomagnetic measurements 10 indicating that Earth’s geodynamo has persisted since the beginning of Earth’s history, and allows for a solid inner core as old as the dynamo...|$|R

Over the past three decades, China has experienced rapid economic development(1), accompanied by increased emission of greenhouse gases, ozone precursors and aerosols(2, 3), but the magnitude of the associated radiative forcing has remained unclear. Here we use a global coupled biogeochemistry-climate model(4, 5) and a chemistry and transport model(6) to quantify China's present-day contribution to global radiative forcing due to well-mixed greenhouse gases, short-lived atmospheric climate forcers and land-use-induced regional surface albedo changes. We find that China contributes 10 % +/- 4 % of the current global radiative forcing. China's relative contribution to the positive (warming) component of global radiative forcing, mainly induced by well-mixed greenhouse gases and black carbon aerosols, is 12 % +/- 2 %. Its relative contribution to the negative (cooling) component is 15 % +/- 6 %, dominated by the effect of sulfate and nitrate aerosols.
