500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although we still had our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E

"We used a {{technique}} of laying our program out in general debate," [...] he said. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> amendment phase, we would offer our {{program as a}} substitute for the Johnson proposal. If we lost in the Committee of the Whole, then we would usually offer it as a motion to recommit and get a vote on that. And if we lost on the motion to recommit, our Republican members had a choice: They could vote against the Johnson program and say we did our best {{to come up with a}} better alternative. Or they could vote for it and make the same argument. Usually we lost; but when you're only 140 out of 435, you don't expect to win many.|$|E
60|$|But Old Jeff Hooker he throwed {{cold water}} on the whole {{business}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> his blacksmith shop and told him what we come for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do mean it, but I don't {{expect you}} to do it; and I don't ask it. I {{suggested}} it <b>to</b> Cynthy, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talking it over, and she saw it wouldn't do." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Owlwood I left Dick in the parlour {{and flew}} up to Aunt Tommy's room. I found her all scrunched {{up on her}} bed in the dark with {{her face in the}} pillows.|$|R
2500|$|The group chose Calliope Studios {{as their}} primary studio, as it was renown to promote artistic freedom. Jungle Brothers, Queen Latifah and Prince Paul with De La Soul and Stetsasonic, were all {{recording}} new music in separate rooms while A Tribe Called Quest recorded People’s Instinctive Travels. Q-Tip later commented [...] "It was exciting. We were kinda left to our own devices. It was just a great environment, conductive for creating. We didn’t have cell phones, we didn’t have the internet, we didn’t {{have a bunch of}} things to tear at us. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> studio, the specific job was to make music. There was no TV in there. It was all instruments and speakers. It was just music".|$|E
60|$|But we were. The sun {{was well}} up <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exhibition-ground.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey {{were seated}} together, {{finishing}} {{a quart of}} ale with a toast in it, before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} {{fastened}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> it, but Dicky Weed banged away {{at it as}} 'ard as he could bang, and at last the bedroom winder went up and Mrs. Pretty stuck her 'ead out.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you and Cartner had pooled your interests. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> work, your man, Davies, came along and tried to hold us up. It was not his fault he didn't; the fellow's a crook." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Abbotstoke {{the brother}} was dead. That parish nurse had not {{attended}} to my directions, and, I do believe, {{was the cause}} of it. The mother had had a seizure, and was in the most precarious state." ...|$|R
6000|$|So they {{softened}} {{down and}} said it was all right; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village they yawled us ashore. About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate who do {{you suppose}} comes down the walk to greet us? Old Smoke-'em-out Smithers, {{who used to be}} the best open air painless dentist and {{electric}} liver pad faker in the Southwest.|$|E
6000|$|I remembered Mary's promised [...] "surprise," [...] {{the secret}} of which was only to be {{revealed}} to me <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cottage. How could I disappoint her? My poor little lady-love looked ready to cry at the bare prospect of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she replied; [...] "I can't do that. For one thing, {{it would}} be too late <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Victoria, I think we could get an {{engagement}} if we reached Vancouver in time to get to Kamloops by--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> level ground, {{with about}} two miles to go before we would stop for luncheon, Jone took a piece of thin rope out of his pocket--he always carries some sort of cord in case of accidents--and he tied it to the back part of my machine.|$|R
6000|$|... "At Langa-Langa. Ran {{up there}} {{as it was}} coming on, and laid there the whole week and traded for grub with the niggers. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Tulagi, there {{she was waiting for}} us and {{scrapping}} with Burnett. I tell you, Mr. Sheldon, she's a wonder, that girl, a perfect wonder." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp, {{the canoe}} {{was taken out}} and turned over, and a log laid across it to prevent its being blown away. The Indian cut some large logs of damp and rotten wood to {{smoulder}} and keep fire through the night. The trout was fried for supper.|$|E
60|$|I marched {{along in}} front of 'im with my 'ead in the air, and {{when he spoke to}} me I didn't answer him. He went aboard the ship <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wharf, and a minute or two arterwards 'e came to the side and said the skipper wanted to see me.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{luck would}} have it he never tumbled to a thing and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pond there was old Mr. Turtle lying out in the sun as if his very last day had come. He acted so sick that even though I knew he'd never had a tooth in his head I almost began to believe he really did have the toothache.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{describe}} my pore gals hagny juring our ride. She {{sat in the}} carridge as {{silent as}} a milestone, and as madd as a march Air. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Gloster she sprang hout of it as wild as a Tigris, and rusht to the station, up to the fatle Bench.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, {{how could}} I, when you wouldn't let me? In {{regard to the}} waistcoat, I wouldn't have a man's waistcoat, much less a gentleman's waistcoat, on my mind, for no consideration; but the silk handkerchief's another thing; and if you was {{satisfied}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Hounslow, I shouldn't object to that as a gift.' ...|$|R
60|$|CHRISTY (sulkily, {{coming back}} to the fire and warming himself again, {{attending}} much more to the fire than to his mother). Well, it's not my fault. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Nevinstown <b>we</b> found him ill in bed. He didn't know us at first. The minister sat up with him and sent me away. He died in the night.|$|R
60|$|Having {{passed the}} wall, {{we took our}} way to the house, taking care to keep {{in the shadows of the}} trees on the lawn when the {{moonlight}} shone out. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> porch the Professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{run over}} for the skipper {{in a state of}} mind that don't bear {{thinking}} of, and he came back with me, 'arf crazy. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cabin we found the door was locked, and, arter the skipper 'ad told Artful wot he'd do to 'im if he didn't open it, he 'ad to go on deck and talk to 'im through the skylight.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dock {{we made a}} discovery. There was a kink in my leader {{about one}} inch above the hook. Nothing but the sword of old Xiphius gladius could have made that kink! Then I remembered a strange, quick, hard jerk that had taken my bait, and which I thought had been done by a shark. It was a {{swordfish}} striking the bait off! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} help being rather short with him, but he {{appeared}} not to mind it. We went the nearest way, without conversing much upon the road; {{and he was so}} humble in respect of those scarecrow gloves, that he was still putting them on, and seemed to have made no advance in that labour, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> my place.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I {{was telling the}} boys last night. There were {{two or three of}} them from Traverse staying at the hotel, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> talking about the hail they allowed that he'd have to cut the creamery plan out. I said that when Elcot Hunter took a thing up he stayed with it until he put it through." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} at night <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Domo d'Ossola, {{at the foot of}} the Pass of the Simplon. But as the moon was shining brightly, and there was not a cloud in the starlit sky, it was no time for going to bed, or going {{anywhere}} but on. So, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a little carriage, after some delay, and began the ascent.|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country, {{but the man}} seemed {{to know where to}} go. He pulled at my rope, and we began to walk along a road with no people in it at all. We walked on and on, but it was all so new to me that I forgot how tired I was. I could feel my mind {{broadening}} with every step I took.|$|E
60|$|Sunday was {{the hardest}} day of all to Fulk, for {{this was the only}} one on which he could not be busy enough to tire himself out. We were a mile from church, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{worm-eaten}} farm pew there was a smell, as Jaquey said, as if generations of farmers had been eating cheese there, and generations of mice eating after them; and she always longed to shut up a cat there.|$|E
60|$|What {{had taken}} place I may as well tell here. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground, Ulick, Mick, and the Captain were already there: Quin, flaming in red regimentals, as big a monster as ever led a {{grenadier}} company. The party were laughing together at some joke of one or the other: and I must say I thought this laughter very unbecoming in my cousins, who were met, perhaps, to see {{the death of one}} of their kindred.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> our quarters, {{which we}} did without accident, Curtis asked me jocularly what I was {{thinking}} about.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> back <b>to</b> the hotel, {{along came}} Rectus and Corny. They {{had been out}} walking together, and looked hot.|$|R
