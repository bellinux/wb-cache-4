5|$|Judy Garland's {{four-year}} {{contract for}} the series called for 26 weekly shows, for which Garland's corporation, Kingsrow Enterprises, would be paid $140,000 per episode. Of that Garland was guaranteed between $25,000 and $30,000 per show. Kingsrow Enterprises would also retain ownership of the tapes, allowing Garland to sell the series into syndication. Although Garland had said as early as 1955 that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> a weekly television series, in the early 1960s {{she was in a}} financially precarious situation. Garland was several hundred thousand dollars in debt to the IRS, having failed to pay taxes in 1951 and 1952, and the commercial disappointment of the film A Star is Born meant that her share of any profits from that film would be eaten up immediately. A successful run on television would secure Garland's financial future.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

25|$|After {{celebrating the}} birth of his son, the first child with Morgan Beck, Miller {{announced}} in October, that he would skip another season with the intention {{to spend more time with}} his family and to focus on his new-found passion of horse training. Even though some people started to suspect that this might mean the end of his skiing career, Miller denied it in December stating that although he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> the full circuit again, there's a likelihood that he'd return to racing occasionally. He terminated his contract with HEAD early under the restriction to not compete with other skis than HEAD in the World Cup circuit or World Alpine Ski Championships. He was then able to sign a deal with US-based ski manufacturer Bomber Ski, which also made Miller the brand's part owner.|$|E
25|$|Things {{were getting}} serious; it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> for Rupert to be {{defeated}} by the inhabitants of Birmingham. Yet there was little chance of carrying the works by a direct attack. Some of Rupert's men saw {{that it might be}} possible, by going across the fields, to ride round and get into the rear of the works, and from there charge the defenders. This was tried and proved successful.The defenders of the works could not stand being attacked front and rear, so abandoned the works and fled into the town. Rupert's troopers followed them. From the houses a desultory fire was kept up on the Royalist troopers as they advanced up the street. On this the troopers set fire to the houses from which they had been fired on, and the town was soon ablaze in several places. Pushing on the resistance became less; those who had fought fled and scattered.|$|E

Hearing this, Mahmud and Supono leave their hiding places and shout [...] "Live, Srikandi of Indonesia!" [...] The four are excited, and Sri and Supono prepare for a quick wedding. Aminah and Sri's parents, however, are frightened upon hearing that the men will join PETA.|$|E

500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz tells Jack that her writing staff have been replacing her name-plate title with various names including [...] "F. Krueger." [...] She explains that the name refers to a time in which she got a chemical peel, wore a red and green sweater with a fedora. This is a reference to the fictional horror villain from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series Freddy Krueger's appearance.

500|$|While in the studio, Timbaland {{played on}} the stereo plenty of songs by American singer and {{musician}} Prince for them to listen to. Early in their sessions, they reportedly were [...] "fooling around" [...] and [...] "freestyling". One night, Danja was playing a guitar riff and {{caught the attention of}} Timberlake, who then started humming to the melody and later sung the lyrics. Timbaland, who was at their side, added drums onto the progressing sound. After an hour, with no lyrics written on paper, Timberlake recorded in the vocal booth a song that would become [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". Timberlake, having been teased by Timbaland, said to the latter: [...] "Let's do something we <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do.</b> Let's go far left and just see what happens." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kier McFarlane, and its plot was inspired by 1968 film Barbarella.

The video was shot in two days, where Minogue had been strapped with harnesses and wires; the majority of the shooting included wires pulling off her clothes during those particular sequences. The singer commented in her 2002 book [...] {{that it was one of}} her [...] "most painful shoots", and complained that she felt [...] "rigged" [...] into all sorts of [...] "contraptions". Minogue further complained about the 19 hours spent on both filming days, and revealed she cried during some of the shooting; she jokingly concluded in the book that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> another visual that required harnesses and water. Minogue's characteristics in the video were loosely inspired by the titular character of Barbarella, for which a large staff that helped with styling, hair styling and make-up was required.|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} {{disclosed that}} it was [...] "a modern day rags to riches story" [...] where the protagonist rises from humble origins to an enviable position. The venture was to be funded by A. Purnachandra Rao of Lakshmi Productions. The film would mark the director's third collaboration with Ajith Kumar in the lead after the success of Kaadhal Mannan (1998) and Amarkalam (1999). Laila Mehdin and Richa Pallod, who played the heroine in Saran's Parthen Rasithen (2000) and Alli Arjuna respectively, were to play the female lead roles. While the recording for the film's audio reportedly began on 16 March 2001, the filming was to start in mid-June and continue until August that year, followed by post-production work in September. It was planned to release the film on 14 November 2001 coinciding with Diwali. However, after finding a more engaging script in Red (2002), Ajith lost interest; he left the project after a week's shoot and the production was shelved. Following this incident, Saran stated that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> another film with Ajith. The pair would, however, reconcile their differences later, and collaborate on Attahasam (2004) and Aasal (2010).|$|E
