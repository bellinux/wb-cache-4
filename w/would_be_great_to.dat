5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E
500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were {{converted}} to 3-D for a two-week limited theatrical re-release, which was extended due to its success. Lasseter said, [...] "The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way, thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. [...] With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way".|$|E

50|$|No {{mixture of}} colors, however, {{can produce a}} {{response}} truly identical {{to that of a}} spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530 nm) and blue light (460 nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> <b>to</b> the green and blue light in the mixture than it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to a pure cyan light at 485 nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.|$|R
500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger {{as a starting point for}} that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E
500|$|The game {{levels were}} {{developed}} {{on a level}} editor on the PlayStation Portable, but Zoë Mode {{were not able to}} refine the editor in time for shipping. [...] Mottram said [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future" [...] and that downloadable content [...] "would work perfectly with the Crush level structure and I am sure that fans of the game would be eager to see more levels." [...] Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as SingStar and Play taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife {{about a month ago}} and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

500|$|She harasses {{people with}} {{physical}} handicaps. [...] When visiting a hospital, Ling accidentally collides {{with a man}} in a wheelchair, and shouts, [...] "Watch where you are going! [...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Sigourney Weaver has {{expressed}} interest in reuniting with Ridley Scott to revive her character for another Alien film. In the 2003 commentary track for the Alien DVD included in the Alien Quadrilogy set, she and Scott both speculated on the possibility, with Weaver stating: [...] "There is an appetite for a fifth one, which is something I never expected...it's really hard {{to come up with}} a fifth story that's new and fresh...but I have wanted to go back into space...I think outer space adventure is a good thing for us right now, 'cause Earth is so grim...so we've been talking about it, but very generally." [...] Scott remarked that, if the series were to continue, the most logical course would be to explore the origins of the space jockey and the Aliens. Weaver supported this idea, saying [...] "I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> go back, because I'm asked that question so many times: 'Where did the Alien come from?' People really want to know in a very visceral way." [...] David Giler said that he, Walter Hill, and Gordon Carroll, the producers of the first four films in the series, would not be willing to produce another unless it was about the Aliens' homeworld and Weaver was on board (despite the fact that they were among the producers of Alien vs. Predator films). Weaver, in turn, indicated that she would only return to the franchise if either Scott or James Cameron were to direct. Cameron had been working on a story for a fifth Alien film which would explore the origins of the creatures, but ceased work on it when he learned that Fox was pursuing Alien vs. Predator, which he felt would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise".|$|E

500|$|Will & Grace producer, Tim Kaiser, in an {{interview}} with The New York Times, said that the doll's appearance was not any kind of [...] "forced" [...] product placement, as some speculated, explaining, [...] "It was just a natural fit, because Jack's affection for Cher is a thread that is running through the show already." [...] Kaiser continued saying that NBC [...] "saw the strength" [...] of the episode's storyline and understood that [...] "if a Cher doll is in the show that much, it's {{an integral part of the}} episode." [...] Kaiser said that [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] writer Katie Palmer [...] "originally didn't know" [...] Mattel planned to market a Cher doll and learned about it after working on the script. Curt King, a spokesman for NBC, further commented that the doll's role in the episode was due to the producers thinking of [...] "a lot of humor [...] would come out of it." [...] Mark Malinowski, senior vice president and director at Ketchum Entertainment Marketing, revealed that Mattel was launching the Cher doll and in a [...] "brainstorming meeting" [...] they mentioned Will & Grace as the Jack character in love with Cher. [...] "We thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> try to include the doll in a plot line of an episode because it would be organic, playing off something that already exists. I don't think any viewer will see this and think 'product placement.' [...] It's strategic for the product and relevant for the audience, particularly the gay men who watch the show because the characters of Jack and Will are gay." [...] It was also noted that Mattel did not pay a fee to the show's producers or NBC to have the Cher doll appear in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|When {{we chose}} the name, we were thinking, well, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> reclaim the word [...] "bitch" [...] for strong, outspoken women, {{much the same way}} that [...] "queer" [...] has been {{reclaimed}} by the gay community. That was very much on our minds, the positive power of language reclamation.|$|E
2500|$|About a sequel, Shahrukh Khan said: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> revisit Don after sometime. I’ve told Farhan that {{we could}} take 60 days out of our {{schedule}} and make a Don 3. But we need a script first, one that could take the last 10 minutes of Don 2 forward to another differently exciting thriller." [...] Farhan Akhtar also {{expressed a desire to}} take the story forward, and said he was fascinated by the character of Don. However, the filmmaker wanted to explore other genres without restriction and added that he was currently focusing on his acting career.|$|E

2500|$|Koivu was {{regularly}} {{partnered with}} Teemu Selänne and Jere Lehtinen {{in a line}} if all three were available. The trio has been a key factor to Finland's success at many bigger events. The line plays mainly to the excellent chemistry Koivu and Selänne seem to have and this has also affected the NHL; after 1999 World Championships, Selänne {{said in an interview}} on a Finnish TV program, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> play with Saku," [...] which led to speculation about Koivu being traded to Anaheim. This finally became true a decade later when Koivu signed with Anaheim in July 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Irwin {{said in an}} {{interview}} in 2000 that the greatest disappointment of his career was not at the British Open, but at the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. Irwin had led the tournament after the first three rounds, but shot a final round of 79 to finish 6th. Reflecting on his final round collapse, Irwin said: [...] "A number of factors were in play and it was very emotional. I thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> win 10 years later at the same venue and, more than anything else, my father was dying of cancer then and I thought it would be wonderful to give him a victory. I destroyed myself with the pressures I'd built up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon after The Office premiered, Fischer {{was focused}} on the show's success; in an April 2005 {{interview}} with her alma mater's student newspaper, she said: [...] "Honestly it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> get to play Pam for a long, long time .... I don't have real big aspirations to be a movie star. I would love to be on a long-running hit TV show. You end up playing a defining role." [...] As The Office grew into a success, Fischer's film acting career became more established. In 2006, she co-starred in her then-husband's film, Slither, and in 2007, she filmed supporting roles in The Brothers Solomon, with Will Arnett and Will Forte, Blades of Glory, with Will Ferrell, John Heder, Amy Poehler and Will Arnett, and , alongside John C. Reilly, with whom she co-starred again in 2008's The Promotion, also starring Seann William Scott.|$|E

2500|$|The {{score to}} Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 {{was led by}} James Hannigan, his third Harry Potter video game soundtrack. During an {{interview}} with Squareenixmusic.com's Greg O'Connor Read {{he was asked if}} he would return for the last game to which he had stated [...] "I'd love to return to the series", and when asked how he would end it he said [...] " [...] it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> end the series with a bang!". It was recorded, like its predecessor, with The Philharmonia Orchestra at AIR Studios in London, while the soundtrack was first unveiled on 28 October 2010 at St Mary's Church, Nottingham where Hannigan performed several tracks with the Pinewood Singers. The main theme for the soundtrack was made available for download on the games official website on 8 November 2010. Hannigan described the music from the game as dark, [...] " [...] largely following similar changes in the underlying story – but is not without its lighter moments".|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Tom Oreb was tasked as {{character}} stylist {{that would not}} only inhabit {{the style of the}} backgrounds, but also fit with the contemporary UPA style. Likewise with Earle's background styling, the animators complained that the character designs were too rigid to animate. For Maleficent, Marc Davis drew from Czechoslovakian religious paintings and used [...] "the red and black drapery in the back that looked like flames that I thought <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> use. I took the idea of the collar partly from a bat, and the horns looked like a devil." [...] However, in an act of artistic compromise, Earle, with final approval on the character designs, requested the change to lavender as red would come off too strong, which Davis agreed to. In addition, Davis served as directing animator over the title character with the character's figure and features based on those of Audrey Hepburn as well as her voice actress, Mary Costa.|$|E
2500|$|By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had {{appeared}} in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film role offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly {{to play the role}} of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. [...] One evening he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised to hear from him — a man she barely knew. Both Ball and Arnaz agreed that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> <b>to</b> have Frawley, a motion picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who warned of Frawley's frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz immediately told Frawley about the network's concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. Contrary to the network's concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and in fact mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of the misanthropic Frawley's few close friends.|$|E
