40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to report the effects of <b>window</b> <b>views</b> and indoor plants on human psychophysiological {{response}} in workplace environments. The effects of <b>window</b> <b>views</b> and indoor plants were recorded by measuring participant's electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), blood volume pulse (BVP), and state-anxiety. Photo Impact 5. 0 was used to simulate the environment in an office, where six conditions were examined: 1) <b>window</b> with a <b>view</b> of a city, 2) <b>window</b> with a <b>view</b> of a city and indoor plants, 3) <b>window</b> with a <b>view</b> of nature, 4) <b>window</b> with a <b>view</b> of nature and indoor plants, 5) office without a <b>window</b> <b>view,</b> and 6) office without a <b>window</b> <b>view</b> and indoor plants. Participants were less nervous or anxious when watching a view of nature and/or when indoor plants were present. When neither the <b>window</b> <b>view</b> nor the indoor plants were shown, participants suffered the highest degree of tension and anxiety...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. XML is {{becoming}} the standard data exchange format. <b>View</b> or <b>transformation</b> of XML data is important and frequent operation in XML data integration and publishing. In schema-based <b>view</b> <b>transformation,</b> users define <b>view</b> schema over sources to obtain view results. This declarative approach alleviates user from writing complex scripts to perform <b>view</b> <b>transformation.</b> Current available schema formats are unable to express views with complex semantic constraints. In this paper, we introduce a semantically expressive XML data model: Object-Relationship-Attribute model for Semi-Structured data (ORA-SS), which allows users to define view schemas with rich semantic meanings. Combine with ORA-SS, we use a native XML DBMS: OrientStore to perform accurate and efficient <b>view</b> <b>transformation.</b> ...|$|R

Note that <b>viewing</b> <b>transformations</b> can subsume other specifics of the investigation, such as bit depth and even sample value histograms. To make this so, <b>viewing</b> <b>transformations</b> should be expressed with respect to a notional display device in which the transformed data are rendered as black when 0 and maximally bright when 1, with a prescribed display gamma function—for that, a gamma value of one-third would seem appropriate since it correlates rather well with human perception. Conversions required to map imagery at some particular bit depth to the actual diagnostic display monitor can always be folded into the formal <b>viewing</b> <b>transformations.</b>|$|R

Errors in registration of multiple views of a 3 D object severely affect view integration during automatic construction of object models.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to test whether live plants on computer workstations with and without <b>window</b> <b>view</b> had restorative effects. Guided by Stress Recovery Theory and Attention Restoration Theory a mixed randomized experiment was conducted exploring restorative effects of plants, including mediating effects of perceived fascination. Eighty-five participants carried out a 1 -hr work session with repeated tasks demanding directed attention in an office with one of three interior conditions: live plants, inanimate objects and control, all with and without a <b>window</b> <b>view.</b> Plant presence led to greater perceived fascination, but perceived fascination was not related to either self-reported restoration or directed attention capacity.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} high-precision, {{high-speed}} keypoint matching method using a two-stage Randomized Trees. The keypoint classification method uses the conventional Randomized Trees to enable highprecision, real-time keypoint matching. But {{the wide variety}} of <b>view</b> <b>transformations</b> for templates expressed by Randomized Trees make high-precision keypoint classification for all transformations difficult with a single Randomized Trees. To resolve this problem, proposed method classifies the template <b>view</b> <b>transformations</b> during the first stage. Then during the second stage, it classifies the keypoints using the Randomized Trees corresponding to each of the <b>view</b> <b>transformations</b> classified during the first stage. For images in which the viewpoint of the object is rotated by 70 degree, evaluation testing demonstrated that proposed method is 88. 4 % more precise than SIFT, and 63. 4 % more precise than the conventional Randomized Trees. We have also shown that the proposed method supports real-time keypoint matching at a speed of 12 fps. ...|$|R

The present study investigates differences in choice reaction time (CRT) and heart rate variability (HRV) in students (N= 10) resting {{with or without a}} <b>window</b> <b>view</b> of a natural environment after a minor physical exertion. Subjects performed a pre-test of a Deary-Liewald choice reaction time task before pedaling a stationary spinning bike for five minutes, followed by 10 minutes of resting in a chair with either a <b>window</b> <b>view</b> of a forest dominated hillside and field land, or a neutral view of a plain interior wall. Subjects’ heart rate variability was measured during the 10 minutes of rest, and post-test of the choice reaction time task was performed immediately after resting. Subjects elicited significantly larger improvement in CRTs after resting with a <b>window</b> <b>view</b> of natural environment, compared to resting with a neutral view. In addition, resting with a <b>window</b> <b>view</b> yielded significantly more efficient heart rate restoration, demonstrated by shorter heart rate restoration times.

40|$|Abstract. Gait {{analyses}} {{have recently}} gained attention as methods of identification of individuals {{at a distance}} from a camera. However, ap-pearance changes due to view direction changes cause difficulties for gait recognition systems. Here, we propose a method of gait recognition from various view directions using frequency-domain features and a <b>view</b> <b>transformation</b> model. We first construct a spatio-temporal silhouette volume of a walking person and then extract frequency-domain features of the volume by Fourier analysis based on gait periodicity. Next, our <b>view</b> <b>transformation</b> model is obtained with a training set of multiple persons from multiple view directions. In a recognition phase, the model transforms gallery features into the same view direction as that of an in-put feature, and so the features match each other. Experiments involving gait recognition from 24 view directions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ...|$|R
