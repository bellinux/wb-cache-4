5|$|Albani {{was created}} a {{cardinal}} deacon in 1690 by Alexander VIII, {{but he did}} not received ordination to the priesthood until shortly before the conclave began. Albani was not a bishop, and had to receive episcopal consecration after his election before he could be crowned pope. Albani had been elected on the feast day of Pope Clement I, and took the name of Clement XI to honour the saint. At fifty-one, Albani <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> any other pope who had been elected in almost two centuries. Albani was the candidate of the zelanti in this conclave, and his election represented a success for them.|$|E
5|$|During Persson's time as {{chairman}} Malmö FF employed their first foreign managers and won their first national titles. In total Persson employed 15 managers, seven {{of whom were}} foreign born. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan and became Swedish champions {{for the first time}} in 1944, and by the end of the 1970s had won nine Swedish league championships. Most of the titles won during this time were under foreign managers, the most successful of whom in terms of honours was Bob Houghton, whom Persson appointed in 1974. Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won their respect and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name. There was also some initial disagreement between Persson and Houghton as Persson had been used to having a final say in the team selection. Houghton wanted full purview over team selection, and Persson ultimately relented and gave it to him.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of scientists refute young Earth creationism. Around {{the start of the}} 19th century mainstream science abandoned the concept that Earth <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> millions of years. Measurements of biological, chemical, geological, and astronomical timescales differ from YEC's estimates of Earth's age by six orders of magnitude (that is, by factor of a million times). Scientific estimates of the age of the earliest pottery discovered, the oldest known trees, the ice cores, and layers of silt deposit in Lake Suigetsu are all significantly older than the oldest YEC estimate of Earth's age. YEC's theories are further contradicted by scientists' ability to observe galaxies billions of light years away.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} birthdate of Plato is not known. Based {{on ancient}} sources, most modern scholars estimate that Plato was born between 428 and 427 BC. The grammarian Apollodorus of Athens argues in his Chronicles that Plato {{was born in}} the first year of the eighty-eighth Olympiad (427 BC), on the seventh day of the month Thargelion; according to this tradition the god Apollo was born this day. According to another biographer of him, Neanthes, Plato was eighty-four years of age at his death. If we accept Neanthes' version, Plato <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Isocrates by six years, and therefore he {{was born in the}} second year of the 87th Olympiad, the year Pericles died (429 BC).|$|E

25|$|The date of Leszek's {{birth is}} unknown. According to Jan Długosz, writing in 15th century, {{he was born}} in 1158. Historian Oswald Balzer stated that Leszek was born between 1160 and 1165. He based his argumentat on the {{document}} from 26 April 1177, where Leszek was mentioned as taking the last place among Polish princes, after Mieszko younger (Misico iunior dux). Balzer considered that Leszek <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Mieszko, who according to Balzer was the same as Mieszko the Younger, who was born after 1159. Balzer also considered that Leszek being a witness had to be at least 12 years old. This date proposed by Balzer had been accepted in historiography. However, argument was proven wrong as Mieszko younger mentioned in said document was shown to be instead Mieszko I Tanglefoot (born before 1147) and a prince could be mentioned in document as a witness even though he was less than 12 years old.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} regeneration or renewal {{was that the}} Doctor's body would rebuild itself in a younger, healthier form. The Second Doctor {{was intended to be}} a literally younger version of the First; biological time would turn back, and several hundred years would get taken off the Doctor's age, rejuvenating him. In practice, however, since the Doctor stated his age in the Second Doctor serial The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), his age has been recorded progressively (see below). In six out of ten transitions, the new actor <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> his predecessor had been when he began the role. In the revived programme, the pattern is resumed with the transition of the Ninth to the Tenth and the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor, although Steven Moffat is on record stating the intention was to cast an actor in his mid-30s to 40s for the role of the Eleventh Doctor, despite casting Matt Smith, who is the youngest actor to ever have played the role.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Lionel Gough Arbuthnot {{played a}} number of matches and must have {{accompanied}} the tourists. Whatman {{was the only one}} of the tourists to have been on one of the earlier tours, having been part of Lord Hawke's team in 1896-97 but had not played any first class cricket between the two tours. Bennett himself and Dashwood had not played first class cricket since 1899 but the remaining eight had played in 1901. Many of the tourists were ex-Oxbridge cricketers, five of them having played in the 1901 Oxford v Cambridge match. The team <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the previous touring sides and although inexperienced was at least the standard of the two 1896-97 teams. Wilson received a telegram on his arrival announcing the death of his mother and Dowson was also unavailable for the first game having a cold. Even with Arbuthnot playing an additional player was required and J.A. Davenport made up the 11. A.G. Robinson played in a minor match on the tour.|$|E

25|$|Other {{contemporaneous}} {{groups in}} the area include the Parkin Phase, Tipton Phase, Menard Phase, Belle Meade Phase and Walls Phase. The archaeological and ethnohistorical records suggest that the groups were rival or politically allied polities, with no neutral parties, engaged in internecine conquest warfare. The presence of palisades, earthen embankments and moats {{and the absence of}} isolated single-family dwellings and smaller hamlets among the local phases suggests such a state of endemic warfare existed. According to the de Soto narratives, Pacaha had been at war for some time with a neighboring group, the Casqui. The Casqui are thought to have had their principal town at a site near Parkin at the location of the present-day Parkin Archeological State Park. Differences in pottery manufacture and burial customs found by archaeologists suggest the two groups had been isolated from each other for quite some time. The narratives record that the Pacaha and Casqui claimed they had been at war for many generations. The many years of fighting had led to a stalemate, where neither group was able to get the upper hand. Attacks were only carried out when the aggressor felt confident of success. The Pacaha controlled more territory and had a larger population than the Casqui. Chief Pacaha <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the Casqui chief, however, and seemingly had more to lose from the continued aggressive Casqui attacks.|$|E
25|$|Romero {{entered the}} minor seminary in San Miguel {{at the age}} of thirteen. He left the seminary for three months to return home when his mother became ill after the birth of her eighth child; during this time he worked with two of his {{brothers}} in a gold mine near Ciudad Barrios. After graduation he enrolled in the national seminary in San Salvador. He completed his studies at the Gregorian University in Rome, where he received a Licentiate in Theology cum laude in 1941, but had to wait a year to be ordained because he <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> the required age. He was ordained in Rome on 4 April 1942. His family could not attend his ordination because of travel restrictions due to World War II. Romero remained in Italy to obtain a doctoral degree in Theology, specializing in ascetical theology and Christian perfection according to Venerable Luis de la Puente. Before finishing, in 1943 {{at the age of}} 26, he was summoned back home from Italy by his bishop. He traveled home with a good friend, Father Valladares, who was also doing doctoral work in Rome. On the route home, they made stops in Spain and Cuba, where they were detained by the Cuban police, perhaps for having come from Fascist Italy, and were placed in a series of internment camps. After several months in prison, Valladares became sick and Redemptorist priests helped to have the two transferred to a hospital. From the hospital they were released from Cuban custody and sailed on to Mexico, then traveled overland to El Salvador.|$|E
