At around 5:00p.m., the Israeli Air Force began attacking Egyptian forces in the fort and on the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal. One group of four aircraft attempted to bomb the fort; the first aircraft dropped its payload of seven bombs, then descended to a low altitude to escape anti-aircraft fire. An anti-air platoon at the Kilometer 17 mark soon shot down an Israeli aircraft (either a Mirage III or an A-4 Skyhawk) with a Strela 2 missile, destroying it. Between 6:00 and 7:00p.m. all bunkers and troop shelters inside the fort were cleared, and the Egyptians transferred 26 Israeli prisoners to the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canal, and thereafter transferred them to Port Said for intelligence gathering. The Israelis concentrated heavy artillery fire against the fort, once they were sure it had been captured by the Egyptians.|$|E

The French beat the Duke of Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen on 4 June, capturing 3,000 Austrians, four colors and 12 guns. By 6 June Kléber's wing {{was on the}} Lahn River and Archduke Charles began evacuating the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine in order to concentrate against the French incursion. Kléber was joined {{within a few days}} by Jourdan and most of the Army of the Sambre-et-Meuse. At about this time, the Austrian high command began transferring Wurmser and 25,000 Austrians to Italy due to the successes of Napoleon Bonaparte. On 15 June, the archduke defeated the French in the Battle of Wetzlar. Subsequently, Jourdan recrossed to the <b>west</b> <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rhine while Kléber retreated north toward Düsseldorf.|$|E

During the breathing space offered by her enemy, Austria assembled an army under the Prince of Coburg and struck back. After a French covering force was routed by Coburg at Aldenhoven, Dumouriez began gathering his army for a counterstroke.|$|E
