5|$|While Erika's {{precursor}} disturbance {{was moving}} across Florida, it dropped heavy rainfall. In south Texas, Erika produced moderate winds of 50 to 60mph (80 to 95km/h) along with light rain, causing minor and isolated wind {{damage in the}} state. In northeastern Mexico, Erika produced moderate amounts of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flooding. There, two people <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> their vehicle was swept away by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Pacific War the {{strategic}} port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by 'Lark Force', which comprised the 2/22nd Infantry Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron. While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military, {{it was not possible to}} reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942. The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle. Few members of Lark Force survived the war, as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> the ship carrying them to Japan (Montevideo Maru) was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942.|$|E
5|$|During April 1940, No. 607 Squadron RAF {{was based}} at Saint-Inglevert, flying Gloster Gladiator Mk II HR aircraft. The {{military}} commander General Maxime Weygand visited the airfield on 21 May, and ordered 516 GAO to prepare to evacuate as the Germans {{were in the}} neighbouring Somme department. The following day, the order came to evacuate to Boos airfield, Rouen, Normandy, but only four of the ten aircraft that departed from Saint-Inglevert arrived safely at Boos. All aircraft carried as many passengers as could be accommodated. Two Potez 63-11's and a Bloch MB.152 were abandoned at Saint-Inglevert, and were destroyed to prevent their use by the enemy, as were supplies of fuel. Personnel from 516 GAO were evacuated from Dunquerque on the , although nineteen of them <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> the ship struck a mine and sank.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{approximately}} 545 Allied airmen who were {{captured in the}} Japanese home islands (excluding the Kuril and Bonin Islands), 132 were executed and 29 were killed by civilians. Another 94 airmen died from other causes while in Japanese custody, including 52 who <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> they were deliberately left in a prison in Tokyo during the 25/26May raid on the city. Between six and eight US airmen shot down on 5May were subjected to vivisection at the Kyushu Imperial University; Professor Fukujirō Ishiyama and other doctors conducted four such sessions throughout May and early June. The Western Military Command assisted in arranging these operations. Many of the Japanese personnel {{responsible for the deaths}} of Allied airmen were prosecuted in the Yokohama War Crimes Trials following the war. Several of those found guilty were executed and the remainder were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, the British ships Phoenix and Rose sailed up {{the harbor}} toward {{the mouth of}} the Hudson. The American {{batteries}} opened fire at Fort George, Red Hook, and Governors Island, and the British returned fire into the city. The ships sailed along the New Jersey shore and continued up the Hudson, sailing past Fort Washington and arriving by nightfall at Tarrytown, the widest part of the Hudson. The goals of the British ships were to cut off American supplies and to encourage Loyalist support. The only casualties of the day were six Americans who <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> their own cannon blew up.|$|E
5|$|Operation Red Wings was a counter-insurgent {{mission in}} Kunar province, Afghanistan, {{involving}} {{four members of}} the United States Navy SEALs. Murphy and two other SEALs, Danny Dietz and Matthew Axelson, were killed in the fighting, in addition to 16 American Special Operations Forces soldiers, who <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> their helicopter was shot down while attempting to extract the SEAL Team. Prior to a helicopter being shot down in 2011, it was both the largest loss of life for American forces since the invasion began and the largest loss for the SEALs since the Vietnam War. Marcus Luttrell was the only surviving American sailor from the squad; he was protected by local villagers, who sent an emissary to the closest military base, allowing a rescue team to locate him.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{there were}} 50injuries in the state, {{as well as}} at least three deaths. Two of them– a woman in West Hollywood, Florida and a man in Hallandale– <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> their houses {{collapsed}} from the strong winds. The third death occurred in Sanford when a boy drowned in a flooded stream. There were also unconfirmed reports of a fourth person drowning when his boat capsized west of Bunnell. The hurricane was one of two major hurricanes– a Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale– to hit the state in 1950. It was the first time on record that two storms of such intensity hit Florida in the same year, and has only been repeated since in 2004 with hurricanes Charley and Jeanne, and in 2005 with hurricanes Dennis and Wilma.|$|E
5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E

5|$|The company {{established}} a defensive {{position for the}} night. While they were doing so, Lieutenant D. B. Stuart, the commander {{of one of the}} Papuan platoons, arrived. They had become concerned when radio contact had been lost and he had been sent {{to find out what was}} going on. King ordered him to bring the Papuans up from Sangan with extra ammunition and the No.11 set. At around 17:30, a native appeared with a message for the Japanese commander. The paper was taken from him and he was shot when he tried to escape. Later, a Japanese patrol returned to Kaiapit, unaware that it was now in Australian hands. They <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> they stumbled across a Bren gun position. Four more Japanese soldiers returned after midnight. One of them escaped.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1874 as a {{replacement}} for Bishopsgate station as the Great Eastern Railway's main London terminus. By 1895 it had the largest number of platforms on any terminal railway station in London. During the First World War, an air raid on the station in 1917 led to 162 deaths. In the build-up to the Second World War, the station served as the entry point for thousands of child refugees arriving in London as part of the Kindertransport rescue mission. The station was damaged by the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing, and during the 7 July 2005 terrorist attacks in the city seven passengers <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> a bomb exploded aboard an Underground train just after it had departed from Liverpool Street.|$|E
5|$|The town {{suffered}} {{very little}} from the bombing {{runs in the}} Second World War that did damage to many English locations. The worst case in Shrewsbury was in 1940, {{a woman and her}} two grandchildren <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>when</b> a cottage was destroyed on Ellesmere Road, the only local air raid deaths. Therefore, many of its ancient buildings remain intact and there was little redevelopment in the 1960s and 1970s, which arguably destroyed the character of many historic towns in the UK. However, some historic buildings were demolished {{to make way for the}} brutalist architectural style of the 1960s, though the town was saved from a new 'inner ring road' due to its challenging geography. Two notable examples of 1960s/70s construction in Shrewsbury were demolished in the 2000s — the Telecom Tower on Smithfield Road and the multi-storey car park at St Austin's Friars.|$|E
