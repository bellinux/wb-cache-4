500|$|Following Martin Foster's departure, Smith {{was handed}} the Tamworth {{captaincy}} during the 2009–10 pre-season, {{which he described}} as a [...] "massive honour". His first appearance of the season came in the opening match, a 1–1 draw away to Stevenage Borough on 8 August 2009. Smith's first goal of the season came after scoring a powerful header in a 2–1 home victory over Wrexham on 25 August 2009. In October 2009, he paid tribute to the defensive partnership he had struck up with Michael Briscoe, saying: [...] "Football is about partnerships on the pitch, having trust in team-mates and good understandings and <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one." [...] Smith suffered a heel injury in October 2009, while also having a hernia problem that possibly needed an operation. After having a hernia operation, {{he was expected to}} be ruled out for a long-term period, but returned two weeks later in the following match, a 3–1 home win over Chester City on 14 November 2009. He was handed a one-match suspension after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season in a 0–0 home draw with Forest Green Rovers on 28 December 2009, meaning he missed Tamworth's match against Oxford United on 16 January 2010. His return came in a 0–0 draw away to Gainsborough in the FA Trophy second round on 19 January 2010. After receiving a yellow card in a 1–0 defeat away to Histon on 9 March 2010, he was given a two-match suspension, returning in a 2–0 away defeat by Cambridge United on 24 March. He scored from close range in the 82nd minute for Tamworth's equalising goal in his first match against York since leaving the club, which finished a 1–1 away draw on 27 March 2010. Smith made 38 appearances and scored four goals in 2009–10.|$|E

White subject's are apparently just there, and that's about the end of it.

2500|$|The first {{mention of}} Domitia in Marcus' letters reveals {{her as a}} sickly infant. [...] "Caesar to Fronto. If the gods are willing <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a hope of recovery. The {{diarrhoea}} has stopped, the little attacks of fever have been driven away. But the emaciation is still extreme {{and there is still}} quite a bit of coughing." [...] He and Faustina, Marcus wrote, had been [...] "pretty occupied" [...] with the girl's care. Domitia would die in 151.|$|E

60|$|And then, in that thick vapour, {{rounding}} I suppose some curve, we came suddenly into we {{knew not}} what--all white and moving it was, {{as if the}} mist were crazed; murmuring, too, {{with a sort of}} restless beating. <b>We</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be passing through a ghost--the ghost of all the life that had sprung from this water and its shores; <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left reality, <b>to</b> be travelling through live wonder.|$|R
2500|$|... "Panahi's films {{redefine the}} {{humanitarian}} themes of contemporary Iranian cinema, firstly, by treating {{the problems of}} women in modern Iran, and secondly, by depicting human characters as 'non-specific persons'—more like figures who nevertheless remain full-blooded characters, {{holding on to the}} viewer's attention and gripping the senses. Like the best Iranian directors who have won acclaim on the world stage, Panahi evokes humanitarianism in an unsentimental, realistic fashion, without necessarily overriding political and social messages. In essence, this has come to define the particular aesthetic of Iranian cinema. So powerful is this sensibility that <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no other mode of looking at Iranian cinema other than to equate it with a universal concept of humanitarianism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a summary}} of {{scientific}} research into creativity, Michael Mumford suggested: [...] "Over {{the course of the}} last decade, however, <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> reached a general agreement that creativity involves the production of novel, useful products" [...] (Mumford, 2003, p.110), or, in Robert Sternberg's words, the production of [...] "something original and worthwhile". Authors have diverged dramatically in their precise definitions beyond these general commonalities: Peter Meusburger reckons that over a hundred different analyses can be found in the literature. As an illustration, one definition given by Dr. E. Paul Torrance described it as [...] "a process of becoming sensitive to problems, deficiencies, gaps in knowledge, missing elements, disharmonies, and so on; identifying the difficulty; searching for solutions, making guesses, or formulating hypotheses about the deficiencies: testing and retesting these hypotheses and possibly modifying and retesting them; and finally communicating the results." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{must confess}} to enjoying that supper. For about ten days <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been living, more or less, on nothing but cold meat, cake, and bread and jam.

60|$|Saturday, July 9. Rose in a {{blaze of}} glory. Rode five mortal hours in a char-à-banc, sweltering under a burning sun. But in less than ten minutes after we mounted the mules and struck into the gorge, the ladies muffled {{themselves}} in thick shawls. <b>We</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> passed, almost in a moment, from the tropics into the frigid zone. A fur cloak was suggested to me, but as it happened I was adequately calorified without. Chancing to be the last in the file, my mule suddenly stopped to eat.|$|R

I have often thought, although I have never said so before, that our lives were too self-centred. <b>We</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no interests outside of ourselves.
