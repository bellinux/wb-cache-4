5000|$|Identifiers {{are unique}} to the server, {{not only to the}} client; for example, no two windows have the same identifier, even if created by two {{different}} clients. A client can access any object given its identifier. In particular, it can also access resources created by any other client, even if their identifiers are outside the set of identifiers it can create. As a result, two clients connected to the same server can use the same identifier to refer to the same resource. For example, if a client creates a window of identifier [...] and passes this number [...] to another application (via any available means, for example by storing this number in a file that is also accessible to the other application), this other application is able to operate on the very same window. This possibility is for example exploited by the X <b>Window</b> <b>version</b> of Ghostview: this program creates a subwindow, storing its identifier in an environment variable, and calls Ghostscript; this program draws the content of the PostScript file to show in this window.|$|E

5000|$|The {{music on}} the album {{consists}} of Jandek's wavering voice and a guitar pick gently plucking very oddly tuned guitar strings. The guitar playing, which many refer to as [...] "untuned" [...] is in fact tuned to what the artist has {{referred to as a}} [...] "black key sound." [...] Eight of the nine tracks largely repeat the same slow, slightly bluesy tempo with similar vocal delivery. On the ending track, [...] "European Jewel (Incomplete)," [...] Jandek switches from the acoustic to a strummed electric guitar that approaches standard tuning and instead of picking the strings, Jandek barres the frets. In the middle of the line [...] "just a shaking sha-" [...] the song abruptly cuts off, leading one to think that the tape has run out or that an error has occurred with the reel to reel tape recorder, and the album unexpectedly ends. The song would be resumed on Chair Beside a Window, beginning with the last three lines of the [...] "incomplete" [...] version and then continuing with the missing lyrics. The Chair Beside a <b>Window</b> <b>version</b> features {{what appears to be a}} live band version with electric guitar, bass, and drums. It revisited three more times on the album The Rocks Crumble, and it is assumed that Smith is overdubbing himself that time around, having told Chusid that there were instances of this in his letter. There are many notable instances where Jandek albums abruptly end so one could assume this is a motif.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Versioning helps {{users to}} keep track of {{different}} sets of edits on a document. Version merging methods enable users to determine which parts of which version they wish to include in the next or final version. We explored several existing and two new methods (highlighting and overlay) in single and multiple window settings. We present the results of our quantitative user studies, which show that the new highlighting and overlay techniques are preferred for version merging tasks. The results suggest that the most useful methods are those which clearly and easily present information that is likely important to the user, while simultaneously hiding less important information. Also, multi <b>window</b> <b>version</b> merging is preferred over single window merging...|$|E

40|$|The maze task is {{an online}} measure of {{sentence}} processing time that provides {{an alternative to}} the standard moving <b>window</b> <b>version</b> of self-paced reading. Rather than each word of the sentence being presented in succession, two words are presented at the same time, and the participant must choose which word is a grammatical continuation of the sentence. This procedure forces the reader into an incremental mode of processing in which each word must be fully integrated with the preceding context before the next word can be considered. Previous research with this technique has not considered whether it is sufficiently sensitive to syntactic complexity effects or to garden path effects. Four experiments are reported demonstrating that reliable differences in processing time for subject relatives and object relatives can be obtained, and that this technique generates garden path effects that correspond closely with the data from eyetracking experiments, but without the spillover effects that are sometimes obtained with eyetracking. It is also shown that the task is sensitive to word frequency effects, producing estimates well in excess of those found with eyetracking...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the methods, indications, outcome of induced labor and its significance in obstetric practice in the study area. Methods. This was a retrospective study of cases of induced labor at the Catholic Maternity Hospital in Ogoja, Cross-River State, Nigeria, between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2011. Data on the sociodemographic characteristics of the parturient, induction methods, indications for induction, outcomes and reasons for failed induction were abstracted from personal case files and the hospital’s maternity/delivery register. The data were analyzed with SPSS 15. 0 <b>window</b> <b>version.</b> Result. The induction rate in this study was 11. 5 %. Induction was successful in 75. 9 % of cases but failed in 24. 1 %. Misoprostol was the commonest induction method (78. 2 %). The commonest indication for induction was postdate pregnancy (45. 8 %). Failed induction was due to fetal distress, prolonged labor, cephalopelvic disproportion and cord prolapse. The induction-delivery interval was 12 ± 3. 6 [*]hours. Conclusion. Induction of labor is a common obstetric procedure which is safe and beneficial in well-selected and properly monitored high risk pregnancies where the benefits of early delivery outweigh the risk of continuing the pregnancy...|$|E

Nurses ’ perspectives may moderate or mediate the aforementioned relationships. This exploratory study intended to understand staff’s perspectives about call lights, staff responsiveness, and the reasons for and the nature of call light use. It also explored differences among hospitals and identified significant predictors of the nature of call light use.
