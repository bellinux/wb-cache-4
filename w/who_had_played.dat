5|$|The Silver Seven {{participated in}} {{perhaps the most famous}} Stanley Cup {{challenge}} of all, that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had struck it rich in the Yukon gold rush of 1898, The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>played</b> for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted in the summer of 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929.

Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
