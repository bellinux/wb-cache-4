But Vogel was only given authorization to recruit 30 Navajos, under a pilot program status to investigate the feasibility of this proposed program with actual Navajos. On the morning of May 4, 1942, twenty-nine Navajo recruits boarded the bus at Ft. Defiance, Arizona, were transported to the induction center at Ft. Wingate, New Mexico, and, after lunch, were transported overnight to Marine Corps Recruit Depot, San Diego (MCRD, SD) for administrative in-processing, then to start their seven weeks of standard recruit training. Upon completion of recruit training the first all-Navajo Platoon 382 graduated from MCRD, SD on June 27, 1942, where they were immediately ordered to report to Camp Elliot for about eight weeks of basic communications training and to develop a code based on the Navajo language. As for developing the code, the Navajos were guided by a cryptographic officer under the command of now Lt. Col. Jones in the basics of employing letter and <b>word</b> <b>substitution</b> encryption methods in the formulation of the code. Shortly after the beginning of this project three additional Navajo Marines were added to the program, and together the 32 Navajos worked to develop the code.

40|$|Word {{obfuscation}} or substitution means replacing {{one word}} with another {{word in a}} sentence to conceal the textual content or communication. Word obfuscation is used in adversarial communication by terrorist or criminals for conveying their messages without getting red-flagged by security and intelligence agencies intercepting or scanning messages (such as emails and telephone conversations). ConceptNet is a freely available semantic network represented as a directed graph consisting of nodes as concepts and edges as assertions of common sense about these concepts. We present a solution approach exploiting vast amount of semantic knowledge in ConceptNet for addressing the technically challenging problem of <b>word</b> <b>substitution</b> in adversarial communication. We frame the given problem as a textual reasoning and context inference task and utilize ConceptNet's natural-language-processing tool-kit for determining <b>word</b> <b>substitution.</b> We use ConceptNet to compute the conceptual similarity between any two given terms and define a Mean Average Conceptual Similarity (MACS) metric to identify out-of-context terms.

40|$|Abstract—Speakers produce {{words to}} convey meaning, but does meaning alone {{determine}} which words they say? We report three experiments that show independent semantic and phonological influences converging to determine word selection. Speakers named pictures (e. g., of a priest) following visually presented cloze sentences that primed either semantic competitors {{of the target}} object name (“The woman went to the convent to become a [...] . ”), homophones of the competitors (“I thought that {{there would still be}} some cookies left, but there were [...] . ”), or matched unrelated control object names. Primed semantic competitors (nun) were produced instead of picture names more often than primed unrelated control object names, showing the well-documented influence of semantic similarity on lexical selection. Surprisingly, primed homophone competitors (none) also substituted for picture names more often than control object names even though they only sounded like competitors. Thus, independent semantic and phonological influences can converge to affect word selection. People are remarkably successful at selecting words that express what they intend to say. Yet much evidence about how this process of lexical selection works comes from errors in which speakers produce unintended words instead of intended ones. At least two kinds of such <b>word</b> <b>substitutions</b> 1 have been observed. In semantic substitutions, the intended and intruding words are similar in meaning (e. g., “he got hot under the belt”; Fromkin, 1973); in phonological substitutions or malapropisms, the words are similar in sound (e. g., “White Anglo-Saxon prostitute”; Fromkin, 1973). These two kinds of <b>word</b> <b>substitutions</b> have been taken to reflect two distinct lexical processes (e. g., Dell, 1986; Levelt, Roelofs, &...|$|R
