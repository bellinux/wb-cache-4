5|$|At {{the same}} time, Quisling {{believed}} {{that the only way}} he could win back Hitler's respect would be to raise volunteers for the now-faltering German war effort, and he committed Norway wholeheartedly to German plans to wage total war. For him at least, after the German defeat at Stalingrad in February 1943, Norway now had a part to play in keeping the German empire strong. In April 1943, Quisling delivered a scathing speech attacking Germany's refusal to outline its plans for post-war Europe. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> this to Hitler in person, the Nazi leader remained unmoved despite Norway's contributions to the war effort. Quisling felt betrayed over this postponement of Norwegian freedom, an attitude that waned only when Hitler eventually committed to a free post-war Norway in September 1943.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E

25|$|Booker's next feud {{was with}} Scott Steiner, {{to whom he}} {{eventually}} lost the title in a Straitjacket steel cage match.

25|$|In 112 {{first-class}} matches, he made exactly 4,000 runs at {{an average}} of 21 runs per innings; he scored only two centuries in a career that lasted 12 years. His highest was 156 against Sussex at the County Ground, Taunton in 1896 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 249 for the second wicket with his brother, who made 154. In the 1896-97 winter {{he was a member of}} a touring team to the West Indies led by Arthur Priestley; a second touring side to the West Indies that winter was led by Lord Hawke. After that tour, his appearances in first-class cricket became less frequent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of 1628 he {{discovered}} that his wife, Kirsten Munk, was having a relationship {{with one of his}} German officers; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> her away she endeavoured to cover up her own disgrace by conniving at an intrigue between Vibeke Kruse, one of her discharged maids, and the king.

Vibeke's children were of course the natural enemies of the children of Kirsten Munk, and the hatred of the two families was not without influence on the future history of Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Initially, {{he played}} {{largely as a}} batsman, usually opening. In 1922, he made 881 runs, and in every other season {{he went on to}} more than 900 runs, passing the 1,000 runs for the season five times. His first century came in 1923 against a weak Glamorgan side at Taunton, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 251 for the second wicket with Jack MacBryan, who made 148. A year later, he made 198 against Hampshire at Bath, the major {{contribution}} in what was, at that stage, Somerset's highest-ever first-class total. The innings remained Young's highest score in first-class cricket. He was picked twice to represent the professionals in Gentlemen v Players matches, once at Folkestone and once at The Oval.|$|E
25|$|When Lee {{produced}} a photo booklet titled 'Young Lovers' in June 1975, {{he decided to}} promote it using posters {{on the sides of}} London buses.

25|$|The {{force had}} navigated fairly far up river {{when they came}} under {{unexpected}} fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of Erebus, was hit four times.

25|$|According {{to ancient}} sources, the {{earliest}} reference to Tarasis {{dates back to}} 464, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> his hands on some letters written by Aspar's son, Ardabur, which proved that {{the son of the}} magister militum had incited the Sassanid King to invade Roman territory, promising to support the invasion. Through these letters, which Tarasis gave to Leo, the Emperor could dismiss Ardabur, who at the time was magister militum per Orientem and patricius, thus reducing Aspar's influence and ambition. As reward for his loyalty, which Leo praised with Daniel the Stylite, Tarasis was appointed comes domesticorum, an office of great influence and prestige. This appointment could mean that Tarasis had been a protector domesticus, either at Leo's court in Constantinople, or attached at Ardabur's staff in Antioch.|$|E
25|$|His career best {{score was}} 143, made against Leicestershire at Chesterfield in 1924, the highest {{score of the}} season for Derbyshire, who failed to win a match all season and {{contrived}} to lose this one after being ahead by 52 on first innings by being bowled out for 69 in the second innings. This remained his only hundred until 1927, when he scored two more, 110 against Glamorgan at Chesterfield and 102 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, and enjoyed his best season in terms of averages, with 871 runs at 27.21. There was a fourth century in 1928, 111 against Warwickshire at Derby, and a final one the following season, 138 against Somerset at Burton-on-Trent, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 153 for the seventh wicket with Archibald Slater and 113 for the eighth wicket with Arthur Richardson. In 1930, he played pretty regularly, but by this time batted mostly at No 7 or 8 and in the season he scored less than 500 runs. The following year, he played just nine matches and was not re-engaged {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{graduated}} from Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1890. In 1891 and 1892, he played first-class cricket fairly regularly for Nottinghamshire, captaining the team on occasion, {{and for some}} amateur teams, though only in 1892 did he have any success: his two first-class scores of more than 50 both came in this season. His best innings was a score of 72 in the Nottinghamshire game against Middlesex <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>put</b> on 161 for the fifth wicket with Arthur Shrewsbury, who made 212. At {{the end of the}} 1892 English cricket season he joined Lord Hawke's XI cricket team in Ceylon and India in 1892–93, where he played in a single first-class match; he did not then appear at all in first-class cricket in 1893. He reappeared in Nottinghamshire matches in 1894 and occasionally kept wicket that season, {{and at the end of}} it he went on a second tour, this time with Lord Hawke to North America, where he played in two first-class cricket matches. He played occasionally in both 1895 and 1896 with no success.|$|E
