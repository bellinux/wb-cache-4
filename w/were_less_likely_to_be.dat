5|$|Middle Mongol had a {{slightly}} larger set of declarative finite verb suffix forms {{and a smaller}} number of participles, which <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as finite predicates. The linking converb -n became confined to stable verb combinations, while the number of converbs increased. The distinction between male, female and plural subjects exhibited by some finite verbal suffixes was lost.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and anoxic events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disrupted.|$|E
50|$|When {{examining}} these MIDs in more detail, the inter-liberal disputes have on {{the average}} more hostility, but <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> involve third parties, hostility <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reciprocated, when reciprocated the response is usually proportional to the provocation, and the disputes <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cause any loss of life.|$|R

They <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> approve compensation policies that include incentive-based pay. The compensation for electric utility executives will be the lowest in regulated utilities that have an unfavorable regulatory environment. These companies have more political constraints than those in a favorable regulatory environment and <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a positive response to requests for rate increases.|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{perpetrators}} of Nazi war crimes were never charged, and returned unremarked to civilian life. The West German Central Prosecution Office of Nazi War Criminals only charged about a hundred former Einsatzgruppe members with war crimes. And as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions; witnesses grew older and <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, and the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> operated on than men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Daniel (1821), Chief Justice John Marshall {{recounted the}} history of tie-breaking methods on the circuit courts. If one judge or justice {{disagreed}} with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend, and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practiceas required by the Judiciary Act of 1793was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. After 1802, in cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit-riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the expiration date. Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils {{are less likely to be}} noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E
5|$|Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; he {{was accompanied by a}} great many indigenous allies. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rounded up into new reducción settlements than elsewhere in Chiapas, since the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E

5|$|A {{study in}} 2011 by Douglas Miller {{shows that in}} English county cricket, the {{proportion}} of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11% of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14% in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11% but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19% in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions—less likely to be out lbw when batting {{and more likely to}} dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end-of-match reports on the umpires; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received leeway whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers. Amateurs administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batsmen from the subcontinent <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lbw wherever they played in the world.|$|E
5|$|By the show's tenth {{anniversary in}} 1979, 9 million American {{children}} under the age of six were watching Sesame Street daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the US Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners, first-, and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups, most significantly economically disadvantaged children; 88% of children from low-income families and 90% of both African-American and Latino children watched the show before entering kindergarten. Over 80% of children from all minority language groups watched it before starting school. Children from the poorest communities were most likely to be regular viewers, as were younger children. Children whose parents did not read to them regularly <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> regular viewers, and children of highly educated parents stopped viewing earlier than children from disadvantaged households.|$|E
5|$|Under the Judiciary Act of 1789, the United States circuit {{courts were}} {{composed}} of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit. If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two, the majority prevailed. If only one Supreme Court justice could attend (as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793), and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice, the practice was to hold the case over until the next term. If a one-to-one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice, {{the opinion of the}} previous circuit rider broke the tie. Following a brief intermezzo with the soon-repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 (which briefly abolished circuit riding), under the Judiciary Act of 1802, the circuit courts were {{composed of a}} stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit. But, a single judge (either the district judge or the circuit rider) could preside alone. In cases where both judges sat, though, one-to-one divisions <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same (barring a change in membership on the Court).|$|E

5|$|Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado {{passed through}} Soconusco with a {{sizeable}} force in 1523, {{en route to}} conquer Guatemala. Alvarado's army included hardened veterans of the conquest of the Aztecs, and included cavalry and artillery; there were also a great many indigenous allies from Cholula, Tenochtitlan, Tezcoco, Tlaxcala, and Xochimilco. Alvarado was received in peace in Soconusco, and the inhabitants swore allegiance to the Spanish Crown. They reported that neighbouring groups in Guatemala were attacking them because of their friendly outlook towards the Spanish. Alvarado's letter to Hernán Cortés describing his passage through Soconusco is lost, and knowledge of events there come from the account of Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who was not present, but related the report of Gonzalo de Alvarado. By 1524, Soconusco had been completely pacified by Alvarado and his forces. Over the next fifty years, native population levels collapsed catastrophically {{as a result of}} exposure to Old World diseases, with an estimated 90–95% drop. In spite of this, the colonial administration demanded twice as much tribute in cacao as had been paid to the Aztecs prior to the Spanish invasion, and cacao continued to be an important crop throughout the colonial period. Due to the economic importance of cacao to the new colony, the Spanish were reluctant to move the indigenous inhabitants far from their established cacao orchards. As a result, the inhabitants of Soconusco <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rounded up into new reducción settlements, where the planting of a new cacao crop would have required five years to mature.|$|E

25|$|Italianate rowhouses so {{defined the}} {{neighborhood}} that the industrial building at 50 Morton Avenue, {{on the western}} corner with Elizabeth Street, had its facade along that street done to mimic five rowhouses. The actual houses built during this era, however, began to break with the Greek Revival and Italianate traditions that had marked their pre-1870s neighbors. Their cornices <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carved ornately, and their facades featured more bay and oriel windows.

25|$|On July 11, 1947, a {{group of}} Irgun men {{retrieved}} weapons, chloroform, cloths and ropes from a hidden cache. After the recent failures, the Irgun militants in Netanya were skeptical regarding the chances of this kidnapping attempt.

Furthermore, Yosef Meller, a longtime Netanya resident and newly recruited Irgun member, volunteered to use his black taxi cab, which was well known around town, for the kidnapping.

At nightfall one basic precaution was taken; the taxi's license plates were changed in an attempt to prevent it being recognized {{in the course of the}} abduction.|$|E
25|$|Kỳ and Thiệu were {{reluctant}} to campaign and meet the populace as they saw such events as liabilities rather than opportunities {{to win over the}} public, and showed little interest in gaining popular support in any case, as they could always count on a rigging of the ballot. The CIA reported that the pair had no intention of participating on the arranged rallies with the civilian candidates because they felt that “possible heckling from the audience that would be too humiliating.” Thiệu and Kỳ were correct; they made one public campaign appearance at a rally, where a very disapproving crowd in Huế assailed Kỳ as a “hooligan” and “cowboy leader.” Kỳ and Thiệu decided to campaign indirectly by appearing at set piece ceremonial appointments, such as transferring land titles to peasants, as hostile elements from the general population <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present. Thiệu took a restrained and more moderate stance during the campaign toward the issue of demoncracy, while Kỳ, the public face of the ticket and the incumbent government, went on the attack, damaging the pair’s image and supposed commitment to democracy. Kỳ did not hide his distaste for democracy or his opponents and “described the civilian candidates as 'ordure' , 'traitors,' and 'destroyers of the national interest.'” He continued on to say that if his opponents continued to attack him, he would cancel the poll. In the accompanying senate election, Kỳ openly endorsed 11 slates, but only one was successful in gaining one of the six seats.|$|E
