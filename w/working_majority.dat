5|$|At the February 1974 general {{election}} the Heath government was narrowly defeated. Douglas-Home, then aged 71, stepped {{down at the}} second election of that year, called in October by the minority Labour government {{in the hope of}} winning a <b>working</b> <b>majority.</b> He returned to the House of Lords at the end of 1974 when he accepted a life peerage, becoming known as Baron Home of the Hirsel, of Coldstream in the County of Berwick.|$|E
5|$|In July 1951 the 13th earl died. Dunglass succeeded him, inheriting {{the title}} of Earl of Home {{together}} with the extensive family estates, including The Hirsel, the Douglas-Homes' principal residence. The new Lord Home took his seat in the Lords; a by-election was called to appoint a new MP for Lanark, {{but it was still}} pending when Attlee called another general election in October 1951. The Unionists held Lanark, and the national result gave the Conservatives under Churchill a small but <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> of 17.|$|E
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that he would lose, and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E

5|$|The Labour Party {{came into}} {{government}} {{under the leadership}} of Tony Blair in May 1997 after the electoral wipeout of the Conservative government, led by John Major; this ended 18 years of Conservative rule. Having secured a landslide victory with 418 seats in the House of Commons, the Party had a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> of 179 seats, and {{went on to win the}} 2001 and 2005 elections. During its first term in office Blair's government introduced many popular policies, including legislation to establish a national minimum wage, reducing the length of hospital waiting lists, and devolving lawmaking powers to Scotland and Wales. Blair also played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process. But his decision to commit British troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq turned public opinion against him and lost him the support of some of his own MPs. When Blair stepped down as Prime Minister in June 2007 he was succeeded by his Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Blair's decade-long premiership had been a time of economic boom for the United Kingdom, but Brown's tenure as Prime Minister was dominated by the global recession of the latter part of the 2000s. Although commentators perceived Brown to have made some good decisions during the economic crisis, such as providing financial aid to several UK banks which found themselves in difficulty, his fiscal policy of borrowing and spending led to a dramatic increase in the country's national debt. He was also viewed by the media as someone who lacked interpersonal skills. Another major event that occurred during Brown's time in government was the 2009 scandal involving MPs expenses, which damaged the public's trust in politicians.|$|E

25|$|First, the Act {{removed the}} Sovereign from the {{election}} process and the choice of Prime Minister. Slowly evolving for 100 years, this convention was confirmed {{two years after the}} passage of the Act. In 1834, King William IV dismissed Melbourne as Premier, but was forced to recall him when Robert Peel, the King's choice, could not form a <b>working</b> <b>majority.</b> Since then, no Sovereign has tried to impose a Prime Minister on Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Despite most {{opinion polls}} {{predicting}} that the Conservatives and Labour were neck and neck, the Conservatives secured a surprise victory after having won a clear lead over their rivals and incumbent Prime Minister David Cameron {{was able to}} form a majority single-party government with a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> of 12 (in practice increased to 15 due to Sinn Féin's 4 MPs' abstention). Thus the result bore resemblance to 1992. The Conservatives gained 38 seats while losing 10, all to Labour, with Employment Minister Esther McVey the most senior Conservative to lose her seat. Cameron became the first Prime Minister since Lord Salisbury in 1900 to increase his popular vote share after a full term, and is sometimes credited as being the only Prime Minister other than Margaret Thatcher (in 1983) to be re-elected with {{a greater number of}} seats for his party after a 'full term'.|$|E
25|$|Under {{this form}} of government, called the Westminster system, the Sovereign is head of state and titular head of Her Majesty's Government. She selects as her Prime Minister {{the person who is}} able to command a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> in the House of Commons, and invites him or her to form a government. As the actual Head of Government, the Prime Minister selects his Cabinet, {{choosing}} its members from among those in Parliament who agree or generally agree with his intended policies. He then recommends them to the Sovereign who confirms his selections by formally appointing them to their offices. Led by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet is collectively responsible for whatever the government does. The Sovereign does not confer with members privately about policy, nor attend Cabinet meetings. With respect to actual governance, the monarch has only three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn. In practice this means that the Sovereign reviews state papers and meets regularly with the Prime Minister, usually weekly, when she may advise and warn him or her regarding the proposed decisions and actions of Her Government.|$|E

50|$|In the United States {{there has}} long been a {{conflict}} between the <b>working</b> class <b>majority</b> and the professional class.

25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; we had one of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a <b>working</b> <b>majority,</b> and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E
500|$|Entering County Hall as GLC {{leader on}} 8 May 1981, Livingstone {{initiated}} changes, converting the building's Freemasonic temple into a meeting room and removing {{many of the}} privileges enjoyed by GLC members and senior officers. He initiated an open-door policy allowing citizens to hold meetings in the committee rooms free of charge, with County Hall gaining the nickname of [...] "the People's Palace". Livingstone took great pleasure watching the disgust expressed by some Conservative GLC members when non-members began using the building's restaurant. In the London Labour Briefing, Livingstone announced [...] "London's ours! After the most vicious GLC election of all time, the Labour Party has won a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> on a radical socialist programme." [...] He stated that their job was to [...] "sustain a holding operation {{until such time as}} the Tory [...] government can be brought down and replaced by a left-wing Labour government." [...] There was a perception among Livingstone's allies that they constituted the genuine opposition to Thatcher's government, with Foot's Labour leadership dismissed as ineffectual; they hoped Benn would soon replace him.|$|E
500|$|Bruce {{moved quickly}} to secure a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> for his government. He {{convinced}} Hughes' long time political ally George Pearce to join his ministry and shored up {{the support of the}} other former National Labor members of the Nationalist Party whom had walked out of the Labor Party with Hughes in 1916. He appointed William Watt as Speaker of the House, effectively removing one of his key opponents from the benches, a tactical manoeuvre that became common in Australian politics thereafter. But his most lasting political achievement was the negotiation of {{what became known as the}} Coalition an arrangement of electoral and political cooperation between the Nationalists (and their successors) and the Country Party. Although differing greatly in character and background, the orderly and diplomatic Bruce forged a strong working relationship with the intelligent but irascible Country Party leader Page. Bruce had to pay a very high price for this relationship, however. [...] As part of the Coalition agreement, the Country Party received five seats in a Cabinet of 11. [...] Page also became Treasurer and ranked second in the Cabinet. The Nationalists also made major concessions on rural development and taxation policy compromises that stirred some resentment among some members of Bruce's party. [...] Page, who would serve as Treasurer and de facto Deputy Prime Minister throughout Bruce's tenure, would become a great admirer of Bruce, stating, [...] "He was a leader who impressed his colleagues with his sincerity and his capacity, and earned their loyalty as the reward for his wisdom and integrity." ...|$|E

Members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party walked out in protest, and, without a <b>working</b> <b>majority</b> in Parliament, Elbegdorj was forced to resign.

Then add to that the parties the 'Liberals' (so called) and others, who use this question as a weapon simply. In the Senate and Legislative Body they haven't forgotten how to talk, have they--these French? The passion and confusion seem to have been extreme.

60|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the session}} of 1836, the hopes of the Conservative party were again in the ascendant. The Tadpoles and the Tapers had infused such enthusiasm into all the country attorneys, who, in their turn, had so bedeviled the registration, that it was whispered in the utmost confidence, but as a {{flagrant}} truth, that Reaction was at length 'a great fact.' All that was required was the opportunity; but as the existing parliament was not two years old, and the government had an excellent <b>working</b> <b>majority,</b> it seemed that the occasion could scarcely be furnished.
