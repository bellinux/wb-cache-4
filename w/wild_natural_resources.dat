While the resulting heightened quantity has been investigated, the possibly changing spatial patterns of such harvesting {{have not yet}} been explored. This study focuses on female firewood collection. It assumes that a household's HIV/AIDS status increase female caregiver duties and thus hypothesizes that time to travel for firewood is constrained. 103 households surveys were incorporated with interviews and GPS trajectories of 21 focal households for a one-year time period in a former homeland village. The models suggest that while HIV/AIDS-proxies do not affect distances walked by girls, they do negatively impact distances walked by women. Such a spatial confinement could support a downward spiral of poor health and rural poverty in a finite forest environment. This study contributes to wild harvesting literature generally, while addressing how age and disease influence female firewood collection, specifically...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>wild</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> are a {{standard}} dietary component in southern Africa, little information exists on these resources' specific {{role in the}} maintenance of household food security among HIV-impacted households. In this context, the influence of cash savings or income generated through use or sale of natural resources (e. g., using fuelwood instead of electricity {{to be able to}} afford to buy food) is also not known. Indeed, to date the environmental dimensions of the AIDS epidemic remain little explored, despite the centrality of the natural environment in the livelihoods of the rural poor across Africa. Filling this information gap is important, given that Sub-Saharan Africa is generally typified by the interlinked phenomena of rapidly rising HIV prevalence rates, high levels of food insecurity, dependence on natural resources for rural livelihoods, climatic variability, and environmental degradation. Nowhere are associations between these pheomena more urgent than in southern Africa, which has the highest rates of HIV infection in the world. BriefNon-PRIFPRI 1; GRP 33; RENEWALFCN...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of {{heightened}} financial and food insecurity, populations adversely affected by HIV and/or AIDS {{may be more likely}} to utilise <b>wild</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> to supplement their diet and livelihoods. Should this effect be pronounced, HIV and AIDS may pose a serious environmental threat. We explored the hypothesis that the presence of factors in the household, such as chronic illness in and recent mortality of individuals in a high HIV-risk age group, as well as the fostering of orphans, are associated with increased utilisation of wild animal products (WAPs) at the household level. We randomly surveyed 519 households from four sites in rural South Africa, recording household socio-economic status, the utilisation of wild animal products and health and demographic factors attributed to HIV or AIDS. Binary logistic regressions were used to test if households with markers of HIV and/or AIDS affliction were more likely to have a higher incidence and frequency of WAP utilisation relative to non-afflicted households, after adjusting for socio-economic and demographic variables. We found that, although households with markers of HIV and/or AIDS were generally poorer and had higher dependency ratios, there was no evidence to support the hypothesis that WAP harvesting was associated with either poverty, or markers of HIV and/or AIDS affliction. Our findings suggest that generalisations about a possible interaction between HIV and/or AIDS and the environment may not uniformly apply to all categories of natural resources or to all user groups...|$|E

In this context there is general agreement that such hatchery stocks have to be established respecting genetic diversity at a micro geographic scale and, consequently, operating {{at the level of}} evolutionary significant units. That is, at least when foreign strains are potentially present in the wild, captive breeding programs have to comprise genetic fingerprinting of wild spawners founding hatchery strains. In contrast to this scientific awareness most captive breeding programs in the Northern Adriatic region, harboring highly endangered endemic salmonid species, still exclusively depend on morphological selection parameters. Here we provide multi locus genotypic data of both Marble trout and Adriatic grayling captive breeding strains managed by local angler associations for wild stock enhancement. Individual assignment tests of wild brood stocks and simulated subsequent hatchery generations indicate introgression of foreign alleles into native stocks in both empirical case studies. By analyzing simulated genotypes of subsequent hatchery generations we found that introgression was critically depending on parameters such as ‘immigration rate’, gender of non-native fish and, finally, the number of subsequent hatchery generations...|$|R

40|$|Do <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> cause civil war? Scholars {{disagree}} on the resource-conflict link. One common model of explanation, the greed model, asserts that <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> provide an incentive to rebel. <b>Natural</b> <b>resource,</b> however, only increases the exposure to conflict at first. When a certain threshold of rent from <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> is reached, the government’s control allows it to overbid the rebels {{in the battle for}} “labor”. With more resources the incumbent(s) can also spend more on defense and deterrence, thereby raising the cost of a rebellion. First, this thesis argues that the implied rent-seeking claim essential to the greed model excludes certain political determinants which could mitigate the adverse effects of <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> dependence. Bestowed with vast amounts of <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> leaders might induce corruption, patronage and individual rent-seeking behavior to buy off any would-be rebels.
