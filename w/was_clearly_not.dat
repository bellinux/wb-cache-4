5|$|The League Cup <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> one of Ferguson's main {{priorities}} of the season, as he used it to blood the younger and less-known players. After being swept aside {{in the third round}} by Ipswich Town – a team {{at the bottom of the}} First Division – Ferguson came under intense scrutiny for fielding a reshuffled squad. However, the manager felt that it was, at the time, an unwanted domestic distraction.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to be aware that the manager <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E

McInnis, like Dietrich, had appealed to the High Court against his conviction, arguing that the failure to adjourn the proceedings while McInnis sought legal representation resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, {{the majority in the}} McInnis appeal found that McInnis was very unlikely to have been acquitted, even with full representation. This <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> the case with Dietrich.|$|E

5|$|In 1299, George's son and Aldimir's nephew Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1322), the {{legitimate}} {{successor to the}} Bulgarian throne, invaded Bulgaria along with Tatar troops. The news of that invasion was enough to force Smiltsena and Ivan to flee to the despotate of Kran even before Theodore Svetoslav's troops had reached the capital. Aldimir gave refuge to Smiltsena and Ivan, though he <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> opposed to his newly crowned nephew. In 1300, Smilets' brother sebastokrator Radoslav headed a Byzantine-supported campaign against Aldimir {{en route to the}} capital. However, the attack had disastrous consequences to Radoslav. He was captured by Aldimir, blinded and forced back to Thessaloniki, while his Byzantine generals were sent as captives to Theodore Svetoslav. With this act, Aldimir pledged his allegiance to Theodore Svetoslav, who rewarded him with an extension to his appanage. The despotate of Kran was enlarged to the east to include the fortresses of Yambol and Lardea near today's Karnobat.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother {{was the daughter of}} an Irish king, whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E

At that time, Colombo deemed it as a blatant show of support for the Tamil Tigers. The total supply air dropped by India during the operation amounted to little over 25 tons, and this <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> sufficient to sustain a besieged city.|$|E

25|$|Abdülhamid II {{was aware}} that the empire needed a navy to shield herself from the ever-growing Russian threat. However, the Ottoman {{economic}} crisis of 1875 and the additional financial burden of the disastrous Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) deprived the Ottoman Empire from the financial resources and economic independence to maintain and modernize a large fleet. The {{second half of the}} 19th century was a period of breakthroughs in the field of naval engineering. The Ottoman Navy was rapidly becoming obsolete, and needed to replace all her warships once a decade {{to keep up with the}} pace in technological progress – which, given the dismal state of the economy, <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> an option.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{believed}} that Project Hula {{would have given}} the Soviet Union the ability to invade the Japanese home islands. However, many historians agreed it was still not enough for the Soviets to pose a serious threat to Tokyo. As of 20 December 1945, 3,741 American lend-lease ships were given to the Soviets, 36 of which were capable of mounting an invasion of Japan. This <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> enough to pose a large threat to Japanese forces in the mainland. Given how the Soviets conducted in their invasions of southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands with limited U.S. Navy ships and landing craft, it was likely that Soviets would not have succeeded in taking entire Japanese-occupied territories, including Hokkaido.|$|E

25|$|On 18 August, Pravda {{published}} an extensive interview with Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev, {{chairman of a}} 26-member commission {{set up by the}} Congress of People's Deputies to investigate the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and its secret protocols. During the interview, Yakovlev admitted that the secret protocols were genuine. He condemned the protocols, but maintained that they had no impact on the incorporation of the Baltic states. Thus Moscow reversed its long-standing position that the secret protocols did not exist or were forgeries, but did not concede that events of 1940 constituted an occupation. It <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> enough to satisfy the Baltics and on 22 August, a commission of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR announced that the occupation in 1940 was {{a direct result of the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and therefore illegal. It was the first time that an official Soviet body challenged the legitimacy of the Soviet rule.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1861, the Russian {{corvette}} Posadnik (Посадник, 1856), captained by Nicolai Birilev, {{arrived in}} Tsushima {{island in the}} inlet of Ozaki, the captain demanding landing rights. This event triggered fear in the Japanese Shogunate, as the Russians had already attempted to breach Japan's isolation policy in the northern island of Hokkaido with the events involving Adam Laxman in 1792, the burning of villages there in 1806, and the events leading {{to the arrest of}} Vasilii Golovnin in 1811. At that time, only a few Japanese ports were open to foreign ships (Hakodate, Nagasaki, Yokohama), and Tsushima <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> one of them, thus suggesting unfriendly intentions {{on the part of the}} Russians. If taken over by the Russians, Tsushima could have become an effective base for further aggression. Japan received British help to support its policy. As tension rose, a second Russian ship arrived, and requests were made by the Russians to build a landing base and to receive supplies.|$|E

Etruria's finances were in deplorable state; the country was ruined by war, bad harvest and the cost to have to maintain the unpopular French troops stationed in Etruria, that only much later where replaced by Spanish troops sent by Charles IV. In 1802, Maria Luisa and her husband were invited to Spain to attend the double wedding of her brother Ferdinand with Maria Antonia of Naples, and of her youngest sister, Maria Isabel, with Francis I of Naples. With Etruria's financial and economic difficulties, Louis' health failing and Maria Luisa in an early state of pregnancy, going abroad <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> expedient and therefore Maria Luisa was reluctant to go, but under the pressure of her father and the French, they started the journey to her native country.|$|E

25|$|The {{dangers of}} Cokayne's {{political}} position {{must have been}} apparent to him, not least because of the fate of his close friend Ipstones, murdered while in London for the 1394 Parliament by Roger Swynnerton, a relative of Maud. Moreover, the murderer was pardoned in 1397 after an intervention by Baldwin Raddington, controller of the king's wardrobe. Cokayne <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> trusted by the king, Richard II, and the Court party: after his brief period of respectability, he received no commissions after 1393. The Ipstones property dispute had wider resonances in the competition between magnates in the region. The Peshales, Maud's in-laws were clients of the Earls of Stafford, as was Ipstones until 1381, when hostilities broke out between them. Gaunt had intervened to get Sir John Holland restored to favour after he murdered the son of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1386, bringing about a deterioration in {{relations between the two}} magnates. Stafford had great influence in his own county and his reach came very close to Cokayne's home territory around Dovedale. Cokayne faced the same toxic combination of local infamy, official indifference and magnate hostility that encompassed the death of Ipstones. Lancastrian power was much more dominant in Derbyshire than in Staffordshire, making Gaunt a realistic protector for its gentry.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{reservations}} about the self-contradictory sources, Eyton concluded that the foundation date lay between 1130 and 1138 and that {{the founder of the}} abbey “in all respects was the first William Fitz-Alan.” However, William FitzAlan's grant of the Preston Boats fish weir, around 1135, <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> a foundation grant: there was already a small but growing community when it was made. The Victoria County History account tends to give more weight than Eyton to the possibility of an earlier origin. Augustinian communities often began as small gatherings around a noted hermit before growing into established monasteries, or even small religious orders: the Abbey of Arrouaise in northern France, which had a Shropshire community at nearby Lilleshall Abbey, is an example. At Haughmond, the remains of a very modest early church were discovered beneath the floor of the later, more ambitious building, during the 1907 excavations: this may date back to the time of Prior Fulk or earlier. Despite these reservations and qualifications, the most recent account of William Fitz-Alan, in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, simply treats him as the founder of the abbey, and it was certainly he who placed it on a secure basis, even if he was not the originator.|$|E
25|$|The months {{following}} {{the acceptance of the}} Treaty saw a gradual progression to civil war. The split in Sinn Féin gradually deepened and the majority of the IRA hardened against accepting anything less than a full republic. Collins and de Valera tried desperately to find a middle course and formed a pact whereby Sinn Féin fought a General Election in June with a common slate of candidates. Despite this pact, the electorate voted heavily in favour of pro-Treaty candidates. On the day of the election, the draft Free State Constitution was published and rejected by the Anti-Treatyites as it <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> a republican document. Collins, forced to a decision, opted to maintain the Treaty position and the support of the British Government, and moved to suppress the Republican opposition that had seized the Four Courts in Dublin. The Civil War started on 28 June 1922, and the IRA was decisively defeated in the field over the following two months, being largely pinned back to Munster. In August 1922, both Griffith and Collins died in quick succession; the former of natural causes, the latter a few days later when ambushed by Republicans at Béal na Bláth. With de Valera now on the fringes as the nominal leader of the Anti-Treaty forces in the Civil War, the new dominion (which {{was in the process of}} being created but which would not legally come into being until December 1922) had lost all its most senior figures.|$|E

25|$|His ecumenical gifts were {{widespread}} and often exuberant. Commonly held land was given, along with {{exemption from taxes}} as well as relics. Christ Church was probably given rights at the important port of Sandwich as well as tax exemption, with confirmation in the placement of their charters on the altar, while it got the relics of St Ælfheah, at the displeasure {{of the people of}} London. Another see in the king's favour was Winchester, second only to the Canterbury see in terms of wealth. New Minster's Liber Vitae records Cnut as a benefactor of the monastery, and the Winchester Cross, with 500 marks of silver and 30 marks of gold, as well as relics of various saints was given to it. Old Minster was the recipient of a shrine for the relics of St Birinus and the probable confirmation of its privileges. The monastery at Evesham, with its Abbot Ælfweard purportedly a relative of the king through Ælfgifu the Lady (probably Ælfgifu of Northampton, rather than Queen Emma, also known as Ælfgifu), got the relics of St Wigstan. Such generosity towards his subjects, which his skalds called destroying treasure, was of course popular with the English. Yet {{it is important to remember}} that not all Englishmen were in his favour, and the burden of taxation was widely felt. His attitude towards London's see <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>not</b> benign. The monasteries at Ely and Glastonbury were apparently not on good terms either.|$|E
500|$|In March 1874, Baxter {{vetoed the}} Railroad Steel Bill, the {{centerpiece}} of the Radical Republican Reconstruction plan. The bill would have released the railroad companies from their debts to the state and created a tax to pay the interest on the bonds.

It is likely the Minstrels struck a deal with Brooks to support the railroad bonds, and within a month the political backers of Brooks and Baxter began to switch.
