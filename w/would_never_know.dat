25|$|ROC and American {{authorities}} {{reached an}} agreement in 1958 to create the 35th Squadron, nicknamed the Black Cat Squadron, composed of two U-2Cs in Taoyuan Air Base in northern Taiwan, at an isolated part of the air base. To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created {{under the cover of}} high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents. But instead of being under normal USAF control, the project was known as Project Razor, and was run directly by the CIA with USAF assistance. Each of the 35th Squadron's operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand. A further layer of security and secrecy was enforced by all U.S. military and CIA/government personnel stationed in Taoyuan assigned to Detachment H having been issued official documents and IDs with false names and cover titles as Lockheed employees/representatives in civilian clothes. The ROCAF personnel <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> their U.S. counterparts' real names and rank/titles, or which U.S. government agencies they were dealing with.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{had made}} no {{political}} bargains, his supporters had given many pledges upon his behalf. When Boss Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania, who rebuffed for a Cabinet position for his political support during the convention, heard that Harrison ascribed his narrow victory to Providence, Quay exclaimed that Harrison <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> [...] "how close a number of men were compelled to approach...the penitentiary to make him President." [...] Harrison {{was known as the}} Centennial President because his inauguration celebrated the centenary of the first inauguration of George Washington in 1789. In congressional elections, the Republicans increased their membership in the House of Representatives by nineteen seats.|$|E
500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." ...|$|E

500|$|Computer-generated imagery {{was used}} in much of [...] "Days Gone Bye", {{particularly}} when Rick encounters a legless walker. [...] "The woman was wearing basically blue stockings and then everything was cleaned out. There is an alarming amount of CGI in the pilot episode and in the whole show, and you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> it," [...] articulated Robert Kirkman. Kirkman felt that Stargate Studios, which was chosen by producers to edit the pilot episode, did a splendid job. He stated: [...] "There's a shot where Rick is riding off on the horse and his hat actually blew off, and they really liked that shot, and so they had Stargate go in and digitally put the hat back on his head." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnet {{was only}} briefly in New Hampshire during his short tenure, where unlike Massachusetts he was readily granted a salary {{for three years}} or the {{duration}} of his administration. [...] At {{the time of his}} appointment to the Massachusetts seat, the province had been governed {{for a number of years}} by Lieutenant Governor William Dummer, acting for Governor Samuel Shute. [...] Burnet made a hardnosed attempt to force the Massachusetts assembly to grant him a permanent salary. [...] Since the institution of the royal charter in 1692, the assembly had steadfastly resisted this, choosing instead to make periodic grants to the governor. [...] Local politicians found this an effective mechanism for influencing the governor to approve their policies, since the governor <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when the next grant would be made, or how large it would be. [...] The salary matter was one of many that had vexed Governor Shute during his time in the province. Dummer, a wealthy Massachusetts native, had been more conciliatory, only insisting that control of the provincial militia remain in his hands.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Joshua Safran {{initially}} {{wanted a}} [...] "straightforward action show" [...] {{different from his}} past work, which included the soapy dramas Gossip Girl and Smash. He revealed {{that he wanted to}} do something with a law enforcement theme such as a political thriller about the NYPD after the September 11 attacks. He based protagonist Alex Parrish, whose complex family history haunts her throughout the series, on a relative; Safran wove his own struggle to understand that family member into Alex's desire to learn the truth about her father. Safran said [...] "I have a family member who either is a pathological liar or has been involved with a government agency my whole life. I've always struggled with knowing that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard to somebody {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth. That struggle informed the character of Alex." [...] He called the series a sexy romance and a political thriller, adding [...] "It's like, what would Die Hard be if Die Hard was weekly and was also a soap".|$|E

500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, you can just go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. You would say {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

2500|$|McManaman's {{image of}} being a {{contract}} rebel and mercenary was exacerbated by his involvement in a year-long dispute between 1997 and 1998 with Umbro, his football boot sponsor. Umbro sued him for breach of contract for knowingly wearing Reebok branded boots in contravention of the deal, and deliberately [...] "blacking out" [...] their logo on his boots in protest. McManaman argued that his contract was unenforceable and an unlawful restraint of trade. McManaman claimed {{that he was being}} exploited. He hired the services of agent Simon Fuller to help free him from the sponsorship contract. The court initially ordered McManaman to fulfil his contract, plus an undertaking to pay Umbro's legal costs for launching contempt of court proceedings against him in 1997, which McManaman accepted and apologised for. A year on, however, McManaman continued to dishonour the deal. He finally won an out-of-court settlement in October 1998, freeing him to negotiate with other companies for what he regarded as remuneration appropriate to his status. The case, in addition to his Liverpool contract wrangles saw the media describe McManaman as the [...] "star performer in his own soap", though McManaman's Liverpool manager Roy Evans defended the player, stating, [...] "Macca is so laid-back you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> he was hurting inside. But he has been. Some of the criticisms have been so unfair. Typical of Macca, he's responded magnificently." ...|$|E

A Queensland based trainer of a similar black Labrador explosive detection dog stated that it was probably due to the breed's excellent character that Sarbi had most likely been looked after by locals while missing, ensuring her survival. Misha Schubert the political correspondent for The Age jokingly questioned the official account that Sarbi's whereabouts while she was missing <b>would</b> <b>never</b> be <b>known,</b> suggesting she had been undercover on a secret mission, or that she had been captured by the Taliban as a prisoner of war, or had simply preferred to remain Absent Without Leave (AWOL).|$|R
