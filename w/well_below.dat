All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water.

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are <b>well</b> <b>below</b> adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E

5|$|Methoxyflurane is an {{extremely}} potent and highly lipid-soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times.

Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at <b>well</b> <b>below</b> full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today.|$|E

40|$|We {{have made}} direct {{measurements}} of the intersubband lifetime in single GaAs quantum <b>wells</b> <b>below</b> the optical phonon energy at 36 meV, At low temperatures and excitations LO phonon emission is inhibited and acoustic phonon emission dominates; a sharp cross-over exists between the two regimes. Rate equation calculations have been performed for the single well samples with no fitting parameters and these agree well with experiment. The calculations have been extended to coupled quantum wells and we find that by careful tuning of the well widths the LO phonon rate can be tuned by up to an order of magnitude...|$|R

40|$|The exciton {{population}} {{in a higher}} subband of GaAs quantum <b>wells,</b> <b>below</b> the free carrier continuum, is studied by time-resolved luminescence spectroscopy. The lifetime of the exciton formed by an electron of the lowest subband and a heavy hole of the second subband is determined as 130 ± 20 ps, in agreement with theoretical estimations of intersubband scattering based on acoustic phonon emission. The exciton lifetime in the second heavy-hole subband is considerably longer than reported values of the recombination time in the lowest exciton state at k= 0. These findings lead to novel intersubband laser concepts based on excitons...|$|R

5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869.

Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds.
