Eastern Kingbirds primarily departed the breeding site in September, migrating to the Amazon Basin (Bolivia and Brazil), > 6, 400 km from their breeding site, then used a second wintering site in northwestern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) {{before returning to the}} breeding site in April. <b>Western</b> <b>Kingbirds</b> left Oklahoma in late July, migrating > 1, 400 km to northwestern Mexico, then to central Mexico and finally to Central America before returning to Oklahoma in April.

Timing of migration appears to be tightly linked to molt. Early departure of <b>Western</b> <b>Kingbirds</b> from the breeding site appears to be timed so that they molt in the Sonoran Desert region during the monsoon, whereas Scissor-tailed Flycatchers remain at their breeding site to complete molt in late summer, when insect prey are abundant.

40|$|Abstract. Natural and {{anthropogenic}} fire {{once played}} an important role in oak woodlands of California. Although lightning-ignited fires were infrequent, the California Indians used fire to modify oak woodland vegetation for at least 3, 000 yr. These high-frequency, low-intensity fires likely resulted in little mortality of mature oaks, low but continuous tree recruitment, an open understory, and a fine-grained mosaic of vegetation patches. Following settlement by Europeans in the mid- 1800 s, ranchers burned to reduce shrub cover and to increase grassland area and forage production; surface fires were common with average fire-return intervals of 8 – 15 yr. Fire suppression, begun in the 1940 s to 1950 s, led to increases in surface and crown fuels, invasion of woody vegetation in the understory, and increased tree density. In the absence of demonstrated fire effects on oak woodland birds, we used changes in vegetation structure expected to result from fire and fire suppression to predict the response of oak woodland birds to fire and fire suppression based on nesting habitat of 17 common oak woodland species breeding at the San Joaquin Experimental Range, Madera County, California. Our results suggest that populations of <b>Western</b> <b>Kingbirds</b> (Tyrannus verticalis), <b>Western</b> Bluebirds (Sialia mexicana), and Violet-green Swallows (Tachycineta thalassina), would increase in abundance following fire, because they consistently nested in habitat similar to that expected to result from frequent, low-intensity fire. The species predicted to respond negatively to changes resulting from fire differed among the variables examined. If fir...|$|R
50|$|Great horned owls are {{frequently}} mobbed by other birds. Most accipitrids will readily mob them, as will falcons. Hen harriers, northern goshawks, Cooper's hawks, Harris's hawks, red-tailed hawks, Swainson's hawks, ferruginous hawks, red-shouldered hawks, American kestrels, peregrine falcons, prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) and common ravens (Corvus corax) {{are among the}} reported species who have been recorded diving on great horned owls when they discover them. In Arizona and Texas, they may be mobbed by Mexican and western scrub jays (Aphelocoma wollweberi & californica) and <b>western</b> and Cassin's <b>kingbirds</b> (Tyrannus verticalis & vociferans). The most infamous nemesis of this owl, however, is the American crow, who seems to regard it with great scorn. Several incidences have been recorded of dozens or even hundreds of crows appearing to mob a great horned owl. Such daytime flights normally cover short distances; if the owl flies, it alights to the nearest secluded spot to escape its tormentors. If an owl alights on ground or on exposed branch or ledge, it may respond to swooping and stooping flights of corvids and raptors with threat display and raising of its wings.|$|R

40|$|The {{spring of}} 2001 {{will likely be}} remembered as the winter that wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t end, {{especially}} in central and western Nebraska. The last remnants of roadside snowbanks remained in the east until 10 April, but the last blizzard closed down the Panhandle on 21 - 22 April, and the last appreciable snowfall there was on 19 May. None of these dates represent late records, but are remarkably later than average for the past 10 - 15 years, and seemed especially burdensome following the long cold winter and the remarkably early spring the previous year. While I recognize the danger inherent in making generalizations when working with such a small sample size, I feel it worthwhile to comment on differences and similarities between the timing of the 2000 and 2001 nesting seasons. While only a few species allowed direct comparison by being found nesting again in the same location as last year, the following information is offered for what it 2 ̆ 7 s worth. It would have been interesting to compare data on more of the cavity nesters, but unfortunately, I did not locate any active nuthatch nests this year, nor take the time to search out more of the other cavity nesters. In the southern Panhandle, Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, <b>Western</b> and Eastern <b>Kingbirds,</b> Bluegray Gnatcatcher, Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s Oriole (and Red-winged Blackbird in the east), all appeared to be 2 - 3 weeks later in their breeding cycle than last year. By contrast, also in the Panhandle, Great Blue Heron, Great Homed Owl, Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpecker, Western Wood-Pewee, Lark Sparrow, and McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspur seemed {{to be on the same}} schedule as last year, as were American Crow, Common Grackle, and House Finch in the east. While it seems intuitive that some species would respond to the late spring by nesting later, why didn 2 ̆ 7 t some other species? How much of the difference in timing was actually due to the weather, and how much was due to the randomness of the small sample size or other variables? Obviously, it will take more years of data collection and a much larger sample size, one that includes all species, before generalizations can be made. Witnessing a blizzard disrupt breeding by Pinyon Jays and Canada Geese makes the reason for those delays pretty apparent. But what about kingbirds and gnatcatchers that were not even present yet? Were they later because of delayed plant growth and insect development? More study and many more records are needed before we can speak with certainty...|$|R

50|$|The {{historical}} lack {{of trees}} in the Great Plains acted {{as a barrier to}} the range expansion and recent increases in forests broke down this barrier. Increases in forest distribution along the Missouri River and its tributaries provided barred owls with sufficient foraging habitat, protection from the weather, and concealment from avian predators to allow barred owls to move westward. Decades later, increases in forests in the northern Great Plains allowed them to connect their eastern and western distributions across southern Canada. These increases in forests were caused by European-American settlers via their exclusion of fires historically set by Native Americans, by their suppression of accidental fires and by increased tree-planting; to a lesser degree this regional net forest increase was also caused by these settlers' extirpating bison (Bison bison) and by overhunting elk (Cervus elaphus), deer (Odocoileus spp.) and, in some areas, by extirpating beaver (Castor canadensis) and replacing native ungulates with livestock. Increase in trees in the Great Plains from fire suppression or tree planting is considered a main cause of the range expansions of many other species of birds including <b>western</b> <b>kingbird</b> (Tyrannus verticalis), eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchus).|$|E

The adult bird flew of the nest and remained about 200 meters away, in a small grove of trees. It took us about 35 minutes to set up our ladder, retrieve and band the owlets and return them to their nest. The adult bird called occasionally during this time. An interesting discovery was that of the carcass of an American Coot in the nest with the owlets.
