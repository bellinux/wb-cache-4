5|$|Despite Swedish {{hopes that}} the Dutch would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty by sending a 45-ship relief fleet. On October 7, 1658 the Dutch fleet set sail from Vlie. Two weeks later, on October 22, it {{anchored}} northwest of Helsingør, unable to proceed for six days due to wind conditions.

Antommarchi did not sign the {{official}} report. Napoleon's father had died of stomach cancer, although this was seemingly unknown {{at the time of the}} autopsy. Antommarchi found evidence of a stomach ulcer; this was the most convenient explanation for the British, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> criticism over their care of Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Vizzini was the undisputed head of the Mafia in Villalba. The war provided the mafiosi with new opportunities for self-enrichment when the Italian Army requisitioned horses and mules in Sicily for the cavalry and artillery. Vizzini came to {{an agreement with the}} Army Commission to delegate the responsibilities to him. He collected a poll tax on the animals whose owners <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> requisition. He was also the broker for animals that were rustled for the occasion, buying at a low price from the hustlers and selling at market prices to the Army.|$|E

Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E

5|$|Brashear is the {{youngest}} of three children born to an African-American father, Johnny Brashear, and French Canadian mother, Nicole Gauthier, in Bedford, Indiana. His father was an alcoholic who relentlessly abused his family, including slashing Donald with belts and electrical cords. On one occasion, when Donald was only six months old, he picked him up and hurled him through a window. Nicole, afraid that Johnny might kill her, left the family and returned to Canada. Later, {{she came back to}} take the children, but left Donald to live with his father for another four years, until Donald's paternal grandmother sent him to Canada. Donald's mother later stated that she left him behind because her future husband was prejudiced and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> having another mixed-race child in the house.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed into a different composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist {{who had worked with}} Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning of November 7, 1825, the very morning the {{legislature}} was to convene, Sharp was assassinated. Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that the motivation for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> any implication in the matter.|$|E
