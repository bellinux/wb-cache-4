500|$|For me, I {{was a new}} {{actor to}} Los Angeles, didn’t know the TV {{business}} very well so I was just excited to work and play a vampire. I had no clue <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do or how I {{was going to be}} scary. Until that is, they put the vampire makeup on me and I went into the trailer and smiled, which I thought was creepy. Joss always said he was intrigued that someone who looked like me and talked like me was like the scariest vampire ever. That's what he wanted, my sweet voice and demeanour until all of a sudden I'm just this vicious vampire." ...|$|E
500|$|Newman was, {{according}} to Nilsson, [...] "tired {{of the album}} when we were finished making it." [...] "For him it was just doing piano and voice... over and over." [...] Nilsson explained [...] "once I got the take down, I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to do with it}} later. He didn't." [...] Newman said of his experience that he [...] "was honored that a writer with Harry's talent would choose to do an album of someone else's songs." [...] Newman continued, [...] "he was such a great singer, a virtuoso singer, really, and he could do so many things as a vocalist that I couldn't do—like hold a note." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Joy Kilpatrick {{was cast}} as Dawson's photo double. Dawson {{described}} {{having a great}} working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, [...] "I {{was about to tell}} her <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be doing so she could give me the beats that I could react to properly" [...] and found her to be supportive and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe avoid relying on split screen. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} FutureSex/LoveSounds {{affected}} both Timberlake's and Timbaland's careers. For Timberlake, it further established {{his career as}} a solo artist. He comments, [...] "'SexyBack' was the point when people stopped asking me when *NSYNC were going to reunite and started asking <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do next." [...] Timberlake has also beefed up his fan base, gaining [...] "hipster" [...] fans {{in the wake of the}} album's success. Combining the international success of Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds and Nelly Furtado's Loose, demands for Timbaland's work reportedly surged. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Willman remarked that FutureSex/LoveSounds is [...] "like Timberlake's 'cred' record", although Chris Collis said Timbaland nearly stole the spotlight, sharing with Timberlake the [...] "star" [...] status.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} a tour to promote Evanescence's previous album, The Open Door, Amy Lee {{said that she}} [...] "just sort of took off and didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do next." [...] According to Lee, she was unsure at the time when—or if—Evanescence would continue. After {{taking a break from}} music for 18 months, she decided she wanted to work with the band members and it [...] "became more of a group project". Lee admitted to an identity crisis: [...] " [...] Fallen happened really fast, and it was just go, go, go for a couple years, and we went right into writing and wrote the next record. By the time we finished touring with The Open Door, I just needed to go, 'Who am I as an adult? During her hiatus, Lee began painting, attended concerts and museums and listened to folk and indie music.|$|E
500|$|In July 1995, Williams {{announced}} that he was leaving Take That, a boy band in which both he and Barlow took part. Following Williams's departure, the group disbanded until 2005 when Take That announced their reunion. After 13 years, in 2008, during the band's work on their fifth studio album, The Circus, Barlow and Williams {{met for the first time}} since the latter left the band. In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, [...] "'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go completely wrong. We had that big chat and the most amazing thing happened at the end of it. We both said sorry to each other and we both meant it and that was all we needed." [...] Barlow added [...] "I spent the last 15 years thinking about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say." ...|$|E

500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through".|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Beckinsale {{starred in}} the action horror film Van Helsing. She was [...] "so surprised" [...] to be {{appearing}} in her second action film in two years. [...] "It just seemed like a very good role." [...] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen {{at the time of}} filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: [...] "I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through." [...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{playing at}} a few gigs with Deftones in California, United States, Korn {{went back to the}} studio to start {{recording}} Life Is Peachy in April 1996. Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it has a kind of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand." [...] Korn's bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said, [...] "We wanted that same energy and inspiration we found up in the Malibu Hills." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> only <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to call myself," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{may tell}} you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to strike out on {{somewhat}} new lines." ...|$|R

Once again he asked the same question - Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to say? Now {{the people were}} prepared and so half of them answered [...] "yes" [...] while the other half replied [...] "no". So Nasreddin said Let the half who know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to say, tell it to the half who don't, and left.|$|R
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|NASCAR {{officials}} reviewed video {{evidence of}} Smith's pass of Stewart {{on the final}} lap with Smith and Dale Earnhardt, Inc. president Max Siegel in attendance, and declared the manoeuvre illegal; Smith was issued a pass-through penalty which dropped him from second to 18th. Smith argued that he was forced down below the yellow line: [...] "I was always told that the rule is if you get forced down there, then you are {{the winner of the}} race, and on the last lap, anything goes. That’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> with. I had a nose inside of him and I could have piled up the whole field." [...] Ninth-place finisher Johnson said there were rumors that drivers were allowed to go below the yellow line on the last lap of the previous day's Craftsman Truck Series race which were circulated {{on the day of the}} AMP Energy 500: [...] "I didn’t know what to really think about it, or understood it, or had seen it. It’s ironic how it played out today.” ...|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 1991, Henderson {{stole his}} 939th base to pass Lou Brock {{and became the}} sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say that day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He spoke from his heart." [...] Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E

500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{was born}} in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Doris (1932–2006), a homemaker, and Keith McCormack, an oil company {{financial}} analyst who died from cancer in 2008. [...] He is the oldest of three siblings. McCormack has Scottish ancestry. McCormack states while he was growing up, he was shy and did not play sports. McCormack attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Ontario. There, he enrolled in theatre and performed in high school productions of Godspell and Pippin, and decided {{to pursue a career}} in acting. McCormack recalls after performing in Godspell, his feelings towards becoming an actor solidified. [...] "...I remember after the first performance of that... I knew where to fit in. That was the beginning of my life as an actor. It changed me in that the concept of any other options disappeared. From that moment there was no question. I knew exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do. I'm lucky that way." [...] He admits that he never felt cool growing up. [...] "I was a bit of an outsider, but I discovered theatre very early on, which got me through." [...] He then transferred to Sir John A. Macdonald Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, where he went to school with David Furnish. He graduated in 1982.|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know if I was going to make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

500|$|In early 2005, Brian Welch {{announced}} that he would be quitting the band. In front of a crowd of 10,000, in three services at Valley Bible Fellowship in Bakersfield, California, said [...] "I was addicted to methamphetamines and tried everything ... rehab, stuff on the Internet, but nothing helped me kick it. I was trying on my own to quit and couldn't do it. I wanted to die. No one knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through. I could not quit. Church was my last shot. I would sit in church high [...] I would wonder why people would go up to the front after the service. But one day it was for me. I said , 'Show me how to quit.'" [...] In a 2013 interview with Rolling Stone, Head described his final moments in the band as very tense; [...] "the last year I was in the band, we were gonna kick out the bass player, Fieldy, and this guy's girlfriend couldn't be {{on this side of the}} stage because there were fights with another wife in the band. And obviously the drugs – it's no secret I was into the drugs, so crazy stuff, like having to finish our blow right before we got to the border because they were gonna come check to see if we had anything." [...] Following his departure from Korn, Welch released two autobiographies, a solo album, and formed a band, Love and Death, who released a debut album in 2013.|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Arthur Freed, the {{successful}} producer of musical films at Metro Goldwyn Mayer, bought the film rights to Best Foot Forward {{and made a}} film version starring Lucille Ball and William Gaxton. Donen moved to Hollywood to audition for the film and signed a one-year contract with MGM. In Best Foot Forward, Donen appeared as a chorus dancer and was made assistant choreographer by Charles Walters. At MGM Donen renewed his friendship with Kelly, who was quickly becoming a popular supporting actor in musicals. When Kelly was loaned to Columbia Pictures for a film with Rita Hayworth, he was offered the chance to choreograph his own dance numbers and asked Donen to assist. Kelly stated, [...] "Stanley needed a job. I needed someone to count for the cameraman, someone who knew the steps and could explain <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do so the shot was set up correctly." [...] Donen accepted and choreographed three dance sequences with Kelly in 1944's Cover Girl. Donen {{came up with the}} idea for the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence where Kelly's reflection jumps out of a shop window and dances with him. Director Charles Vidor insisted that the idea would never work, so Donen and Kelly directed the scene themselves and Donen spent over a year editing it. The film made Kelly a movie star and is considered by many film critics to be an important and innovative musical. Donen signed a one-year contract with Columbia and choreographed several films there, but returned to MGM the following year when Kelly wanted assistance on his next film.|$|E
