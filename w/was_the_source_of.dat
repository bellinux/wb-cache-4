5|$|Even the {{earliest}} anatomists {{were able to}} recognize the cerebellum by its distinctive appearance. Aristotle and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the parencephalis, {{as opposed to the}} encephalon or brain proper. Galen's extensive description is {{the earliest}} that survives. He speculated that the cerebellum <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> motor nerves.|$|E

50|$|However, this {{decision}} created another issue {{as to which}} river <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa. The Netherlands considered the Marowini (the eastern tributary river) to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa; the French considered the Litani, located further to <b>the</b> west, to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lawa.

5|$|The Red Sox {{suffered}} a collapse {{late in the}} 2011 season, losing their playoff positioning. A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett, Jon Lester, and John Lackey spent games they did not pitch in the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer; some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> this information, alienating him from his teammates.|$|E

5|$|Though {{similar in}} claims, both Hillhouse and Hersh's {{accounts}} of the bin Laden death appeared {{to be based on}} different sources which The Intercept concluded might corroborate the claims if their identities were known.

5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938.

The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> baptismal legitimacy and authenticity.

5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> dispute between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member {{a piece of land}} in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
5|$|During Team Canada's stay in Moscow, {{the team}}'s {{treatment}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> numerous complaints by the players. When leaving Sweden, {{the team was}} informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while the steaks were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E

5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary thermonuclear reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Lithuania was {{incorporated}} into the Russian Empire in 1795. It was occupied by Germany during World War I, and declared itself independent on 16 February 1918. The next two years were marked by the turbulence of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, delaying international recognition {{and the establishment of}} political institutions. The newly formed army fought the Bolsheviks, the Bermontians, and Poland. In October 1920, Poland annexed Vilnius, the historic and modern-day capital of Lithuania, and the surrounding area; this controversial action <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> ongoing tension between the two powers during the interwar period. Lithuania's second-largest city, Kaunas, was designated the interim capital of the state.|$|E

5|$|Q'anjob'al {{is spoken}} by 77,700 in Guatemala's Huehuetenango department, with small populations elsewhere. The region of Q'anjobalan {{speakers}} in Guatemala, due to genocidal policies during the Civil War and its {{close proximity to}} the Mexican border, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> a number of refugees. Thus there are now small Q'anjob'al, Jakaltek, and Awakatek populations in various locations in Mexico, the United States (such as Tuscarawas County, Ohio and Los Angeles, California), and, through postwar resettlement, other parts of Guatemala. Jakaltek (also known as Popti') is spoken by almost 100,000 in several municipalities of Huehuetenango. Another member of this branch is Akatek, with over 50,000 speakers in San Miguel Acatán and San Rafael La Independencia.|$|E
5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity. One reason for including this color final was, according to Tarkovsky, {{to give the}} viewer some rest and {{to allow him to}} detach himself from Rublev's life and to reflect. The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> all of Rublev's art.|$|E
5|$|The shorts were {{featured}} on the first three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show. By the fourth and last season of The Tracey Ullman Show the first season of the half-hour show was on the air. In the two first seasons the shorts were divided into three or four parts, but in the third season they were played as a single story. Tracey Ullman later filed a lawsuit, claiming that her show <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> The Simpsons success and therefore should receive {{a share of the}} show's profit.
