In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts.

5|$|Harrelson was the season's next {{significant}} casting choice, {{brought on}} to play Hart at McConaughey's request. Harrelson stated that he joined True Detective partly because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with certain {{people involved in the}} project, with whom he had previously collaborated in the 2012 HBO film Game Change. Michelle Monaghan agreed to play the season's female lead, Maggie, because she felt compelled by the direction of the plot and her character's story arc. Michael Potts and Tory Kittles completed the principal cast, playing detectives Maynard Gilbough and Thomas Papania, respectively. Major supporting roles in True Detective first season include Kevin Dunn as Major Ken Quesada, Alexandra Daddario as Lisa Tragnetti, and Brad Carter as Charlie Lange.|$|E

Unlike traditional comic editors who focus on coordinating schedules and pushing deadlines, Brothers only reviews the work and provides responses that help the team create better work with more internal consistency. Eric Trautman, who had previously edited two of Rucka's novels, was recruited to help with research, timelines, and design work. Lark <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with a European colorist to provide a look distinct from traditional American comics. Rucka suggested Santi Arcas, a colorist he had worked with in the past, and Lark particularly liked Arcas' skies and textures.|$|E

She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play On Golden Pond, specifically for her father and her. On Golden Pond, which also starred Katharine Hepburn, brought Henry Fonda his only Academy Award for Best Actor, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and could not leave home. He died five months later.|$|E

After Chopra had starred earlier in Nadiadwala's Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in 2004, both had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> together again, but nothing had materialised. Much later, Nadiadwala reached out to her to discuss a film he was developing with Anand and Kapoor. Chopra met Anand to discuss the script, but the project did not work out. Later when Nadiadwala approached her again with the script of Anjaana Anjaani, Chopra accepted the role. Manish Malhotra designed Chopra's clothes; Mamta Aanand designed Kapoor's. Salim Sulaiman composed the background score, while Rameshwar S. Bhagat edited the film.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head—similar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2—to finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask off-screen and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|Actor Ryo Ishibashi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Miike {{and agreed}} to the role. He commented that despite not being a great fan of horror films, he enjoyed scripts, {{such as that of}} Audition, that showcased human nature. Model Eihi Shiina was cast in the film as Asami. Shiina's career was {{primarily}} as a model and she only began acting after being offered a film role while she was on holidays. Shiina first learned about Miike through his film Blues Harp, which made her interested in meeting the director. When Shiina first met Miike, they began talking about her opinions on love and relationships. On their second meeting, Miike asked Shiina to play the part of Asami. Shiina thought that the opinions and feelings she expressed to Miike were the reason she was cast in the role, and she tried to play the role as naturally as she could without going over the top.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Adams Township High School, Verville took a {{correspondence}} course in electrical engineering. He moved to Detroit, Michigan {{at the age}} of twenty, and from 1910 to 1913 he worked in the electrical departments of the Detroit Edison Company, Ford Motor Company, and Hudson Motor Car Company. By 1913, Verville had made his mind up that he wanted to learn to fly. William Edmund Scripps, the editor and owner of The Detroit News, introduced Verville to Glenn Curtiss in July 1913. Curtiss encouraged Verville to apply for his Spring 1914 flight school. Instead, Verville went to Hammondsport, New York in February 1914, where Curtiss Aeroplane Company was located, and told Curtiss he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> as an apprentice in his drafting and engineering shop. Curtiss agreed and this began Verville's aviation career.|$|E
