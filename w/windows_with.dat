5|$|Specialized {{applications}} include use in laboratories as containment for high-pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, {{and limited}} use in specialized <b>windows.</b> <b>With</b> the continuing advances {{being made in}} the production of synthetic diamonds, future applications are becoming feasible. The high thermal conductivity of diamond makes it suitable as a heat sink for integrated circuits in electronics.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the mayoral}} inaugurations, the {{marketplace}} was also the setting for other public events, particularly mourning processions on the deaths of monarchs, coronation celebrations, royal birthdays and celebrations of military victories. Firework displays and bonfires would be held on these occasions, accompanied by the local militia firing volleys and the ringing of the bells of the surrounding churches, while local residents and shopkeepers would illuminate their <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> lit candles. Often, particularly in the 18thcentury, temporary triumphal arches would be erected beside the Guildhall. Free beer would traditionally be distributed at these events, which would on occasion degenerate into drunken disorder.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 1960s <b>window</b> <b>with</b> {{its design}} scratched onto the glass {{was destroyed by}} vandals in the late 1990s and was replaced <b>with</b> a new <b>window</b> <b>with</b> the image acid-etched into the glass and designed by the then Churchwarden Glenn Christodoulou.|$|R
5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between each pair of columns are large round-headed <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in Gabon were French.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game developed {{and published by}} LucasArts in 1998 for Microsoft <b>Windows,</b> <b>with</b> Tim Schafer as the game's project leader. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use 3D computer graphics overlaid on pre-rendered, static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in order to progress.|$|E

5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
5|$|Milsom street leads up hill, {{from the}} Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, {{which was founded}} in 1738 as The Mineral Water Hospital, to The Paragon which overlooks the Walcot area. The Paragon was {{designed}} by Thomas Warr Attwood. Each building has matching doors and <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> central pediments and flat entablatures either side of the 1st floor windows and Tuscan pilasters and pediments to the doorways. Numbers 22 to 37 continue the theme from numbers 1 to 21 and were completed in 1775 by Joseph Axford, a local mason. Numbers 28 to 32 were damaged by bombing during World War II but have since been restored.|$|E
5|$|On 12 September 2007, Microsoft {{announced}} {{they were planning}} on releasing Ikaruga on Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360. It was released on 9 April 2008, and included new features such as leaderboards, achievements, {{and the ability to}} record and replay playthroughs. Treasure later released Ikaruga on the arcade distribution platform, NESiCAxLive, on 8 August 2013. In October 2013, Treasure placed the title into the Steam Greenlight process to bring the game (based on the Xbox 360 version) to Microsoft <b>Windows,</b> <b>with</b> hopes to bring their other titles to the platform later. The game was released on Steam on 18 February 2014.|$|E

5|$|On {{the main}} (north) facade, {{there is a}} two-bay-wide {{projection}} with a hip roof and two wall dormers. There is a large roof dormer on the side (east) facade which provides exterior access to the hayloft. Other fenestration includes small square <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> fixed sashes near the eaves on all facades and four double-hung windows, two per level, in the main facade's pavilion. Each end facade has a set of large double wood carriage doors. The complex now serves as a storage and maintenance facility for the club's golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Placed symmetrically in {{the north}} and south sides of the church are two nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden windows. Between the two windows on the church's north {{elevation}} is an exterior concrete block chimney. The layout of the east-facing rear elevation of the church is also symmetrical, and features three nine-over-six double-hung sash wooden <b>windows,</b> <b>with</b> the center window placed above and between the other two windows. The church's windows have been repaired using materials consistent with original construction.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{alterations}} proved {{successful in}} stabilising {{the tower and}} in serving {{the needs of the}} church, and the church remained little changed for the next 130years; the most notable alterations during this period were the replacement of the glass in the chancel's two leper <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> stained glass images of Pre-Raphaelite knights by Edward Burne-Jones as a memorial to a young officer killed during the Boer War, and the painting of a mural over the chancel arch by John Ward depicting the events of Holy Week in modern dress and set in the Chilterns. In 1951 the church was Grade A listed.|$|E

5|$|The Apple House, a small red-brick {{building}} {{to the west of}} the stables quadrangle, also dates from around 1636, and can be seen in a painting of Crewe Hall from around 1710. Originally a dovecote, it is used as a storehouse. Built on an octagonal plan with two storeys, it has two oval <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> stone surrounds. The lower entrance has a stone semicircular arch; a second doorway is located at first-floor height. The pyramidal tiled roof is topped by a glazed lantern with a lead cap. The building is listed at grade II.|$|E
5|$|The fantail was made. Some of {{the small}} gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter {{included}} repairs to the brickwork and <b>windows,</b> <b>with</b> only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.|$|E
5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on <b>windows,</b> <b>with</b> the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated with a light grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E

5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised exemplar of the garden suburb and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and dormer <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. An oval path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens are planted in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new <b>windows</b> <b>with</b> narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E
