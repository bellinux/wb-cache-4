Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear {{to be focused on}} the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Angels Cry" [...] {{is about}} {{maintaining}} {{hope that a}} fading relationship can be salvaged because true love only happens once. Carey sings [...] "I’m willing to live and die for our love/Baby <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> that shine." [...] However, the lyrics [...] "Super natural love conquers all" [...] could also be interpreted as feeling God's love. Adam Holz of Plugged In thought that the lyrics were [...] "depressing," [...] while Lauren Murphy of Entertainment IE felt that the lyrics [...] "When you and I say goodbye, I felt the angels cry" [...] were too sentimental. Although Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times thought that the song had a [...] "sad" [...] tone, she praised its production. Bill Lamb of About.com placed [...] "Angels Cry" [...] in his list of the album's best tracks. Michael Cragg of musicOMH was critical of the song, writing {{that it is a}} [...] "limp ballad" [...] which he thought was trying too hard at recreating some of Carey's previous material, and concluded by writing that it [...] "ultimately ends up making you want to hear the original version more than anything". A reviewer for DJ Booth commented that the song sounded as thought it could have been released in 1994.|$|E

5000|$|.....I {{do think}} {{there have been some}} librarians who had a {{different}} idea of the direction libraries should go. Patricia Battin is one example. In my opinion, she hugely inflated a crisis in order to extract what was essentially disaster relief money from Congress. I don't think she acted with ill intentions, it's just that {{what she wanted to do}} resulted in the destruction of things libraries ought to be hanging onto...there were people who acted irresponsibly because they were caught up in the excitement of revolutionizing the distribution of information. And as a result things that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>get</b> <b>back</b> were destroyed." [...] (p. 103) ...|$|R

Then if we dashed forward to the place where they had been, they would pour a volley into us and finish us at once; for if they were lying twenty yards away they ought certainly to hit every one of us, as they have eight shots to fire. At present I have no doubt they are talking, and I think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to where we piled up the saddles and bales. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> defend ourselves better there than here. <b>We</b> <b>can</b> then talk matters over quietly." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} Edwin Hubble {{announced}} a linear relationship between distances and redshifts of external galaxies, the accepted value of his constant dropped by (or the Universe expanded and aged by) a factor of 5 to 10. More recently, different groups, often using nearly the same data, have passionately defended distance scales that differ by about a factor of two. The sections of this review explore (1) the history of extragalactic distance scales, (2) {{the relationships between the}} Hubble constant, H 0, and other cosmological parameters, (3) types of distance indicators, (4) ways of measuring distances in practice, (5) values of H 0 reported recently {{on the basis of these}} methods, (6) the continuing discrepancies between the 'long' and 'short' distance scales, and (7) prospects for future convergence on a single, global value of H, so that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>get</b> <b>back</b> to doing other things. The units of the Hubble constant are km s - 1 Mpc - 1 (or reciprocal time), and no one now strongly favors any value outside the range 40 - 90 km s - 1 Mpc - 1 (time scales of 11 - 25 Gyr) ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{seemed to}} him that the gentle shapes wavered in his vehement breath, and he could not realize that in their alien realm they could not have heard a word he uttered. They {{remained}} dreamily silent, as if he had not spoken, and then the heroine said: [...] "Perhaps we shall have to wait for a new school of short-story writers before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> into the magazines.

He will find that we easily and probably end well, and that we're a consolation and refuge for readers, who can take heart from our happy dénouements, when they see a family resemblance in us, and can reasonably hope that if they follow our examples they will share our blessings. Authors can't really enjoy themselves in the company of those degenerates, as I call them. They're mostly as young and right-principled and well-behaved as ourselves, and, if they could get to know us, we should be the best of friends. They would realize that there was plenty of harmless fun, as well as love, in the world, and that there was lots of good-luck." ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 18). Firesale is a feature-length narrative screenplay {{that follows}} a couple`s crime spree while driving across the country. The script manipulates gender archetypes established in {{films of the}} same genre in which the female character is a damsel in distress or a mere passenger being led astray. In Firesale, the woman has the keys and she is the driver. Jolene teaches Rome, we do not burn bridges so we aren`t followed, but so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> never <b>get</b> <b>back.</b> This principle proves more difficult in the digital age of social networking where we geotag ourselves and monitor each other constantly. Through the tutelage of Jolene, Rome learns how {{to gain access to}} the "private" lives of their victims via social networks and how to use that information to rob them. This thesis report will explore the conventions of the heist and con artist film subgenres, and consider ways in which these conventional screenplays subverts and transforms them in the context of the digital era of social media. Additionally, I will be comparing and contrasting relevant films to Firesale including Bonnie & Clyde, Badlands, Thelma & Louise and True Romance...|$|R

The presentation will be a dialogue between Bruno Kaufmann and Christophe Premat about the modern concepts of Rousseau´s works. Rousseau referred to provinces where democratic tools were experienced such as Corsica or Poland. The first part of the presentation will sketch a theoretical background of Rousseau´s thought whereas the second part will introduce the hidden heritage of Rousseau by comparing his views on direct democratic tools with modern political systems.

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans. Upon Johnson's transfer, team manager Adrian Heath said: [...] "I think it's {{fair to say}} that Eddie has lost his way recently and I hope <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> him <b>back</b> on the right path to where he is again one of the bright young players in English football." [...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|R
