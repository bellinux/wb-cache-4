5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage). Later they were realized to pertain to the much younger La Colonia Formation, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (Late Cretaceous, Lower Maastrichtian stage). Thus, Carnotaurus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.|$|E
5|$|Tendulkar {{took the}} fewest innings (259) while Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene took the most innings {{to achieve the}} feat (333).

Rahul Dravid—the third Indian to reach the milestone after Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly—is the fastest in terms of time span, taking 10 years and 317 days. Brian Lara's time span of 16 years and 17 days is the slowest among all. As of August 2016, Tendulkar leads the list with 18,426 runs, followed by Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, who scored 14,234.

Drawing {{from a wide range of}} inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{official}} {{end of the}} Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November30, the dates of October31 and November15 have also historically marked {{the official}} end date for the hurricane season. December, the only {{month of the year}} after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years– the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006. No storms have been recorded to exceed Category1 hurricane intensity in December. In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category4 intensity on November17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category4 hurricane, though this was well within the bounds of the hurricane season. Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category5 hurricane ever documented, though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date. Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category1 intensity.|$|E

5|$|A {{husband and}} wife who had lost their son {{as a result of}} the war offered {{themselves}} as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Erin was the longest-lived {{hurricane}} in the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. The sixth tropical depression, fifth tropical storm, {{and first}} hurricane, Erin developed from a tropical wave on September 1. After strengthening to a 60mph (95km/h) tropical storm {{as it moved}} to the west-northwest, wind shear weakened Erin and caused it to dissipate on September 5. The remnants re-organized into a tropical depression the next day, and Erin strengthened into a hurricane on September 9 while moving northwestward. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> date for the first hurricane of the season since Hurricane Diana on September 10, 1984. Erin quickly intensified and reached peak winds of 120mph (195km/h) later on September 9. At its closest approach, Erin passed 105miles (170km) east-northeast of Bermuda near peak intensity, and subsequently weakened as it turned to the east. A trough turned Erin to the northeast, and after passing just east of Cape Race, Newfoundland it became extratropical on September 15. The extratropical remnant continued northeastward and lost its identity near Greenland on September 17.|$|E
5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In {{the two decades}} before World War II, the quest to break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: the Liberty engine, Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the engine types used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|E

5|$|On {{the weekend}} series of April 20–22, 2012, the Red Sox celebrated the 100th anniversary of Fenway Park against the Yankees, who they played {{to open up}} the park. Both teams wore their 1912 uniforms on April 20, which the Yankees won 6-2. The Yankees came back from down, 9–0, to win, 15–9, the next day, the largest deficit they have ever overcame. They won the season series 13–5, their best record against the Red Sox since 2001, when they also went 13–5 against them, and swept the final three-game series of the season at Yankee Stadium to clinch the AL East while the Red Sox {{finished}} last in the division {{for the first time since}} 1992 with their worst record since 1965. Valentine was fired soon after. Later in 2012, the Yankees acquired 2004 ALCS Game 7 winner Derek Lowe.
