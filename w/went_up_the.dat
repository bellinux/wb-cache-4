5|$|John Mordan {{settled on}} Little Fishing Creek in Mount Pleasant Township in the 1790s. He also {{built the first}} sawmill in Mount Pleasant Township on Little Fishing Creek. When {{numerous}} other settlers arrived {{in the vicinity of}} Mordan's mill, the area became known as Mordansville. There was also once an obscure gristmill on an island on the creek. The Catawissa Railroad historically <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley of the creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the brothel was {{expanded}} again. A one-story structure {{was added to}} the building, increasing the number of cribs by eight; four of the added cribs opened directly onto Pleasant Alley, by that time known as Venus Alley. When copper prices <b>went</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> more than 14,000 miners in the city experienced a pay-rise of twenty-five cents and injected an additional $6,000 into Butte's economy. The Dumas also experienced an upswing in patronage. As a result of the added patronage, the brothel added five partitions and a staircase in 1916, and the ground floor, once a grand parlor, was partitioned into cribs.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, {{it soon became}} clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chain of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E

We can leave <b>the</b> Mediterranean and <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Rhone to Lyons, there enter the Saone, cross from the Saone to the Maine through the Canal de Bourgogne, and from the Marne enter the Seine and go out the Seine at Havre. When we cross the Atlantic to the United States, we can <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Hudson, pass through the Erie Canal, cross the Great Lakes, leave Lake Michigan at Chicago, gain the Mississippi by way of the Illinois River and the connecting canal, and go down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. And then there are the great rivers of South America. We'll know something about geography when we get back to California.|$|R

5|$|On September 8, 1913, the Army and Navy Union {{began its}} sixteenth {{biennial}} national encampment convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Some {{of the delegates}} took a river steamer trip {{the next day and}} <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Delaware River from the Arch street wharf to Port Richmond. They were shown various piers and shipbuilding yards and stopped at League Island. Colonel H. Ogden Lake was presented as the next commander of the national organization, since Commander Downs retired from the position. There were about a thousand delegates that attended this convention.|$|E
5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' ripped the mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E

5|$|Johnson <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{track on}} lap 52, but regained {{control of his}} car. Six laps later, after the leaders ran single file, Kenseth {{received}} help from Johnson while running on the outside line {{to prepare for a}} race winning slingshot. Kenseth slid underneath teammate Biffle as they started the final lap, as Biffle attempted to block Kenseth. Kenseth maintained the lead and crossed the finish line on lap 60 to win the race, with Smith in second and Johnson third. Sadler and Biffle rounded out the top five finishers. Blaney and Nemechek earned the second pair of transfer spots to qualify for the Daytona 500. Bayne, Tony Raines and David Stremme secured qualification for the Daytona 500 based on their lap times in the qualifier, with Terry Labonte using a champion's provisional to qualify. The following six drivers failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 because they did not finish high enough in their respective Duels or turn a fast-enough qualifying lap: Waltrip, Richardson, Bill Elliott, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace and J.J. Yeley. The second race had a total of five lead changes among four different drivers and no cautions were shown. Biffle's total of 40 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Kenseth led two times for a total of ten laps.|$|E
5|$|The Tar Heels' {{began to}} strain Kansas' defense with several players making {{perimeter}} shots, and {{when combined with}} Kansas' inability to convert from the field, this allowed the Tar Heels to jump out to a 114 lead. This led to Harp changing Kansas' defensive formation to a 23 zone, with Chamberlain under the basket. Rosenbluth — who was now relatively unguarded when compared to Kansas' previous formation — made a contested seventeen foot jumper. Kansas retaliated by giving the ball to Chamberlain who was subsequently fouled as he went up for a shot. He went to the free throw line and made one of two. As Kansas <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> floor coach Harp ordered his squad to revert to their original boxandone. Carolina's Kearns made a jumper from the floor after pump faking to lose a defender, which brought the score to 157 in favor of Carolina. Kansas came up the floor and missed their shot, but Chamberlain grabbed the rebound and was then fouled in air. He went to the line for a one–and–one and missed the first shot, while Rosenbluth caught the rebound.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, August 21, a US patrol of two platoons of {{infantry}} and M26 Pershing tanks <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{road toward the}} North Korean positions. White flags had appeared {{in front of the}} American line, and civilians in the area said many North Koreans wanted to surrender. The US patrol's mission was to investigate this situation and to form an estimate of North Koreans losses. The patrol advanced about , engaging small North Korean groups and receiving some artillery fire. On its way it destroyed five disabled North Korean tanks with thermite grenades. The patrol also found a 37mm anti-tank gun, two SU-76 self-propelled guns, and a 120mm mortar among the destroyed North Korean equipment, as well as recognizing a large number of North Korean dead. At the point of farthest advance, the patrol found and destroyed an abandoned T-34 tank in a village schoolhouse courtyard.|$|E

5|$|The race {{started at}} 4:48p.m.; Kyle Busch {{maintained}} his pole position advantage {{heading into the}} first corner and led the field on the first lap. Carpentier <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> track on the same lap but avoided hitting the barriers, while Reutimann did the same and scraped the outside wall, causing right-rear damage to his car. He was black-flagged by NASCAR because debris was dangling from his vehicle. Reutimann's right-rear tire exploded while entering the pit road on lap five but no debris was left on the track. On lap eight, Bowyer hit the wall, causing Kahne to drive down the track. He also made contact with Jamie McMurray, who slid through the infield frontstretch grass, causing the first caution flag {{and the appearance of}} the pace car. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops for tires, and eighteen drivers remained on the track.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Fort Peter {{took place}} on the Georgia side of the St. Marys River. After {{capturing}} the fort and St marys, British forces <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river. In all, they captured two American gunboats and 12 merchantmen, including Countess of Harcourt.|$|E
25|$|While {{the other}} two Union XIX Corps {{divisions}} under Nathaniel Prentice Banks were comprising the expedition into west Louisiana crossed Berwick Bay towards Fort Bisland, Brigadier General Cuvier Grover's division <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Atchafalaya River into Grand Lake, where they could either block a Confederate retreat, or force a retreat if the Confederates stayed and fought at Fort Bisland. The battle occurred {{two days after the}} Battle of Fort Bisland.|$|E

They left Srednekolmysk cutting west overland on an old Government trail through flat, forested country dotted by lakes.

25|$|The Munsee and Mahican {{tribes of}} Native Americans {{indigenous}} to the Hudson Valley {{did not live}} in the mountains, but settled heavily in the valley below. They <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Escarpment only to hunt or start fires to nurture hunting grounds and provide defensive barriers against other tribes, or to follow trails to other communities {{on the far side}} of the mountains. While nothing has been recorded from the early years of contact with European settlers of what role the mountains above them played in their religious beliefs, it is very likely that they did, given their animistic traditions.|$|E
25|$|Yang Jisheng, {{a long-time}} {{communist}} party member and {{a reporter for}} the official Chinese news agency Xinhua, puts the blame squarely on Maoist policies and the political system of totalitarianism, such as diverting agricultural workers to steel production instead of growing crops, and exporting grain at the same time. During the course of his research, Yang uncovered that some 22 million tons of grain was held in public granaries {{at the height of the}} famine, reports of the starvation <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> bureaucracy only to be ignored by top officials, and the authorities ordered that statistics be destroyed in regions where population decline became evident.|$|E
