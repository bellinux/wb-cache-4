500|$|Some {{of those}} Hope met in Morris' band were also {{interested}} in jazz. One, saxophonist Johnny Griffin, recalled a group of musicians, including Hope, who practiced and learned together in New York {{in the days of}} late-1940s bebop: [...] "We'd go to Monk's house in Harlem or to Elmo's house in the Bronx, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> a lot of playing. I played piano a bit, too, so I could hear what they were all doing harmonically. But if something stumped me, I'd ask and Elmo would spell out harmonies. We'd play Dizzy 's tunes or Charlie Parker's." ...|$|E

"Smile" [...] {{received}} its own answer song when rapper Example recorded a track called [...] "Vile" [...] in 2006, from We Didn't Invent the Remix, with tongue-in-cheek lyrics written from the boyfriend's perspective.

We didn't really think it was pioneering, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> what rappers did before us was doing on tapes. When {{a lot of the}} old guys, like Kool Moe Dee, The Treacherous Three, and Grandmaster Flash, got in the studio, they never put their greatness on records. Me and Run and Jay would listen ... and we'd say, 'They didn't do that shit last night in the Bronx!' ... So we said that we weren't going to be fake. We ain't gonna wear no costumes.

500|$|The sleeve artwork for Achtung Baby was {{designed}} by Steve Averill, who had created the majority of U2's album covers, along with Shaughn McGrath. To parallel the band's change in musical direction, Averill and McGrath devised sleeve concepts that used multiple colour images to contrast with {{the seriousness of the}} individual, mostly monochromatic images from previous U2 album sleeves. Rough sketches and designs were created early during the recording sessions, and some experimental designs were conceived to closely resemble, as Averill put it, [...] "dance-music oriented sleeves. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> them to show how extreme we could go and then everyone came back to levels that they were happy with. But if we hadn't gone to these extremes {{it may not have been}} the cover it is now." ...|$|E
500|$|Debbi Peterson {{explained}} {{in an interview}} with MTV UK in 1989 about why Prince gave them the song: [...] " [...] really liked our first album. He liked the song 'Hero Takes a Fall', which is a great compliment, because we liked his music. He contacted us, and said, 'I've got a couple of songs for you. I'd like to know if you're interested,' and of course we were. One of the songs Prince brought to the group was 'Manic Monday', written under the pseudonym of Christopher." [...] Peterson talked about the evolution of what Prince brought them: [...] "It was a Banglefication of a Prince arrangement. He had a demo, that was very specifically him. It was a good song, but we didn't record it like 'This is our first hit single! Oh my God! I can feel it in my veins!' <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> the song, and the album, and then sat back and thought about it." ...|$|E

500|$|Of his {{approach}} to directing the film, Lane explains, [...] "Thunderbirds Are Go was done like an episode but on a bigger scale. Whereas we would think {{that it might be}} nice to do a particular shot on the series but couldn't afford to, with Thunderbirds Are Go <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> it because we had the money." [...] For the Swinging Star hall sequence, all the visual elements except Alan and Lady Penelope are displayed in black and white, with background characters appearing in the form of enlarged still photographs. On the surrealism of the Swinging Star scenes, aspects of which include pink space clouds made of dry ice and a giant guitar on which Cliff Richard and The Shadows perform part of [...] "Shooting Star", Anderson explains that the production team [...] "recreated a Busby Berkeley sequence", and that the appearance of puppet versions of real-life celebrities boosted the publicity value of the film.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Hetfield {{stated that}} the album was written with [...] "a lot of passion". He said, [...] "There's two years of {{condensed}} emotion in this. We've gone {{through a lot of}} personal changes, struggles, epiphanies, it's deep. It's so deep lyrically and musically. [...] is just the best that it can be from us right now." [...] The band purposely wanted a raw sound on the album so that Rock did not polish the sound while mixing. The band desired the raw sound because of the depth of the emotion they felt {{and did not want to}} [...] "mess with it". Rock commented, [...] "I wanted to do something to shake up radio and the way everything else sounds. To me, this album sounds like four guys in a garage getting together and writing rock songs. There was really no time to get amazing performances out of James. We liked the raw performances. And we didn't do what everyone does and what I've been guilty of for a long time, which is tuning vocals. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> it, boom, and that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone {{looked at me like}} I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} in April 2008 {{that all of the}} original cast (except Kaya Scodelario and Lisa Backwell) would be replaced for series 3. Elsley said: [...] "There are risks associated with dumping a cast, but <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> it. There was some disquiet at the channel, but then they told us just to go with it." [...] Speaking at Broadcast's television drama conference, he also confirmed the show would stick to its pattern of introducing college-age characters, moving them on in the next series, then letting them go. [...] "The first year is about getting to know the kids, and the second gives us the advantage of being able to explore their psyches a little more," [...] said Elsley. Brittain said that the new cast would be quite different from the original characters, although people may still spot some similarities. Open auditions for the second generation of cast members were held in Bristol, which attracted 1,500 16- to 18-year-olds, followed by a further two days of auditions in London.|$|E
2500|$|The Doors were {{notorious for}} their {{appearance}} on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer Jim Morrison change the lyrics to their hit single [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by altering the line, [...] "Girl, we couldn't get much higher", before the band performed the song live on September 17, 1967. However, Morrison sang the original line, and on live television with no delay, CBS was powerless to stop it. They were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek, the band was told, [...] "Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again." [...] Morrison replied with glee, [...] "Hey man, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> the Sullivan show."—at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success. Manzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He {{has said that the}} band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident was re-enacted in the 1991 biographical film, The Doors.|$|E

5000|$|Booth {{said that}} he is [...] "pleased" [...] that his {{character}} is involved in some of the soap's biggest dramas. He said to PA: [...] "It's a drama! And from an acting perspective it's really good because we get some really gritty storylines, so from a personal point of view I really enjoy what they throw at us." [...] Speaking of the upcoming British Soap Awards, he added: [...] "It's how the votes go. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> the best <b>we</b> can and if people are going to vote for the storylines and for the people, great.

We were engaged to each other, Frank and I; but {{then one day}} father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn't hear of our {{engagement}} lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank {{said that he would}} go and make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting, that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>did</b> it right there; and then Frank went off to seek his fortune, and I went back to pa.|$|E
