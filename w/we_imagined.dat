Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change. We all {{want to be in the}} right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what <b>we</b> <b>imagined</b> it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Burke and Tim Alexander {{were the}} visual effects {{supervisors}} for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, [...] "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than <b>we</b> <b>imagined</b> that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of {{not making this}} into a zombie movie, so we were constantly {{trying to figure out}} how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement – they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style." [...] He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.|$|E

60|$|In {{the morning}} {{it was not}} long before we {{discovered}} the source of the hideous uproar which had aroused us in the night. The iguanodon glade was the scene of a horrible butchery. From the pools of blood and the enormous lumps of flesh scattered in every direction over the green sward <b>we</b> <b>imagined</b> at first that a number of animals had been killed, but on examining the remains more closely we discovered that all this carnage came from one of these unwieldy monsters, which had been literally torn to pieces by some creature not larger, perhaps, but far more ferocious, than itself.|$|E

At first it was tacitly agreed to ignore this fact, and we {{made the most of}} the charming locality, with its rare watercourse that lost itself in tangled depths of manzanita and alder, its laurel-choked pass, its flower-strewn hillside, and its summit crested with rocking pines.|$|E

60|$|Well, {{notwithstanding}} this, we ventured; for, to {{men that}} had passed such wild places as we had done, nothing could seem too desperate to undertake. We ventured, I say, and the rather because we saw very high mountains in our way at a great distance, and <b>we</b> <b>imagined,</b> wherever there were mountains there would be springs and rivers; where rivers there would be trees and grass; where trees and grass there would be cattle; and where cattle, some kind of inhabitants. At last, in consequence of this speculative philosophy, we entered this waste, having a great heap of roots and plants for our bread, such as the Indians gave us, a very little flesh or salt, and but a little water.|$|E

60|$|Anything stranger, {{and indeed}} more fantastic {{than the general}} effect of this scene, lit by the bright {{moonlight}} and set in that wild arena, it was never my lot to witness. The red-haired, half-naked men and women, the gigantic priest, the mystical white cat, that, gripping his scalp with its claws, waved its tail and seemed to take {{a part in the}} performance; the unholy chant and its volleying chorus, all helped to make it extraordinarily impressive. This struck us the more, perhaps, because at the time we could not in the least guess its significance, though <b>we</b> <b>imagined</b> that it must be preliminary to some sacrifice or offering. It was like the fragment of a nightmare preserved by the awakened senses in all its mad, meaningless reality.|$|E

60|$|We were {{embarked}} on a strange river, in a strange boat, and bound for a strange city. To us Westerners a halo of romance, of unreality, hung over New Orleans.

It was most fitting that such a place should be the seat of dark intrigues against material progress, and this notion lent added zest to my errand thither.
