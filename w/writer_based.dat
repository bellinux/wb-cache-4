5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 as {{the year of the}} crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the <b>writer,</b> <b>based</b> on the fact that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 as the year of the crusade and 1156 as the year of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E

2500|$|Donald Trump {{initially}} {{attempted to}} produce a television series titled Trump Tower {{which would have been}} modeled after soap operas Dallas, Dynasty, and Upstairs, Downstairs. MVP Entertainment production company employee Bob Frederick worked with Trump and they contracted with a <b>writer</b> <b>based</b> on Los Angeles, California to write the plot of the potential television series. Trump pitched the idea to television networks in earnest during the period of the 1990s. Trump convinced Showtime Networks to create a television pilot episode, which did not further develop into a full television series. Trump received payment for television rights to the series at this point in time. After this setback, Trump next took his Trump Tower television show pitch in 2008 to the television network Lifetime. Trump was slated to be the narrator of the Lifetime version of the Trump Tower television series. The novel initially attributed to Trump, carried the same title and basic plot outline as his previously pitched television series.|$|E
