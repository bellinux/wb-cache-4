Amid negotiations over that issue, Arnold wrote out a letter of resignation on July 11, the same day that word arrived in Philadelphia, that Fort Ticonderoga had fallen to the British.

On 29 October 1762 at the Battle of Freiberg, the last great battle of the Seven Years' War, he could not participate as planned, since his replacement had not yet arrived, but he advanced to Pretzschendorf after the battle.|$|E

In July 1951, he was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the successor organization to the Manhattan Project, where he became the Assistant General Manager for Manufacturing. In this role, he oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities. The construction of new reactors at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites would eventually triple the production of nuclear weapons.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of {{vaccination}} on robustness of networks against propagating attacks that obey the susceptible-infected-removed model. By extending the generating function formalism developed by Newman (2005), we analytically determine the robustness of networks {{that depends on the}} vaccination parameters. We consider <b>the</b> random <b>defense</b> where nodes are vaccinated randomly and <b>the</b> degree-based <b>defense</b> where hubs are preferentially vaccinated. We show that when vaccines are inefficient, the random graph is more robust against propagating attacks than the scale-free network. When vaccines are relatively efficient, <b>the</b> scale-free network <b>with</b> <b>the</b> degree-based <b>defense</b> is more robust than <b>the</b> random graph <b>with</b> <b>the</b> random <b>defense</b> and <b>the</b> scale-free network <b>with</b> <b>the</b> random <b>defense.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

5|$|Mainstream opinion {{reflects}} {{the function of}} identification with a sports team in both individual and group psychology. There are many benefits associated with sports fandom, both private (increased self-esteem) and public (community solidarity). The activity of viewing sporting events provide shared experiences that reinforce personal and group identification with a team. The name, mascot, cheerleaders, and marching band performances reinforce and become associated with these shared experiences. Daniel Snyder explicitly invokes these associations with family, friends, and an 81-year tradition as being the most important reasons for keeping the Redskins name. When self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, there are many beneficial but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior. However, for some, the identity being expressed is one of supremacy, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>defense</b> of native mascots clearly racist.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Cold War era, {{radar and}} antenna related {{applications}} remained a prominent research activity in EES' contracts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Defense</b> Department. Millimeter wave radar research, in particular, was prominent in EES' defense activities {{from the late}} 1950s, when the first military-designation millimeter wave radar was built at Georgia Tech, to the 1980s, when GTRI developed {{what was then the}} world's highest frequency microwave radar. EES' high-frequency radar research found applications in radio astronomy, meteorology and climate studies, which improved weather forecasting and climate models and assisted in NASA's planning of the Cassini and Galileo missions. Expansion of EES' antenna research in the 1970s, in particular, the development of an air defense antenna for the U.S. Army Missile Command, resulted in the establishment of the Huntsville Research Laboratory, GTRI's oldest off-campus research center.|$|E
