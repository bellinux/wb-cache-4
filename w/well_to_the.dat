5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed {{from a low}} level circulation on July 11, <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Windward Islands.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Bermuda on August 25, and ultimately discontinued {{about three days}} later. Two cruise ships left Bermuda early to avoid the storm, and another two postponed their scheduled stops there. The threat of the storm, combined {{with a lack of}} passengers due to cruise ship diversions, resulted in the suspension of ferry service. Cristobal ultimately passed <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest of the island, producing breezy conditions and heightened surf.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} Yap, Mitag {{turned to}} the northwest and later to the north due to an approaching trough. It passed {{to the north of}} Palau, contributing to one death there. Despite predictions of weakening, the typhoon continued to intensify, reaching peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10minute sustained) on March5. The combination of cooler air and interaction with the westerlies caused Mitag to weaken significantly. Only four days after reaching peak winds, the storm had dissipated <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|After reentering {{the central}} Pacific, John briefly reached a {{tertiary}} peak strength of 90 {{miles per hour}} (145 km/h), a strong Category 1 hurricane, <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Midway Island. However, the trough was rapidly pulling apart John's structure, and the cold waters of the northern central Pacific were not conducive to a tropical cyclone. On September 10, the 120th advisory was released on the system, finally declaring John to have become extratropical approximately 1000 miles (1600 km) south of Unalaska Island.|$|E

5|$|Despite forming {{fairly close}} to the Lesser Antilles, no {{tropical}} cyclone warnings were issued for the islands, as the official forecast correctly foresaw that Philippe would stay <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. A tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on September 23, but proved redundant when Philippe dissipated <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the island. The storm still brought gusty winds and moisture to the island, with 0.15inches (3.8mm) of precipitation reported on September 23. The circulation that absorbed Philippe dropped light rainfall on the island, and {{was responsible for the}} lowest barometric pressure during the month.|$|E
5|$|Ladd's group {{soon found}} their {{business}} expertise {{in other areas}} did not apply as <b>well</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> iron industry. Their lack of experience, coupled with a dispute over water rights, caused the company to close in 1869. After a brief respite in which they filled an order for iron wheels for the Central Pacific Railroad from 1874 to 1876, the company closed for good in 1878 and the assets were sold off at a sheriff's auction.|$|E
