Crosshead displacement rates ranged from 0. 056 mm/s to almost 56 Coupons were cut from flux-core arc welded HSLA- 65 plates to characterize the base metal, <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> materials, and mismatched welds. Constitutive material properties could be extracted reliably for all coupons at the lowest displacement rate and showed that, as expected, all weld fillers had similar elastic modulus values but different yield strengths. A comparison of the peak strains at 85 per cent of maximum elongation showed that overall the failure strain was inversely related to the crosshead displacement rate. Analysis of the mismatched coupons found that the failure location was a function of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> and was independent of strain rate. Higher magnification imaging of the weld nugget showed that strain partitioning occurred within the weld zone, with slightly lower strains in the cap pass as opposed to the root pass. 9 2011 Author.

40|$|<b>Weld</b> <b>filler</b> alloys that exploit {{transformation}} plasticity through low austenite to {{martensite transformation}} temperatures offer an effective method of reducing residual stresses in strong steel welds.

40|$|AbstractThe results {{reported}} in this research study {{are part of a}} larger EU RFCS (Research Fund for Coal and Steel) project where the aim is to study the fatigue behavior of improved welds in high strength steels by utilizing different improvement techniques. In this particular study LTT (Low Transformation Temperature) <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> material have been investigated and their possibility to improve the fatigue strength. The characteristic of these filler material is that they undergo phase transformation at temperature close to room temperature which will reduce the tensile residual stress in the weld and in some cases result in compressive residual stresses. Two different LTT alloy compositions have been developed, with different Ms (Martensite Start) temperatures in order to study the amount of tensile/compressive residual stresses produced by these wires. Welding residual stress measurements were carried out by X-ray diffraction technique. Plates with welded longitudinal attachments were fabricated in 700 MPa and 960 MPa steel grades using different LTT filler materials.

40|$|Abstract. Weld {{residual}} stresses often approach, or exceed, the yield {{strength of the}} material, with serious implications for the integrity of engineering structures. It is not always feasible to measure {{residual stresses}}, so integrity assessments often rely heavily on numerical models. In ferritic steels, the credibility of such models depends {{on their ability to}} account for solid-state phase transformations that can have a controlling effect on the final residual stress state. Furthermore, a better understanding of weld transformations provides an opportunity to engineer the weld stress state and microstructure for improved life. In this paper the complementary merits of synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction are exploited both to verify and refine weld models and to inspire the development of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metals to control weld stresses. In terms of <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metal design, X-ray diffraction is used to characterize phase transformations in real time during realistic weld cooling cycles, for understanding small-scale behaviour, and identifying features that need to be incorporated into finite-element models. Meanwhile, neutron diffraction is used to elucidate the practical consequences of solid-state phase transformations on the macroscopic scale, thereby providing crucial validatory structural integrity data...|$|E

Creep properties of 9 Cr heat resistant steels can be improved by the addition of boron and nitrogen to produce martensitic boron-nitrogen strengthened steels (MarBN). The joining of this material is a crucial consideration in the material design since welds can introduce relatively weak points in the structural material. In the present study, creep tests of a number of MarBN <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metals have been carried out to determine the effect of chemistry on the creep life of weld metal. The creep life of the weld metals was analysed, and the evolution of creep damage was investigated. Significant differences in the rupture life during creep have been observed as a function of boron, nitrogen and molybdenum concentrations in the weld consumable composition. Although the creep lives differed, the particle size and number in the failed creep tested specimens were similar, which indicates that there is a possible critical point for MarBN <b>weld</b> <b>filler</b> metal creep failure...|$|E
