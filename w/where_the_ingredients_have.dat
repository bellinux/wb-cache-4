The following, however, have not been taken into consideration: –ingredients consisting of genetically modified microorganisms or parts of animals/fish –ingredients produced by/from genetically modified organisms but without any DNA present –studies on consequences for the environment or biodiversity –in vitro studies or computer simulations According to a Norwegian report “Gen-mat ” (NOU 2000 : 29), and a more recent search in Medline and Citations Index, to our knowledge a total of ten studies have been published on {{the health effects of}} GM-foods and feeds. In this minireview the data made available in these published studies is discussed. In their study Noteborn et al (1995) used a GM-tomato developed at a Dutch research institute, with a gene expressing the Bt Cry 1 A(b) toxin. The toxin was expressed at as little as 7, 5 ng/mg protein in the fresh GM-tomato. A commercial semi-synthetic animal feed (no composition given), and the same feed mixed with 10 % of lyophilised tomatoes (the GM-tomato or the unmodified parent) were fed to young male and female rats (weanlings) for 91 days. Rats given tomato-diets ate on average what corresponds to 20 g of fresh tomatoes a day. Percent survivals, terminal body weights and organ weight...|$|R

For example, deficiencies in memory and planning can significantly impede cooking activities where limitations in remembering <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> are located and organizing steps in a recipe can be an issue. In this context, a smart apartment where persons could interact by means such as a touch screen would certainly be useful.

Method Specifically, this study assessed a cooking assistant implemented in a Smart apartment.

50|$|The {{essential}} {{components of}} aplites are quartz and alkali feldspar (the latter usually orthoclase or microperthite), microcline and albite.

Hence their crystals are rather imperfect and fit closely {{to one another in}} a sort of fine mosaic of nearly equi-dimensional grains. Phenocrysts of feldspar occur occasionally and of quartz more seldom; but the relation of aplite to quartz-porphyry, granophyre and felsite is very close, as all these rocks have nearly the same chemical composition.|$|R
