5|$|In 2011, Lim {{noted that}} the Compulsory Education Act ensures that all {{children}} {{have the opportunity to}} receive an education. However, she expressed concern that processes for entry to schools for children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> were cumbersome. Furthermore, education for children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> <b>needs</b> was not subject to the same subsidies that students in mainstream schools had. She thus brought to the House's attention the fact that special needs children might have been unintentionally marginalized. These concerns were supported by Penny Low, MP for Pasir Ris–Punggol GRC.|$|E

30|$|The {{existing}} literature on children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> outside Tanzania {{has focused on}} conceptualization of children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> and their diversity (Farrel 2003; DfES 2009; Hallahan and Kauffman 2003; Halliwell 2003). Some authors {{emphasize the importance of}} identifying children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> so as to plan for their intervention services (Bender and Shores 2007); to intervene before they fail (Hus 2001); and to facilitate their proper development alongside their typical growing peers (Fabian and Dunlop 2007). Similarly, available literature on children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> in Tanzania focuses on the taxonomy of services to these children (segregation, integration, and inclusion) (HAKIELIMU 2008; MOEVT 2016). Despite the fact that the impossibility of providing effective care and services to young children <b>with</b> <b>special</b> educational <b>needs</b> without establishing collaborative relationship with families is acknowledged (Klein et al. 2001), very few studies have been done in Tanzania to examine professional-parents relationship. Thus, this study sought to fill this gap.|$|R
