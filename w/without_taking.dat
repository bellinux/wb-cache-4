Samar gives her his jacket and leaves <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> it back. Akira finds his diary in the pocket and begins reading it.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} and implemented in 1982 by Jean-Paul Benzécri and J. Juan.

5|$|After {{being dropped}} from the senior state team, Karthik was {{overlooked}} for the selection in the zonal Duleep Trophy, and played in the Under-19s for South Zone. He had a more productive time in his second zonal season, scoring 180 runs at 60.00 with three half-centuries. He was rewarded with selection in the national Under-19 team, and played in three youth one day internationals (ODIs) against Nepal. He made only 51 runs at 17.00 <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a catch, but India won all their matches with ease.|$|E
5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around him <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin {{enrolled}} in October 1966 at the University of Edinburgh to study Archaeology. He had regretted not attending Oxford {{and had been}} contemplating going to university for a few years. A visit in December 1965 to the Hermitage in Leningrad sparked {{his interest in the}} field of archaeology. Despite winning the Wardrop Prize for the best first year's work, he found the rigour of academic archaeology tiresome, and he left after two years <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a degree.|$|E

At the end of combat, money (as yen) is rewarded to Amaterasu, with bonuses for completing a battle quickly and <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> damage. The money can be spent on numerous items from merchants across the land, including healing goods, better weapons, tools and key items for completing quests.

5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut during the 192627 season, playing four matches for South Australia. He made his debut against Queensland. He was unbeaten without scoring {{in his first}} innings as South Australia made 579. Halcombe then took 2/37 as Queensland made 251 and were forced to follow on. He conceded 58 runs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a wicket in the second innings, but his team nevertheless won by ten wickets.|$|E

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> his degree, and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai.|$|E
5|$|In the WNCL, Ebsary went wicketless for {{the entire}} season for the first time, conceding 127 runs at an economy rate of 4.70. She {{remained}} productive with the bat, scoring 207 runs at 25.87, making 43 and 57, her two highest scores of the season, in the double-header against Victoria. Western Australia won three of eight matches and {{did not make the}} final. Ebsary made 34 and 25 in her two T20 matches for the season, but had no success with the ball, conceding a total of 36 runs from three overs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a wicket.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command {{attempted}} {{to pinpoint the}} main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron's reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no attempt was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E

5|$|Pennant {{received}} his early education at Wrexham Grammar School, {{before moving to}} Thomas Croft's school in Fulham in 1740. At the age of twelve, Pennant later recalled, he had been inspired {{with a passion for}} natural history through being presented with Francis Willughby's Ornithology. In 1744 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, later moving to Oriel College. Like many students from a wealthy background, he left Oxford <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a degree, although in 1771 his work as a zoologist was recognised with an honorary degree.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{followed}} {{his older brother}} to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and {{in his first year}} played in the freshmen's trial match in which he claimed six wickets, five of them in the first innings. He played one first-class match for the university that summer, bowling ten overs <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a wicket against Yorkshire. He also played five second-class matches during 1881, all for Somerset County Cricket Club. His best performance for Somerset during that time was against Kent, when he claimed six wickets in the first innings.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} played in March–April 1921. After four draws, the fifth game saw Lasker blunder with Black in an equal ending. Capablanca's solid style {{allowed him to}} easily draw the next four games, <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> any risks. In the tenth game, Lasker as White played a {{position}} with an isolated queen pawn but failed to create the necessary activity and Capablanca reached a superior ending, which he duly won. The eleventh and fourteenth games were also won by Capablanca, and Lasker resigned the match.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its history, a {{sizeable}} number of Oxford alumni, known as Oxonians, have become notable in many varied fields, both academic and otherwise, ranging from T. E. Lawrence, British Army officer known better as Lawrence of Arabia to the explorer, courtier, and man of letters, Sir Walter Raleigh, (who attended Oriel College but left <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a degree); and the Australian media mogul, Rupert Murdoch. Moreover, 58 Nobel prize-winners have studied or taught at Oxford, with prizes won in all six categories.|$|E
5|$|A {{point of}} {{contention}} among scholars is {{the role played by}} Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, Mesrop Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian Albanian alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by Donald Rayfield and James R. Russell, but has been criticized by scholars, both Georgian and Western, who judge the passage in Koryun unreliable or even a later interpolation. Other scholars quote Koryun's claims <b>without</b> <b>taking</b> a stance on its validity. Many agree, however, that Armenian clerics, if not Mashtots himself, must {{have played a role in}} the creation of the Georgian script.|$|E

He enjoyed Adams as a tutor, but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and {{he was forced to}} return home. He left behind many of the books that his father had previously lent him, both because he could not afford the expense of transporting all of them and as a symbolic gesture that he hoped to return to the school soon.|$|E
