2500|$|Roxy Miéville appears {{with the}} couple, {{as well as}} with the unseen Godard and Anne-Marie Miéville at the end of the film. Godard and his {{long-term}} professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy, but no longer live together. During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of Libération observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them. When interviewed by NPR, Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard [...] "trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way... There are hints throughout the film that animal consciousness is kind of closer to the world than <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh." [...] Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes and that Roxy [...] "restores balance" [...] to the couple when they are in conflict and represent [...] "the commoners" [...] while the couple represents [...] "nobility" [...] or [...] "the clergy." [...] MacCabe wrote that Roxy [...] "offer an image of acceptable sociality" [...] in the film. In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, which Brody calls [...] "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Series b however, {{completely}} refutes {{the basic}} concepts of empiricism. It begins by declaring that [...] "Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception, he perceives more than sense (thou' ever so acute) can discover." [...] As such, Man can indeed discover aspects beyond his own immediate experience; [...] "Reason or {{the ratio of}} all we have already known. {{is not the same}} as it shall be when we know more." [...] Blake points out that Man is fundamentally desirous of discovering more and moving beyond the bounds of his specific physicality, which is nothing more than a restriction; [...] "The bounded is loathed by its possessor." [...] As a result, Man yearns to know that which he does not yet know because [...] "Less than all cannot satisfy Man." [...] However, Man should never desire more than he can possess, because [...] "if any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot." [...] However, because Man tends to desire the infinite, thus [...] "the desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite." [...] That is to say, if Man can only desire what he can possess, yet he desires the infinite, then he must be able to possess the infinite. Blake takes from this that if Man's desires and possessions can be infinite, then Man too must be Infinite, and, by extension, Man can see the Infinite. Indeed, not to see the Infinite is a perversion of Man's true nature, as defined by the Poetic Genius; [...] "If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character. the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things & stand still, unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again"; i.e. Man is made to do more than perceive and experience through the senses only. Furthermore, to see the Infinite is to see God, which is to transcend the sensate ("the Ratio"); [...] "He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only." [...] Therefore, for Man to see God, he must be as God, and as such, [...] "God becomes as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> we may be as he is." ...|$|E
