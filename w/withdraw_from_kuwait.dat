25|$|Operation Desert Shield {{commenced}} in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. The 8th SOS was {{deployed to}} Saudi Arabia {{as a deterrent}} against the Iraqi threat to its southern neighbor. In January 1991, when Iraq failed to comply with United Nations directives to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> the proven skills of the 8th SOS were called on once again as Operation Desert Shield escalated into Operation Desert Storm. The 8th SOS {{played a pivotal role}} in the success of coalition forces as they liberated Kuwait by dropping 11 15,000-pound BLU-82 bombs and 23 million leaflets and conducting numerous aerial refuelings of special operations helicopters.|$|E
500|$|The air {{campaign}} against Iraq began on January 17, 1991, after 139 days {{of planning and}} buildup. Schwarzkopf sent a prepared statement to the troops ahead of the first airstrikes, which were timed to hit their targets at 02:40. He oversaw the strikes from his war room in Riyadh, then emerged from his command center {{late in the day}} on January 18 to speak to the press, saying the air war had gone [...] "just about exactly as we had intended it to go". He then began making frequent briefings to the media to increase press coverage of the results. He declined to measure the success of the campaign by counting suspected Iraqi casualties, believing this would undermine his credibility. The {{air campaign}} proved to be a success by achieving air superiority and destroying the Iraqi military's communications network, supplies, as well as many tanks and armored vehicles. By January 20 he announced Iraq's nuclear test reactors had been destroyed, and by January 27 he announced that the coalition had total air superiority in Iraq. Bush then gave Hussein an ultimatum to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by 12:00 on February 23 or Schwarzkopf's ground forces would attack.|$|E
2500|$|International affairs {{drove the}} Bush presidency. Bush helped the country {{navigate}} {{the end of}} the Cold War and a new era of U.S.–Soviet relations. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush successfully pushed for the reunification of Germany. He also led an international coalition of countries which forced Iraq to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in the Gulf War, and undertook a U.S. military invasion of Panama. Though it was not ratified until after his presidency, Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which created a trilateral trade bloc consisting of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.|$|E
50|$|After an {{argument}} between Wiener and Al Hadithi, Al Hadithi agrees to give CNN a Saddam Hussein interview. On October 29, Bernard Shaw (Robert Wisdom) and the CNN crew interview Saddam Hussein {{at one of}} his presidential palaces. In the interview, Hussein states that Iraq <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> would be like the U.S. <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> Hawaii. The crew then covers the release of American hostages from Iraq. Wiener then finds Bob Vinton and is emotionally moved by his being safe.|$|R
50|$|Ultimately, the US {{stuck to}} its {{position}} {{that there would}} be no negotiations until Iraq <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and that they should not grant Iraq concessions, lest they give the impression that Iraq benefited from its military campaign. Also, when US Secretary of State James Baker met with Tariq Aziz in Geneva, Switzerland, for last minute peace talks in early 1991, Aziz reportedly made no concrete proposals and did not outline any hypothetical Iraqi moves.|$|R
5000|$|Iraq {{agrees to}} a Soviet-proposed {{cease-fire}} agreement. The US rejected the proposal {{but said that}} retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave twenty-four hours for Iraq to begin <b>withdrawing</b> forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On August 2, 1990, Iraq, led by Saddam Hussein, invaded its oil-rich {{neighbor}} to the south, Kuwait; Bush condemned the invasion and began rallying opposition to Iraq in the US and among European, Asian, and Middle Eastern allies. [...] Secretary of Defense Richard Bruce [...] "Dick" [...] Cheney traveled to Saudi Arabia to meet with King Fahd; Fahd requested US military aid in the matter, fearing a possible invasion of his country as well. The request was met initially with Air Force fighter jets. Iraq made attempts to negotiate a deal {{that would allow the}} country to take control of half of Kuwait. Bush rejected this proposal and insisted on a complete withdrawal of Iraqi forces. The planning of a ground operation by US-led coalition forces began forming in September 1990, headed by General Norman Schwarzkopf. Bush spoke before a joint session of the U.S. Congress regarding the authorization of air and land attacks, laying out four immediate objectives: [...] "Iraq must <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> completely, immediately, and without condition. Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored. The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured. And American citizens abroad must be protected." [...] He then outlined a fifth, long-term objective: [...] "Out of these troubled times, our fifth objective – a new world order – can emerge: a new era – freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace. An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and South, can prosper and live in harmony.... A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak." [...] With the United Nations Security Council opposed to Iraq's violence, Congress authorized the Use of Military force with a set goal of returning control of Kuwait to the Kuwaiti government, and protecting America's interests abroad.|$|E
50|$|Iraq's {{refusal to}} <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> {{led to the}} Gulf War and the {{eventual}} return of the pre-occupation Kuwaiti government on 26 February 1991.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678 {{which gave}} Iraq until 15 January 1991 to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and {{empowered}} states to use [...] "all necessary means" [...] to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline.|$|E
50|$|He {{began his}} {{diplomatic}} {{career in the}} mid-1980s {{when he joined the}} United States Department of State. In the lead up to the Gulf War, Helal interpreted for Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi emissary Tariq Aziz at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, at which time Aziz was presented with an ultimatum to <b>withdraw</b> troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The United States {{amassed a}} 30 nation {{coalition}} of some 30,000 {{troops and the}} UN Security Council issued an ultimatum to Iraq for the withdrawal. Operation Desert Storm, an air bombardment, followed by a 43-day war followed Iraq's failure to withdraw. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) provided vessels for the multi-national naval force, patrolling the Persian Gulf to enforce the UN sanctions. The Government elected to maintain an Australian naval presence in the Gulf following the surrender of Iraq and 1991 Peace Treaty. Ultimately, though Iraq <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> its failure to adhere to other conditions of the 1991 Treaty led to the second Iraq War a decade later. In {{an address to the}} nation explaining Australia's involvement, Hawke said that to protect small nations, sometimes [...] "tragically", we must fight for peace.|$|R
2500|$|Kasem {{was active}} in {{politics}} for years, supporting Lebanese-American and Arab-American causes, an interest which was triggered by the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. [...] He wrote a brochure published by the Arab American Institute entitled [...] "Arab-Americans: Making a Difference". He turned down a position in season three of Transformers because of the show's plot portraying [...] "evil Arabs". He also called for a fairer depiction of heroes and villains, {{on behalf of all}} cultures, in Disney's 1994 sequel to Aladdin called The Return of Jafar. [...] In 1996, he was honored as [...] "Man of the Year" [...] by the American Druze Society. Kasem campaigned against the Gulf War, advocating non-military means of pressuring Saddam Hussein into <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> was an advocate of Palestinian independence and arranged conflict resolution workshops for Arab Americans and Jewish Americans.|$|R
50|$|On August 28, 1990, the Kuwaiti {{territory}} {{was transformed}} into the Kuwait Governorate, Iraq's 19th province, and thus it was formally annexed. Iraq's refusal to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> led to the Persian Gulf War, and on 26 February 1991 the pre-occupation government was returned to power.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. On Nov. 8, 1990, the 1st Armored Division {{received}} {{orders to}} deploy to Southwest Asia {{to provide an}} offensive option, should Saddam refuse to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> This provided an abrupt change of focus for the division, from a U.S. forces [...] "build down" [...] in Europe to a sudden [...] "buildup" [...] in Southwest Asia.|$|E
5000|$|On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678 {{which gave}} Iraq until 15 January 1991 to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and {{empowered}} states to use [...] "all necessary means" [...] to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline. The Resolution requested Member States {{to keep the}} Council informed on their decisions. This was the legal authorisation for the Gulf War, as Iraq did not withdraw by the deadline.|$|E
50|$|Conflict in the Middle East {{triggered}} {{yet another}} international crisis on August 2, 1990, when Iraq invaded {{and attempted to}} annex neighboring Kuwait. U.S. officials feared that Hussein was then {{on the verge of}} armed conflict with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Washington's since the 1940s. The United Nations condemned the invasion as an act of aggression; President Bush compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler and declared that if the United States and international community did not act, aggression would be encouraged elsewhere in the world. The Security Council gave Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait, but Saddam Hussein ignored it, and the Security Council authorized a military response. The war began in January 1991, with U.S. troops forming the majority of the coalition which participated in Operation Desert Storm. By the time Iraqi troops <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in late February, Iraq had lost approximately 20,000 troops, with some sources citing as many as 100,000 casualties on the Iraqi side.|$|R
50|$|On June 25, {{the first}} batch of the 600-member {{contingent}} began to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> Samawah to <b>Kuwait.</b> The last 220 troops left Iraq by July 18. And the JIRSG base in Samawah was planned {{to be the new}} headquarters of the 2nd Brigade, 10th Division of the Iraqi Army.|$|R

50|$|In late December 1990, 2/4 {{deployed}} by air to Al Jabayl, Saudi Arabia for Operation Desert Shield. During Operation Desert Storm {{the battalion}} fought as a Mechanized Infantry Armor Task force (Task Force Spartan) during the 2nd Marine Division's attack into Kuwait. After the cease fire the battalion remained in Kuwait with Eighth Marines and conducted security and contingency operations west of Kuwait City. 2/4 {{was the last}} Marine infantry battalion to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> arriving in the U.S. on 15 May 1991.|$|E
50|$|The {{sanctions}} against Iraq were a near-total financial and trade embargo {{imposed by the}} United Nations Security Council on Ba'athist Iraq. They began August 6, 1990, four days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, stayed largely in force until May 2003 (after Saddam Hussein's being forced from power), and persisted in part, including reparations to Kuwait, through the present. The original stated purposes of the sanctions were to compel Iraq to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> to pay reparations, and to disclose and eliminate any weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1990, Iraq made a {{proposal}} to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> provided that foreign troops left the region and that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel's and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The White House rejected the proposal. The PLO's Yasser Arafat expressed that neither he nor Saddam insisted that solving the Israel-Palestine issues should be a precondition to solving the issues in Kuwait, though he did acknowledge a [...] "strong link" [...] between these problems.|$|E
50|$|Aziz {{came into}} the meeting with little leverage. Saddam had {{instructed}} him on the Iraqi position, and he had little flexibility to deviate from it. The Iraqi position had been throughout the crisis that Iraq would not consider <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> unless the Palestinian issue was resolved. Aziz tried to turn any potential military conflict with the United States and its allies into a war between Iraq and the United States. When confronted {{with the possibility of}} fighting other Arab countries, Aziz stated, But when a war breaks out between an Arab and Muslim country on the one hand, and foreign powers such as the United States, Britain, and other foreign nations, on the other, combatants will not keep in mind that they will be fighting to vindicate UN resolutions.... The soldier in our region does not fight only when ordered to do so. Indeed he fights out of convictions.... Against the backdrop of your ties with Israel, I would like to tell you in all sincerity that if you initiate military action against an Arab country, you will be faced with hostile sentiment in the region, and in many Muslim states as well.|$|R
50|$|A {{cease-fire}} {{was announced}} by the US on 28 February 1991. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar met with Saddam Hussein to discuss the Security Council timetable for the <b>withdraw</b> of troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Iraq agreed to UN terms for a permanent cease-fire in April 1991, and strict conditions were imposed, demanding the disclosure and destruction of all stockpiles of weapons.|$|R
50|$|The Geneva Peace Conference {{was held}} on January 9, 1991 to find a {{peaceful}} solution to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait {{in order to avoid}} a war between Iraq and the United States backed coalition. Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz represented Iraq, while United States Secretary of State James Baker was the United States representative. Lasting nearly seven hours, both parties refused to move on their initial positions. Iraq refused to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> occupied <b>Kuwait,</b> while the United States and its allies continued to demand Iraq's immediate withdrawal. The meeting was the final initiative that eventually led to the Gulf War.|$|R
50|$|On 27 October 1990, the two {{countries}} along with Cuba and Yemen voiced concerns over a UN resolution that would make Iraq responsible for financial repercussions relating to the Invasion of Kuwait. Eventually an agreement was made to increase pressure on President Saddam Hussein to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and end the Gulf War. The war would eventually end on 28 February 1991 with {{the intervention of the}} Coalition of the Gulf War. Although Malaysia and Colombia supported the UN's authorised use of force against Iraq, neither countries participated directly in the Coalition.|$|E
50|$|The U.S.-Kuwaiti {{strategic}} partnership intensified dramatically {{again after}} Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The United States spearheaded UN Security Council demands that Iraq <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> and its authorization {{of the use}} of force, if necessary, to remove Iraqi forces from the occupied country. The United States subsequently played a dominant {{role in the development of}} the multinational military Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm that liberated Kuwait. The U.S.-Kuwaiti relationship remained strong in the post-Gulf War period. Kuwait and the United States worked on a daily basis to monitor and to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN Security Council resolutions.|$|E

5000|$|Iraq’s {{ignoring}} the UN-imposed deadline (16 January) for <b>withdrawing</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> however, changed the complexion {{of events in}} the region, and Operation Desert Storm soon got underway early the following day (17 January). Over the ensuing weeks (17 January-13 February), Thomas S. Gates, as Red Crown (Inter Anti Aircraft Warfare Defense Zone Coordinator) coordinated the departures and returns of air strikes from the aircraft carriers John F. Kennedy, [...] and America, “ensuring that all friendly aircraft returned safely through the air defense net while preventing any possible raid-following Iraqi aircraft getting through.” Following a visit to Hurghada (14-18 February), Thomas S. Gates operated once more in the Red Sea (19 February-1 March), during which time (24 February) the ground war began in Iraq and Kuwait. Following the cease-fire (28 February), the ship conducted a brief period of maritime interdiction operations in the Gulf of Aqaba. Following an in-port period at Jeddah (2-10 March), where she underwent an IMAV alongside the destroyer tender , Thomas S. Gates transited the Suez Canal (12 March). She then conducted anti submarine warfare exercises in the central Mediterranean (15-17 March), after which she transited the Strait of Gibraltar (18 March), headed for Norfolk, returning to her homeport on 28 March.|$|R
50|$|The Iraqi {{invasion}} and occupation of Kuwait was unanimously condemned by all major world powers. Even countries traditionally {{considered to be}} close Iraqi allies, such as France and India, called for immediate withdrawal of all Iraqi forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> Several countries, including the USSR and China, placed arms embargoes on Iraq. NATO members were particularly critical of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and by late 1990, the United States had issued an ultimatum to Iraq to <b>withdraw</b> its forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by 15 January 1991 or face war.|$|R
25|$|During {{the period}} of {{negotiations}} and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the Palestinian problem by promising to <b>withdraw</b> his forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> if Israel would relinquish the occupied territories in the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.|$|R

50|$|The Invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990 was a 2-day {{operation}} {{conducted by}} Iraq against the neighboring state of Kuwait, {{which resulted in}} the seven-month-long Iraqi occupation of Kuwait. This invasion and Iraq's subsequent refusal to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> by a deadline mandated by the United Nations led to military intervention by a United Nations-authorized coalition of forces led by the United States. These events {{came to be known as}} the first Gulf War and resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the Iraqis setting 600 Kuwaiti oil wells on fire during their retreat.|$|E
50|$|Fellow Arab {{countries}} {{called for}} Saddam {{to comply with}} Resolution 678. Egyptian President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak and Saudi King Fahd, along with other heads of state, publicly called for an unconditioned withdrawal from Kuwait. Syrian Minister of Defense Mustafa Tlas stated Syria would increase its military presence if Iraq did not comply. After a meeting in Cairo on December 3, 1990, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Egypt issued a statement that stated “Bush’s initiative creates the last chance for removing the danger of war from the region. Saddam had better seize this opportune moment to <b>withdraw</b> <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait,</b> rather than embroil the region in a bloody and futile war.|$|E
50|$|In November 1990, President Bush ordered United States Central Command {{to begin}} to prepare for {{offensive}} operations against Iraq after negotiations with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq were at an impasse. The 416th TFW was deployed from Tonopah in mid-December and in January 1991, {{a portion of the}} 417th TFS was also deployed to Saudi Arabia. In spite of the massive Coalition buildup, Saddam Hussein of Iraq stubbornly refused to <b>withdraw</b> his troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b>|$|R
25|$|A UN-brokered ceasefire became {{active in}} July 1988, ending the Iran-Iraq war. Hussein had advised Saddam after 1988 to polish his {{image in the}} West by visiting other countries, and by {{appearing}} at the United Nations for a speech, but to no avail. The Iraqi-Jordanian relationship developed into the Arab Cooperation Council (ACC), which also included Egypt and Yemen, on 16February 1989, serving as a counter to the Gulf Cooperation Council. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait on 2August 1990 led six months later to international intervention to expel Iraqi forces <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in {{what became known as}} the Gulf War. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait caught Hussein by surprise; he was the ACC chairman at that time, and a personal friend of Saddam's. After informing the then American president George H. W. Bush of his intention to travel to Baghdad to contain the situation, Hussein travelled to Baghdad on 3August for a meeting with Saddam; at the meeting, the latter announced his intention to <b>withdraw</b> Iraqi troops <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> only if Arab governments refrained from issuing statements of condemnation, and no foreign troops were involved. On Hussein's way back from Baghdad, Egypt issued a condemnation of the Iraqi invasion. To Hussein's dismay, Egyptian president Husni Mubarak refused to reverse his position and called for Iraq's unconditional withdrawal <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> An Arab League summit held in Cairo issued a condemnation of Iraq with a fourteen-vote majority, despite calls by Jordan's foreign minister Marwan Al-Kasim that this move would hinder Hussein's efforts to reach a peaceful resolution. Both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia viewed Hussein with suspicionthey distrusted him and believed he was planning to obtain a share of Kuwait's wealth.|$|R
5000|$|India's Coast Guard Act {{was passed}} in August 1978. The Indian Coast Guard participated in counter {{terrorism}} operations such as Operation Cactus. During contemporary times the Indian navy was commissioned in several United Nations peacekeeping missions. The navy also repatriated Indian nationals <b>from</b> <b>Kuwait</b> during the first Gulf War. Rajesh Kadian (2006) holds that: [...] "During the Kargil War (1999), the aggressive posture adopted by the navy {{played a role in}} convincing Islamabad and Washington that a larger conflict loomed unless Pakistan <b>withdrew</b> <b>from</b> the heights.".|$|R
