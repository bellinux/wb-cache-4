40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the physical mechanisms that distress thrust washer bearings through physical modeling and numerical techniques. The thrust <b>washer</b> <b>bearing</b> is subjected to non-axisymmetric loads within the planetary gear sets of automatic transmissions in automobiles. In practice the thrust <b>washer</b> <b>bearing</b> often distresses severely and unpredictably, causing transmission breakdown and liability issues. A specially designed thrust <b>washer</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig allows for controlled variation of the operational parameters (speed, load, lubrication flow rate, etc.) governing the tribological behavior of the washer. The test rig also records pertinent real-time data (frictional torque and temperature) from the bearing. In conjunction with the experimental model, a new comprehensive numerical simulation of thrust washer bearings is constructed. The numerical simulation incorporates the effects of macro-scale deformation, micro-scale surface asperity contact, heat generation, boundary and full film lubrication. To model surface asperity contact, the current work performs an extensive finite element study of elasto-plastic spherical contact. The numerical and experimental results show that significant sliding asperity contact can cause high temperatures, high friction, and severe wear. Ph. D.

40|$|In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the effects}} of grooves on thrust washer bearings is investigated. Eight equally sized grooves are machined about 100 Âµm deep into one side of a flat-faced steel washer. This thrust <b>washer</b> <b>bearing</b> is lo-cated between a helical gear and its carrier and is tested on a test rig capable of measuring frictional torque and the temperature of the bearing at different speeds. It is found that the grooved washers had lower bearing temperatures and failed at signifi-cantly higher loads than the control washer with no grooves. For a test procedure with varying operating conditions, the co-efficient of friction is also significantly lower for the grooved washers. However, the grooved washers had about the same co-efficient of friction as the control washers at each step when the speeds are very high. The results from various tests sug-gest that the increased amount of lubricant passing through the grooved surface of the washer removes heat from the <b>washer</b> <b>bearing</b> by convection. This decrease in stored heat conducted from friction deters thermoelastic instabilities and the reduction of hydrodynamic stiffness due to the decrease in viscosity. En-hanced hydrodynamic load-carrying capacity is also evident in the grooved washers test results...|$|E

5000|$|As {{the screw}} is {{tightened}} it pushes the Belleville and thrust washers onto the gear/pulley. This creates {{contact between the}} <b>washers</b> and ball <b>bearings</b> inside of the gear/pulley. The friction created by the contact between the <b>washers</b> and ball <b>bearings</b> is, aided by grease (commonly silicone grease), designed so that as one washer moves, the ball bearings rotate.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} novel surface integrated thin film sensors which were developed for use at various mechanical components and tools. In general the sensors consist of hard coatings with optimized tribological properties well arranged to a wear resistant thin film system with inherent sensory properties. One class of sensors for measurement of temperature, force or pressure in mechanical contact zones {{is based on}} nano structured diamond-like-carbon films, which show an impressive piezoresistive effect (K > 100) besides excellent tribological properties. Because of the extreme hardness and high elasticity {{in the order of}} 15 - 30 GPa and 140 - 270 GPa, respectively, the coatings can be applied directly to mechanical parts. Examples of mechanical components with local sensors for measurement of load distributions, force detecting <b>washers</b> and ball <b>bearings</b> with micro load sensors in the race track of the balls are described. Another example for high precision measurement by use of surface integrated thin film sensors will deal with turning operations. To this the authors developed a wear resistant coating system for cutting tools based on hard Al 2 O 3 films and an intermediate arranged thin film structure of hard TiN for measurement of surface temperature, wear, tool breakage and cutting edge geometry. Results on in-situ measurements at cutting of steel and aluminum will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the oil system. Strip examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab <b>washers.</b> The damaged <b>bearing</b> along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover side bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover side bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|R
