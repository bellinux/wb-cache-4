5000|$|RCA's {{solution}} was to use three conventional black and white tubes with filters on the front to produce the three primary colors. The tubes were arranged with the green-filtered tube {{at the bottom of}} the chassis, facing up. Above it and to one side was the blue-filtered tube This was aimed at right angles to the green, so light from the two crossed in space between them. At the crossing point, a dichromic mirror was positioned to reflect the blue light up, while allowing the green light to pass through unchanged. Both [...] "beams" [...] were now traveling toward the top of the tube. A third tube and mirror completed the system by adding red to the image. A suitable red phosphor was not available at the time; instead, a red <b>Wratten</b> <b>filter</b> was placed over a tube with bright yellow phosphor, and then neutral filtered to get the proper brightness in relation to the other two tubes. All three signals then shone onto a mirror at the top of the chassis, which reflected the light forward toward the viewer.|$|E

40|$|Whether a two-color {{reproduction}} from a red {{and green}} additive process is acceptable depends largely {{on the nature of}} the scene and its illumination. Additive two-color reproduction will be explored here using different scene illuminants and also different red and green filter combinations. Two projection methods are also examined. Red and green separations were produced by photographing a scene through 16 different filter combinations and 3 different scene illuminants. These separations are then projected two different ways. One method involves projecting the separations back through the red and green filters they were taken through, while in the other method the green filter is removed and replaced with a neutral density.

40|$|Two paired-comparison psychophysical {{experiments}} were performed. The stimuli consisted of six image types resulting from several multispectral image-capture and reconstruction techniques. A seventh image type, color-managed images from a high-end consumer camera, was {{also included in}} the first experiment to compare the accuracy of commercial RGB imaging. The images were evaluated under simulated daylight (6800 K) and incandescent (2700 K) illumination. The first experiment evaluated color reproduction accuracy. Under simulated daylight, the subjects judged all of the images to have the same color accuracy, except the consumer camera image which was significantly worse. Under incandescent illumination, all the images, including the consumer camera, had equivalent performance. The second experiment evaluated image quality. The results of this experiment were highly target dependent. A subsequent image registration experiment showed that the results of the image quality experiment were affected by image registration to some degree. An analysis of the color reproduction accuracy and image quality experiments combined showed that the consumer camera image type was preferred the least over all.

This paper describes {{the investigation of the}} feasibility of generating a sinusoidal intensity distribution from a crenelate pattern by incoherent spatial filtering using non-monochromatic radiation. Using a Kodak Ektar Enlarging Lens (focal length of 100 mm.) at f/ 8 it has been found that images may be spatially filtered up to 30 cycles/mm while maintaining a modulation of 62 # in white light (tungsten illumination). At this frequency the third harmonic is about 10 # of the D. C. level in white light and approaching 13 # in blue (<b>Wratten</b> <b>Filter</b> # 47) radiation. The magnitude of the third harmonic appears to limit the range of this system from 5 2 ̆ 2 to 30 cycles/mm if the user can tolerate a 10 # third harmonic.

40|$|At {{means of}} {{determining}} the temperature of a hot solid body by photographic means has been developed. For {{the purposes of this}} experiment, a General Electric tungsten ribbon filament lamp, with an operating range of 12 to 18 amperes was used as the object. From published curves, {{it was found that the}} color temperature of the filament varied from 2220 K to 2990 K over the above amperage range. It is therefore possible to vary the color temperature with a powerstat and to monitor it with an ammeter. Using two front surfaced mirrors, the lamp illuminated both sides of a photometric edge so that they both received equal initial illumination. Two different spectral transmission filters were placed in the system, one in the path of each beam, so that each side of the photometer edge was now illuminated by different wavelengths of radiation. One filter was a Kodak 89 B <b>wratten</b> <b>filter,</b> which transmits radiation above 730 nm up to 900 nm, but blocks radiation below 730 nm. The second filter was a Kodak # 301 infrared cutoff filter which transmits in the visible range from 400 to 730 nm but blocks infrared radiation above 730 nm. At a given lamp temperature, the edge was imaged onto Kodak 2481 High Speed Infrared film which was then processed according to a standardized method. The densities of each side of the image, each exposed by different wavelengths as explained above, are measured, and the corresponding log exposures and exposures are determined from a previously prepared characteristic curve of the film. From this data, a ratio R = E 301 /E 89 B was determined. Since this value varied with changing illumination (hence, color temperature), the above procedure was repeated for several color temperatures within the above-mentioned range. The result was a calibration curve of R as a function of color temperature. It was now possible to determine the value of an unknown temperature of the lamp. The above procedure was repeated with the lamp at an unknown setting. By extrapolating the R value for the unknown temperature on the calibration curve, it was possible to determine the color temperature of the lamp.

50|$|Wratten is also {{credited}} with introducing the noodling process for pre-washed gelatin emulsion in 1878, which substantially increases {{the surface area}} of the emulsion and thus {{the efficiency of the}} process. This allowed creating more sensitive photographic plates than previously possible. In 1906 Wratten incorporated his company with his son, S. H. Wratten, and C. E. Kenneth Mees as owners. Mees, a recent graduate of London University, was placed in charge of new product development, and soon introduced panchromatic plates sensitive to longer wavelengths. To allow photography using particular wavelengths of light, Mees developed dyed gelatin filters which were placed between the plate or lens and the subject matter. These colored filters, later known as <b>Wratten</b> <b>filters,</b> began with yellow filters dyed with tartrazine (CAS # 1934-21-0), but were soon available in many more colors.

As a result, the data obtained in these images are dependent on the viewing conditions and the observer.

As a solution, many research institutions are now advocating the use of multispectral imaging to record the objects fundamental spectral properties to remove the data 2 ̆ 7 s dependency on the observer and viewing environment.

This {{is especially true for}} filters used for aesthetic (as opposed to technical) reasons. For example, an 81B Warming Filter is a filter used to slightly [...] "warm" [...] the colors in a color photo, making the scene a bit less blue and more red. Many manufacturers make filters labeled as 81B with transmission curves which are similar, but not identical, to the Kodak Wratten 81B.

Some manufacturers use their own designations to avoid this confusion, for example Singh-Ray has a warming filter which they designate A-13, which is not a <b>Wratten</b> number. <b>Filters</b> used where precisely specified and repeatable characteristics are required, e.g. for printing press color separation and scientific work, use more standardized and rigorous coding systems.|$|R
40|$|The color gamut, i. e. {{the range}} of {{reproducible}} colors, is in most conventional display systems not sufficient for accurate color reproduction of highly saturated colors. Any conventional three-primary display suffers from a color gamut limited within the triangle spanned by the primary colors. Even by using purer primaries, enlarging the triangle, {{there will still be}} a problem to cover all the perceivable colors. By using a system with more than three primary colors, in printing denoted Hi-Fi color, the gamut will be expanded into a polygon, yielding a larger gamut and better color reproduction. Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a projection technology developed by Texas Instrument. It uses a chip with an array of thousands of individually controllable micromirrors, each representing a single pixel in the projected image. A lamp illuminates the micromirrors, and by controlling the amount of time each mirror reflect the light, using pulse width modulation, the projected image is created. Color reproduction is achieved by letting the light pass through color filters, corresponding to the three primaries, mounted in a filter wheel. In this diploma work, the DLP projector InFocus® LP™ 350 has been evaluated, using the Photo Research® PR®- 705 Spectroradiometer. The colorimetric performance of the projector is found to be surprisingly poor, with a color gamut noticeably smaller then that of a CRT monitor using standardized phosphors. This is due to the broad banded filters used, yielding increased brightness {{at the expense of the}} pureness of the primaries. With the intention of evaluating the potential for the DLP technology in multi- primary systems, color filters are selected for additional primary colors. The filters are selected from a set of commercially available <b>filters,</b> the Kodak <b>Wratten</b> <b>filters</b> for science and technology.

Colorimetric performance of the system is greatly improved, yielding an expansion of the color gamut in CIE 1976 (L*u*v*) color space by 79 %, relative the original three-primary system.

The atmosphere and clouds can then be seen and photographed at short wavelengths by Earth-based telescopes equipped with a <b>Wratten</b> 47 <b>filter.</b> It happens that the blue screen of the filter suddenly begins to disappear and that the Martian surface becomes visible. We believe that the "Allais syzygy effect " may explain this phenomenon known as "blue clearing".

The outcome would be to trigger dust storms and exacerbate a disorderly excitement of molecules in the atmosphere. The thermal agitation facilitates the absorption of energy {{and the formation of}} small condensations that cause light scattering. Assuming that the Martian gravity decreased slightly, a Stokes Raman scattering would manifest at intramolecular level of the Martian atmosphere: the emitted photon has a lower energy than the absorbed photon. Therefore, it is mainly the waves corresponding to the spectral regions yellow, orange or red that are diffused, what eliminates short wavelengths.

We used psychophysical methods to measure the effects of wavelength on the reading performance of four normal observers, two dichromats, and 25 low-vision observers. Reading rates were measured for text scanned {{across the face of}} a television (TV) monitor. We compared performance under four luminance-matched conditions in which sets of neutral-density and <b>Wratten</b> color <b>filters</b> were placed in front of the TV screen-blue (λmax = 430 nm), green (λmax = 550 nm), red (λmax = 650 nm), and gray. Under photopic conditions, the reading rates of normal subjects were independent of wavelength, with the exception of characters near the acuity limit. At lower luminances, wavelength effects could be explained by the shift from photopic to scotopic vision. It was hypothesized that light scatter or absorption in eyes with cloudy ocular media would result in depressed performance in the blue. Only one of seven subjects demonstrated this effect, which we traced to wavelength-specific absorption. Observers with advanced photoreceptor disorders tended to read blue text faster than red text. This could not be explained on the basis of photopic spectral sensitivities alone. Finally, the presence of central or peripheral field loss was not predictive of wavelength-specific effects in reading. On the whole, wavelength only occasionally plays a significant role in reading.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThe chief {{problem of}} this {{research}} was to study by standard sensitometric procedures the effects of intensity, time and wavelength on the amount of speed increase which might be obtained from four representative slow, regular, high, and extra high speed emulsions (Royal Pan, Aerial Recon type 1 -B Class L, Plus X and Microfile) by latensification. Latensification has been defined simply as a process applied after exposure and before development to increase the speed or sensitivity (reciprocal of the exposure required to produce a given result) of an emulsion. A secondary purpose was to examine latensification of a very slow, fine grain emulsion for possible use in small high quality aerial camera systems, in which the emulsion graininess is the limiting factor when used with conventional high speed emulsions. The latensification method in this case was post-exposure to radiation from 0. 36 to 0. 68 microns. This spectral range was divided into four bands by the <b>Wratten</b> <b>Filters</b> # 25 A, 58 and 47 B, (red, green and blue respectively) and the Corning 7 - 54, ultraviolet. White light was also used. A tungsten lamp of constant intensity, combined with a ground glass and two inch opal glass disk diffuser produced a source of uniform illumination. Normally exposed sensitometric strips were then subject to laten sification by exposure to radiation in which the spectral region, intensity, and time were varied. Each emulsion was subject to four spectral regions plus white light and four intensity levels for each region. The exposure was then extended over a range of time believed sufficient to reach a peak speed increase for that intensity. Reciprocity failure was sufficient to need considerable attention. The characteristic curves were analyzed by measuring ASA, halfgamma and inertia (H & D) speeds. The speed ratios (latensified speed/control speed) obtained for each spectral region, intensity, and time of exposure were compiled. Curves of speed ratio against time of exposure and fog level against required exposure time for each intensity and spectral region were plotted. These experiments have shown that white light may be used most efficiently in latensification with the panchromatic emulsions tested. In addition to this {{it has been shown that}} the short wavelength region is less effective in producing speed gains than is the long wavelength region. It has been explained that these effects may be due primarily to the greater scattering of the blue and ultra-violet light by the emulsion even though the Gurney-Mott theory of latent image formation would indicate otherwise if these other influences were n ot considered. The overall evaluation attests to the fact that the effect of wavelength is a secondary consideration as compared to the intensity of radiation used to latensify the emulsion. Optimum intensity, when applied with the proper length of exposure time to produce a fog lievel approximately double the normal fog, is the major factor leading to optimum conditions of speed gain. The maximum speed ratio gains achieved for each emulsion were Royal Pan 2. 24, Aerial Recon 1. 85, Plus X 2. 08, and Microfile 7. 35. Generally speaking the slower the emulsion the better the gains which may be achieved. Royal Pan, however, was an exception and produced unexpected results in speed gain. The results obtained with Microfile indicate this fine grain emulsion may possibly be employed in miniature camera systems for use in aerial photography. A less active developer than normally used D- 11 must be used to reduce contrast to a comparable degree ordinarily used in aerial photography. The effect of forced development in D- 11 was found not to produce speed gains as high as the less active development in D- 23, Development in Microdol (1 : 4) proved of little interest as speed loss was excessive. This speed loss is characteristic of most true fine-grain developers...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} various wave lengths of visible {{light in the}} {{stimulation}} of single visual sense cells has been studied {{by means of the}} single fiber preparation from the eye of Limulus. Oscillographic records were made of the impulse discharge in a single optic nerve fiber in response to stimulation of the attached sense cell by lights of different wave lengths. <b>Wratten</b> monochromatic <b>filters</b> supplied the means for obtaining the different spectral lights; the total intensity supplied to the eye being determined by a thermopile and galvanometer. With lights of approximately equal energy content the strongest response occurs to the green region of the spectrum. The response, however, does not vary qualitatively with wave length. By the proper adjustment of intensity, responses can be obtained which are identical, impulse for impulse, for all the spectral lights used. Moreover the ratios of the intensities for the various wave lengths necessary to produce a constant response do not vary with the intensity level of the stimulating lights; there is no Purkinje effect. The single visual sense cell can gauge brightness but cannot distinguish wave length. The reciprocals of the intensities necessary to produce a constant response when plotted against wave length give the visibility curve for the single sense cell. This curve is symmetrical about a maximum at λ 520 mµ, falling off to low values in the red and violet. It closely resembles the visibility curve for human rod vision. Bundles from the optic nerve containing several active fibers whose impulses can be distinguished by differences in form and magnitude or whose attached sense cells can be located and illuminated independently were used to determine whether there is any differential sensitivity among sense cells in the same eye for different regions of the spectrum. Such a differential sensitivity has been found to exist in the eye of Limulus and may be considered a peripheral mechanism of color vision...|$|R
40|$|A simple direct fluorometric {{method for}} rapid {{identification}} of group A streptococci is described. The method permits {{the detection of}} the organism in mixed cultures {{without the aid of}} a microscope and is amenable to automated processing of specimens. Experience with the indirect fluorometric method revealed that nontrypsinized cells from a 10 -fold dilution of overnight broth cultures could be stained with uniform brilliance with fluorescent antibody (1 : 15 dilution) and that fluorescent antibody dissociated from such cells at 55 C for 20 min gave serologically specific fluorometric values. With this information, it was possible to develop a simpler fluorometric test which gave results comparable to those obtained by conventional cultural-precipitin grouping techniques. In the direct test described, cultures from throat swabs were incubated overnight, and cells from a 10 -fold dilution were stained with specific fluorescent antibody (1 : 50 dilution) and then rinsed. The stained specimens were transferred to a continuous-filter paper strip (Whatman 3 MM) and read serially in a Turner 110 fluorometer with Corning 5840 and <b>Wratten</b> 2 A <b>filters</b> in place. The reagents used required careful standardization and testing to assure that fluorometric readings above a specified value would be indicative of the presence of group A streptococci...|$|R
