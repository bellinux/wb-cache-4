40|$|This paper compares machine {{learning}} techniques for detecting malicious <b>webpages.</b> The conventional method of detecting malicious <b>webpages</b> {{is going through}} the black list and checking whether the <b>webpages</b> are listed. Black list {{is a list of}} <b>webpages</b> which are classified as malicious from a user’s point of view. These black lists are created by trusted organizations and volunteers. They are then used by modern web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. However, black list is ineffective because of the frequent-changing nature of <b>webpages,</b> growing numbers of <b>webpages</b> that pose scalability issues and the crawlers’ inability to visit intranet <b>webpages</b> that require computer operators to log in as authenticated users. In this paper therefore alternative and novel approaches are used by applying {{machine learning}} algorithms to detect malicious <b>webpages.</b> In this paper three supervised machine learning techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Classifier, and two unsupervised machine learning techniques such as K-Means and Affinity Propagation are employed. Please note that K-Means and Affinity Propagation have not been applied to detection of malicious <b>webpages</b> by other researchers. All these machine learning techniques have been used to build predictive models to analyze large number of malicious and safe <b>webpages.</b> These <b>webpages</b> were downloaded by a concurrent crawler taking advantage of gevent. The <b>webpages</b> were parsed and various features such as content, URL and screenshot of <b>webpages</b> were extracted to feed into the machine learning models. Computer simulation results have produced an accuracy of up to 98 % for the supervised techniques and silhouette coefficient of close to 0. 96 for the unsupervised techniques. These predictive models have been applied in a practical context whereby Google Chrome can harness the predictive capabilities of the classifiers that have the advantages of both the lightweight and the heavyweight classifiers...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{resource}} constraints, {{search engines}} usually have difficulties keeping the local database completely synchronized with the Web. To detect as many changes as possible, the crawler {{used by a}} search engine {{should be able to}} predict the change behavior of <b>webpages</b> so that it can use the limited resource to download those <b>webpages</b> that are most likely to change. Towards this goal, we propose using sampling approach at the level of a cluster. We first group all the local <b>webpages</b> into different clusters such that each cluster contains <b>webpages</b> with similar change patterns. We then sample <b>webpages</b> from each cluster to estimate the change frequency of all the <b>webpages</b> in that cluster, and the cluster containing <b>webpages</b> with higher change frequency will be revisited more often by our crawler. We run extensive experiments on a real Web data set of about 300, 000 distinct URLs distributed among 210 websites. The results show that by applying our clustering algorithm, pages with similar change patterns are effectively clustered together. Our proposal significantly outperforms the comparators by improving the average freshness of the local database...|$|R

Our questions are; what information about gender, sexual preference and sexual limits are presented on the <b>WebPages</b> RFSU, RFSL and UMO, and what similarities and differences can be identified and how can these be analyzed from a queer perspective? Our material was collected from the three <b>WebPages</b> and categorized according to three topics of interest; gender, sexual preference and sexual limits. Our analyses are based on queer theory and former research in the field. We found a number of topics and interesting information which were categorized under new headlines. Our conclusion is that the topics mentioned on the <b>WebPages</b> are in most of the cases homogenous. On the theme gender we found that the categories man and woman were prominent. In the discussion about gender we found that all three <b>WebPages</b> only wrote about hetero-, homo- and bisexuality.

5|$|Major-thirds tuning was {{introduced}} in 1964 by jazz-guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, ArnoldSchoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of {{his work as a}} session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a <b>webpage</b> with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.|$|E

40|$|Background: The World Wide Web is {{a source}} to a wealth of health {{information}} that was previously unavailable to lay people. Formal studies have raised concerns about the credibility of online materials on the Web; {{most of them have}} been performed on English-language websites. Objectives: To investigate the credibility of Norwegian-language lay information about the effects of interventions on the World Wide Web. Methods: I performed a cross-sectional study of Norwegian lay health <b>webpages</b> on two specific topics: 1) Effect of low glycemic diets for weight reduction. 2) Effects of taking extra calcium supplementation during pregnancy to prevent pre-eclampsia and other related outcomes. <b>Webpages</b> were identified via four search engines and SMIL. Information on the included <b>webpages</b> was compared to the results of Cochrane reviews. I used a set of commonly used technical criteria to evaluate the transparency of webpages/sites. Furthermore, I compared the <b>Webpages</b> compliance with the criteria to their accuracy scores {{to see if there was}} an association between accuracy (information credibility) and the technical criteria (surface credibility). Results: 56 <b>webpages</b> were included, 49 from commercial providers. Overall, only above 40 % of the <b>webpages</b> were evaluated as accurate. The low glycemic diets web pages were more inaccurate than the calcium supplementation <b>webpages.</b> There were no apparent differences between accurate <b>webpages</b> and inaccurate <b>webpages</b> in complying with the technical criteria. Conclusion: Lay health information on the Web seems to be inaccurate, unclear and sometimes inconsistent. Technical criteria will not sufficiently distinguish accurate materials from inaccurate materials. Further research is needed on other, more clinical topics to ensure the inclusion of public agency websites. Master i bibliotek- og informasjonsvitenska...|$|R
5|$|The {{game has}} {{generated}} several controversies {{related to its}} violence and depiction of women. A mission that requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste. The mission also received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups. The game became subject to widespread online debate over its portrayal of women, particularly {{in the wake of}} backlash against GameSpot journalist Carolyn Petit when she claimed the game was misogynistic in her review. After Petit's review <b>webpage</b> received more than 20,000 largely negative comments, many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism. Television personality Karen Gravano and actress Lindsay Lohan both filed lawsuits against Rockstar in allegation that characters in the game were based on their likenesses. Their lawsuits were later dismissed. Australian department store Target pulled the game from their 300 stores following a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game.|$|E

Web plays dynamic role because it {{contains}} vast data as collection of large number of <b>WebPages</b> and every second new pages are added, updated and deleted in web. Retrieving efficient, relevant and meaningful information from this large source of information is very challenging job. Every search engine applies an algorithm to large number of <b>WebPages</b> in search results which calculators rank of every <b>WebPages</b> and ensure that most efficient and relevant <b>WebPages</b> as per query made by user appear first in search results. In this paper We have analyzed few algorithms which uses link structure or web structure mining and few algorithms which uses web content mining for calculating the page rank value of <b>WebPages</b> and proposed one algorithm which uses both web structure mining as well as web content mining as hybrid for calculating the page rank value of <b>WebPages.</b> This gives better and efficient results as compare to other and overcome some limitations of web structure mining based algorithms...|$|R

We aimed {{to assess the}} quality of online patient information {{relating to}} both. MethodsThe Google search engine was searched for “carotid endarterectomy” and “carotid stenting”. The first 50 <b>webpages</b> returned were assessed. The Gunning Fog Index (GFI) and Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) were calculated to assess readability. The LIDA tool (Minervation Ltd., Oxford, U. K.) {{was used to assess}} accessibility, usability and reliability. Results 20 % (n =  10) of the <b>webpages</b> returned for CEA were from peer reviewed sources with 34 % (n =  17) posted by hospitals or health services. Comparatively, for CAS, 40 % (n =  20) were peer reviewed with 16 % (n =  8) posted by hospitals or health services. GFI and FRES scores indicated <b>webpages</b> for both CEA and CAS had poor general readability. <b>Webpages</b> for CEA were easier to read than those for CAS (mean FRES difference of 6. 7 (95 % CI 0. 51 to 12. 93, p =  0. 03).
