He stated later in life: [...] "I have fought sixty battles and I have learned nothing <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know at the beginning.

500|$|PopMatters {{journalist}} J.C. Maçek III wrote [...] "For {{fans who}} bought the toys, watched the cartoon and read the comics during the ‘80s and now have like-aged {{children of their own}} (all of <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and do), might I suggest proceeding to watch this fun film with your kids, but compromise so that you can leave the commentary track on. The film will remain a treat for the eyes, but you can more easily gloss over those parts that will make you apologize to your brain." ...|$|E
500|$|A day later, {{producer}} David Kahne stated on {{the same}} site that the leaked listing was bogus. In an interview with Billboard magazine in May 2007, McCartney said that the album's material was [...] "in some ways a little bit retrospective. Some of them are of now, some of them hark back to the past, {{but all of them}} are songs I'm very proud of." [...] McCartney played mandolin on the song [...] "Dance Tonight". He comments that [...] "In searching the instrument to try and find chords, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with the guitar when I was 14, probably, that freshness was brought back." [...] "Ever Present Past", which McCartney called [...] "personal", originally started out as a song called [...] "Perfect Lover". [...] "Ever Present Past" [...] also includes references to the Beatles. In June 2007, McCartney revealed that [...] "See Your Sunshine" [...] "is pretty much an out-and-out love song for Heather. A lot of the album was done before, during and after our separation. I didn't go back and take out any songs to do with her." [...] "You Tell Me" [...] is about McCartney's memories of his previous wife, Linda.|$|E

500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can see it again, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film that has nothing to offer but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E

2500|$|During a Simulchat in 1995, Michael Jackson stated: [...] "I wrote a {{book called}} Dancing the Dream. It was more autobiographical than Moonwalk, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with Mrs. Onassis. It wasn't full of gossip and scandal and all that trash that people write, so I don't think people paid much {{attention}} to it, but it came from my heart. It was essays, thoughts and things that I've thought about while on tour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Commodore Sloat took action. As {{he later}} {{recorded}} {{in a letter}} to Wood, [...] "The information you furnished me at Mazatlan from the City of Mexico, via Guadalajara, (at the risk of your life) was the only reliable information I received of that event, and which induced me to proceed immediately to California, and upon my own responsibility to take possession of that country, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> on 7 July 1846." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{student of}} mine [...] {{asked me to}} day {{to give him a}} reason for a fact <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know was a fact—and do not yet.

[...] After the first few mornings, however, I preferred {{to ride in the}} street carts, rather than listen to the rough, profane language which these boys used on their way to work. [...] And these boys were supposed to be civilized, having had good teachers and good education, yet they used the vilest of language, to <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care to listen.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Trade ministers {{representing}} {{most of the}} world's governments {{reached a}} deal that sets a deadline for eliminating subsidies of agricultural exports by 2013. The final declaration from the talks, which resolved several issues that have {{stood in the way}} of a global trade agreement, also requires industrialized countries to open their markets to goods from the world's poorest nations, a goal of the United Nations for many years. The declaration gave fresh impetus for negotiators to try to finish a comprehensive set of global free trade rules by the end of 2006. Director-general Pascal Lamy said, [...] "I now believe it is possible, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not a month ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, Eisner, in his {{sideline}} as a comics packager, {{created the}} feature [...] "Secret Files of Dr. Drew" [...] for Fiction House. Grandenetti said Eisner instructed him to draw it [...] "in the Eisner style. [...] <b>Which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> badly. [...] Anyway, {{after a couple}} of stories I began to do my own thing". The eight-page story [...] "The Strange Case of the Absent Floor" [...] in Rangers Comics #47 (June 1949), which he both penciled and inked, marked Grandenetti's first credited comics art, and he remained on the feature (scripted by Eisner's office manager and future journalist Marilyn Mercer) through #60 (Aug. 1951). Grandenetti also drew [...] "Senorita Rio" [...] stories for the same publisher's Fight Comics.|$|E

2500|$|God speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor {{enter into}} the {{courtroom}} confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence. Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: [...] "Where were you when I laid {{the foundations of the}} earth?" [...] Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly. In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge [...] "of things beyond me <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and [...] "therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fiennes {{stated that}} he had two weeks to shoot the climactic {{showdown}} scene where he is gloating over a terrified Harry, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fiennes said with a chuckle: [...] "I have no doubt children will be afraid of me now if they weren't before." [...] In preparation, he read the novel Goblet of Fire, but jokingly conceded: [...] "I was only interested in my scene, and I {{had to go through}} thousands and thousands of other scenes <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> dutifully, until I got to my scene and I read it many, many, many, many, many times and that was my research." [...] Fiennes reprised his role as Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 and Part 2.|$|E
2500|$|In a May 2011 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Cramer {{explained that he}} was unprepared for Stewart's intense interview, saying [...] "As soon as he started, I realized Stewart was on a mission to make me look like a clown. I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? Get mad? I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and made me into a buffoon... They wanted to make me the Face of the Era, and they succeeded. Rick Santelli's a conservative. Ideological. O.K., I get that. But me? I was very anti-Bush. I'm a Democrat, I've got the canceled checks to prove it, and suddenly I'm the enemy? Me? Me?" ...|$|E
