50|$|The main {{activity}} of the Trust {{takes place at the}} Talyllyn Railway Wharf Station. Inside the Museum interactive and static exhibits illustrate the diversity, individuality, technical ingenuity and charm of narrow-gauge railways. The fleet of historic wagons kept outside is operational and the original <b>wagon</b> <b>weighbridge</b> from 1865 has been restored and included in a redeveloped section of the Wharf yard including a purpose built weighbridge hut.|$|E
50|$|Also {{located within}} the railway yard is the Westinghouse Brake Examination Pit and shelter. It {{comprises}} a modest corrugated iron building with a barrel vaulted corrugated iron roof covering a long rectangular brick-lined pit. The building contains boards detailing brake examination schedules, and a workbench.Other yard structures include Signal Cabin A, a water crane and a <b>wagon</b> <b>weighbridge.</b> Signal Cabin A is a two-storeyed chamferboard-clad building with pitched corrugated iron roofs, a cantilevered timber catwalk overlooking the railway at first floor level. The building contains intact but disconnected mechanical signalling equipment. The first floor contains a large frame of colour-coded mechanical steel signalling levers, timber and brass track indicators, and a yard diagram. The Water Crane comprises a cast iron hollow tube surmounted by a rotating cast iron feeder arm with valve controls and a canvas tube attached, mounted on a concrete pedestal and adjacent to a concrete drain. The <b>Wagon</b> <b>Weighbridge</b> comprises a large steel scale housed in chamferboard-clad building with a pitched corrugated iron roof, and a large metal balance plate.|$|E
50|$|The Toowoomba Railway Station, Honour Board and Railway Yard Structures {{complex is}} located on Railway Street, within walking {{proximity}} of the Toowoomba town centre. The Railway Station complex comprises the main station building, awnings and outbuildings, and several yard structures. The station building consists of adjoining two-storeyed rendered masonry buildings with single storeyed annexes and outbuildings with corrugated iron roofs. The buildings line {{the edge of a}} concrete platform, which is covered with corrugated iron canopies, and which extends out beyond the main buildings to the north and the south. The buildings comprise the central Station Building (1874) connecting to the Railway Refreshment Room Wing (1902), the Tea Room extension (1915) and Honour Roll pavilion (1918) to the north, and annexes and platform outbuildings to the south. The yard structures, located to the north-east of the station building, include a substantial corrugated iron and timber Goods Shed, a two-storeyed signalling shed known as Cabin A, modest timber and corrugated iron structures associated with maintenance and worker accommodation, the brick Westinghouse Brake Examination pit and corrugated iron shelter, a <b>wagon</b> <b>weighbridge</b> and timber shelter, and a cast iron water crane. The complex also includes two WWII bomb shelters.|$|E
50|$|A pair of railway <b>wagon</b> <b>weighbridges</b> existed side by side, {{outside the}} weigh bridge office (that still exists) {{next to the}} railway {{crossing}} at the road entrance to Minffordd exchange sidings and to the volunteers' hostel. The remains of these weighbridges rest in two slate wagons in the yard. The weighbridge office underwent a major refurbishment in 2007-08.|$|R
50|$|Not {{much detail}} is {{available}} on the post-Joint Stock lives of brake van 58. However, it is known that No.58 was later converted to a <b>weighbridge</b> <b>wagon</b> (fixed at a certain weight for calibration purposes).|$|R
5000|$|Facilities {{for goods}} traffic {{were on the}} Up side (the side for {{passengers}} toward London): a 100 ft loading bank which could hold four wagons, a 65 ft goods shed with a 30 long cwt kg crane where a further three wagons could be held, with capacity for a further thirteen on the Worcester side of the shed. A signal box was added in 1907, which controlled access to the goods shed {{as well as to}} the refuge siding on the Down side which held 46 <b>wagons.</b> A 5-ton <b>weighbridge</b> was located on the Up side near the goods shed and main station building; this was replaced in 1938 by a 10-ton model which cost £160 (£ in [...] ). The Down platform was 396 ft long, while the Up platform was shorter at 270 ft. The main station building on the Up platform was timber-built and originally designed by Brunel, with the construction being completed by John Fowler. On the Down side a wooden waiting shelter was provided, behind which was the station house constructed in alternating courses of red and grey bricks.|$|R
