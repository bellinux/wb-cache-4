However, in the high carbon steel <b>wire</b> <b>drawing,</b> the <b>wire</b> temperature rises greatly as the drawing speed increase.

To investigate the effect of prior cold working on spheroidization of the <b>drawn</b> <b>wire,</b> spheroidization annealing was conducted at subcritical temperature of 705 oC for 2 h for both processes.

40|$|Eliminating a Major Cause of <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Breakage in A- 15 High-Field Superconductors Phase 1 Summary Purpose of the research: The Phase 1 {{goal was}} to make a {{significant}} improvement in the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology used for difficult to draw superconductor precursor composites. Many ductile Nb-Al and Nb-Sn precursor wire composites have experienced the onset of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage at about 1. 5 mm diameter. Phase 1 focused on evaluating the role that precision rigid guidance of the <b>wire</b> into the <b>drawing</b> die and the hydrostatic stress state at the die entrance played in preventing wire breakage. Research carried out: The research performed depended upon the construction of both a mechanical wire guide and a hydrostatic pressure stiffened wire guidance system. Innovare constructed the two wire guidance systems and tested them for their ability to reduce <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> breakage. One set of hardware provided rigid alignment of the wires to their <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> die axes within 0. 35 degrees using ''hydrostatic pressure stiffening'' to enable the precision guidance strategy to be implemented for these highly flexible small diameter wires. This apparatus was compared to a guide arrangement that used short span mechanical guide alignment with a misalignment limit of about 0. 75 degrees. Four A- 15 composite wires with breakage histories were drawn to evaluate the use of these wire guiding systems to reduce and/or eliminate wire breakage. Research findings and results: In Phase 1, a breakthrough in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology for A- 15 superconductor composites was achieved by dramatically limiting or eliminating breakage in four different A- 15 composite precursor wire designs during the drawing of these very desirable composites that previously could not be drawn to near final size. Research results showed that the proposed Phase 1 mechanical wire guides were sufficiently effective and successful in eliminating breakage when used along with other advanced <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology to justify the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station. New insights into the formation and growth of a shear type defect that causes breakage lead to improved drawing technology and it will be the basis for further study and improvements included in a Phase 2 proposal. Potential application of the research: This new capability now justifies the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station to replace the bulky, slower and research oriented equipment that currently uses four independent operations for each wire diameter reduction. In a Phase 2 proposal, the designs for each operation were to be optimized for their performance and so they could be used to integrate these individual operations into an Advanced <b>Wire</b> <b>Drawing</b> Station. This station will perform all the mechanical conditioning, cleaning, lubrication, guidance and drawing operations simultaneously and it will be tested to verify <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> performance targets.

One way in which wire manufacturers can meet this challenge is to possess a thorough understanding of deformation, friction and lubrication during the <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> process, and therefore to make good decisions regarding the selection and application of lubricants as well as the die design. Friction, lubrication and die design during <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> thus become the subject of this study. Although theoretical and experimental investigations have been being carried out ever since the establishment of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> technology, many problems remain unsolved. It is therefore necessary to conduct further research on traditional and fundamental subjects such as the mechanics of deformation, friction, lubrication and die design in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing.</b> Drawing experiments were carried out on an existing bull-block under different cross-sectional area reductions, different speeds and different lubricants.

A die box connected to the existing die holder for using dry soap lubricant was designed and tested.

Simultaneous optimization of damage and <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> force suggests a refined vision of the optimal die semi-angle concept.
