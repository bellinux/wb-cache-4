2500|$|In October 2006, Launch Radio Networks {{reported}} that Sully Erna has {{started working on}} his solo album. Although he wasn't exactly sure what shape it will take, Erna told Launch Radio Networks that [...] "I've been putting some thought into it," [...] he said. [...] "I actually have some stuff that I'm doing on the side right now. I don't know when I'm gonna kind of unleash something like that, and I don't know really what it's gonna be yet. I {{have a couple of}} different ideas, and I'm not sure what and when it's gonna happen, but of course Godsmack is our lifeblood and we don't have any plans on trying to break this thing up. But, you know, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> venture out a little bit and just do some side stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can't aid every one, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> aid Charley," [...] {{answered}} Laura. And {{then she}} and the others told of what had occurred at the post-office.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get hold}} of the money!" [...] cried Sam. [...] "For it belongs to us--at least two hundred and seventy-five dollars of it--not {{counting}} what he may have got on the diamonds and the cuff buttons." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Its {{dark and}} scary, and has {{all kinds of}} spooky stuff in it, {{including}} a moving occult hand that actually -- well, <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> spoil the surprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|REGINALD. <b>We</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{know whether}} a promise is a promise or not. Cant you answer {{yes or no}} without spoiling it and setting Hotchkiss here {{grinning}} like a Cheshire cat? If she puts on her veil and goes to Church, will you marry her? ...|$|R
5000|$|Smaller vessels were {{directed}} to abandon the search while four navy warships and two patrol boats continued the search for survivors. Sunaryo, a transport ministry maritime official, said, [...] "We are facing very bad weather and rough seas. <b>We</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take any risks by sending small boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us do it," [...] said Meg thoughtfully. [...] "It is {{only another}} name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do our best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but Carl, {{you don't}} {{mean to say}} you're {{going to give up}} your business, when you're doing so well? And {{aviation}} shows what you can do if you stick to a thing, Carl, and not just wander around like you used to do. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see you succeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything. We {{know how}} much {{influence}} your name has--one of the old Hatboro' names--in the community, and all that; and <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> interest the whole community in our scheme. We want to establish a Social Union for the work-people, don't you know, {{and we think it}} would be much nicer if it seemed to originate with the old village people." ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{publishing}} {{a very good}} review for their 1995 album Afraid of Sunlight and including it in their 50 Best Albums of 1995, Q refused to interview the band or write a feature on them. Steve Hogarth later said: [...] "How can they say, this is an amazing record... no, <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> talk to you? Its hard to take when they say, heres a very average record... well {{put you on the}} front cover." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{handbook}} focusses {{on environmental}} and beneficial animals. Aquatic ecosystems, birds, honeybees, silkworms end groundwater are selected as protection goals {{and for each}} of the protection the following three questions were answered: What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect? Where <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect? How strict <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect? For each protection goal risk assessment procedures are described...|$|R

6000|$|... "Call it {{what you}} will," [...] Mr. Gaynsforth continued, {{with an air of}} not having heard the interruption, [...] "we have the money and we want the information. You can give it to us if you like. We don't ask for too much. We don't even ask for the name of the man who {{committed}} these crimes. But <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know the nature of those papers, exactly what position Mr. Hamilton Fynes occupied in the Stamp and Excise Duty department at Washington, and, finally, what the mischief you are doing over here in Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] said she, [...] "we've {{got another}} thing to say; and it will seem queer to you after what we've said already. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go into fiction, but {{not the way we}} was in it before. The fact is that between us we've written a story, and we've brought it with us, hoping you wouldn't mind letting Jone read it to you. Of course we was expecting to read it to only two; but as we've got to go back to-day, if the rest of the folks don't mind, Jone can read it anyway." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{the whole}} of this process of the making and {{delivery}} of a shell, which is the main process of modern warfare, is {{one that can be}} far better conducted by a man accustomed to industrial organisation or transit work than by the old type of soldier. This is a thing that cannot be too plainly stated or too often repeated. Germany nearly won this way because of her tremendously modern industrial resources; but she blundered into it and she is losing it because she has too many men in military uniform and because their tradition and interests were to powerful with her. All the state and glories of soldiering, the bright uniforms, the feathers and spurs, the flags, the march-past, the disciplined massed advance, the charge; all these are as needless and obsolete now in war as the masks and shields of an old-time Chinese brave. Liberal-minded people talk of the coming dangers of militarism in the face of events that prove conclusively that professional militarism is already as dead as Julius Caesar. What is coming {{is not so much the}} conversion of men into soldiers as the socialisation of the economic organisation of the country with a view to both national and international necessities. We do not want to turn a chemist or a photographer into a little figure like a lead soldier, moving mechanically at the word of command, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make his chemistry or photography swiftly available if the national organisation is called upon to fight.|$|E

3000|$|What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{conserve}}? We have a choice. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> conserve {{the environment}} {{as it was in}} 1788, or <b>do</b> <b>we</b> yearn for an environment without man, as it might have been 30 000 or more years ago?

6000|$|No, no; {{the rules}} {{themselves}} must be altered. Time was, indeed, when {{people used to}} think they were made and ordained by divine authority. [...] "Cum privilegio" [...] was the motto of the captains. But we know very well now that every club settles its own standing orders, and that it can alter and modify them as fundamentally as it pleases. Lots of funny old saws are still uttered upon this subject--"There must always be rich and poor;" [...] "You can't interfere with economical laws;" [...] "If you were to divide up everything to-morrow, {{at the end of}} a fortnight you'd find the same differences and inequalities as ever." [...] The last-named argument (I believe it considers itself by courtesy an argument) is one which no self-respecting Radical should so much as deign to answer. Nobody that I ever heard of for one moment proposed to [...] "divide up everything," [...] or, for that matter, anything: and the imputation that somebody did or does is a proof either of intentional malevolence or of crass stupidity. Neither should be encouraged; and you encourage them by pretending to take them seriously. It is the initial injustices of the game that we Radicals object to--the injustices which prevent us from all starting fair and having our even chance of picking up a livelihood. We don't want to [...] "divide up everything"--a most futile proceeding; but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> untie the legs and release the arms of the handicapped players. To drop metaphor at last, it is the conditions we complain about. Alter the conditions, and there would be no need for division, summary or gradual. The game would work itself out spontaneously without your intervention.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1984 and 1985, after congressional {{committees}} began questioning training techniques {{being used by}} the CIA in Latin America, the 1983 manual went through substantial revision. In 1985 a page advising against using coercive techniques was inserted at the front of Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual. Handwritten changes were also introduced haphazardly into the text. For example, [...] "While we do not stress the use of coercive techniques, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make you aware of them and the proper way to use them", has been altered to, [...] "While we deplore the use of coercive techniques, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make you aware of them so that you may avoid them." [...] (p. A-2) But the entire chapter on coercive techniques is still provided with some items crossed out.|$|E

We do not attack the Flemings, but we intend to whip the flamingant exaggerations that threaten the integrity of the Belgian fatherland. We want also to clarify what the Walloons were in the past, what they carry out in the present, what they aspire for the future.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{song from}} 1981, [...] "SS-Staat" [...] ("SS State") on Kill the Hippies - Oi!, is (according to the band) [...] "a glaringly provocative anti-Nazi song." [...] Due to poor {{recording}} quality, the line [...] "SS-Staat im Staate, wir wollens nicht erleben" [...] ("SS {{state in the}} state, <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience it") can be misunderstood as [...] "SS-Staat im Staate, wir wollens mit erleben" [...] ("SS state in the state, we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> experience it").|$|R
5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} bands influences, Smith commented: <b>We</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get called a Radiohead rip-off band. I think Radiohead {{is a lot}} closer to my natural tendencies as a {{songwriter}} than a band like, um, Jethro Tull. I listen to way more Jethro Tull than I do Radiohead these days, but I could write 10 Radiohead songs before I could write one Jethro Tull song. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sound more like Jethro Tull, but I just cant. Thats a big struggle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make a Trekkies 3. In earnest, we’re {{hoping to}} get started in two more years. We have to time it with the rights and all the legal stuff. There’s a lot of {{politics}} involved. We approached CBS/Viacom/Paramount own various rights to Star Trek already and there’s interest. So fingers crossed. When producing these documentaries, I’m always delighted by the surprise at something we didn’t expect, such as the stories people tell and interacting with the fans, hearing stories. I never get tired of it..." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a January 2012 interview, Udaltsov {{called for}} [...] "a direct democracy, {{where the people}} would have their say through fair and {{transparent}} referendums, where they could interact with authorities using the Internet, where {{they could have a}} say in social reforms." [...] According to Udaltsov: [...] "We are not nostalgic about the Soviet Union, we do not argue for a return to a centrally planned economy where social initiative was stifled, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> preserve what was good in the Soviet system while adopting new paths to development; we want to see the social-democratic development of Russia." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{his release}} from Shrewsbury, Lomax went on trial with Conference National side Barrow, Dave Bayliss, manager of Barrow said, [...] "Kelvin is a lad <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> sign, we'll see what's in the budget and {{hopefully}} get something done." [...] On 12 August 2011, he completed his move to Barrow after his successful trial period. Just a day later, he made his debut for the club {{as part of a}} 1-1 draw with Tamworth. Just three days after his debut he was sent off in a 3-1 defeat to York City. After 26 appearances and no goals, he was released {{at the end of the}} 2011-12 season.|$|E

5000|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} film one star, stating, [...] "Cat, another over-blown Hollywood raid on Dr. Seuss, has a draw on Mike Myers, who inexplicably plays the Cat by {{mimicking}} Bert Lahr in The Wizard of Oz." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4 stars. Although he praised the production design, {{he considered the}} film to be [...] "all effects and stunts and CGI and prosthetics, with no room for lightness and joy". Ebert and co-host Richard Roeper gave the film [...] "Two Thumbs Down". Roeper said of Myers performance that [...] "Maybe {{a part of him}} was realizing as the movie was being made that a live-action version of The Cat in the Hat just wasnt a great idea." [...] Ebert had the same problem with the film that he had with How the Grinch Stole Christmas, in that [...] "If there is one thing Ive learned from these two movies is that <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see Jim Carrey as a Grinch, and <b>we</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see Mike Myers as a cat. These are talented comedians, lets see them do their stuff, dont bury them under a ton of technology." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2014, former Federal {{resources}} and energy minister Martin Ferguson was appointed {{as chairman of}} the UCL Australia board. Ferguson is an advocate for nuclear power in Australia. UCL Australia's Chief Executive David Travers said of Ferguson's appointment: [...] "UCL doesn’t want to be large in Australia, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be influential and welcome Martin to the team to help us achieve these goals.”Also in 2014, James [...] "Jim" [...] Voss, a senior nuclear engineer and Fellow of the UK Nuclear Institute was appointed Honorary Reader at UCL Australia's International Energy Policy Institute. He had previously served in the Executive Office of the President of the United States under two Presidents and advised senior government officials in other countries. He is also a former Managing Director of Pangea Resources, the proponent of a proposal to establish a nuclear waste dump in Australia in the late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Okuyo {{received}} negative criticism, {{even from}} friends for acting in The River and the Mountain, a play whose parts Uganda's Media Council ruled [...] "implicitly promote homosexual acts". Written by Oxford-educated poet Beau Hopkins {{in collaboration with}} David Cecil, a British producer and the manager of Tilapia (Cultural Centre where the play ran for a week until 23 August 2012), it was deemed contrary to the laws, cultural norms and values of Uganda hence Cecil's arrest on 6 September 2012. In the play, Okuyo plays Samson, a homosexual factory owner killed by his own workers after they are incited by fiercely conservative pastors. Okuyo was accused of [...] "being funded by gay lobby groups", but replied, [...] "I am not into gay advocacy. Although with this play, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make people {{understand that we are}} all human. We should not judge, segregate, harm or kill others." ...|$|E

Or <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a community that is aware it’s not innocent, that does not see its internal conflicts as weak points and is a community that does not need enemies and scapegoats to build its unity.
