5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E

5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia with Love had an effect on the novel The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|Following The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun, {{producer}} Harry Saltzman {{sold his}} 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems, {{brought about by}} financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, {{in which he had}} invested heavily. The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Ian Fleming wrote The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1964, {{completing}} {{it by the}} beginning of March. His health affected him badly during the writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words a morning to a little over an hour's worth of work a day.|$|E

5|$|In 1947 a Belgian film {{adaptation}} of The Crab <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Claws was produced, and believing that cinematic adaptations {{were a good}} way to proceed, Hergé contacted Disney Studios in the United States; they declined his offer to adapt The Adventures of Tintin for the silver screen.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the {{animation}} company Belvision Studios produced {{a string of}} colour adaptations based upon Hergé's original comics, adapting eight of the Adventures {{into a series of}} daily five-minute episodes. The Crab <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Claws was the fifth such story to be adapted, being directed by Ray Goossens and written by Greg, himself a well-known cartoonist who in later years would become editor-in-chief of Tintin magazine.|$|E
5|$|In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye {{for what}} {{proved to be}} his last holiday and wrote {{the first draft of}} The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun. He was {{dissatisfied}} with it and wrote to William Plomer, the copy editor of his novels, asking for it to be rewritten. Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.|$|E

5|$|James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first {{appeared}} on film in The Man <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Gun, although in an un-credited capacity. Villiers presumed he would {{play the role of}} M in subsequent films and was disappointed not to be asked; the producers thought him too young for the role and wanted an actor in his 70s.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{his novels}} were {{initially}} serialized, {{like those of}} Dickens. Their length was not predetermined. Illusions Perdues extends to a thousand pages after starting inauspiciously in a small-town print shop, whereas La Fille aux yeux d'or (The Girl <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Golden</b> Eyes, 1835) opens with a broad panorama of Paris but becomes a closely plotted novella of only fifty pages.|$|E
