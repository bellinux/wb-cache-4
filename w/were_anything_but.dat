Among the most notable of these endorsements came from Andrew Sullivan and Paul Craig Roberts, while a series of editorials in Pat Buchanan's The American Conservative magazine made a conservative case for several candidates, with Scott McConnell formally endorsing Kerry, and Justin Raimondo giving the nod to independent Ralph Nader.|$|E

Aérospatiale {{in the middle of}} the contest then tipped its hand by suddenly redubbing its offering as the AS532 Cougar.

500|$|A few critics {{disagree}} with the speculation over Giraud's and Byron's relationship. The early 20th-century biographer Ethel Mayne points out both the frequency of such relationships in Byron's life and their inherent ambiguity when she says, [...] "His stay was also marked by one of those ambiguous friendships with a youth infinitely below him in rank which have already been seen to recur in his life... The patron {{was supposed to be}} learning Italian from this made a pretext for giving him, on their parting at Malta in 1811... a considerable sum of money". Elizabeth Longford, in her 1976 biography, disagrees with the claims that there was a physical relationship between the two and argues, [...] "Byron's especial favourite among the 'ragazzi' was Nicolo Giraud. He had first taken up with Nicolo while Hobhouse was away in Euboea the year before, but {{there is no evidence that}} his feelings for Nicolo <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> romantic and protective." [...] Jerome Christensen followed this view in 1993 and adds, [...] "we know little more than what Byron tells us".|$|E

[...] A concentration of later Khmer inscriptions in southern Cambodia may suggest the even earlier presence of a Khmer population.

In real crises they could be generous, but in ordinary affairs of life they <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> kind ... Dickinson and Forster were not really Bloomsbury.

2500|$|Milton wrote {{during a}} period when {{thoughts}} about divorce <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> simplistic; rather, there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time. However, Milton's basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals, particularly the Westminster divines. Milton addressed the Assembly {{on the matter of}} divorce in August 1643, at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter. In the , Milton argued that divorce was a private matter, not a legal or ecclesiastical one. Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas. In fact, when the Westminster Assembly wrote the [...] they allowed for divorce (...) in cases of infidelity or abandonment. Thus, the Christian community, at least a majority within the 'Puritan' sub-set, approved of Milton's views.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{denied that}} the songs <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> about {{personal}} experience, and were not about the United States. It quickly became the fastest selling album that Morrison had recorded {{at that time and}} went gold within three months. Relocating to Europe within a few years, his work during the 1980s would not be so [...] "radio friendly" [...] and easily accessible to the casual listener. With the success of Wavelength Morrison assembled a band to promote it, which was similar in many ways to the abandoned Caledonia Soul Orchestra of It's Too Late to Stop Now fame. During the Wavelength tour, Morrison performed in his native Belfast [...] {{for the first time since}} leaving for the US to record [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] for Bang Records. Morrison's first video, Van Morrison in Ireland, released in 1981, resulted from these performances and featured two songs from the album: [...] "Wavelength" [...] and [...] "Checkin' It Out".|$|E
2500|$|But despite {{continuing}} technological advances, {{from the}} 1870s onward, {{the idea that}} history and civilization were inherently progressive, and that progress was always good, came under increasing attack. Arguments arose that {{the values of the}} artist and those of society were not merely different, but that Society was antithetical to Progress, and could not move forward in its present form. The philosopher Schopenhauer (1788–1860) (The World as Will and Representation, 1819) called into question the previous optimism, and his ideas had an important influence on later thinkers, including Nietzsche. Two of the most significant thinkers of the period were biologist Charles Darwin (1809–82), author of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859), and political scientist Karl Marx (1818–83), author of Das Kapital (1867). Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection undermined religious certainty and the idea of human uniqueness. In particular, the notion that human beings were driven by the same impulses as [...] "lower animals" [...] proved to be difficult to reconcile with the idea of an ennobling spirituality. Karl Marx argued that there were fundamental contradictions within the capitalist system, and that the workers <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> free.|$|E

2500|$|De Ovies's time as Dean Emeritus {{became a}} time of accolades {{bestowed}} on him by the Cathedral. [...] In 1950 Dr. Henry Noble was commissioned to create a bronze bust of Dean de Ovies to commemorate his service to the Cathedral. [...] His retirement years <b>were</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> quiet with de Ovies assisting in setting up the Georgian Clinic {{for the treatment of}} alcoholics in 1953, serving in the role as director of religious therapy in counseling individuals undergoing rehabilitation there. [...] In 1958 de Ovies began writing a column for the Metropolitan Herald, an Atlanta weekly newspaper. [...] De Ovies was {{on the cutting edge of}} treating alcoholism as a treatable illness and his book Dear Drunks published in 1958 was an outgrowth of his sessions treating alcoholics and an effort to de-stigmatize alcoholism and its treatment in an era when most people saw alcoholism as a person failing or a lack of self-control or discipline. [...] That same April the magazine Pastoral Psychology named de Ovies it's [...] "Man of the Month" [...] for his work as chaplain of the Peachtree Sanitarium and at the Georgian Clinic.|$|E
