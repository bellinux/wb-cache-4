40|$|We {{consider}} a four-dimensional field-theory model with two massless fermions, coupled to an Abelian vector field <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> mixing, and to another Abelian vector field with flavour mixing. Both Abelian vectors have a Lorentz-violating kinetic term, introducing a Lorentz-violation mass scale $M$, from which fermions and the flavour-mixing vector get their dynamical masses, whereas the vector coupled <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> mixing remains massless. When the two coupling constants have similar values {{in order of}} magnitude, a mass hierarchy pattern emerges, in which one fermion is very light compared to the other, whilst the vector mass {{is larger than the}} mass of the heavy fermion. The work presented here may be considered as a Lorentz-symmetry-Violating alternative to the Higgs mechanism, in the sense that no scalar particle (fundamental or composite) is necessary for the generation of the vector-meson mass. However, the model is not realistic given that, as a result of Lorentz Violation, the maximal (light-cone) speed seen by the fermions is smaller than that of the massless gauge boson (which equals the speed of light in vacuo) by an amount which is unacceptably large to be compatible with the current tests of Lorentz Invariance, unless the gauge couplings assume unnaturally small values. Possible ways out of this phenomenological drawback are briefly discussed, postponing a detailed construction of more realistic models for future work.

40|$|We study N= 2 supersymmetric Yang [...] Mills {{theory in}} four {{dimensions}} and then compactify it on R^ 3 × S^ 1. The gauge symmetry {{of the theory}} is broken by a vacuum expectation value of the scalar field, which parametrises the moduli space. The spectrum of BPS states, carrying electric and magnetic charges, is piece-wise constant, changing only when the vacuum expectation value crosses the so-called walls of marginal stability. Kontsevich and Soibelman proposed an algebraic construction relating BPS spectra {{on both sides of}} a wall of marginal stability. These formulae are known to correctly relate the strong- and weak-coupling spectra in theories with gauge group SU(2) with and without fundamental flavours; we generalise this result to gauge group SU(n) <b>without</b> <b>flavours</b> in the weak-coupling regime. In addition, we find the walls of marginal stability in the SU(n) theory {{at the root of the}} Higgs branch and, employing the wall-crossing formula, determine the BPS spectrum in all regions of the moduli space. Gaiotto, Moore, and Neitzke (GMN) proposed an ansatz expressing the moduli space metric of N= 2 theory on R^ 3 × S^ 1 in terms of a set of integral equations. Using the GMN ansatz, we find perturbative and instanton corrections in R^ 3 × S^ 1 for gauge group SU(2) with or <b>without</b> <b>flavours</b> and for gauge group SU(n) <b>without</b> <b>flavours.</b> For gauge group SU(n), we also demonstrate that the predicted two-instanton metric is continuous across the walls.

The Flavour and CP violation in experimental data follows a hierarchical pattern, accounted by the Standard Model. We define the Minimal Flavour Violation condition with six spurions in effective field theories, implying Flavour and CP violation entirely dependent on the fermion mixing matrices but independent of the fermion masses hierarchy; it is renormalization-group invariant.

Each region can lead to distinct leptonic signatures from squark-gluino events during the early LHC experiments (integrated luminosity ∼ 10 fb^- 1 or even smaller). In the much studied stau-LSP coannihilation region with a vanishing common trilinear coupling (A_ 0) at the GUT scale a large fraction of the final states contain electrons and / or muons and e - μ - τ universality holds to a good approximation. In the not so well studied scenarios with non-vanishing A_ 0 both LSP pair annihilation and stau-LSP coannihilation could contribute significantly to the dark matter relic density for even smaller squark-gluino masses. Our simulations indicate that the corresponding signatures are final states rich in τ-leptons while final states with electrons and muons are suppressed leading to a violation of lepton universality. These features may be observed {{to a lesser extent}} even in the modified {{parameter space}} (with non-zero A_ 0) where the coannihilation process dominates.

New butter with flaxseed additive and flaxseed additive technology were developed by us. The suspension microstructure of flaxseed additive was studied. It was revealed that microstructure of flaxseed additive is multicomponent and structured system. It consists of uninterrupted phase of polysaccharides solution and structural elements such as particles of flaxseed, globules and areas with a cellular structure from polygonal cells. As a result the mechanism of microstructure suspension formation was proposed. It has a few stages. They are the formation of dispersion of globules, the aggregation of globules and formation of areas with a cellular structure. Sensory evaluation has shown that butter with flaxseed additive has pure creamy flavour and odor <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> and odor of additive, yellow color and good spreadability and plasticity.

One of the goals of these analyses was to investigate which model is capable of obtaining large mixing induced CP asymmetry in the B_s system, S_{psi phi}, and to find out what this would imply for other flavour observables. In this context also the rare decays B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^- have been considered. In some models their branching ratios can be enhanced by orders of magnitude above the SM expectations. The recent data on S_{psi phi} and B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- from the LHCb put an end to these very optimistic hopes modifying significantly the allowed patterns of deviations from SM predictions for flavour observables in concrete BSM models. We make a first semi-quantitative assessment of the most important modifications in the predictions of the BSM models in question including also recently analyzed models and taking into account the most recent lattice input.

The mean subject multiplicity and the differential and integrated jet shape, describing the distribution of the transverse energy inside the jet, have been measured for jets with E_T"j"e"t #>=# 6 GeV and - 1 #=# 3. 0 GeV and vertical stroke #eta#(D"*) vertical stroke ## D" 0 (#-># K"-#pi#"+) #pi#_a"+ (and the charge-conjugate channel) have been measured with the ZEUS central tracking detector (CTD). The closest jet in azimuth to the D"* meson is tagged and the internal structure of the second jet, which in most of the events also originates from a charm (or anti-charm) quark, is investigated. The E_T"j"e"t and #eta#"j"e"t dependence of the measured jet substructure has been studied and compared with the predictions from leading-logarithm parton-shower Monte Carlo programs. In addition, a measurement of the internal jet structure for inclusive (i. e. <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> tagging) dijets in photoproduction, at much lower E_T"j"e"t compared with previous analyses, has been performed. In particular, it has been observed that the jets in the inclusive sample become broader as #eta#"j"e"t increases whereas the charm initiated jets do not. This is consistent with the predicted fractions of quark and gluon initiated jets in photoproduction processes. The internal structure of gluon jets has been extracted with a statistical method using the measurements for the inclusive dijet and the charm-enriched jet samples for E_T"j"e"t #>=# 15 GeV. It is observed that gluon jets have a higher mean subjet multiplicity and are broader than quark jets of the same E_T"j"e"t which is in agreement with pQCD predictions.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{investigations}} are described of {{the identification of}} aroma compounds which are formed {{as a result of}} oxidative deterioration of butter during cold storage, producing a typical trainy (fishy) off-flavour. As these flavour defects are caused chiefly by autoxidative breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, it was also studied which fatty acids may act as precursors in the formation of these off-flavours. For this purpose the volatile odorous compounds formed in the autoxidation of pure unsaturated fatty acids were identified and compared with the compounds formed in butter with cold-storage defects. In the introductory chapter (I), a survey is given of results obtained in previous investigations concerning the aroma compounds in butter with coldstorage defects. Aliphatic carbonyl compounds in particular are considered to be responsible for these flavour defects, but these components were isolated only from washed cream and sweet-cream butter, and not from cold-stored butter made from soured cream. In addition, several classes of compounds such as carbonyl compounds with double bonds not in conjunction with the carbonyl group and cis/trans -isomers have been overlooked in previous investigations, because of inadequate analytical techniques. In Chapter II a survey is given of the mechanisms of autoxidation of fatty acids. The mechanisms are discussed of the radical chain reactions leading to the formation of hydroperoxides, and of the dismutation of these compounds to secondary autoxidation products. The latter reactions are of particular interest, as they result in the formation of aroma compounds which may cause flavour defects. In Table 2 a survey is given of the hydroperoxides and the secondary oxidation products that may be expected in the autoxidation of a number of unsaturated fatty acids, and of those which were actually found in previous investigations. Chapter III deals with flavour defects observed in autoxidized food lipids in general and cold-storage defects of butter in particular. First of all, the organoleptic properties and flavour threshold values are given of many secondary autoxidation products (see Table 3) which have very low flavour threshold values and highly repugnant odours. Secondly, autoxidation experiments are described which indicate the contribution of various unsaturated fatty acids to autoxidation off-flavours. Thirdly, the generation of oxidation defects in lipid-containing foods, and the effect of several factors on this type of deterioration, are discussed. Finally, special attention is paid to the development of cold-storage defects in butter. The main factors which influence the keeping quality of cold-stored butter are: the extent to which milk, cream and butter are contaminated with copper, and the pH of the butter serum. It is known that the oxidation processes in butter, which may cause inter alia a trainy flavour, start at the fat/serum interface. Experiments were carried out which provided further evidence that the oxidative deterioration of coldstored butter is due primarily to oxidation of the phospholipids. Further experiments show, however, that 'artificial butter' made from butter fat and milk serum (without fat globule membrane material or phospholipids) may also develop a trainy flavour, provided that a strong pro-oxidant (copper) is present at the lipid/water interface. It must therefore be concluded that it is uncertain whether the off-flavours are formed by oxidation of the unsaturated fatty acids of the phospholipids, or of the butter fat, or even of both. Chapter IV consists of a description of the techniques which were used for the isolation and identification of volatile flavour compounds in oxidized lipids. The special problems concerning the isolation and separation of volatile flavour compounds are outlined. For the isolation of volatile flavour compounds in butter fat, a semi-continuous high-vacuum distillation apparatus was designed. Aroma compounds were isolated from small samples of oxidized lipids by means of a batch-wise high-vacuum distillation technique. The aroma components were first separated by temperature-programmed gas chromatography, using a type of column which minimized the risk of artefact formation. For further separation and identification, the carbonyl compounds from the fractions obtained by gas chromatography were converted into their DNPH-derivatives, because the latter have favourable properties for liquid-chromatographic and spectrometric analyses. A special conversion reaction was used to avoid isomerization and artefact formation. A method of silver nitrate complex chromatography was used for the further separation of mixtures of DNPH's according to type and degree of unsaturation. After these manipulations, the DNPH's were in general separated into the individual compounds. For their further identification ultraviolet, infrared and mass spectrometry were used. Many reference DNPH's have enabled specific characteristics to be determined (absorption wavelengths in ultraviolet and infrared spectrometry, and m/e -values in mass spectrometry). In a few cases odorous compounds other than carbonyl compounds had to be identified. These compounds were separated by gas chromatography (using a second column, if necessary) and subsequently used for spectrometric analysis. Figure 9 is a diagram which visualizes the combination of techniques used for identification of volatile compounds obtained from oxidized lipids. It could be established that even very labile compounds such as 2 cis -enals, 3 cis -enals, etc. were not modified and could be identified correctly by means of this combination of techniques. In Chapter V the results are presented of investigations on the identification of volatile compounds contributing to the trainy flavour of cold-stored butter. For the sake of comparison, the aroma compounds from fresh butter <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> defects have also been analysed. In Chapter VI the results are given of the identification of aroma compounds which are formed in the autoxidation of a number of unsaturated fatty acids. Many compounds have been identified, which have not been detected previously in butter with oxidation defects or in autoxidized fatty acids. In Chapter VII {{the results of the present}} investigations are discussed and summarized. From the analysis of trainy butter and butter <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> defects it can be seen that the odorous fraction shows large changes as a result of the oxidative deterioration. Many of the aroma compounds in trainy butter are the same as those found in autoxidized fatty acids. By comparing the composition of the mixture of odorous compounds from trainy butter with that of compounds from autoxidized fatty acids (see Table 25 and Figure 10) it has been possible to determine that the autoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and particularly the autoxidation of linolenic acid (and fatty acids with the same alkyl-terminal structure) chiefly contributes to the development of a trainy flavour. This conclusion was confirmed experimentally; the addition of autoxidized linolenic acid (with a small quantity of arachidonic acid) to butter <b>without</b> <b>flavour</b> defects caused a distinctly trainy flavour. The analyses of aroma compounds which result from the autoxidation of a number of pure unsaturated fatty acids have established that the aroma compounds formed are well in line with those that can be expected from the mechanisms of autoxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and the dismutation of the hydroperoxides (see Tables 21 to 24). It was established that the changes in flavour in the first stages of oxidative deterioration of cold-stored butter can be ascribed to the rapid oxidation of the highly unsaturated fatty acids, which play the main part in the development of a fatty-metallic off-flavour. The tallowy flavour in the last stage of oxidative deterioration of cold-stored butter can be ascribed to the continued oxidation of several fatty acids.
