5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school.

As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of students <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> disabilities. Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low working memory activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E

The learning models compared were TAI with scientific approach, PBL with scientific approach, and classical with scientific approach. This experiment was quasi-experimental. It uses 3 x 3 factorial planning. The population was the entire 8 th grade students of State Junior high School in Grobogan regency in the academic year 2014 / 2015. The sampling technique used was stratified cluster random sampling. The sample consisted of students of SMP N 2 Tegowanu, SMP N 3 Godong and SMP N 5 Purwodadi. Data collection instruments used were learning achievement test and student learning activity questionnaire. Hypothesis examination used was variance analysis (anava) with unequal cell. Conclusions acquired from this thesis are as follows: 1) PBL using scientific approach gives better mathematics learning achievement compared to TAI and classical Learning, TAI using scientific approach gives better mathematics learning achievement compared to classical learning. 2) student 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics achievement <b>with</b> high <b>learning</b> activity is better than those with intermediate and poor learning activity, intermediate learning activity is better than those <b>with</b> poor <b>learning</b> activity. 3) on TAI using scientific approach, student 2 ̆ 7 s mathematics achievement <b>with</b> high <b>learning</b> activity is as good as those <b>with</b> intermediate <b>learning</b> activity, high learning activity is better than those <b>with</b> poor <b>learning</b> activity, and intermediate learning activity is good as those <b>with</b> poor <b>learning</b> activity.
