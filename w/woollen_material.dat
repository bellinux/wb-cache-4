The indoor dress consists of a black habit with capuche and cincture. In many Augustinian houses white is used in Summer and also worn in public, usually in places {{where there were no}} Dominicans. Shoes and out of doors (prior to Vatican II) a black hat or biretta completed the habit.|$|E
25|$|The fotă {{is made of}} <b>woollen</b> <b>material</b> or cotton {{mixed with}} wool, woven on four heddles. It fully covers the underskirt (poale) except for, in some areas, the hem. The oldest fote were made of black or greyish brown fabric using the natural colours of the wool. The {{earliest}} decoration was a red border (bete roșii) at the lower edge and on the front edge, which strengthen the fabric. This type of fotă is still found in north Moldavia where fote made of hemp or flax were formerly worn in some parts in summer. Fote with vertical stripes (vâstre) are also common in this area. The extent of the decoration becomes more elaborate as one moves south. The stripes change from simple woven decoration to alternately simple stripes and stripes of woven motifs (alesăture). In Muntenia, the stripes are replaced by compact woven decoration or heavy geometric embroidery, covering the whole surface except for the area which is overlapped in the front. The richest decoration is found in Argeș and Muscel zones where the fotă itself is occasionally made from silk, and the woven decoration is in gold or silver thread.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electric}} machine was soon further improved by Andrew (Andreas) Gordon, a Scotsman {{and professor at}} Erfurt, who substituted a glass cylinder {{in place of a}} glass globe; and by Giessing of Leipzig who added a [...] "rubber" [...] consisting of a cushion of <b>woollen</b> <b>material.</b> The collector, consisting of a series of metal points, was added to the machine by Benjamin Wilson about 1746, and in 1762, John Canton of England (also the inventor of the first pith-ball electroscope) improved the efficiency of {{electric machine}}s by sprinkling an amalgam of tin over the surface of the rubber. In 1768, Jesse Ramsden constructed a widely used version of a plate electrical generator.|$|E
50|$|When John Roberts' father, the Scottish {{manufacturer}} of <b>woollen</b> <b>materials,</b> {{sent him to}} New Zealand, {{he had in mind}} the purchase of a pastoral run to breed sheep with wool to his own requirements. His own wool could be shipped directly to Scotland without the expense of middle-men. The policy of crossbreeding on Murray Roberts' stations to establish the desired qualities of the wool led to the Corriedale breed. The first major investment in pastoral activities was Lauder station in 1868.|$|R
5000|$|She {{moved to}} Bradford, England, {{arriving}} in 1932 and undertaking a year's study at Bradford Technical College. One reason for choosing this location was that Swiss technical colleges {{would not accept}} women students - and at Bradford she was only the third female student. In an interview in 1990, Straub noted that Germany during the early 1930s {{was out of the}} question as she was known for being outspoken and her mother did not want to have to rescue her from prison. [...] The Bradford course covered textile maths, weaving technology and raw materials, as well as cloth construction, and its focus was on <b>woollen</b> <b>materials</b> as the city was a major wool manufacturing centre. The experience gave Straub a keen interest in the uses and varieties of fibres and she developed her skills in double cloth textile construction and the use of power looms.|$|R

40|$|Much {{attention}} has been paid in the past to the peculiar mechanism of keratin digestion which enables the clothes moth to infest <b>Woollen</b> <b>materials</b> (Schulz, 1925; Liriderstrem-Lang & Duspiva, 1935; Duspiva, 1936), but little is known about its general food requirements. It is known that the larvae will not grow on clean wool (Titschak, 1922; Crowell & McCay, 1937) and that damage to clothing is generally restricted to parts soiled by dirt and sweat. On the other hand, Tineola has been bred in the laboratory on various foods in the absence of keratin, and there are no indications that keratin is a necessary con-stituent of the food (Titschak, 1922). A study of some aspects of the nutrition of Tineola has been made by Crowell & McCay (1937) and will be discussed below. METHODS The methods employed are similar to those de-scribed in earlier publications (Fraenkel & Blewett, 1943 a, c). Ten larvae were always grown together in a 2 x 1 in. specimen tube containing 2 g. of food, and each test was done in duplicate. All the tests were performed at 25 ° and 70 % relative humidity. They were started with the first stage larva and concluded with the emergence of the adult moth. Tineola as a rule pupates inside the food and therefore pupation cannot be observed. The pupal period tis most probably constant and independent {{of the nature of the}} larval food, and it lasts, at 25 ° and 70 % R. H., about 10 days. General food requirements Tineola grows well on an artificial food mixture composed o...|$|R
60|$|No Utopians wear black, {{and for all}} the {{frequency}} of the samurai uniform along the London ways the general effect is of a gaily-coloured population. You never see anyone noticeably ragged or dirty; the police, who answer questions and keep order (and are quite distinct from the organisation for the pursuit of criminals) see to that; and shabby people are very infrequent. People who want to save money for other purposes, or who do not want much bother with their clothing, seem to wear costumes of rough woven cloth, dyed an unobtrusive brown or green, over fine woollen underclothing, and so achieve a decent comfort in its simplest form. Others outside the Rule of the samurai range the spectrum for colour, and have every variety of texture; the colours attained by the Utopian dyers seem to me to be fuller and purer than the common range of stuffs on earth; and the subtle folding of the <b>woollen</b> <b>materials</b> witness that Utopian Bradford is no whit behind her earthly sister. White is extraordinarily frequent; white woollen tunics and robes into which are woven bands of brilliant colour, abound. Often these ape the cut and purple edge that distinguishes the samurai. In Utopian London the air is as clear and less dusty than it is among high mountains; the roads are made of unbroken surfaces, and not of friable earth; all heating is done by electricity, and no coal ever enters the town; there are no horses or dogs, and so there is not a suspicion of smoke and scarcely a particle of any sort of dirt to render white impossible.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a moment}} the doubt was gone. She was enchanting. Quite a {{different}} style of dress, but equally lovely and suitable. A long figured gown of some fine <b>woollen</b> <b>material,</b> giving very nearly {{the effect of a}} plain neat print, and made quite simply to fit her perfect little figure. A plain linen collar, and a quiet silver brooch. Hair tied in a single broad knot above the head, instead of yesterday's chignon and cheese-plate. Altogether, a model winter morning costume for a cold climate. And as she advanced frankly, holding out her hand with a smile, I could have cut my own throat with a pocket-knife as a merited punishment for daring to distrust her. Such is human nature at the ripe age of twenty! ...|$|E

30|$|About 90 % of the herders {{indicated}} that they are engaged in seasonal work such as transporting oranges in winter, carrying tourist equipment and construction materials, making cane products, working as casual labour at construction sites and other cottage industries such as yathra (<b>woollen</b> cloth <b>material)</b> weaving. Orange harvest and export starts late November and lasts till early February. This season in the south coincides well with the time when TAP herders are in their winter camps. For a long time, TAP families {{have been involved in}} a range of activities in the process of exporting these oranges mainly to Bangladesh. TAP families either do petty contracts like middlemen in handling the fruits or transporting them from remote orchards to the road head, or women and girls engage in packing the fruits in the boxes. These activities form one of the main cash income opportunities for TAP families in winter for those that migrate far down enough to reach orange-growing areas. Those that do not go that far engage in making baskets and other cane products, mainly for their domestic consumption. However, irrespective of the amount of income they earned seasonally or crops harvested from their fields, nearly 90 % of herders rated cattle as important to highly important for their household’s livelihood.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1943, Gauchar {{has played}} host {{to one of the}} largest trade fairs in Uttarakhand. The Bhotias of Chamoli District, {{residing}} in the border regions of Garhwal Himalayas, are well known for their traditional expertise in making a range of <b>woollen</b> garments and <b>materials,</b> besides processing and colouring of wool. Before 1962, there was trans-border trade between India and former Tibet, and the import of wool was the major source of income for the Bhotia’s woollens-based, indigenous cottage industry. But after 1962, trade was stopped due to conflicts between China and India. The Gauchar Mela served as huge market for the Bhotias to sell their ware including woollen products, precious jewels and heeng (asafoetida), and to buy good for daily necessity such as cloth and salt to carry back with them. This fair was not merely a local fair, but people travelled here from as far as Bijnaur and Kotdwar to participate in the brisk trade.|$|R

50|$|A duffel coat, or duffle coat (standard UK spelling), is a coat {{made from}} duffel, a coarse, thick, <b>woollen</b> <b>material.</b> The name derives from Duffel, {{a town in}} the {{province}} of Antwerp in Belgium where the material originated. Duffel bags were originally made from the same material. The duffel coat may have initially come from the Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. The hood and toggle fastenings proved popular and it spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was being supplied to the British Royal Navy, and Field Marshal Montgomery was a famous wearer of the coat in World War II. After the war, the coats became available as government surplus stock and became popular, especially with students.|$|E

It is untailored {{at the waist}} so it hangs down straight from the shoulders. The front vertical edges fall straight and are squared-off at the bottom edge which is also straight horizontally with no vent at the back. In length it reaches 3 or 4 inches below the crotch area. It has no lapels and buttons tightly up to the neck with a broad and stiff up-turnable collar to protect the neck from wind, cold and wet weather. It is thus well suited to outdoors work in demanding conditions.|$|E
5000|$|The school uniform is {{the oldest}} {{military}} uniform still worn in Australia. It consists of navy blue trousers with a vertical red stripe, a white shirt, black shoes, and a jacket made of {{a black and white}} <b>woollen</b> <b>material,</b> stitched in a birdseye pattern. It has red cuffs and red tabs {{on each side of the}} collar. The cuffs and epaulets are each surmounted by a braided red [...] "Lovers' Knot". The uniform reflects the military history of the school, and is similar to the blazers worn at the Battle of Waterloo. The jacket may be modified in a number of ways. Military insignia can be stitched onto the right arm to show rank in the Australian Army Cadets, a white lanyard may be worn by members of the Marching Band, and the Regimental Sergeant Major may wear the Coat of Arms on the left arm. Cadet Under Officers wear a different grey jacket, which has diamond lozenges on the shoulder tabs and a silver braided 'Lover's Knot'.|$|E
