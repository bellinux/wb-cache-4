50|$|The Bergetiger was {{the name}} the Allied forces gave to a German World War II armored tracked vehicle based on the Tiger I chassis. The vehicle was found {{abandoned}} on a roadside in Italy with terminal engine problems. The main gun had been removed, and a boom & <b>winch</b> <b>assembly</b> had been fitted to the turret. No other Tiger tanks modified in this manner were ever recovered.|$|E
25|$|Although {{drilling}} finished on 9 October 2010, Laurence Golborne, Chilean Minister of Mining, {{announced that}} the rescue operation was not expected to begin before 12 October due to the complex preparatory work required on both the escape shaft and the extraction system site. These tasks included a borehole inspection {{to determine how much}} of the shaft needed casing to prevent rockfalls from jamming the escape capsule. Depending on the shaft casing requirement, installation of the requisite steel pipes could take up to 96 hours. After that, a large concrete platform for the winching rig to raise and lower the capsule had to be poured while the <b>winching</b> rig required <b>assembly.</b> Finally, thorough testing of the capsule and winching system together was required.|$|R
50|$|Several new {{technical}} solutions {{were implemented}} during {{the construction of}} the TV Tower. The reinforced-concrete tower itself was assembled using the sliding mold method. The concrete mold was installed at a height of 2.5 metres, then the armature was inserted and the concrete was poured. After that the concrete form was shifted upwards, narrowed to the new diameter value and the new section of reinforced concrete was created. Today you can still see the rings resulting from this concreting process at 2.5 metre intervals on the tower. The concrete was poured continuously for 8 months, with the tower gradually rising above the landscape. The builders used the M-400 concrete based on oil shale ash and Portland cement. This concrete had been developed by the scientists at the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute under the supervision of Professor Verner Kikas. The concrete was designed to withstand 300 frost resistance cycles. Subsequent inspections have revealed that the strength of this concrete is even higher than stipulated.The antenna part of the structure is made from steel cylinders. The metal antenna was installed using the ejection method. At first a smaller-diameter cylinder was lifted to the necessary spot, then over it was placed a larger-diameter cylinder and the smaller cylinder was pushed up through it with blocks and <b>winches.</b> The <b>assembly</b> was completed by attaching to each cylinder the television and ultra short-wave transmitter vibrators.The upper metal framework weighing over 120 tons was assembled on the ground {{around the base of the}} tower and then raised to 170 metres. From start to finish all building work was supervised by foreman Aleksander Ehala and team master Väino Saar. They often had to solve extremely complicated problems and the designers always agreed with their solutions.The TV Tower is a sophisticated structure and it is therefore regularly checked for geodetic compliance: foundation settling, vertical deviation, condition of reinforced concrete and metal components, other parameters of the tower. The allowed swerve of the top of the TV Tower due to wind is 1.5 metres, of the viewing platform - 90 cm. Besides winds, the tower is affected by solar heat, resulting in the top “drawing” a peculiar curve. The steel part, from 190 m to 260 m, has a lift for two persons and hatches for access to the external platforms for the purpose of inspection and repairs of the antenna equipment. In the tower below the antenna section there is also a staircase with 1,050 steps, all the way from the basement to a height of 190 metres.|$|R

40|$|Question: Can {{a device}} be {{fabricated}} {{that will allow}} wakeboard riders’ access to locations that may be inaccessible by boats or where motorized boats are prohibited? This device will be called a Wakeboard Winch and will need to meet specific design requirements to ensure adequate performance. For the winch design to be considered effective it {{must be able to}} support up to a 200 pound wakeboard rider, be able to achieve a maximum tow speed of 25 mph, and the final <b>winch</b> <b>assembly</b> should weigh less than 200 pounds. Rationale: The design and manufacturing of the winch must be optimized to meet the design requirements established, while also minimizing the cost of production. Methods: The Wakeboard Winch will be designed using mechanical engineering methods relating to power transmissions using shafts, torque converters, and roller chain drives. Along with this, the winch will be fabricated using manufacturing processes learned throughout the mechanical engineering technology (MET) coursework which may include, but is not limited to, milling, machining, and welding. Results: At this time, the Wakeboard Winch has been mocked-up and preliminary testing has been completed to ensure successful operation. Final assembly will be completed the second week of April and testing is scheduled to follow shortly after. Principal Conclusions: The preliminary evaluation of the winch displayed adequate operation giving promise to meeting the 200 pound weight limit and 25 mph speed limit established by the design requirements...|$|E
