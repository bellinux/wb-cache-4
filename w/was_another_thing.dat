25|$|Donald's {{drifting}} {{from job}} to job was reportedly inspired by Barks' own experiences. So was his usual lack of success. And even in those that he was successful this would be temporary, just until a mistake or chance event caused another failure, another disappointment for the frustrated duck. Barks also reported that this <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> he was familiar with.|$|E
25|$|One of the fair's major crowd-attracting and {{financial}} shortcomings was {{the absence of}} a midway. The fair's organizers were opposed, on principle, to the honky-tonk atmosphere engendered by midways, and this <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that irked the BIE, which insisted that all officially sanctioned fairs have a midway. What amusements the fair actually had ended up being largely dull. The Meadow Lake Amusement Area was not easily accessible, and officials objected to shows being advertised.|$|E
2500|$|Savige {{rejected}} the plans. His justification {{in the official}} war history provides a fair and reasonable portrait of Potts, as seen from above {{in the chain of}} command: [...] "Potts was a very gallant man and looked for fights, but looking without planning the ways and means to land and support troops on hostile shores <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Further, Potts always found it difficult to envisage or accommodate himself to the overall plan of his commander ... Potts was a character apart from the rest. His personal courage was unsurpassed and his genial nature drew one to him. However, his zeal to be on patrol or with the leading section denied him control of operations which led him to countenance fear of some disaster overtaking his troops".|$|E
60|$|ILL-FAV. And they said, We intend no hurt to your lives; it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{we would}} have.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. I don't like it much." [...] (This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> they say, {{and then}} they wait for you to express incredulity.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to tell you, Roger," [...] {{put in the}} Widow Canby. [...] "Something I {{know you}} will be greatly pleased to hear." ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who does he think he is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr Bloom gave prudent assent. The {{language}} of course <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} Stannard pondered. To baffle the young trooper had rather amused him, but to dispute with Bob <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not worship her; I loved her, which <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> The priest Oros here worships thee, whom {{he calls}} Mother. I loved that immortal woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do, but it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> {{to stand}} {{laughing}} here. I see {{one thing that}} I shall do--I shall take away your picture and hang it in my room.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, and if {{you wish}} I will tell you; but there <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I must say first. Come a little way down the lane with me, Mr. Brattle." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, this <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> altogether, and the captain's earnest {{acceptance}} {{would have}} been more coherent {{if it had not been}} for the impatience of his mare.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Son {{of a great}} man? Ambassador, French!' The greatness seemed impressed, {{but whether}} {{ambassador}} was understood <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing,</b> though it was accepted as relating to the boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "The boyars did {{not like}} it very well to be obliged to build these ships," [...] {{continued}} Rollo. [...] "And there <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that they disliked still more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you!" [...] she said. [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I want to ask, Mr. Jordan. If you get {{any news}} of the Shasta, will you come and tell me?" ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{one thing}} to chase a horse; it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> to catch it. Little {{consideration}} and less sagacity is required to convince us of the truth of that fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Men {{find that}} action <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> [...] Than what they in discoursing papers read; [...] The world's affairs require in {{managing}} [...] More arts than those wherein you clerks proceed." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was this}} that {{staggered}} Kirk. That Mrs. Bailey should indulge {{in this particular}} form of insanity was intelligible. But that Ruth should have descended to it <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> altogether.|$|E
60|$|The {{application}} of anaesthetics <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> fully explained by Gys, but {{this could not}} be demonstrated. Patsy, however, was taught {{the use of the}} hypodermic needle, which Maud and Beth quite understood.|$|E
60|$|She {{did know}} Kit was obstinate, but to allow Miss Brown {{to talk about}} it <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Besides, she was bothered about the other's object for stating Kit ought to go back.|$|E
60|$|The {{science of}} Humboldt is one <b>thing,</b> poetry <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> The poet to-day, {{notwithstanding}} all the discoveries of science, and the accumulated learning of mankind, enjoys no advantage over Homer.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{then there}} <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> not a question, but {{something}} which I think I ought to tell you,--something {{which you have}} a right to know before we are married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I didn't {{think this}} new thing was coming up," [...] growled Jarvey. [...] "We were to share equal {{on what we}} {{happened}} {{to get out of}} the greasers. This <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> entirely." ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Jim {{imagined}} Lance felt Evelyn's charm, {{and although}} they were cousins, he understood cousins sometimes married, with their relatives' approval, when the marriage would advance {{the interests of the}} family. It was possible that he might hurt Lance worse than by robbing him of Langrigg.|$|E
60|$|They {{needed the}} venison, {{but when he}} had got down a short {{distance}} {{he knew he was}} rash, for it looked as if the rocks {{on the other side of}} the waterfall were perpendicular. Then, although he might perhaps reach the shelf, to carry the deer back <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|What had jarred on {{him even}} more than the {{signature}} was a little sting he had been silent on--the phrase [...] "married relation"--What an idiot it made him seem as her lover! If Sue had written that in satire, he could hardly forgive her; if in suffering--ah, that <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>is</b> {{curious about}} it," [...] added the captain; [...] "and that is, that, when a line is let out {{to such a}} length, they can never get it back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to {{whom the}} sight {{is likely to}} do good. Enough; you are English; that <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Stay there, if you please, a little moment." ...|$|R
60|$|JAMES. Come! If she's {{anything}} {{of a woman}} she'll see it for herself. She won't want to drag you down further. If there were a prospect of your being able to marry her--it might <b>be</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
60|$|All the same, Peter set {{his mouth}} and pushed ahead. In the valley, he could hit up the pace for Deering, but he {{imagined}} to follow the big fellow on the rocks <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> When a bushman took the rocks he went to shoot big-horn and bear. The mountain clubmen studied climbing as one studies the ball-game.|$|E
60|$|Little did Henry know of Dr. May's near {{approach}} to untruth in denying {{that he had}} a house to let to the opposition surgeon--of his attestations to his daughter that young Ward was a skilful operator--or of his vexation when she professed herself ready to undergo anything for his pleasure, but said that little Margaret's health <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> I did {{not tell}} you, sir. As {{we went to the}} barracks, we passed some cavalry men talking. They were arguing that the enemy must be marching this way, for at two o'clock last night ten troopers were {{suddenly}} called up and sent off, the gates being opened for them by order of the governor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Possibly,' said Helen languidly; 'but {{then there}} <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> which I dislike--I cannot bear {{to hear the}} most {{beautiful}} chapters in the Bible stammered over as if the children had not the least perception of their meaning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But of course," [...] said Don Erminio, [...] "when I {{sign for}} Se√±or Wolf, I will sign all you ask. When I sign for me, it <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing.</b> Then, if I am not cautious, {{somebody}} gets my dollars." ...|$|R
60|$|I laughed {{all the way}} downstairs, but it was {{a little}} pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>thing</b> and not so pretty.|$|R
