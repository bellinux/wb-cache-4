5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to <b>wait,</b> <b>that</b> also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{privately owned}} diesel {{locomotives}} operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts {{did not have to}} <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long after the final withdrawal of the class to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged 'Farewell to the Deltics' open day at British Rail Engineering Limited's Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power and ran back up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of brain death {{needs to be}} rigorous, {{in order to be}} certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general they require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK), and may include two isoelectric (flat-line) EEGs 24hours apart (less in other countries where it is accepted that if the cause of the dysfunction is a clear physical trauma {{there is no need to}} <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long to establish irreversibility). The patient should have a normal temperature and be free of drugs that can suppress brain activity if the diagnosis is to be made on EEG criteria.|$|E

500|$|Whitlam {{took office}} with a {{majority}} in the House of Representatives, but without control of the Senate (elected in the 1967 and 1970 half-elections). The Senate at that time consisted of ten members from each of the six states, elected by proportional representation. The ALP parliamentary caucus chose the ministers, with the party leader only having the power to assign portfolios. A caucus meeting could not be held until after the final results came in on 15 December. In the meantime, McMahon would remain caretaker prime minister. Whitlam, however, was unwilling to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long. [...] On 5 December, with Labor's win beyond doubt even though counting was still underway, Whitlam had the Governor-General, Sir Paul Hasluck, swear him in as prime minister and Labor's deputy leader, Lance Barnard, as deputy prime minister. The two men held 27 portfolios during the two weeks before a full cabinet could be determined.|$|E
500|$|... "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] has {{a lesbian}} subtext. [...] According to The Audience Studies Reader by Will Brooker and Deborah Jermyn, while in some episodes a lesbian subtext is implied, in [...] "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" [...] the {{lesbianism}} is so strongly {{suggested that it}} could be considered [...] "maintext". [...] Andrew Leonard of Salon described the episode as the [...] "disco lesbian vampire" [...] episode and stated that it provided [...] "tacit consent to a lesbian reading of the Xena-Gabrielle relationship." [...] A DVD Town reviewer felt that the general lesbian eroticism in Xena: Warrior Princess was [...] "amped up" [...] in this episode, noting Gabrielle's [...] "sexy clothes" [...] and her looking at Xena with [...] "hungry eyes". Heather Findlay of Girlfriends magazine itemized several scenes with a lesbian subtext. [...] Gabrielle wandering into an all-female bar ("wink-wink"), becoming a vampire ("apparently Friedman studied that topos in her women's studies classes"), and [...] "kissing" [...] Xena ("oh, <b>wait,</b> <b>that</b> was a bite"). The book Queer by Simon Gage, et al. stated that although the series is now canceled, the [...] "lesbian vampire disco" [...] episode lives on in [...] "lesbian video players everywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{was already}} an {{accomplished}} frontiersman, horseman and guerrilla fighter. In {{addition to his}} native Dutch he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently. He had shot a lion {{for the first time}} when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11. During his many hunting excursions he was nearly killed on several occasions. In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the Steelpoort River, his four-pounder elephant gun exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb. Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with turpentine. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When gangrenous marks appeared up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly-killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy. He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less." [...] The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long to start hunting again.|$|E

500|$|The {{usage of}} the safety car came under {{criticism}} from figures within the sport. Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel, while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period. Martin Brundle, who competed in Formula One for twelve years, stated [...] "the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres tells me that, {{on the face of}} it, the safety car was out too long", and felt that the safety car [...] "should be a last resort, not a default option." [...] However, he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver's visibility, and inexperience using the Pirelli wet-weather tyres led to caution. Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA's decisions, in particular the length of the red flag delay: [...] "It was right to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long; track conditions had to improve {{in order to make the}} cars drivable again. They did everything right." [...] De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race, and Whiting stating that [...] "when it rained it was quite clear we needed to stop the race." [...] Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race, although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers.|$|E

It was his first win in the UFC in over ten years. After the bout, Henderson laughed and said, [...] "Hopefully I don't have to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long before I get my next win." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, 50 Cent announced that {{he is looking for}} new artists, [...] "You'll see new faces, because I'm looking for new artists now. I'll sign new artists and take them with me and kinda groom them. Some of the stuff you can't teach a person; they gotta have it". While he was on tour, recently made affiliate Beanie Sigel confirmed after a long awaited <b>wait,</b> <b>that</b> he would be finished signing to G-Unit when 50 got back from tour.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1972 {{election}} Whitlam defeated McMahon {{and became}} Prime Minister. This created a potentially awkward situation since Whitlam and Hasluck had bitterly resented {{one another for}} years. In a celebrated incident in the House of Representatives in 1965, Whitlam had thrown {{a glass of water}} at Hasluck after Hasluck said: [...] "You are one of the filthiest objects ever to come into this chamber". Improbably enough in view of this, the Governor-General and the PM treated each other with complete civility that soon became genuine mutual respect. They had no difficulties in their formal dealings. An indication of the change which had taken place occurred soon after Whitlam's victory. Normal practice called for McMahon to stay on as caretaker Prime Minister until Labor could choose a full ministry at its first caucus meeting. [...] However, Whitlam was unwilling to <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long, and asked Hasluck to have Whitlam and his deputy leader, Lance Barnard, sworn in as an interim two-man government once Labor's victory was beyond doubt. [...] Hasluck promptly agreed, and Whitlam and Barnard held 27 portfolios between them until the full Labor ministry was sworn in.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1975, he {{audition}}ed for the Broadway play A Matter of Gravity. Katharine Hepburn watched his audition and cast him as her character's grandson in the play. With Hepburn's {{influence over the}} CBS network, Reeve worked out the schedules of Love of Life and the play {{so that he would}} be able to do both. Because of his busy schedule, he ate candy bars and drank coffee in place of meals, and suffered from exhaustion and malnutrition. On the first night of the play's run, Reeve entered the stage, said his first line, and then promptly fainted. Hepburn turned to the audience and said, [...] "This boy's a goddamn fool. He doesn't eat enough red meat." [...] The understudy finished the play for him, and Reeve was treated by a doctor who advised him to eat a more healthy diet. He stayed with the play throughout its year-long run and was given very favorable reviews. He and Hepburn became very close. She said, [...] "You're going to be a big star, Christopher, and support me in my old age." [...] He replied, [...] "I can't <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long." [...] A romance between the two was rumored in some gossip columns. Reeve said, [...] "She was sixty-seven and I was twenty-two, but I thought that was quite an honor...I believe I was fairly close to what a child or grandchild might have been to her." [...] Reeve said that his father, who was a professor of literature and came to many of the performances, was the man who most captivated Hepburn. When the play moved to Los Angeles in 1976, Reeve— to Hepburn's disappointment— dropped out. They stayed in touch for years after the play's run. Reeve later regretted not staying closer instead of just sending messages back and forth.|$|E

6000|$|She sobered a little. [...] "Men {{have the}} advantage. You will be young at thirty-three, and I'll be--well, a matron. No, I'm afraid I can't <b>wait</b> <b>that</b> long. I must find my admirable short-stop or half-back, {{whichever}} {{he is to}} be, long before that." ...|$|E
