5|$|The {{modern era}} of AAC {{began in the}} 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several {{societal}} changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights. In the early years, AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and glossectomy cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia. It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to learn to speak. Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because {{it was believed that}} they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC. The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device {{in the form of a}} sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Dawkins {{listens to}} people {{from both sides}} of the divide – first, Jewish {{representative}} Yisrael Medad and then, the Grand Mufti of Palestine, Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri. The two sides appear irreconcilable. Hoping to meet someone <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to see both viewpoints, Dawkins interviews Yousef al-Khattab, formerly Joseph Cohen, an American-born Jew who came to Israel as a settler before converting to Islam. After offering Dawkins a cheerful welcome, al-Khattab explains his views relating to the decadence of Western values.|$|E
25|$|Sacagawea was {{pregnant}} with her first child when the Corps of Discovery arrived near the Hidatsa villages to spend the winter of 1804–05. Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark built Fort Mandan. They interviewed several trappers <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to interpret or guide the expedition up the Missouri River in the springtime. They agreed to hire Charbonneau as an interpreter because they discovered his wife spoke Shoshone, and they knew they would need the help of Shoshone tribes at {{the headwaters of the}} Missouri.|$|E
25|$|Emma, Hook, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina and Robin are in {{the library}} of the mansion, searching for a way to stop Gold and Isaac from {{enacting}} a new reality with the newly activated ink. They are joined by August, who shows them a drawing of the Sorcerer's Apprentice, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to help them. Hook remembers the Apprentice from when he and Gold trapped him in the sorcerer's hat. With the help of the Blue Fairy, they release the Apprentice, who immediately says that there’s no time to waste. He tells them that they must find the storybook page depicting the door, as well as the door's key, for only then will they be able to lock Isaac back into the book where he belongs. The group splits up, with Henry, Hook, David and Mary Margaret heading back to the loft for the book and key, while Emma, Regina and the Apprentice head to Gold's pawnshop.|$|E

500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming something that looked like a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E
500|$|During 1861, botany {{became a}} preoccupation for Darwin, and his {{projects}} became serious scientific pursuits. He continued {{his study of}} orchids throughout the summer, writing to anyone <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to supply specimens {{he had not yet}} examined. Field naturalists, botanists, and country gentry sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold greenhouse, a friend {{on the other side of}} the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of ad hoc evolutionary adaptations. In June he described his examination of bee orchids as a passion, and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as [...] "beautiful facts".|$|E

500|$|Wolters and {{longtime}} Speer secretary Annemarie Kempf, while not permitted direct communication with Speer in Spandau, {{did what they}} could to help his family and carry out the requests Speer put in letters to his wife—the only written communication officially allowed Speer. [...] Beginning in 1948, Speer had {{the services of a}} sympathetic Dutch orderly to smuggle mail. [...] In 1949, Wolters opened a special bank account for Speer, the Schulgeldkonto or [...] "School Fund Account", and began fundraising among those architects and industrialists who had benefited from Speer's activities during the war. [...] At first the funds were used only to support Speer's family, but as the amounts grew and Speer's family became increasingly able to support itself, the money was used for everything from vacations for Speer's Spandau conduit, Toni Proost, to bribes for those <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to secure Speer's release. [...] Once Speer became aware of the existence of the fund, he would often send detailed instructions {{about what to do with}} the money. [...] Wolters raised a total of DM158,000 for Speer over the final seventeen years of his sentence.|$|E
2500|$|The men {{who wrote}} the Constitution of the United States were fearful of large {{standing}} armies, legislatures that had too much power, and perhaps most of all, a powerful executive <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to wage war on his own authority. All were objects of concern because of the dangers each posed to liberal democracy and a free citizenry. While it is often impossible to [...] "gauge accurately {{the intent of the}} Framers", it is nevertheless important to understand the motivations and concerns of the writers with respect to the appropriate relationship between civil and military authority. The Federalist Papers provide a helpful view of how they understood the relationship between civil authority, as represented by the executive branch and the legislature, and military authority.|$|E
2500|$|Unaware {{of all of}} {{the events}} {{happening}} back in North Carolina, Lula and Sailor continue on their way until – according to Lula – they witness a bad omen: the aftermath of a two-car accident, and the only survivor, a young woman, dies in front of them. With little money left, Sailor heads for Big Tuna, Texas, where he contacts [...] "old friend" [...] Perdita Durango, <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to help them, although she secretly knows he is under contract to be killed by Lula's mother. While Sailor agrees to join up with gangster Bobby Peru in a feed store robbery, Lula waits for him in the hotel room, trying to conceal that she is pregnant with Sailor's child. While Sailor is out Peru enters the room and forces Lula to implore him to make love with her, but in the end he refuses, stating he has no time. This traumatizes Lula, who was raped as a child.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who argue}} for Ivins' innocence {{claim that the}} anthrax used in the attacks was too {{sophisticated}} to be produced by a lone researcher without relevant training. [...] "In my opinion, there are maybe four or five people {{in the whole country}} <b>who</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to make this stuff, and I'm one of them," [...] said Richard O. Spertzel, former deputy commander of USAMRIID. [...] "And even with a good lab and staff to help run it, it might take me a year {{to come up with a}} product as good." [...] The spores in the Daschle letter were 1.5 to 3 micrometres across, many times smaller than the finest known grade of anthrax produced by either the US or Soviet bioweapons programs. An electron microscope, which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, would be needed to verify that the target spore size had been consistently achieved. The presence of the anti-clumping additive silicon in the anthrax samples also suggests a high degree of sophistication as specialists working at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory were unable to duplicate this property despite 56 attempts.|$|E
