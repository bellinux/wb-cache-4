The next day, an elephant suddenly materializes {{in front of an}} oncoming big rig. The driver manages to stop in time, but the elephant soon collapses and dies, over forty miles away from where it disappeared the night before at the Fairfield Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Southard and Mary Jarrett {{founded the}} field of {{psychiatric}} social work, applying psychiatry to industrial employees. The Kingdom of Evils, a book on psychiatric social work by Southard and Jarrett, was published after his death. In his introduction to the book, physician Richard Cabot wrote that it highlighted the collaboration between doctor and social worker; the physician excels at diagnosis, and the social <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> better able to provide resources for treatment.|$|E

5|$|Workers use several {{different}} strategies {{to deal with}} their dead, including burying, cannibalism, and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends {{on the nature of the}} corpse a <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Dudley, Arkansas {{is the site of}} the latest investigation for Mulder and Scully, who are sent to find a missing poultry inspector. The case takes a twist when another poultry <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> shot after she goes insane, leading Mulder to believe that certain townspeople are cannibals.|$|E
5|$|War of the Worlds is a 2005 American {{science fiction}} thriller film {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg and written by Josh Friedman and David Koepp, {{loosely based on}} the novel of the same title by H.

30|$|Before 1978, the {{construction}} industry used the relative easy production methods with brick and concrete structures, combining semi-industrial and on-site prefabrication. Enterprises <b>were</b> state-owned. <b>Workers</b> <b>were</b> both fixed and temporary workers. The fixed <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> the major part of {{the construction}} industry (Qi, 2011). Temporary <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> recruited from rural masons, carpenters and stunners, usually for tasks.|$|R
5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his winch driven through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|E
5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E
5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the second verse, Madonna moves into her bedroom, wearing a very feminine lingerie looking outfit. She moves behind different white screens and dances in suggestive manner, her silhouette reflecting it {{from the other side of}} the screens. In the meantime the worker continues to think about Madonna's voice and dreams of her eyes amidst smokes. He then sees Madonna standing atop a long flight of stairs inside the factory, wearing a pinstripe suit and displaying a monocle glass. She dances on a platform, holding her crotch sometimes, and briefly tears open her jacket to exposes her bra, as two men pull at levers beside the steps. In the meantime, the owner of the factory listens to live musicians in his room, with a remote control, as Madonna is shown lying naked on her bed, with one end of a chain attached to her neck, the other end going long down into the factory. As the owner leers at the musicians in the room, the <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> shown caressing Madonna's cat, while looking up expectantly towards her room. Perhaps the owner in a suit is Madonna's husband and she is trying to escape him.|$|E
50|$|Workers {{and major}} <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> mostly {{coloured}} orange. <b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> 5 - 6 mm long; they look after larvae and farm scale bugs for honeydew. Major <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> 8 - 10 mm long, with long strong legs and large mandibles. They forage, assemble {{and expand the}} nest. Queens are typically 20 - 25 mm long, and normally greenish-brown.|$|R

5|$|Workers {{are known}} to produce their own eggs, but these eggs are unfertilised and hatch into male ants. There is a chance of workers attacking a {{particular}} individual who has successfully produced male offspring due {{to a change in}} a workers cuticular hydrocarbon; cuticular hydrocarbons are believed to {{play a vital role in}} the regulation of reproduction. However, this is not always the case. Myrmecia is one of several ant genera which possess gamergate workers, where a female <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> able to reproduce with mature males when the colony is lacking a queen. Myrmecia workers are highly fertile and can successfully mate with males. A colony of M. pyriformis without a queen was collected in 1998 and kept in captivity, during which time the gamergates produced viable workers for three years. Ovarian dissections showed that three workers of this colony mated with males and produced female workers. Queens have bigger ovaries than the workers, with 44 ovarioles while workers have 8 to 14. Spermatheca is present in M. gulosa workers, based on eight dissected individuals showing a spermatheca structurally similar to those found in queens. These spermathecas did not have any sperm. Why the queen was not replaced is still unknown.|$|E
25|$|In D. maculata, queens {{mate with}} only one male which results in a worker {{relatedness}} of 0.75, whereas the relatedness between the queen and <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> only 0.5.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{effective}} mating frequency of D. norwegica queens is low, worker- worker relatedness {{is higher than}} worker-queen relatedness. Genetically speaking, this means that each <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> more related to other workers’ sons that the queen’s sons, creating worker queen conflict over reproduction.|$|E
25|$|Section 9 of the Employment Ordinance {{makes it}} clear that the fact that an {{employee}} takes part in a strike does not entitle his employer to terminate the employee's contract of employment. If a <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> dismissed for strike action, he or she would have the right to sue the employer for compensation. However, there is no legal entitlement to reinstatement.|$|E
25|$|A robot sent to {{the first}} floor of unit 1 records a {{radiation}} level of 2,000 mSv/h. At this level, workers would only be allowed to stay in the area for 8 minutes. In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO <b>worker</b> <b>is</b> able to peer into the basement and determines that the 11m deep basement is approximately half full of water.|$|E
25|$|In {{experiments}} where T. sessile <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> {{confined in}} an area without a queen, egg-laying (by the <b>workers)</b> <b>was</b> observed, though the workers destroyed any prepupa {{that emerged from the}} eggs.|$|R
50|$|The Trades Union Congress (TUC) {{report on}} {{vulnerable}} <b>workers</b> http://www.vulnerableworkers.org.uk/files/CoVE_full_report.pdf <b>was</b> critical that the Authority's narrow scope failed {{to extend its}} regime for gangmasters to sectors such as construction, hospitality, and care home <b>workers.</b> It <b>was</b> estimated that at least 2 million <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> left out while UCATT, the building workers union, estimating that East European <b>workers</b> <b>were</b> paid as low as £8.80 for a 39-hour week.|$|R
50|$|<b>Workers</b> <b>are</b> more {{related to}} their own sons than to the queen's sons. However, <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> more related to the queen's sons than sons of other <b>workers.</b> This <b>is</b> because swarm-founding colonies are {{typically}} large and have multiple queens, making workers more related to queens than other workers. Because {{of the difference in}} degree of relatedness, a <b>worker</b> would <b>be</b> more inclined to care for the queen’s sons than to a son of another worker. Worker policing effectively preserves the collective interests of the colony by controlling the production of males within a colony and limiting male production to only the queen. Another situation of <b>worker</b> policing <b>is</b> found in cyclical oligogyny, where males are only produced when there are multiple queens in the colony and <b>workers</b> <b>are</b> equally related to males and females. Workers typically participate in worker policing when the degree of relatedness between <b>workers</b> <b>is</b> relatively low.|$|R
