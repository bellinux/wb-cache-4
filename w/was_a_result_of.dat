5|$|Civil War tokens are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest. The widespread use of the tokens <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the scarcity of government-issued cents during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} X-rays on the sodium and chlorine nuclei in salt. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the alignment of electron spins. In 1926, he became a consultant for the Lamp Department at General Electric. In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into fluorescent lamps. His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E

Thus the process of development and that of aging are coupled by Mis-construction and Mis-re-construction (Misrepair) of the structure of an organism.|$|R

5|$|Conflict {{among the}} Christian {{population}} of Neapolis emerged in 451. By this time, Neapolis {{was within the}} Palaestina Prima province {{under the rule of}} the Byzantine Empire. The tension <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Monophysite Christian attempts to prevent the return of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Juvenal, to his episcopal see. However, the conflict did not grow into civil strife.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed {{to stop at the}} Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} part of life in Upper Canada, local {{administration}} and justice was administered by the colonial government. From 1792 to 1841, magistrates were appointed by District Councils. There were four districts in the colony of which Scarborough was part of the Home District. Partly due to a political reorganization that <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the Durham Report, Scarborough gained elected representation on the Home District Council. Scarborough elected two councillors.|$|E

The thesis through a case study of the historical development of the commercial strip established the following findings.

Third, the commercial strip <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> the commercial zoning and rezoning patterns.

Igor Nesterov, head of seismology of USSR, said the Leninakan seismic station was destroyed so there was no way of knowing whether it received reports of an earthquake coming its way, although Nesterovs' colleagues later said the station was not able to receive reports {{because of the lack of}} instruments it carried.|$|E
5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated {{during a time of}} declining wolf populations in the southeastern United States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body. By examining these characteristics, examiners can begin to piece together a timeline of the events during and after death. This can potentially help determine the time since death, whether or not trauma on the skeleton <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> peri or post-mortem activity, as well as if scattered remains {{were the result of}} scavengers or a deliberate attempt to conceal the remains by an assailant.|$|E
