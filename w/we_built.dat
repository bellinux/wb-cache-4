25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and <b>we</b> <b>built</b> a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that <b>we</b> <b>built.</b> And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E

[...] Academic Peter Wright has said about Moonbase 3 that its [...] "appeal to realism resulted in a disquieting sense of claustrophobia and isolation that undermined the optimism of its premise and captured the general mood of insularity felt (and often desired) in Britain in the early 1970s". [...] Moonbase 3, although not directly influential, {{can be seen as}} an antecedent of similar realistic, near-future, British space series such as Star Cops and Space Island One.|$|E
500|$|For a fight scene {{taking place}} {{on top of a}} {{speeding}} bullet train, the actors and stunt performers filmed on wires above a set piece surrounded by a greenscreen. The moving background, filmed on an elevated freeway in Tokyo, was added later. Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Martin Hill said the team adopted a [...] "Google Street View method", explaining [...] "But instead of having a big panoramic cam on top of a van, <b>we</b> <b>built</b> a rig that had eight 45 degree angle Red Epic [...] that gave us massive resolution driving down all the massive lanes of the freeway. We let a bit of air out of the tires of the van and kept a constant 60 kilometers an hour. So if we shot at 48 fps we just needed to speed up the footage by 10 times to give us the 300 kilometers an hour required." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's SQUID scenes, {{which offer}} a point-of-view shot (POV), {{required}} multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation. A full year was spent building a specialized camera that could reproduce {{the effect of}} looking through someone else's eyes. Bigelow revealed that it was essentially [...] "a stripped-down Arri that weighed {{much less than the}} smallest EYMO and yet it would take all the prime lenses." [...] Cinematographer Matthew F. Leonetti was also hired to help Bigelow film the scenes, which were choreographed weeks in advance. The opening sequence, which features a 16-foot jump between two buildings by a stunt performer without a safety harness, took two years to co-ordinate. According to Cameron, [...] "It's a major set piece. For the jump alone, <b>we</b> <b>built</b> special cameras, special rigs. We designed transitions that would work seamlessly.

500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. <b>We</b> <b>built</b> all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so you feel that wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location. [...] Alberta plans to widen the southwest leg of the road, which is well over capacity, but the plans are currently unfunded until at least 2020. [...] They include widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between Highway 2 and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way. [...] In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should {{have done a better job}} of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton. Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>built</b> a six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10years, that wouldn’t be money well spent." ...|$|E

Smith related: [...] "We had an arrangement with the off-licence up the road, every night they would bring in supplies. We decided we weren't going to throw anything out. <b>We</b> <b>built</b> this mountain of empties in the corner, a gigantic pile of debris in the corner. It just grew and grew". According to Tolhurst, [...] "we wanted to make the ultimate, intense album. I can't remember exactly why, but we did". The recording sessions commenced and concluded in three weeks. Smith noted, [...] "At the time, I lost every friend I had, everyone, without exception, because I was incredibly obnoxious, appalling, self-centered". He also noted that with the album, he [...] "channelled all the self-destructive elements of my personality into doing something".|$|E
