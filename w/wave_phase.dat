2500|$|Wave {{energy is}} a {{quantity}} of primary interest, since it is a primary quantity that is transported with the wave trains. As can be seen above, many wave quantities like surface elevation and orbital velocity are oscillatory in nature with zero mean (within the framework of linear theory). In water waves, the most used energy measure is the mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area. It {{is the sum of}} the kinetic and potential energy density, integrated over the depth of the fluid layer and averaged over the <b>wave</b> <b>phase.</b> Simplest to derive is the mean potential energy density per unit horizontal area Epot of the surface gravity waves, which is the deviation of the potential energy due to the presence of the waves: ...|$|E

50|$|In plasma physics, a wave can be collisionlessly damped by {{particles}} in the plasma whose velocity matches the <b>wave's</b> <b>phase</b> velocity. This is typically represented as a spatially dispersive loss in the plasma's permittivity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea of a}} group {{velocity}} distinct from a <b>wave's</b> <b>phase</b> velocity was first proposed by W.R. Hamilton in 1839, and the first full treatment was by Rayleigh in his [...] "Theory of Sound" [...] in 1877.|$|R
2500|$|The two stream {{instability}} can {{be thought}} of as the inverse of Landau damping, where the existence of a greater number of particles that move slower than the <b>wave</b> <b>phase</b> velocity [...] as compared with those that move faster, leads to an energy transfer from the wave to the particles. In the case of the {{two stream instability}}, when an electron stream is injected to the plasma, the particles' velocity distribution function has a [...] "bump" [...] on its [...] "tail". If a wave has phase velocity in the region where the slope is positive, there is a greater number of faster particles (...) than slower particles, and so there is a greater amount of energy being transferred from the fast particles to the wave, giving rise to exponential wave growth.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{field theory}} having a gauge symmetry was Maxwell's formulation, in 1864–65, of electrodynamics [...] ("A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field"). The {{importance of this}} symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, Hilbert had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates. [...] Later Hermann Weyl, inspired by success in Einstein's general relativity, conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in year 1919 that invariance under the change of scale or [...] "gauge" [...] (a term inspired by the various track gauges of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism. [...] Although Weyl's choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name [...] "gauge" [...] stuck to the approach. [...] After the development of quantum mechanics, Weyl, Fock and London modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of <b>wave</b> <b>phase,</b> and applying it successfully to electromagnetism. Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{in an attempt to}} describe the strong nuclear forces. This idea, dubbed Yang–Mills theory, later found application in the quantum field theory of the weak force, and its unification with electromagnetism in the electroweak theory.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based on {{the indoor}} radio-wave {{propagation}} analysis, and the fundamental limits of CMOS technology it is shown that phased array {{technology is the}} ultimate solution for the radio and physical layer of the millimeter wave multi-Gb/s wireless networks. A low-cost, single-receiver array architecture with RF phase-shifting is proposed and design, analysis and measurements of its key components are presented. A high-gain, two-stage, low noise amplifier in 90 nm-CMOS technology with more than 20 dB gain over the 60 GHz spectrum is designed. Furthermore, a broadband analog phase shifter with a linear phase and low insertion loss variation is designed, and its measured characteris-tics are presented. Moreover, two novel beamforming techniques for millimeter <b>wave</b> <b>phased</b> array receivers are developed in this paper.

Progressive waves with different wave amplitudes in an intermediate water depth were used. The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique was employed to measure the velocity fields.
