5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E

This had led to their match against Namibia, which was scheduled to begin on 26 February to be put back to 2 June. With the old-look side restored, Kenya were clear favourites again.|$|E

Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.|$|R

He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to get back on his feet when on Saturday, March 18, 1882, Virgil's younger brother Morgan Earp was killed in another ambush. On March 19, Wyatt's 34th birthday, he and James {{accompanied}} Morgan's body to Benson, where it was loaded aboard a train for California, watched over by James and two or three friends. They took Morgan to the Earp family home in Colton, California. It was not practical, given Virgil's injuries, to transport him and his wife Allie out of Tombstone {{at the same time as}} Morgan.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in time, the idea of {{constructing}} a new tramway was revolutionary. The trend throughout the world had been to close existing tramways rather than open new ones, and only three relatively small tram systems remained in France (the Lille, Marseille and Saint-Étienne systems). In North America {{the very beginning of}} a light rail renaissance <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to be seen, with the Edmonton Light Rail Transit system opening in 1978, followed by the Calgary C-Train and San Diego Trolley systems in 1981. No significant new tramway system had been built in Europe in many years.|$|E
25|$|Orazio died {{suddenly}} in 1639. Artemisia {{had her own}} commissions to fulfill after her father's death, {{although there are no}} known works assignable with certainty to this period. It is known that Artemisia had already left England by 1642, when the civil war <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting.</b> Nothing much is known about her subsequent movements. Historians know that in 1649 she was in Naples again, corresponding with Don Antonio Ruffo of Sicily, who became her mentor during this second Neapolitan period. The last known letter to her mentor is dated 1650 and makes clear that she still was fully active.|$|E

25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to use it {{when he came to}} the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Garibaldi Belt formation, {{a number}} of older, but related {{volcanic}} belts were constructed along the Southern Coast of British Columbia. This includes the east-west trending Alert Bay Volcanic Belt on northern Vancouver Island and the Pemberton Volcanic Belt along the coastal mainland. The Pemberton Belt began its formation when the former Farallon Plate was subducting under the British Columbia Coast 29million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. At this time, the north-central portion of the Farallon Plate <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to subduct under the U.S. state of California, splitting it into northern and southern sections. Between 18and five million years ago during the Miocene period, the northern remnant of the Farallon Plate fractured into two tectonic plates, known as the Gorda and Juan de Fuca plates. After this breakup, subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate might have been coincident with {{the northern end of}} Vancouver Island eight million years ago during the late Miocene period. This is when the Alert Bay Belt became active. A brief interval of plate motion adjustment about 3.5million years ago may have triggered the generation of basaltic magma along the descending plate edge. This eruptive period postdates the formation of the Garibaldi Belt and evidence for more recent volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt has not been found, indicating that volcanism in the Alert Bay Belt is likely extinct.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success.

Moby <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{began the}} 2010–11 season in goalscoring form in pre-season, scoring four {{goals in a}} {{friendly}} against Hull, and goals against Leicester City and Brighton & Hove Albion. Having forced his way into manager Steve Bruce's plans, he started the opening match of the new Premier League season, playing the full 90 minutes against Birmingham at the Stadium of Light in a 2–2 draw. He also played the full 90 minutes in Sunderland's next league outing against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in Sunderland's 1–0 win against Manchester City on 29 August 2010, which sidelined him for an expected six months. Steve Bruce said [...] "It's a tragedy. But Fraizer will be back. He's a larger-than-life character. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to show what he was about.

500|$|In 2006, Cameron {{stated that}} if Avatar was successful, {{he hoped to}} make two sequels to the film. In 2010, he said the film's {{widespread}} success confirmed {{that he would do}} so. He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups. Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work [...] "once the novel is nailed down". He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus. The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest. He intended to capture footage for this sequel {{at the bottom of the}} Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible. In 2011, Cameron stated that he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be [...] "strident" [...] since the film will concentrate on entertainment.|$|E
500|$|After surrendering, Diệm called Lodge by {{telephone}} {{for the last}} time. Lodge did not report the conversation to Washington, so it was widely assumed that the pair last spoke on the previous afternoon when the coup <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting.</b> However, after Lodge died in 1985, his aide, Colonel Mike Dunn said that Lodge and Diệm spoke {{for the last time}} around 07:00 on 2 November moments after Diệm surrendered. When Diệm called, Lodge [...] "put [...] on hold" [...] and then walked away. Upon his return, the ambassador offered Diệm and Nhu asylum, but would not arrange for transportation to the Philippines until the next day. This contradicted his earlier offer of asylum the previous day when he implored Diệm to not resist the coup. Dunn offered to personally go to the brothers' hideout to escort him so that the generals could not kill him, but Lodge refused, saying, [...] "We just can't get that involved." [...] Dunn said, [...] "I was really astonished that we didn't do more for them." [...] Having refused to help the brothers to leave the country safely, Lodge later said after they had been shot, [...] "What would we have done with them if they had lived? Every Colonel Blimp in the world would have made use of them." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s Berry toured on the {{strength}} of his earlier successes. He was on the road for many years, carrying only his Gibson guitar, confident that he could hire a band that already knew his music no matter where he went. AllMusic said that in this period his [...] "live performances became increasingly erratic,... working with terrible backup bands and turning in sloppy, out-of-tune performances" [...] which [...] "tarnished his reputation with younger fans and oldtimers" [...] alike. In March 1972 he was filmed, at the BBC Television Theatre in Shepherds Bush, for Chuck Berry in Concert, part of a 60-date tour backed by the band Rocking Horse. Among the many bandleaders performing a backup role with Berry in the 1970s were Bruce Springsteen and Steve Miller when each <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> his career. Springsteen related in the documentary film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll that Berry did not give the band a set list and expected the musicians to follow his lead after each guitar intro. Berry neither spoke to nor thanked the band after the show. Nevertheless, Springsteen backed Berry again when he appeared at the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. At the request of Jimmy Carter, Berry performed at the White House on June 1, 1979.|$|E
