2500|$|The French {{mathematician}} Lazare Carnot {{proposed in}} his 1803 paper Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement {{that in any}} machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of moment of activity. In other words, in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son Sadi Carnot published Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever [...] "caloric" [...] (what {{is now known as}} heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He made the analogy with that of how water falls in a water wheel. This was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th century [...] "Newtonian hypothesis" [...] that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford who showed (1789) that heat could be created by friction as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the <b>working</b> <b>substance,</b> such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state {{at the end of a}} complete engine cycle, that [...] "no change occurs in the condition of the working body".|$|E

5000|$|In thermodynamics, a {{heat engine}} {{is a system}} that {{converts}} heat or thermal energy—and chemical energy—to mechanical energy, which can then be used to do mechanical work. It does this by bringing a <b>working</b> <b>substance</b> from a higher state temperature to a lower state temperature. A heat [...] "source" [...] generates thermal energy that brings the <b>working</b> <b>substance</b> to the high temperature state. The <b>working</b> <b>substance</b> generates work in the [...] "working body" [...] of the engine while transferring heat to the colder [...] "sink" [...] until it reaches a low temperature state. During this process some of the thermal energy is converted into work by exploiting the properties of the <b>working</b> <b>substance.</b> The <b>working</b> <b>substance</b> can be any system with a non-zero heat capacity, but it usually is a gas or liquid. During this process, a lot of heat is lost to the surroundings, i.e. it cannot be used.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} both Otto and Diesel {{heat engine}} cycles running upon the <b>working</b> <b>substances</b> modeled by the van der Waals fluid {{as a simple}} non-ideal gas model. We extensively perform the efficiency study in these model engines. Then we find that this "real" engine model can go beyond its ideal-gas counterpart in efficiency, whereas as well-known, the maximum Carnot efficiency {{is the same for}} both ideal and non-ideal gas engines. In fact, the higher the density of non-ideality is, the higher efficiency tends to be found, especially in the low-temperature regime, but with more shrinkage in the range of physically allowed compression ratio, determined by the Carnot upper bound, namely, the Second Law of thermodynamics.

The <b>working</b> <b>substances</b> are Al 2 O 3 -water nanofluids, which are defined by power-law shear-thinning model. The relative depth and positive eccentricity of dimples/protrusions arranged in the microchannels are 0. 2 and 0. 3 respectively.

The overall thermal performance is evaluated by parameters of Fanning friction factor, Nusselt number and thermal performance.

By 1860, as formalized in the works of those such as Rudolf Clausius and William Thomson, two established principles of thermodynamics had evolved, the first principle and the second principle, later restated as thermodynamic laws. By 1873, for example, thermodynamicist Josiah Willard Gibbs, in his memoir Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids, clearly stated the first two absolute laws of thermodynamics. Some textbooks throughout the 20th century have numbered the laws differently. In some fields removed from chemistry, the second law was considered to deal with the efficiency of heat engines only, whereas what was called the third law dealt with entropy increases. Directly defining zero points for entropy calculations was not considered to be a law. Gradually, this separation was combined into the second law and the modern third law was widely adopted.|$|E
