Some soundtrack work beckoned in Hollywood on a 1981 horror film called Wolfen but a musician's strike delayed the recording and, returning to San Francisco, McMahon, in the same week, missed his plane flight home and had his wallet, containing all his money, stolen creating the urgent need {{to find some way}} to earn a living wage and save for the air trip back to Australia.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the vast}} scope of the damage, {{initially}} Windsor town officials feared many, possibly even hundreds, of people could have been killed. While there were many serious injuries, only three people {{were killed by the}} storm. Two victims, construction workers working in a bank parking lot, took shelter in a <b>work</b> <b>truck</b> when they saw the storm approach. [...] The first victim was killed immediately by a piece of flying lumber, the other died a few weeks later from his injuries becoming the 3rd victim. The second victim was found the next day across the street from her obliterated house. Over 400 people were hospitalized, mostly for injuries from flying glass or the victims' having been thrown by winds.|$|E

40|$|Confusion and misconceptions {{regarding}} the utility {{and safety of}} turf <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> are addressed in this paper. Sources of this confusion include media stories of related vehicles and advertisements. The maneuverability, including both turning ability and traction performance, as well as lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> are evaluated based on experimental tests and mathematical models. Experiments with the three most popular heavy-duty turf <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> from Cushman ® and Toro® show that the three-wheeled model maintains a distinct advantage over the four-wheeled models with respect to maneuverability in tight spaces as measured in clearance-circle tests. Traction-performance tests with these vehicles show there to be considerable variations in traction performance between vehicles, test conditions, and loading states. The analyses of the lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf <b>work</b> <b>trucks,</b> using a mathematical model, indicate that the optimum four-wheeled vehicle is more laterally stable than the three wheeler for equal track widths. However, among vehicles of equal clearance-circle performance, the optimum three-wheeled vehicle stability surpasses that of the four wheeler. This paper continues with {{the analysis of the}} effects of a simple load on three- and four-wheeled vehicle stability which shows qualitatively different effects of loading on the two vehicle configurations. Finally, this paper evaluates the need for and implementation of a rollover protective structure (ROPS) system. Among the conclusions reached is that both three- and four-wheeled turf <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> are required to achieve all of the performance goals found in the workplace...|$|R

5000|$|As well as road vehicles, {{they also}} {{produced}} trucks for internal transport in factories. Three such trucks were {{displayed at the}} Amsterdam Motor Show in 1948, branded the universal <b>works</b> <b>truck,</b> the industrial <b>works</b> <b>truck,</b> and the Omnitruck ride-on vehicle. The vehicles were provided by Tomlinson's distributors in the Benelux countries, Autobodrijf Ten Hoove. Tomlinson-Benelux NV showed three vehicles at the Brussels Motor Show in early 1949. Again, two were pedestrian controlled vehicles, and the third was an Omnitruck. Tomlinson supplied the chassis, while bodywork was manufactured locally in Holland. The PCVs were a Roadster A6 20-cwt chassis, with a [...] motor driving the rear axle through an overhead worm drive, and a universal <b>works</b> <b>truck,</b> also rated as suitable for a payload of 20 cwt. The frame was fitted with castor wheels at each end, giving it a turning circle of just 6 ft. Three speeds could be selected on the Omnitruck, with the fastest being 12 mph.|$|R

40|$|Special report"This {{report is}} an {{investigation}} into the safety profile of work-related trucks which includes dump, garbage/refuse, tow/wrecker, cement mixer, utility, and many other single unit vocational trucks. Statistics are presented comparing <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> to tractor semitrailers, straight truck vans, and passenger cars. Five years (1997 - 2000, 2002) of fatal crash counts are taken from the Trucks Involved in Fatal Accidents database. Fatal crash counts in 2002 for passenger cars are derived from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System data file. Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data for trucks are taken from the 2002 Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey, while VMT data for passenger cars are derived from reports published by the Federal Highway Administration. Crash involvement rates per 100 million VMT are calculated and compared among different vehicle types. In addition, fatal crash statistics are presented comparing <b>work</b> <b>trucks,</b> straight truck vans, tractor semitrailers, and passenger cars with respect to road and environment characteristics, vehicle characteristics, and driver characteristics. Based on VIUS VMT, the average annual crash involvement rate for all trucks (class 3 and above) was 3. 54. Dump trucks had the highest crash involvement rate (5. 96). The rate for garbage/refuse trucks was 5. 12, while the rate for tractor semitrailers was 3. 63. Straight truck vans had one of the lowest rates (2. 09). While fatal crash involvement rates for some of the <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> appear to be high, aggregated rates do {{not take into account the}} kinds of roads that <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> typically traveled on. Dump trucks accumulated 80 % of travel on local trips (50 miles or less), while semitrailers accumulated only 15. 8 % of travel on local trips. After stratification by trip type, it is shown that rates for many <b>work</b> <b>trucks</b> are comparable to, and in some cases lower than, the rate for semitrailers. On trips greater than 50 miles the rates for dump trucks and garbage/refuse trucks were 2. 90 and 1. 90, respectively, while the rate for semitrailers was 3. 2...|$|R
