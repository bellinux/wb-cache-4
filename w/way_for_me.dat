He released two more EPs—Kaleidoscope Dream: Water Preview on July 31 and Air Preview on September 11— to digital retailers. In an interview for The Village Voice, Miguel said that the strategy allowed listeners to absorb the songs at his desired pace and called it [...] "a great <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to reconnect with my peers ... the people that I hang out with—that {{go to the same}} shows, listen to the same music, read the same blogs, same magazines." ...|$|E

500|$|Nintendo's {{advertising}} campaign for Brain Age 2 featured several celebrities. The company announced on June 25, 2007 that Australian actress Nicole Kidman {{would appear in}} European television and newspaper advertisements to promote the game. Nintendo chose to feature her because of [...] "her universal appeal to mainstream audiences {{of all ages and}} backgrounds, as well as her reputation for being intelligent, entertaining and genuine". Kidman praised Nintendo's desire to reach out to new audiences with self-improvement products, and found that playing the game made her feel young. Nintendo also chose professional swimmer Kieren Perkins to promote Brain Age 2 in his native Australia, who commented, [...] "Having used the original Dr Kawashima's Brain Training game for a while now, I was genuinely looking forward to all of the new ways I could exercise my mind.

500|$|On September 20, 2001, dates were {{released}} {{along with the}} track listing of the album. The tour was slated to begin on October 26, 2001, but {{the opening of the}} show was pushed back until October 31 after Spears became ill and was prescribed five days of rest. The tour was postponed one more day due to production delays and finally kicked off at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. Before the tour began, Spears announced she planned to give $1 of each ticket to the children of firefighters and police officers killed during the September 11 attacks. She also planned to sell merchandise and auction front row seats, hoping to raise $2million. On February 26, 2002, more North American dates {{were released}} through her official website to kick off in Las Vegas at Mandalay Bay. The second leg of the tour was sponsored by Samsung. In conjunction with entertainment company WFX, they offered [...] a cell-phone service that featured collectible merchandise and a membership card with access to backstage reports directly from Spears. She stated that [...] " [...] is an exciting new <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to stay connected with my fans".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained {{that she wanted to}} put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans. She asserted that the tour was a [...] "pop-electro opera" [...] because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was [...] "essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage." [...] The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured {{in such a way that}} the box fit any stage. [...] "So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show", she added.|$|E

5000|$|Camille F. Gravel, Jr., the Alexandria {{attorney}} {{who was a}} confidant of three governors and who himself died nine months after DeBlieux's death, referred to his friend, accordingly: [...] "This may sound overblown, but there aren't enough <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to describe what a fine man J.D. DeBlieux was. He had courage in his handling of public matters..." [...] Gravel, who was with DeBlieux at the 1956 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, recalled that two crosses were burned on DeBlieux's property in Baton Rouge during the desegregation crisis, but DeBlieux stood his ground.|$|R
60|$|That {{evening was}} {{in a very real}} sense a parting of the <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> To refuse this call was to go selfishly and comfortably along the lines of {{literary}} activity I had chosen. To accept was to enter the arena where problems of economic justice were being sternly fought out. I understood already something of the disadvantage which attached to being called a reformer, but my sense of duty and the influence of Herbert Spencer and Walt Whitman rose above my doubts. I decided to do my part.|$|R
500|$|I {{started working}} at EJ's {{when it was}} a strip club in about October 1994. A couple of the key staff and I {{convinced}} the owner we would do better as a rock-'n'-roll bar, and decided to launch the new format on [...] 1, 1995. As a future rock club, we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to suit that clientele. While comparing the prices of the domestic beers, we found that Pabst was cheapest at $33 per keg. The club gained popularity, and Pabst became the drink of choice. On Tuesdays, Pabst was sold at the full price of $1.75, but there was no cover to see the bands. Things kept getting busier. It was suggested that Thursdays become a 'beer bust,' where a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm, when the room was cleared for the show. By this time, perhaps mid-1996, EJ's had achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of national talent, which again increased sales. During busy months, we were getting three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month. Years later, Pabst became known as the 'hipster' beer of Portland. There is no <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to warrant that EJ's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this impact, but I have done so nonetheless, for years.|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to get it, {{to get it in}} Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E
500|$|Since the mid–1970s, {{references}} to Four Years Among the Cannibals {{have continued to}} appear in studies on New Guinea. In the 1990s, Detzner's work received some rehabilitation from ethnographer Terence Hays, who placed Detzner's work in its contemporary context: [...] Four Years Among the Cannibals, he wrote, [...] "paved the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] by creating romanticized images {{that served as a}} backdrop for more serious readings". [...] Since then, geographer Robert Linke has raised some important questions: [...] "Why did Detzner resort to lies to embellish his wonderful story? The unadorned truth would have been enough to establish him {{as one of the great}} figures in New Guinea history." [...] Detzner had remained at large for four years, as a fugitive in enemy-held territory: surely, Linke concluded, this was an exceptional feat. No doubt the Australians could have made a more broadly organized attempt to capture him, and probably would have succeeded, but they did not make the effort; they preferred instead the more convenient [...] "shoot-at-sight" [...] method. [...] "It is impossible", Linke wrote, [...] "not to admire his [...] sheer elan, his courage and tenacity." [...] In 2008, Detzner's book was retranslated, reprinted, and marketed as a modern translation of a rare and valuable book about the exploration of the New Guinean interior during World War I.|$|E

2500|$|During {{service in}} World War II, the Army {{assigned}} Davis to an integrated entertainment Special Services unit {{and he found}} that the spotlight lessened the prejudice.

He also recorded blues songs for Capitol Records in 1949, under the pseudonyms Shorty Muggins and Charlie Green.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{believed}} {{that although he}} played right-handed as an adult, Hogan was actually left-handed. In his book [...] "Five Lessons," [...] in the chapter entitled [...] "The Grip," [...] Hogan said [...] "I was born left-handed -- that was the normal <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do things. I was switched over to doing things right-handed when I was a boy but I started golf as a left-hander because the first club I ever came into possession of, an old five-iron, was a left-handed stick." [...] This belief also seemed to be corroborated by Hogan himself in his earlier book [...] "Power Golf." [...] However, some mystery still remains about this since Hogan in subsequent interviews said that the belief of him being left-handed was actually a myth (noted in what was probably his last video interview and in his 1987 Golf Magazine interview).|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{before its}} release, Gotye {{spoke to the}} ABC about the {{significance}} of the artwork, the title, and how it symbolises the creative and introspective process of recording the album; [...] "It's more about reflection - the look at yourself that a mirror offers and also the way it gives you a different perspective on things around you. So I guess I feel a bit analogous to what these songs become to me—you know little <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to explore my record collection, explore the world of sound that I'm fascinated by, and also sometimes get a different perspective on memories and emotions I've been mulling over that they find voice in these songs".|$|R

This work was healing as a feeling of belonging became stronger <b>for</b> <b>me</b> as a result. This sense of inclusion for First Nations people in Canada is desperately lacking today. Without a context of personal empowerment we cannot develop fully as painful feelings of disconnection atrophy our natural curiosity and innate intelligence. An education based on the principles of artistic engagement with nature and self-governance has the capacity to be both healing and empowering for First Nations children. I feel such a vision offers hope to any person not currently served by public schools today...|$|R

[...] He continued in saying that the Israeli government's reaction — rebuked by the UN — was [...] "an immediate provocation. They are trying to provoke us" [...] and that Palestine expected the Security Council to [...] "uphold international law and to bring Israel into compliance" [...] in accusing Israel of [...] "unilaterally creating illegal facts on the ground [...]" [...] He concluded that though Palestine would work towards peace, their resolve and determination [...] "had limits" [...] and were being tested; also saying the choice was Israel’s to continue the peace process in good faith just as Abbas’ message the previous day had made [...] "crystal clear" [...] and that one day perhaps Palestine could be a full member of the body as [...] "the overwhelming vote yesterday had sent a “massive message to the Security Council" [...] and that the flag of Palestine should be put in the alphabetical order outside the United Nations building [...] "in order to open a new chapter." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle.

2500|$|Anselmo {{started his}} own record label called Housecore Records {{sometime}} in 2001. The name derived from Anselmo's home being described {{as more of a}} [...] "hang out" [...] where many local friends and musicians would stay and record music together. Housecore also features in tattoo form on Anselmo's arm (Anselmo's told fans via live webcam that it was his first and favourite tattoo). Anselmo's primary objective is to release much older unreleased material and material from his many side projects. After gaining permission from Pantera's label, Elektra, he merged Housecore with his longtime friend and Necrophagia band mate Killjoy's label, Baphomet Records. The newly named [...] "Baphomet/Housecore Records" [...] secured distribution deals with Relapse Records in August 2001. Anselmo stated [...] "What you're going to get here with Baphomet/Housecore, it's going to be different. It's going to be a fresh approach. It's {{going to be a lot}} of home made shit, not all major label-produced monstrosities. I just got permission from Elektra to independently put out all the bands that I've ever fucking done. Each band that I'm involved in outside of Pantera is a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to express and develop different outlets that are very much a part of me. With Pantera it's only one side of me. I love to write and create music, and the side bands are very different from Pantera. They also show the flexibility in me as a musician; Pantera's very important in my life, but there's many other things that keep this boy here content". After only three releases, Anselmo and Killjoy severed business ties, thus returning Anselmo's label to its original name, Housecore Records. Housecore is now actively releasing material by Anselmo and by bands he is producing and supporting.|$|E
