30|$|We {{are just}} {{beginning}} to realize the power of location-aware services, especially for mobile devices, that aid users in their interaction with their immediate physical environment. Location-aware services allow users to become aware of physically proximate resources that they might not otherwise know about, provide convenience in finding and interacting with those resources, and enable interpersonal networking that takes physical location as well as ad-hoc community-building in account.

50|$|NASPA {{came into}} {{existence}} following a <b>weekend</b> <b>meeting</b> at Hasbro headquarters in Springfield, Massachusetts in December 2008. The meeting was arranged by the National Scrabble Association (NSA) and Hasbro executives. Hasbro had decided to stop its financial support of adult tournament Scrabble and clubs {{by the end of}} 2009. The NSA, which had been running adult tournament Scrabble since the late 1970s, would continue as an organization, but it would exist largely to focus on its growing school Scrabble program and to promote recreational play. (The NSA ceased operations on July 1, 2013.) The Springfield meeting was attended by 16 people, representing a cross-section of the Scrabble community: prominent Scrabble players, club and tournament directors, and others from across the continent. Those 16 had been invited by the NSA to hear firsthand from Hasbro executives about the company's decision to cease funding. In its wake, the attendees were offered the opportunity to form a new organization to preserve competitive adult Scrabble in North America and encouraged to do so with Hasbro's blessing.|$|E

These members were replaced by George F. Howe, Bolton Davidheiser and H. Douglas Dean. Dean and Davidheiser left after only two years, Dean because of his unorthodox views on Evolution, and Davidheiser because {{he was unable to}} work with Seventh Day Adventists on the committee. Marsh, an Adventist, left about the same time because he interpreted the society's <b>weekend</b> <b>meetings</b> as a religious affront.|$|R

Though this form of work, it is possible to educate the parents of the mentally retarded persons, so that they can easier recognize their children's symptoms and take part in their further therapy.

The Doctor of Professional Studies in Computing (D. P. S.), while advanced in content and rigorous in demands, can be distinguished from the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph. D.) in that its focus is the advancement of the practice of computing through applied research and development. The Doctor of Professional Studies is a professional doctorate that integrates academic and professional cultures. The program enables computing and information technology professionals to earn a doctorate in three years through part-time study while continuing in their professional career.
