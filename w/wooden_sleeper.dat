50|$|Lesser {{features}} of the former railway can be found along {{various parts of the}} alignment, including ballast, the occasional <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper,</b> rail - (metal) sleeper sections discarded near the route (gauge uncertain), and concrete culverts. At Ban Khon village, a short bridge allows a narrow road to pass under the alignment. Visitors heading back from Ban Hangkhon village after a half-day’s walk or cycle along the alignment choosing to return to Don Det island via the eastern footpath are confronted with a precarious bridge made from old rails and rail - sleeper sections spanning a stream. Signs of an early attempt to stimulate tourism and perhaps as a nod towards the island’s unique role in Laotian railway history can be found near Ban Hua Det village, where a rubber wheeled motorised tourist ‘train’ complete with ‘carriages’ in the form of trailers lies abandoned near the gantry.|$|E
5000|$|Although a {{passenger}} platform was erected at Lord Greville's Wharf (also known as Richborough Port), no passenger trains ever called there nor were authorised to do so. The East Kent may have only considered seeking authorisation if the Port had developed, {{which would have}} justified the improvements which would undoubtedly have been required by the Ministry to Transport {{to be made to}} the Stour bridge. An intermittent passenger service between Eastry and [...] had been introduced between 1925 and 1 November 1928, the intention having been to extend the service through to the new platform at Richboro Port if this was seen as having traffic potential. In the event, as only piecemeal development took place at the Port, the East Kent had no real incentive to encourage {{a passenger}} service on the branch. The short platform was built of cinders with a <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> face and a white-painted wooden platform edging. Passenger facilities consisted of a plank seat, nameboard, two lamp posts and a fence running along the back which was made of wooden posts and, allegedly, old locomotive tubes. The station's nameboard indicated that it was called Richboro Port; no tickets are believed to have been printed for it. The station was in a desolate and windswept location and had the distinction of being the only East Kent station not to be situated on Railways No. 1 and No. 2. Certain sources give the intended opening date of the station as [...] but this could be a reference to the date of erection of the platform.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> {{laid in the}} {{railroad}} is highly contaminated by the preservative such as creosote used in the production process. And the secondary contamination of <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> happened from the leakage of diesels and lubricant oils. Recently the concrete sleeper has replaced the wooden sleepers. But the wooden sleepers are still used and the huge amount of waste <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> are discharged every year. Due to the environmental toxicity of contaminants in waste <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper,</b> the waste <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> is categorized as the specified waste and its disposal should be carefully conducted. But there is not alternative method except the incineration. In this study, the thermal extraction characteristics of waste <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> in high temperature were investigated to observe the feasibility of the disposal and reuse of waste <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper...</b>|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{iron ore}} company LKAB uses freight wagon with three-piece bogie to {{transport}} iron ore from the mines in Kiruna and Malmberget to Luleå and Narvik. A simulation {{model of the}} freight wagon has been built at KTH Rail Vehicles using the Multibody simulation code GENSYS. The purpose is to investigate possible sources of rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of the wheels given {{the high level of}} damage, particularly in the winter. The <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> track has recently been replaced by a stiffer track with concrete sleeper. After the change, the frequency of RCF increased. Therefore, both track models are implemented. A parameter study is performed on vertical track stiffness and viscous damping regarding the seasonal variations of the track conditions. Another parameter study is carried out on the influence of the wheel-rail friction coefficient because in winter time the climate is very dry along most parst of the Swedish iron-ore line. The impact of new and worn wheel profiles on RCF is investigated. The wear number is calculated and compared with the RCF probability. The shakedown map is used to study the influence of an increase in track forces on RCF. It is shown that RCF happens on the tread of the inner wheels while negotiating curves below approximately 450 m radius. And in cold dry climate conditions when the wheel-rail friction coefficient significantly increases and when the wheel material behaves more brittle, the risk of RCF is significantly increased while the wear rate is not high enough to wear out the initiated cracks. It is proven that using concrete sleepers and vertically stiffer track might increase the track forces but it cannot be the main reason for severe RCF during winter. QC 20140110 </p...|$|E
40|$|Replacement {{of wooden}} {{sleepers}} to prestressed concrete sleepers has marked as advancement in the railway sleepers industry in Malaysia. Despite superiority of these man-made composite sleepers, wooden sleepers still lead {{in terms of}} track performance qualities in particular on its natural elasticity. An initiative to investigate the degree of degradation of used wooden sleepers {{and the possibility of}} reusing them on low capacity railway track in Malaysia as a means of reducing the overall track rehabilitation cost was undertaken. Used wooden sleepers were tested according to Australian Standard, Railway Track Material, Prestressed Concrete Sleepers (AS 1085 : 14 : 2003) on Rail Seat Vertical Load Test and Centre Positive Bending Moment Test. Six <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> samples were tested under the static load until failure. Benchmarking was carried on high strength prestressed concrete sleeper, tested according to AS 1085 : 14 : 2003 : Rail Seat - Positive Moment Test. The results obtained showed the maximum load that the used wooden sleepers can carry surpassed the design load of KTMB specifications and it is about 58 % of high strength prestressed concrete sleeper. The maximum deflection produced by all used wooden sleepers is 20 mm showing that the sleepers maintained their elastic behaviour. Modulus of Elasticity ranging from 21 to 27 kN/mm 2 of which within the standard value, indicating weathering process does not so much affect their stiffness. Most sleepers showed crack patterns propagated in the longitudinal direction. Toughness value is almost one half of the high strength prestressed concrete sleeper. This study indicates that there is a potential of reusing the wooden sleepers for light loading of the railway track. Hence, an extensive study is recommended to be carried out under fatigue loading condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} for this thesis {{work is the}} need for improving reliability of equipment and quality of service to railway passengers as well as a requirement for cost-effective and efficient condition maintenance management for rail transportation. This thesis work develops a fusion of various machine vision analysis methods to achieve high performance in automation of wooden rail track inspection. The condition monitoring in rail transport is done manually by a human operator where people rely on inference systems and assumptions to develop conclusions. The use of conditional monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to avoid the consequences of failure, before the failure occurs. Manual or automated condition monitoring of materials in fields of public transportation like railway, aerial navigation, traffic safety, etc, where safety is of prior importance needs non-destructive testing (NDT). In general, wooden railway sleeper inspection is done manually by a human operator, by moving along the rail sleeper and gathering information by visual and sound analysis for examining the presence of cracks. Human inspectors working on lines visually inspect wooden rails to judge the quality of rail sleeper. In this project work the machine vision system is developed based on the manual visual analysis system, which uses digital cameras and image processing software to perform similar manual inspections. As the manual inspection requires much effort and is expected to be error prone sometimes and also appears difficult to discriminate even for a human operator by the frequent changes in inspected material. The machine vision system developed classifies the condition of material by examining individual pixels of images, processing them and attempting to develop conclusions with the assistance of knowledge bases and features. A pattern recognition approach is developed based on the methodological knowledge from manual procedure. The pattern recognition approach for this thesis work was developed and achieved by a non destructive testing method to identify the flaws in manually done condition monitoring of sleepers. In this method, a test vehicle is designed to capture sleeper images similar to visual inspection by human operator and the raw data for pattern recognition approach is provided from the captured images of the wooden sleepers. The data from the NDT method were further processed and appropriate features were extracted. The collection of data by the NDT method is to achieve high accuracy in reliable classification results. A key idea is to use the non supervised classifier based on the features extracted from the method to discriminate the condition of wooden sleepers in to either good or bad. Self organising map is used as classifier for the <b>wooden</b> <b>sleeper</b> classification. In order to achieve greater integration, the data collected by the machine vision system was made to interface with one another by a strategy called fusion. Data fusion was looked in at two different levels namely sensor-level fusion, feature- level fusion. As the goal was to reduce the accuracy of the human error on the rail sleeper classification as good or bad the results obtained by the feature-level fusion compared to that of the results of actual classification were satisfactory...|$|E

50|$|Small metal {{sleepers}} {{were also}} used, using small {{nuts and bolts}} holding a very small plate {{to the foot of}} the rail. The lack of photographic evidence makes it impossible to say conclusively, but we assume the metal and <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> were both used in a repeating pattern together, the metal sleepers keeping the gauge, and the wider <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> providing stability to hold the whole formation in place. Rough shingle ballast was used as dictated by the available supplies.

40|$|Purpose. The {{deficit of}} {{permanent}} way (PW) material elements {{leads to a}} revision of the re-use of old serviceable object after their replacement or repair. As {{an example is the}} following fact, that after the wear in the under-rail area of <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> and beams, or other defects that prevent their further exploitation, there is an acute issue of their planned replacement. Usually, the required minimum margin of sleepers is always in the track service brigades. As for the wooden beams the length of which in the turnouts is up to 5 m, there is not always possible quickly replace them {{due to the lack of}} size in the short term. Therefore, the geometric dimensions of the connect elements of the two halves of the beams or sleepers in a single rigid structure were proposed and justified and its characteristics do not differ from solid beam. Methodology. The authors considered the calculation algorithm of wooden elements connection and mathematical models that describe the elastic properties of base. The most adequate technique that fully characterizes the interactions beam in the form of a beam of finite length on the ballast was determined. Findings. The qualitative and quantitative verification of the results showed a very good agreement between the values of bending moments, shear forces and deflections that were obtained by the finite difference method (FDM) and the analytical method. It gives the reason to believe that the received geometric dimensions of nag connection can be recommended to employees of track facilities to connect the <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> on the switches and crossovers. Originality. The nag connection geometrical sizes of two <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> in the beam for using on switches were substantiated. Practical value. The proposed joint design allows re-using of renovated old <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> and bars. This design can be applied not only for the connection of conventional <b>wooden</b> <b>sleepers</b> in the beam of desired length, but also to create the halves of a single sleeper designs for lightly loaded sections of the station and access routes...|$|R
