30|$|Assuming {{the same}} viscosity, 2  ×  1018  Pa s, for all {{viscoelastic}} media (Model 1), the mantle wedge and oceanic mantle relaxations affect the horizontal surface deformation equally (Fig.  5 a), causing eastward motion onshore and westward motion on the seafloor (Fig.  4 b, e). Regarding the vertical surface deformation, subsidence was dominant {{across the entire}} Tohoku district and was controlled mainly by relaxation in the oceanic mantle (Fig.  4 e). This model can explain the observed horizontal deformation, although it cannot explain the vertical deformation characteristics. The main problem with this model is the assumption of the same viscosity for all viscoelastic media. Previous studies of viscoelastic relaxation at subduction zones have reported that the difference in viscosity between the mantle wedge and the oceanic mantle significantly affects the surface deformation (Hu et al. 2004; Wang 2007). In addition, these two media contribute differently to the surface deformation, as mentioned in the previous subsection. Moreover, DeMets et al. (2014) recently reported that the viscosity of the asthenosphere below the oceanic plate is greater than 1  ×  1019  Pa s. Since we considered that the viscosity of the oceanic mantle is {{higher than that of}} the mantle wedge, we used a viscosity value for the oceanic mantle of at least 1  ×  1019  Pa s. On the basis of Model 1 and the results of the previous studies, we next designed Model 2, which assumes different viscosities between the mantle <b>wedge,</b> <b>set</b> at 2  ×  1018  Pa s, and the oceanic mantle, set at 1  ×  1019  Pa s.|$|E

40|$|In many ultrafast applications, ultrashort pulse lasers are {{combined}} with temporal compressors {{to achieve a}} desired pulse duration in a target or sample. Precise temporal characterization is important for knowing the actual pulse shape and optimizing the compression itself. The dispersion-scan (d-scan) technique is a recent approach for the simultaneous measurement and compression of femtosecond pulses. It usually involves using glass wedges to impart variable, well-defined amounts of dispersion to the pulses while measuring the spectrum of a nonlinear signal produced by those pulses {{as a function of}} dispersion. This works very well for broadband few-cycle pulses, but longer, narrower bandwidths pulses are much more difficult to measure this way because of the limited amount of dispersion that can be introduced by a <b>wedge</b> <b>set.</b> Here we present and demonstrate the concept of self-calibrating d-scan, which furthermore extends the applicability of the d-scan technique to pulses of arbitrary temporal length, enabling their complete measurement without previous knowledge of the introduced dispersion, while retaining all the advantages of the technique. In particular, we show that the pulse compressors employed in chirped pulse amplification (CPA) systems (usually based in diffraction gratings or prisms) can be used to simultaneously measure the output pulses on-target in a simple way, {{while at the same time}} calibrating the often unknown dispersion of the compressor itself. We demonstrate the technique through simulations and experiments under known conditions.

Within this article we present an approach to extract Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) in 2 D from raster images as we previously did from 3 D models.

The ultimate source areas of the Cenozoic sequences have been suggested to be either mainland SE Asia/Indochina or Borneo itself. During the Paleogene until the earliest Miocene, deep marine turbidites were deposited in an accretionary <b>wedge</b> <b>setting.</b> Provenance studies on these Paleogene sediments based on detrital modes of sandstones and heavy mineral studies show that they have all been derived from a recycled orogenic source. Upper Cretaceous to Eocene sediments, the Sapulut and Trusmadi Formations, are compositionally mature (quartzose recycled), and may have been derived from mainland SE Asia/Indochina. During the Eocene there was an important change in sediment maturity and a provenance shift from quartzose to intermediate recycled sandstones. Heavy mineral studies show that the Eocene-Oligocene sediments of the Crocker Formation are mainly derived from granite, and that granite debris has been derived directly from its source or has been only slightly recycled/transported. The ultimate source area for these sediments was probably the Schwaner Mountains of southern Borneo, although a minor component of ophiolite debris suggests derivation from nearby basement of northern Borneo. The relative immaturity and heavy mineral suites of the Crocker Formation indicate it was derived from Borneo itself rather than SE Asia/Indochina, but primarily from basement sources rather than by recycling of older sediments...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} a scenario where gravitational dynamics {{emerges from the}} holographic hydrodynamics of some microscopic, quantum system living in a local Rindler wedge. We start by considering the area scaling properties of the entanglement entropy of a local Rindler horizon as a conceptually basic realization of the holographic principle. From the generalized second law and the Bekenstein bound we derive the gravitational dynamics via the entropy balance approach developed in [Jacobson 1995]. We show how this setting can account for the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium features associated with the gravitational dynamics and extend the thermodynamical derivation from General Relativity to generalized Brans-Dicke theories. We then concentrate on the possibility to define a version of fluid/gravity correspondence within the local Rindler <b>wedge</b> <b>setting.</b> We show how the hydrodynamical description of the horizon can be directly associated to a hydrodynamical description of the thermal fields. Because of the holographic behavior, {{the properties of the}} Rindler wedge thermal gauge theory are effectively encoded in a codimension one system living close to the Rindler horizon. In a large scale analysis, this system {{can be thought of as}} a fluid living on a codimension one stretched horizon membrane. This sets an apparent duality between the horizon local geometry and the fluid limit of the thermal gauge theory. Beyond the connection between the classical Navier-Stokes equations and a classical geometry, we discuss the possibility to realize such a duality at any point in spacetime by means of the equivalence principle. Given the shared local Rindler geometric setting, we eventually deal with the intriguing possibility to link the fluid/Rindler correspondence to the derivation of the gravitational field equations from a local non-equilibrium spacetime thermodynamics...|$|R

This research project is divided into two phases: in the first phase, a new experimental device and a new erosion procedure were tested; in the second phase, the case study of the Northern Apennine have been investigated with an experimental approach. The new experimental device is similar to the classic sandbox of Malavieille [1984] but some new features have been introduced: * the sandbox is longer, allowing more shortening; * the geometry of the base plate is more realistic, featuring a subduction plane. Erosion was performed proportionally to the surface rise: the areas of the prism where the relief grows faster are submitted to a more intense erosion. This simple methodology allows not to impose a slope angle to the erosion surface. Experiments performed in the first phase are compared to older analogical and numerical studies already published in literature, in order to better outline the effects of the new experimental device. Experiments performed in the second phase are compared to the Northern Apennine, on a transect through the Apuan Alps.

Experiments have been carried out under thermally-developing flow conditions for a range of Reynolds numbers. De-ionized water and alumina/water-based dilute nanofluids have been employed as the coolant medium. The nanofluid-based experiments employ three volumetric concentrations of 0. 01 %, 0. 03 % and 0. 05 %. Projection data of the convective fields have been recorded using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Phenomena such as thermal boundary layer profiles and thickness of thermal boundary layer have been interpreted based on the infinite fringe setting mode of the interferometer, while the quantitative information in the form of whole-field temperature distributions and heat transfer coefficients have been retrieved from the <b>wedge</b> fringe <b>setting.</b> Effects of increasing Reynolds numbers and volumetric concentrations of nanofluids on thermal boundary layer profiles and the resultant heat transfer rates have been investigated. Results of the experiments carried out at low Reynolds number (Re < 513) reveal that the thermal boundary layer profiles are nearly insensitive to the changes in the concentrations of dilute nanofluids, while a significant enhancement in the heat transfer coefficient is seen as the concentrations of nanofluid is increased. On other hand, at higher Reynolds numbers, increasing concentrations of dilute nanofluids leads to a considerable increase in the thickness of thermal boundary layer that is accompanied with a mild deterioration in the heat transfer rates. Based on the primary findings of the experiments, that are purely non-intrusive in nature, various plausible mechanisms that govern the heat transfer characteristics of dilute nanofluids have been discussed.
