5|$|At {{the base}} of the deposit, these {{sandstones}} are reddish brown, very micaceous and shaley, sometimes containing calcareous nodules, ferruginous concretions and vegetable wax; above, they are gray and quartziferous. This is the Aye formation, including spiriferida like Cyrtospirifer verneuili, Rhynchonellida as Rhynchonella pugnus and R. boloniensis, some Orthoceras, Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis Well-preserved feldspar and mica probably come from <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> under a semi-arid climate of mountains present in the Netherlands today and extending to Düsseldorf.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). <b>Wind</b> <b>erosion</b> generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> of loess.|$|E

5|$|Meteorites from Antarctica are an {{important}} area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the Adelie Land meteorite. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.|$|E
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people walking over it, leading to blowout, the rapid <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|E
5|$|The National Trust {{took control}} of the Tor in 1933, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, {{excavations}} identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with <b>wind</b> <b>erosion,</b> started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.|$|E

25|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{windbreak}} or a shelterbelt is to protect areas from <b>wind</b> causing <b>erosion</b> on the bare soil of croplands. Windbreaks can also serve as an area that separates fields and protects them from spray drift of pesticides.|$|R
5|$|Wind roses are tools used to {{determine}} the direction of the prevailing wind. Knowledge of the prevailing wind allows the development of prevention strategies for <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> of agricultural land, such as across the Great Plains. Sand dunes can orient themselves perpendicular to the prevailing wind regime within coastal and desert locations. Insects drift along with the prevailing wind, while birds are able to fly more independently of it. Prevailing winds in mountain locations can lead to significant rainfall gradients within the topography, ranging from wet across windward-facing slopes to desert-like conditions along their lee slopes. Prevailing winds can have differences due to the uneven heating of the Earth.|$|E

40|$|The Mutch Memorial Station (Viking Lander 1) on Mars {{acquired}} {{imaging and}} meteorological data {{over a period}} of 2245 martian days (3. 3 martian years). This article discusses the deposition and erosion of thin deposits (ten to hundreds of micrometers) of bright red dust associated with global dust storms, and the removal of centimeter amounts of material in selected areas during a dust storm late in the third winter. Atmospheric pressure data acquired during the period of intense erosion imply that baroclinic disturbances and strong diurnal solar tidal heating combined to produce strong <b>winds.</b> <b>Erosion</b> occurred principally in areas where soil cohesion was reduced by earlier surface sampler activities. Except for redistribution of thin layers of materials, the surface appears to be remarkably stable, perhaps because of cohension of the undisturbed surface material...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although many {{different}} erosion processes affect the coastal area of South Iran, <b>wind</b> caused <b>erosion,</b> considered a restrictive factor in human activities, makes {{one of the}} more common landscapes of the coastal strip. Therefore the recognition of <b>wind</b> caused <b>erosion</b> and its result is inevitable to conduct an effective coastal management. This study discusses the littoral geomorphologic shape of Hormuz Striate, evaluates the process of transferring sands from the genesis point of view, analyses the destructive and sedimentary roles of erosion process and the effective factors in them and finally assesses the effect of this phenomenon in human’s activities. This research is based upon documental and detailed field studies; the experimental models of wind-caused erosion, its effect in shaping processes and littoral strip transformation were used. It was recognized from the results that the littoral strip is the main supplier of the sands in this region. During the ebb and flow period, these sands are transferred into the coastal area by noontime wind which would be blow from sea towards the land. With regard to the climatic conditions of this region, we should take necessary steps towards controlling the transfer of sand and promoting the stabilization of sand among the local residents.

40|$|Barrow, Alaska {{with little}} warning. The storm was “unique in its {{violence}} and consequences ” (Schafer 1966). The cyclone {{that produced the}} strong <b>winds,</b> <b>erosion,</b> and flooding in Barrow originated along the Arctic front over Siberia around 145. 6 o E late on 1 Oct 1963. Over the next 24 hours it traversed to the coast and continued northward on a track typical for such systems. However, shortly after 9 pm (all times Alaska Standard Time) on 2 Oct, the storm turned eastward and commenced a rapid deepening, reaching an estimated minimum central pressure of 976 hPa at 11 am on 3 Oct, while located in the Beaufort Sea north of Barrow (Lynch et al. 2003). The strongest winds at Barrow were reported between 1 and 3 pm with gusts possibly as high as 70 kts (36 ms-...|$|R

25|$|The type of {{desertification}} {{caused by}} year-round pasturing of cattle has been termed {{the most devastating}} in Central Asia, with the gravest situations in Turkmenistan and the Kazakh steppe along the eastern and northern coasts of the Caspian Sea. <b>Wind</b> <b>erosion</b> and desertification also are severe in settled areas along the Garagum Canal; planted windbreaks have died because of soil waterlogging and/or salinization. Other factors promoting desertification are the inadequacy of the collector-drainage system built in the 1950s and inappropriate application of chemicals.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{of the floor}} of the canyon system between Candor and Melas chasmata is grooved. This is interpreted to be alluvial deposits and/or material that has collapsed or contracted by the removal of ice or water. There are also portions of older and younger massive floor {{material of}} volcaniclastic origin - only separated in age by crater distribution. Also there is etched massive floor material that is like the younger and older massive material except that it has <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> features on it. There are also a few spires of undivided material composed of the same material as the canyon walls.|$|E
25|$|A {{buffer strip}} {{is an area}} of land {{maintained}} in permanent vegetation that helps to control air, soil, and water quality, along with other environmental problems, dealing primarily on land that is used in agriculture. Buffer strips trap sediment, and enhance filtration of nutrients and pesticides by slowing down runoff that could enter the local surface waters. The root systems of the planted vegetation in these buffers hold soil particles together which alleviate the soil of <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> and stabilize stream banks providing protection against substantial erosion and landslides. Farmers can also use buffer strips to square up existing crop fields to provide safety for equipment while also farming more efficiently.|$|E

25|$|A simpler system, {{developed}} later, uses a {{concave disc}} (or {{a pair of}} them) set at a large angle to the direction of progress, that uses the concave shape to hold the disc into the soil– unless something hard strikes the circumference of the disk, causing it to roll {{up and over the}} obstruction. As the arrangement is dragged forward, the sharp edge of the disc cuts the soil, and the concave surface of the rotating disc lifts and throws the soil to the side. It doesn't make as good a job as the mouldboard plough (but this is not considered a disadvantage, because it helps fight <b>wind</b> <b>erosion),</b> but it does lift and break up the soil (see disc harrow).|$|E
25|$|The Hekla {{area was}} once forested. Forest and some grasses {{are much more}} {{resilient}} to ash and pumice fall than low vegetation, but the combined effect of human habitation and the volcanic activity has left an unstable surface very susceptible to erosion. Hekluskógar, a 90,000ha reforesting project is attempting to restore the birch and willow woodland to the slopes of Hekla, starting with soil fertilisation and grass sowing. This would stabilize the large areas of volcanic ash, help to reduce <b>wind</b> <b>erosion</b> of the frost heaved surface, slow drainage rates and hence water erosion, and ultimately increase biodiversity. It is the largest reforestation of its type in Europe. After an eruption, {{almost all of the}} 'safe sites' on new lava flows are colonised by mosses within 20 years expanding to a homogeneous layer up to 20cm thick within 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The second {{method used}} was the linear-plus-cubic diffusion, {{which is a}} model of fault scarping. This method uses the {{diffusive}} process on hill slopes, such as rain-splash and <b>wind</b> <b>erosion,</b> that move sediment down hill. t = t’(SO)*2/k (0). The last method used to date the faulting was the morphologic dating without numerical model. Such a technique requires that down slope debris instability is a timedependent function of slope angle, in units of volume per time per length of contour (Nash, 2005). The scarp ages can be determined based on the relationship Ta/Tb = H*-2 b / H-2 b From the first method we can conclude that there were at least five seismic events that did not occur at the same time. From method two we can say than the faulting ages between 57ka to 377ka with surface offset of 11.2m that had a magnitude of 6-7 earthquakes. Finally the third method of dating concludes that the relative ages of the east Potrillo fault scarps ranges form 153,000 to 239,000.|$|E
