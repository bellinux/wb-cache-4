5|$|Holographic {{interferometry}} {{was discovered}} by accident {{as a result of}} mistakes committed during the making of holograms.

5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E

5|$|With modern {{insights}} into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles {{close to the}} speed of light, particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms. The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed. Only four main interactions are known: in order of decreasing strength, they are: strong, electromagnetic, <b>weak,</b> <b>and</b> gravitational. High-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.|$|E
5|$|A broad mid-tropospheric trough {{over the}} southeastern United States spawned {{an area of}} {{convection}} over the lower Mississippi River Valley on July 13, and drifted southward towards the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> isolated surface low pressure area formed {{off the coast of}} Louisiana. The circulation in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On July 16, deep convection increased and organized near the center, and oil rigs and surface buoys reported surface winds of 30mph (50km/h). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150miles (240km) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on February7 south of Diego Garcia. For about a week, the system remained <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> changed directions several times; after an eastward movement, it {{turned to the}} northwest, curved to the southeast, and later began a steady track to the southwest. On February13, it intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and quickly attained peak winds of 95km/h (60mph). Given the name Haja, the storm passed southeast of Rodrigues and Réunion. Haja approached the southeast coast of Madagascar, but turned to the southeast and weakened, dissipating on February19.|$|E
5|$|According to Fumić, {{the weaker}} and ill {{children}} were lodged with compassionate local peasants, but 350 {{of the strongest}} children were taken away by the fighters. According to Lukić, a total of 727 children were liberated from the camp, but at the first rest stop at Svetojanska, medical examinations by Davila identified about 400 <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> sick children who could no longer walk, and they were returned to Jastrebarsko. Davila estimates {{the number of children}} actually liberated from the camp at around 400.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} {{developed on}} May2, 2002 near Sri Lanka, {{associated with a}} <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> broad circulation center. The system tracked west-northwestward through the Arabian Sea along a trough near the equator. Its thunderstorm activity was enhanced by a ridge to its north, though was also removed from the center. By May5, the circulation had become better defined, and concurrently the convection increased over the center. After further organization, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the system as Depression ARB01A on May6. Around the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it as Tropical Depression 01A, while located about 1300km (800mi) southeast of Salalah, Oman.|$|E
50|$|Fly {{sparging}} (or German sparging), {{which is}} used by commercial breweries and many homebrewers, uses continuous process sparging. When the wort reaches a desired level (typically about 1 in) above the grainbed, water is added at the same slow rate that wort is being drained. The wort gradually becomes <b>weaker</b> <b>and</b> <b>weaker,</b> <b>and</b> at a certain point, they stop adding water. This results in greater yields.|$|R

5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be <b>weak</b> <b>and</b> ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E
