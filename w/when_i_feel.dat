[...] "When there are no safe bets, that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> my blood move."

[...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

2500|$|The brazen {{quality of}} Turner's screen roles was {{reflected}} in her public life. With her deep voice, Turner was often compared to a young Lauren Bacall.

2500|$|Author Ian Inglis {{describes}} the song's melody as [...] "romantic".

Inglis writes that Harrison goes on to state both [...] " [...] {{he wants to do}} for his lover" [...] and [...] "what he hopes for in return", in the respective lines [...] "To try to love you more" [...] and [...] "A smile <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> blue".|$|E

2500|$|Frank Williams gave Regazzoni {{his final}} drive in a {{competitive}} car alongside Alan Jones. The Williams FW07 proved to be very competitive, especially in the final part of the season, with FW07s winning {{all but two of}} the final six races of the 1979 calendar. The first win was for Regazzoni, at Silverstone, the first of over 100 victories for the Williams Grand Prix team. In deference to the team's Saudi sponsors, he celebrated on the podium with Lilt. However, despite his achievement, once again he was replaced by Carlos Reutemann {{at the end of the}} season. At the Italian Grand Prix, motor sport journalist Nigel Roebuck asked Regazzoni why he continued to drive at the age of 40, with no prospect of a competitive seat. Regazzoni replied, [...] "I love , and most of all I love to drive racing cars. So why should I stop <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> this way?". At the end of the year he was invited to compete in the 1980 International Race of Champions, the last active Formula One driver, alongside Mario Andretti, to do so.|$|E

(My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as [...] "me myself" [...] instead of [...] "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...) ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Dish Network {{announced}} that it was dropping The Weather Channel at 12:00a.m. Eastern Time that day in favor of its own similar weather information channel, The Weather Cast. The carriage dispute was over the rates that The Weather Channel asked Dish Network to pay: from 11¢ per subscriber per month to 12¢, a 9% increase, totaling $140,000 per month. The dispute was also over The Weather Channel's programming format shifting from an information-based channel to an entertainment-based service. The Weather Channel said in a statement, [...] "Dish has chosen to be the first distributor to drop The Weather Channel rather than pay the standard industry rates others in the industry have already agreed to pay", and encouraged Dish Network customers to switch to other pay television providers. Dave Shull, senior vice president for programming for Dish Network said The Weather Channel's fees were harder for the satellite provider to justify paying as more people receive weather information through the internet and mobile services: [...] "They're looking for bid increases <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like there's a real migration to the Web, and it's difficult to really justify those rate increases at this time." ...|$|E
