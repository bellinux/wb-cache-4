5|$|In 1954, she {{published}} The Divine King in England, {{in which}} she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies {{all over the world}} sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, and that, for instance, the death of William II <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Tarkington's {{accompanying}} essay {{published in}} the February 20, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> fable or parable in which youthful Adolf Hitler and youthful Benito Mussolini meet in The Alps in 1912. During the fictional meeting both men describe plans to secure dictatorships in their respective countries via the suppression of freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|Mara Aramov arrives {{to shoot}} Phagan, but she convinces Gabe and Lian {{that she came}} to help. The three travel to PharCom's {{warehouses}} in hopes of preventing Rhoemer from launching a missile. Lian reveals that the serum Gabe injected into the test subjects <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> lethal chemical, and Markinson was having them killed. Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.|$|E

5|$|The list of cardinal-nephews {{includes}} {{at least}} fifteen, and possibly {{as many as}} nineteen popes (Gregory IX, Alexander IV, Adrian V, Gregory XI, Boniface IX, Innocent VII, Eugene IV, Paul II, Alexander VI, Pius III, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Benedict XIII, and Pius VII; perhaps also John XIX and Benedict IX, if they were really promoted cardinals; as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII, if in fact they were related to their elevators); one antipope (John XXIII); {{and two or three}} saints (Charles Borromeo, Guarinus of Palestrina, and perhaps Anselm of Lucca, if he <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> cardinal).|$|E
5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E

It {{is usually}} {{considered to have}} been adopted to aid forward visibility for the driver (a rather different pattern of smoke deflector), {{but there is some}} evidence that the real reason was to reduce the chance of lineside fires (rather like the prominent 'stacks' of early United States designs).|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} allegedly {{centered on}} a falsified conversation between Karamanlis and Strauss, a Bavarian officer of the King. They also alleged that {{a photograph of the}} former New Democracy leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis, standing next to a uniformed Nazi officer, repeatedly published by the PASOK-leaning Greek daily Avriani, <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> photomontage that had been fabricated in Bulgaria. Their disclosures have not been challenged to this day.|$|E

25|$|Staying {{away from}} each other proves to be very painful and {{difficult}} for Tad and Dixie, especially considering that Pine Valley is a small town. Try as she may, Dixie is unable to stay away from Tad and when JR is kidnapped, Dixie immediately calls Tad.

25|$|Segametsi's {{stepfather}} {{was arrested}} after confessing {{that he and}} other local businessmen killed the girl, but he retracted his statement, saying that the confession <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> second-hand account. While the named businessmen were arrested, they were released, sparking controversy in Mochudi. In 2008, Sekobye Mokgalo, one of the named businessmen, asked for government compensation for the wrongful conviction. In 2009, he received 300,000 Botswana pula for damages from the government.|$|E
25|$|During the trial, {{the defense}} {{maintained}} their {{claim that the}} crash {{was the result of}} Alvarez's aborted suicide attempt and he never intended to hurt anyone, but prosecutors claimed he deliberately caused the crash in an attempt to get attention from his estranged wife, citing that he doused his SUV with gasoline beforehand. A relative of one of the victims questioned why Alvarez did not simply lie down on the tracks if it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> suicide attempt.|$|E

25|$|After Tassoni and Angelica depart, the horrified Concetta sees Tancredi in {{a radically}} {{different}} light. What she had once believed was a vulgar attempt to seduce Angelica <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> momentary lapse of judgment. Tancredi loved only her and never ceased to regret marrying Angelica. She also realizes that Tancredi's attempt to enter the convent was in reality a subtle marriage proposal directed to her. After fifty years, Concetta is at last stripped of the comfort of blaming her father and cousin for her own mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Worried about Britain's other {{interests}} in Iran, and (thanks to the Tudeh party) believing that Iran's nationalism <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> Soviet-backed plot, Britain persuaded US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles that Iran was {{falling to the}} Soviets—effectively exploiting the American Cold War mindset. Since President Harry S. Truman was busy fighting a war in Korea, he did not agree {{to overthrow the government}} of Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, in 1953, when Dwight D. Eisenhower became president, the UK convinced the U.S. to undertake a joint coup d'état.|$|E
25|$|We {{were able}} to use archival pieces from Van Cleef & Arpels, which came with a {{revolving}} door of security guards. The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. When you see Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E

25|$|The Quinlan Quints: four {{quintuplets}} (the fifth {{one went}} missing {{and has never}} been found) who live in Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador – inspired by the fame of the Dionne quintuplets; portrayed by Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh (Colin Mochrie plays Mercer's quint role for seasons 9 and 10). Usually interviewed by Mercer's character J.B. Dickson, the Quints would boast about something outlandish that Dickson has a hard time believing until one of the quints (usually Jones) spills the beans and reveals that what they were promoting <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> scam.

25|$|After the Khmer advance was checked, Anawrahta {{turned his}} {{attention}} toward Nanzhao. Anawrahta led a campaign against the kingdom in the northeast. (According to a mid-17th century source, he began the march on 16 December 1757.) He advanced to Dali, the capital of Nanzhao Kingdom, ostensibly to seek a Buddha's tooth relic. As {{in the case of}} the request for the scriptures from Thaton, it <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> demand for tribute. The ruler of Nanzhao shut the gates, and would not give up the relic. After a long pause, two kings exchanged presents and conversed amicably. The Nanzhao ruler gave Anawrahta a jade image which had come into contact with the tooth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{anthropologist}} Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley {{are among those}} who questioned {{the involvement of the}} ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe that Gilles de Rais <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>a</b> witch and adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess, Diana. However, most historians reject Murray's theory. Norman Cohn argues that her theory does not agree with what is known of Gilles' crimes and trial. Historians do not regard Gilles as a martyr to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars tend to view him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.|$|E
