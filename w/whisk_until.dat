25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire <b>whisk</b> <b>until</b> frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

5000|$|The sweet dumplings {{are made}} of egg yolk, flour, sugar, and vanilla, mixed into a thin dough. Then egg white is <b>whisked</b> <b>until</b> it is stiff and folded {{carefully}} into the dough. Afterwards dumplings (Nocken, diminutive: Nockerl, cf. Gnocchi) are formed and baked on low heat in an oven.|$|R
5000|$|The omelette {{commonly}} includes {{finely chopped}} green chili peppers and onions (or shallots), {{finely chopped fresh}} green coriander, salt, and zeera (cumin). Variations include grated coconut, ground black pepper, curry leaves, and finely chopped tomatoes. [...] Grated cheese may also be added. The egg mixture is <b>whisked</b> <b>until</b> fluffy and then cooked on a skillet. Usually the skillet is not warmed much before the mixture is poured in {{and it does not}} immediately solidify. The stove is usually turned on right before the egg is poured in.|$|R
5000|$|Swiss Meringue is whisked over a {{bain-marie}} to {{warm the}} egg whites, and then <b>whisked</b> steadily <b>until</b> it cools. This forms a dense, glossy marshmallow-like meringue. It is usually then baked.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} make a beurre monté, boil a very small {{quantity}} of water, i.e. 15-60 mL (1-4 tablespoons). Once water has come to a boil, turn the heat down and start whisking the cold butter into the water, one or two chunks at a time. Add more butter whenever the chunks have melted. Once the emulsion is started, more butter can be added at a time. Continue adding butter while <b>whisking</b> <b>until</b> one has the desired quantity of beurre monté. The beurre monté must then be held warm, but under [...] or else it will break.|$|R

50|$|Steps for {{the extra}} cheese mbejuPut into a bowl the Paraguayan cheese with the butter, whisk with a spoon until it is cream. Add the starch {{and a little bit}} of salt, as soon as it gets hard add some milk and <b>whisk</b> again <b>until</b> it gets cream.For the filling, cut the {{tomatoes}} and the cheese. In a hot pan add the dough covering the entire surface, on the top add the tomatoes and the cheese the oregano, basil, {{and a little bit of}} pepper. Cover up the pan again with some more dough, and cook for 3 minutes on each side.|$|R

The way the fairy-servants do is this: The men, scores of them, climb up the trees and shake the branches, and the blossom falls like snow. Then the lady servants sweep it together by <b>whisking</b> their skirts <b>until</b> it is exactly like a table-cloth, {{and that is how}} they get their table-cloth.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of freezing, thickening and storage on the physical properties of the strawberry desserts made with addition of various hydrocolloids. The strawberry cultivars ‘Polka’, ‘Honeoye’, and ‘Senga Sengana’ harvested in Latvia were used in the study. The strawberries were processed in a blender for obtaining a homogenous mass. The strawberry mass was analyzed fresh and after storage at - 18 °C. Both fresh and frozen strawberry mass samples with added gelatine, xanthan gum, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose were <b>whisked</b> <b>until</b> obtaining dessert. For determination of the optimum hydrocolloid amount, sensory evaluation was done using a five-point hedonic scale. Moisture, soluble solids content, density, and pH of the product were determined. Apparent viscosity was measured using a rotational viscometer DV–III Ultra. Consistency of the dessert during its storage was evaluated using a texture analyser TA. XT. plus. The results of sensory evaluation allow concluding that in order to provide the most acceptable consistency, colour, and taste of strawberry dessert, the optimum quantity of carboxymethyl cellulose and xanthan gum to be added is 0. 6 % and that of gelatine is 6 %. During freezing, the soluble solids content and pH level decreased in the strawberry mass, whereas the addition of hydrocolloids increased these values. The moisture content in strawberry puree, in its turn, as a result of freezing increased under the influence of syneresis, but added hydrocolloids, on the contrary, decreased this influence. Also the viscosity and consistency of the strawberry puree prepared from the researched cultivars decreased under the influence of freezing, whereas the addition of hydrocolloids increased both the values, making the strawberry dessert firmer. The research suggests that strawberry dessert with gelatine had the most pronounced changes during storage, but strawberry dessert with added xanthan gum and carboxymethyl cellulose changed the least...|$|R
5000|$|Eggs are sieved, and <b>whisked</b> {{with water}} <b>until</b> the mixture are {{completely}} blended in a cream-like consistency. Sometimes, kelp and/or anchovy broth {{is used in}} place of water for a richer flavor. Optional ingredients include mushrooms, peas, onions, Korean zucchini, carrots, and other vegetables for their own twist on the dish. The dish is then seasoned with saeu-jeot (salted shrimp), myeongnan-jeot (salted pollock roe), or salt, and optionally ground black pepper. Before served, it is topped with chopped scallions or crown daisy greens, gochutgaru (chili flakes) or sil-gochu (shredded dry red chili), and toasted sesame seeds.|$|R
