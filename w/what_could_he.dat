5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were {{the days when the}} British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What, with me! No; he was {{not there}} with me. I have never seen the man since I first left Granpere to come here.' And then George Voss began to think what might have {{happened}} had Adrian Urmand been at the hotel while he was there himself. After all, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have said to Adrian Urmand? or <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have done to him? ...|$|E
60|$|Hers to decide? How {{was that}} possible? <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> mean? She pressed him with some such questions.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> comfort <b>could</b> <b>he</b> give her, <b>what</b> hope <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{hold out}} that the twist, now gnarled and knotted, might be removed, that she might gain peace of soul and body and the [...] "happiness" [...] {{of which he had}} talked with Alison Parr?... He raised his eyes, to {{discover}} that the woman's were fixed upon him, questioningly.|$|R
60|$|The {{words were}} unlike her, the tone was such {{as he had}} never heard her use. Do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not help the {{answering}} light which sprang into his own eyes.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see this, his own skull, {{yellow and}} eroded? Two centuries old. Would he still speak? Would he speak, if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see it, the grinning, aged skull? What {{would there be}} for him to say, to tell the people? <b>What</b> message <b>could</b> <b>he</b> bring? ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? In actual cash Mother and he {{had less}} than seven dollars in the world.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> say, {{since he}} did not know himself? He stammered, tried to speak, could not get {{anything}} out.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> but {{kiss the}} armful of furs? And a pretty armful it was, {{nestling}} against him wearily, but happy.|$|E
60|$|The tone of confidence, {{together}} with {{the testimony of the}} papyrus, and the boy's beautiful face, removed the last shadow of doubt from the eunuch's mind. Here was a great fact; but <b>what</b> use <b>could</b> <b>he</b> make of it? Above all, <b>what</b> advantage <b>could</b> <b>he</b> draw from it? He stood with his fat chin in his hand, turning it over in his cunning brain.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? Not even to God's elect {{does the}} sky always send down manna.|$|R
60|$|And an obstinacy in him {{made him}} {{put his arm}} round her and draw her to the shadow. She submitted: let him try <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. Let him try <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do. <b>He</b> leaned {{against the side of}} the stack, holding her. The stack stung him keenly with a {{thousand}} cold, sharp flames. Still obstinately he held her.|$|R
60|$|A thrill {{ran through}} her nerves. Who or <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> be, this silent man? Then {{suddenly}} it struck {{her that he}} might be dumb.|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? Talk it {{over with}} Soames? That would only make matters worse. And, after all, {{there was nothing in}} it, he felt sure.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hark at the innocent!" [...] rejoined Lenoir, with a sneer. [...] "What {{could he}} have done? Patriots, friends, brothers, I ask you, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have done?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jonas laughed very heartily at this question, {{but gave}} no answer. Rollo <b>could</b> not imagine <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{laughing}} at. Jonas, however, would not tell him, {{but said that}} he would know all about it, when he should come to see Franco Ney.|$|R
60|$|The {{doctor said}} that <b>he</b> would. <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> say? It {{appeared}} quite {{clear to him}} that some of Mary's fears were groundless.|$|R
5000|$|State Representative Jane H. Smith, a Republican from Bossier City, {{and herself}} a former {{superintendent}} in Bossier Parish, described Picard as [...] "a warrior and a fighter. He {{was right there}} until the very end, doing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> had {{a passion for the}} job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have on his mind?" [...] said Miss Salome. But {{she said}} it a little anxiously. She, too, had noticed Chester's absent ways and {{abstracted}} face.|$|E
6000|$|Scoutbush was {{honestly}} shocked. Who {{would have}} dreamed it? No {{one had ever}} {{told him that the}} cholera had really been there before. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? Send for Thurnall? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> find to eat?" [...] inquired Betsy. [...] "It's {{an awfully}} swell {{place to live}} in, but one can't breakfast on rubies and di'monds, or even gold." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? He locked them in, and was, {{through the}} failure of the man, in a quandary which made clear {{reflection}} necessaryâ€”and impossible.|$|R
50|$|To see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see.|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> they do? <b>He</b> {{does not}} {{actually}} break the law.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> tell {{to tempt}} my ear [...] From you? What high thing could there be, [...] So tenderly and sweetly dear [...] As my lost boyhood is to me? ...|$|E
60|$|He looked {{sideways}} at Barbara {{and wondered what}} she was so thoughtfully frowning over. Oh, lovely and delicate young creature! <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> adequately say of death and beauty and tenderness? Tenderness....|$|E
60|$|Rescued {{from death}} in the Arctic wastes, and reunited to a {{beautiful}} wife, the lieutenant looked, nevertheless, unaccountably anxious and depressed. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> be thinking of? He was thinking of Clara.|$|E
6000|$|... ... grief! {{the vital}} blood [...] Of that man's mind, what can it be? What food [...] Fed his first hopes? <b>what</b> {{knowledge}} <b>could</b> <b>he</b> gain? [...] 1802.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I met your--this young lady'--something {{told him}} {{that was not the}} proper way to put it, but hang it, <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> say?--'at the casino last night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Keswick, {{very much}} surprised. [...] "That {{is not at}} all like Mr Brandon. <b>What</b> reason <b>could</b> <b>he</b> have for {{treating}} you in such a manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{serve the}} gentleman with? The gentleman {{had not come}} to buy. He only desired to know whether Joanna Grice, who used to keep the dressmaker's shop, was still living? ...|$|E
60|$|Again, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do by way {{of earning}} a living? He did not {{know much about the}} City and its ways, but he knew enough to {{understand}} that summary dismissal from a bank is not the best recommendation one can put forward in applying for another job. And if he did not get another job in the City, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> do? If it were only summer, he might get taken on somewhere as a cricket professional. Cricket was his line. He could earn his pay at that. But it was very far from being summer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, isn't that {{a trifle}} unreasonable? <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>he</b> {{have done that}} he hasn't done? He was ill and worn out, but he wouldn't even stay a day after he got the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> {{you expect}} from sending a man made of our common, tormented clay on a voyage of discovery? <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> <b>he</b> find? <b>What</b> else <b>could</b> you {{understand}} or care for, or feel the existence of even? There was comedy in it, and slaughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{speaking}} {{of a man}} of that sort," [...] said Decoud, curtly. [...] "The heroes {{of the world have}} been feared and admired. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>he</b> want?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Knapp {{neither could}} persuade local farmers {{to adopt the}} {{techniques}} he had perfected on his farm, nor <b>could</b> <b>he</b> enlist farmers from the North {{to move to the}} region to serve collectively as a sort of educational catalyst. [...] <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do, <b>he</b> reasoned, was to provide incentives for farmers to settle in each township with the proviso that each, in turn, would demonstrate to other farmers <b>what</b> <b>could</b> be done by adopting his improved farming methods.|$|R
