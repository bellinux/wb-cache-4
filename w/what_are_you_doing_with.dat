6000|$|If {{the boys}} could do little with the Hydraulic, {{they were at}} no loss {{in regard to the}} Reservoirs, into which its feeding waters were {{gathered}} and held in reserve, I suppose, against a time of drought. There was the Little Reservoir first, and then a mile beyond it the Big Reservoir, and there was nearly always a large flat boat on each which was used for repairing the banks, but which the boys employed as a pleasure-barge. It seemed in some natural way to belong to them, and yet they had a feeling of something clandestine in pushing out on the Reservoir in it. Once they filled its broad, shallow hold with straw from a neighboring oatfield, and spent a long golden afternoon in simply lying under the hot September sun, {{in the middle of the}} Reservoir, and telling stories. My boy then learned, for the first time, that there was such a book as the [...] "Arabian Nights;" [...] one of the other boys told stories out of it, and he inferred that the sole copy in existence belonged to this boy. He knew that they all had school-books alike, but it did not occur to him that a book which was not a Reader or a Speller was ever duplicated. They did nothing with their boat except loll in it and tell stories, and as there was no current in the Reservoir, they must have remained pretty much in the same place; but they had a sense of the wildest adventure, which mounted to frenzy, when some men rose out of the earth on the shore, and shouted at them, [...] "Hello, there! <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>with</b> that boat?" [...] They must have had an oar; at any rate, they got to the opposite bank, and, springing to land, fled somewhere into the vaguest past.|$|E
