5|$|On 1 November 1944, the {{division}} was disbanded. At the same time, Albanians in Kosovo took up arms against the Partisans <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> {{that the region}} would not be unified with Albania after the war, despite earlier Partisan promises. Atrocities occurred when 30,000 Partisans were sent to Kosovo to quell Albanian resistance in the region. Between 3,000 and 25,000 Kosovo Albanians {{were killed in the}} ensuing violence.|$|E

5|$|The psychiatrists {{responsible}} for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> {{of the difficulties}} that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, {{who served as the}} Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.|$|E
5|$|Dean's other {{dream is}} a major {{turning point in the}} character's storyline, after which he starts gaining self-respect and realizes that he truly wants to live. He begins the season with little self-worth, and the writers {{realized}} that this outlook stems from his father, John Winchester. Initially, they planned to have Jeffrey Dean Morgan reprise his role as John, who would browbeat Dean within the dreamscape. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> that Morgan was busy filming Watchmen, the writers instead found inspiration in the junkyard scene from the film Superman III, in which good and evil versions of Superman confront one another. Kripke noted, however, that the conversation between the two Deans still focuses on John.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with other Native leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay out of the war.|$|E

5|$|The next event {{recorded}} {{in connection with}} the Hungarians is their raid against Italy in 899 and 900. The letter of Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans suggests that Emperor Arnulf incited them to attack King Berengar I of Italy. They routed the Italian troops on 2 September at the river Brenta and plundered the region of Vercelli and Modena in the winter, but the Doge of Venice, Pietro Tribuno defeated them at Venice on 29 June 900. They returned from Italy <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> of the death of Emperor Arnulf at the end of 899.|$|E
5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1832, the militiamen {{caught up}} with the British Band near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. To buy time for the noncombatants to cross the Wisconsin River, Black Hawk and Neapope confronted the Americans in a rear guard action that became known as the Battle of Wisconsin Heights. Black Hawk was desperately outnumbered, leading about 50 Sauks and 60 to 70 Kickapoos against 750 militiamen. The battle was a {{lopsided}} victory for the militiamen, who lost only one man while killing as many as 68 of Black Hawk's warriors. Despite the high casualties, the battle allowed much of the British Band, including many women and children, to escape across the river. Black Hawk had managed to hold off a much larger force while allowing most of his people to escape, a difficult military operation that impressed some U.S. Army officers <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> of it.|$|E

5|$|Von Oppen's battalions {{and about}} 700 German and 1,300 Ottoman {{soldiers}} in the 16th and 19th Infantry Divisions were moving north towards Beisan on 22 September <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> {{it had already been}} captured. He planned to continue his withdrawal north to Samakh during the night of 22 September, where he correctly guessed that Liman von Sanders would order a strong rearguard action. However, Jevad, the commander of the Eighth Army which included Asia Corps, ordered von Oppen to move eastwards across the Jordan River. Von Oppen got all the German and some of his Ottoman soldiers across the Jordan River before the 11th Cavalry Brigade attacked and closed that line of retreat during fighting to close the Jordan River gaps. All those who had not crossed the river were captured.|$|E
5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor knew who he was. In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned {{of the death of}} his young son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Egyptian General Headquarters (GHQ) in Cairo, {{sent the}} 139th Sa'iqa Group with its two battalions to Ismailia. They {{were given the}} {{objective}} of eliminating Israeli forces up to the Deversoir area and destroying Israeli bridges across the Suez Canal. A team of frogmen was attached for that end, and the group had no armor or heavy weaponry, and their only transports were large military trucks. GHQ did not include Second Army command {{in any of the}} planning, and in fact only notified Second Army of the operation on the morning of October 19, when the Sa'iqa Group had already begun moving to Ismailia from Cairo. This alarmed Second Army command, and Khalil ordered military police to stop the 139th Sa'iqa Group's vehicles at Abu Suweir, and have its commander, Colonel Osama Ibrahim, arrive at his headquarters in Ismailia. Ibrahim arrived that evening and met Khalil and Shazly. Both men were shocked <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> of Ibrahim's objectives, imaginary as they were and impossible to achieve, an indication of the state of confusion in GHQ at the time. Khalil canceled the entire operation and placed the Sa'iqa unit under Second Army's command instead, and Ibrahim in turn notified GHQ of his new orders. By midnight he was at Khalil's headquarters once more, where he was informed GHQ's reply: Ibrahim would proceed with his original mission.|$|E

Contrary to the theory, buyers are inclined to bid less <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> <b>they</b> have the high value. Consistent with theory, the overall proportion of efficient allocations is lower than in the first- price auction before information is revealed.
