5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with intervertebral discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} {{vary depending on}} <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracheobronchial tree is injured and how severely it is damaged. There are no direct signs of TBI, but certain signs suggest the injury and raise a clinician's suspicion that it has occurred. Many of the signs {{and symptoms}} are also present in injuries with similar injury mechanisms such as pneumothorax. Dyspnea and respiratory distress are found in 76–100% of people with TBI, and coughing up blood {{has been found in}} up to 25%. However, isolated TBI does not usually cause profuse bleeding; if such bleeding is observed {{it is likely to be}} due to another injury such as a ruptured large blood vessel. The patient may exhibit dysphonia or have diminished breath sounds, and rapid breathing is common. Coughing may be present, and stridor, an abnormal, high-pitched breath sound indicating obstruction of the upper airway can also occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{serotonin}} neurotransmitter has {{the ability}} to mediate synaptic transmission through either GPCR's or LGIC receptors. Depending on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain region serotonin is being acted upon, will depend on whether the output is either increasing or decreasing post-synaptic responses. The most popular and widely used drugs in the regulation of serotonin during depression are known as SSRIs or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These drugs inhibit the transport of serotonin back into the pre-synaptic neuron, leaving more serotonin in the synaptic gap to be used.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a static analysis technique based on pro-gram slicing for CSP specifications. Given a particular event in a CSP specification, our technique {{allows us to}} know <b>what</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specifi-cation must necessarily be executed before this event, and <b>what</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specification could be executed before it in some execution. Our tech-nique {{is based on a}} new data structure which extends the Synchronized Control Flow Graph (SCFG). We show that this new data structure im-proves the SCFG by taking into account the context in which processes are called and, thus, makes the slicing process more precise...|$|R

25|$|An {{emoticon}} or smiley is {{a symbol}} or combination of symbols used to convey emotional content in written or message form. Forums implement a system through which some of the text representations of an emoticons (e.g. xD, :p) are rendered as a small image. Depending on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world the forum's topic originates (since most forums are international) smilies can be replaced by other forms of similar graphics, an example would be kaoani (e.g. *(^O^)*, (^-^)b), or even text between special symbols (e.g. :blink:, :idea:).|$|E
25|$|DNA-environment {{interactions}} {{are important in}} the development of personality because this relationship determines <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DNA code is actually made into proteins that will become part of an individual. It has been noted that while different choices are made available by the genome, in the end, the environment is the ultimate determinant of what becomes activated. Small changes in DNA in individuals are what lead to the uniqueness of every person as well as differences in looks, abilities, brain functioning, and all the factors that culminate to develop a cohesive personality.|$|E
25|$|Simple API for XML (SAX) is a lexical, {{event-driven}} API {{in which}} a document is read serially and its contents are reported as callbacks to various methods on a handler object of the user's design. SAX is fast and efficient to implement, but difficult to use for extracting information at random from the XML, since it tends to burden the application author with keeping track of <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> document is being processed. It is better suited to situations in which certain types of information are always handled the same way, {{no matter where they}} occur in the document.|$|E

25|$|The art is {{commonly}} found in rock shelters (protected by a natural ledge) and shallow caves in which sunlight can penetrate easily. There is no clear preference as to <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rock shelter is used for art, it can be placed high or half-way up the walls. The sites were not used for habitation, and lack the organic remains of hearths and rubbish deposits which would help dating. Many sites are heavily decorated with figures superimposed, while other apparently suitable locations nearby have no images at all. The sites are often in ravines in steep valleys that would be relatively little use to farmers, but perhaps ideal for hunting by ambush and stampeding animals into a dead end.|$|E
25|$|If a nazirite fails in {{fulfilling}} {{these three}} obligations {{there may be}} consequences. All {{or part of the}} person's time as a nazirite may need to be repeated. Furthermore, the person may be obligated to bring sacrifices. Whether a nazirite has to repeat time as a nazirite depends on <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nazirite vow was transgressed. A nazirite who becomes defiled by a corpse is obligated to start the entire nazirite period over again. In the Mishna, Queen Helena vowed to be a nazirite for seven years, but became defiled near the end of each of two of her first nazirite periods, forcing her to twice start over. She was a nazirite for a total of 21 years. Nazirites who shave their hair are obligated to redo the last 30 days of the nazirite period. However, if the nazirite drinks wine, the nazirite period continues as normal.|$|E
25|$|Two dice {{are usually}} used to decide <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall to start dealing from. They are {{standard}} six sided dice. The dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places {{to the side}} to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto) or a dice with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can {{be placed in a}} hollow square (the dealer holds onto it. There are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries.

500|$|A broad issue {{affecting}} the neutrality of science concerns the areas which science chooses to explore, that is, <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world and man is studied by science. Philip Kitcher in his [...] "Science, Truth, and Democracy" [...] argues that scientific studies {{that attempt to}} show one {{segment of the population}} as being less intelligent, successful or emotionally backward compared to others have a political feedback effect which further excludes such groups from access to science. Thus such studies undermine the broad consensus required for good science by excluding certain people, and so proving themselves in the end to be unscientific.|$|E
500|$|As {{had also}} {{been the case with}} his predecessors, the rank of {{adjutant}} was seen by Joaquim Inácio as an embarrassment. Inside the armada administration, it denoted the most important office, as it was filled by an officer who acted as the navy minister's direct representative in the armada. Even so, the title of [...] "adjutant" [...] was itself perceived as demeaning. Joaquim Inácio later complained: [...] "In <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world... does the navy minister have a general officer as an adjutant? What is an adjutant, other than a young officer who transmits orders, and even messages, he receives from his chief?" [...] He concluded: [...] "Thus the title of adjutant cannot encumber an officer who supervises the armada's discipline and answers for it." [...] His request to have the designation for the position changed to a more appropriate title was ignored. He also felt slighted that many of his proposals to the navy boards regarding improvements were not acted on, and on 21 November 1860, he asked to be removed from all positions.|$|E
500|$|Finally, {{the film}} {{illustrates}} the growing urban–rural divide in China. When Wei reaches Zhangjiakou, the film creates a clear contrast between {{urban and rural}} life, and the two locations are physically separated by a dark tunnel. The city is not portrayed as idyllic; rather, Zhang shows that rural people are faced with difficulties and discrimination in the cities. While Wei's first {{view of the city}} exposes her to well-dressed people and modern buildings, the living quarters she goes to while searching for Zhang Huike are cramped and squalid. Likewise, the iron gate where Wei waits all day for the TV station director reflects the barriers poor people face to survival in the city, and the necessity of connections to avoid becoming an [...] "outsider" [...] in the city. Frequent cuts show Wei and Zhang wandering aimlessly in the streets, Zhang begging for food, and Wei sleeping on the sidewalk; when an enthusiastic TV host later asks Zhang <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city left the biggest impression, Zhang replies that the one thing he will never forget is having to beg for food.

2500|$|The {{senior editor}} of this book and {{accompanying}} website on ExpertConsult [...] is Professor Susan Standring, who is Emeritus Professor of Anatomy at King's College London. The three most recent editions differ from all previous editions in an important respect: they present anatomical structures by their regional anatomy (i.e. ordered according to <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body the structures are located in – e.g. the anatomy of the bones, blood vessels and nerves, etc. of the upper extremity is described in one place). All previous editions of Gray's Anatomy were organised by systemic anatomy (i.e. there were separate sections for the body's entire skeletal system, entire circulatory system and entire nervous system, etc.). The editors of the 39th edition acknowledged the validity of both approaches but switched to regional anatomy by popular demand.|$|E

2500|$|He {{then turns}} {{to the subject of}} morality, {{maintaining}} that we do not need religion to be good.

He asks, [...] "would you commit murder, rape or robbery if you knew that no God existed?" [...] He argues that very few people would answer [...] "yes", undermining the claim that religion is needed to make us behave morally. In support of this view, he surveys the history of morality, arguing that there is a moral Zeitgeist that continually evolves in society, generally progressing toward liberalism. As it progresses, this moral consensus influences how religious leaders interpret their holy writings. Thus, Dawkins states, morality does not originate from the Bible, rather our moral progress informs <b>what</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bible Christians accept and what they now dismiss.|$|E
