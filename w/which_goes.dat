5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection‚Äîthe tuberoinfundibular pathway <b>which</b> <b>goes</b> to the pituitary gland, where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary gland. Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the pituitary gland. The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E
