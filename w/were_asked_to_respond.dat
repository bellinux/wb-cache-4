50|$|Prior to Swinney’s {{introduction}} of this methodology, studies of lexical access were largely procured by offline measures, {{such as a}} phoneme-monitoring task. In these measures, study participants <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to a syntactic or lexical ambiguity in a sentence only after the entire sentence had been comprehended. Since Swinney considered the system of resolving ambiguities to be an autonomous, fast and mandatory process, he suggested that the “downstream,” temporal delay between stimulus and response could contaminate results. The CMPT, therefore, was created to probe lexical access in real time.|$|E

[...] McDonnell said that the scene was helpful for promoting dialogue and contrasted it with how violence against women is portrayed elsewhere in media. Douglas insisted that the scene was not sensationalistic but rather was an attempt to honestly portray the human condition.|$|E
50|$|Of two prototypes started, {{only one}} was completed, flying on 17 October 1940, {{the first flight}} was delayed due to {{problems}} with the Niagara V engines which had a vibration problem.

Airspeed <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to a proposal to re-engine the aircraft with two Armstrong Whitworth Cheetah XI radial engines and add rear-facing machine guns.

The competing G.A.L.38 flew {{for a few months}} before it was cancelled and scrapped in March 1942. The requirement for such aircraft had been made obsolete due to the introduction of radar on long-range patrol aircraft such as the Liberator I.|$|E

5000|$|A {{commission}} for the Year of Natural Scotland and Cape Farewell, {{a series of}} artists <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the peatland landscape of the Isle of Lewis, celebrating the role which the blanket bog moorland plays towards global climate regulation. Boyd spent several weeks working on and in the landscape, staying in Shielings {{at the heart of}} the moorland while recording archaeological finds, and learning about life on the moor from artist and resident Anne Campbell. The resultant series of work Stacashal was exhibited throughout Scotland in 2013, most notably at the Royal Botanics in Edinburgh, and was made using the photogravure process, a tribute to the work of James Craig Annan one of Boyd's formative influences. Using compass bearings, Boyd shows the moorland from the peak of Stacashal, a remote hill in the centre of the island, a response to the work of Thomas Joshua Cooper who documented the extremities of the island. [...] A second body of work called The Isle of Rust (An t-Eilean Ruadh) was also exhibited, utilising rust from abandoned moorland machinery to produce images of Lewis using the collodion process.|$|E

[...] Having found a {{trove of}} discarded, unmarked bank envelopes in a dumpster, Jacob stamped them with the words [...] "Life," [...] "Time," [...] "Death," [...] and [...] "Hunger," [...] wrapped each group of four with a paper band, and asked recipients to transform and return the envelopes to him. [...] "Words," [...] Jacob wrote in the invitation to participate, [...] "are the translation of ideas, made specific and personal by the specific persons who use them." [...] Recipients <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to the words [...] "in any manner, using the generic form (the small envelopes) as the point of origination." [...] Rather grandiloquently, in the documentation Jacob declared [...] "Consider this 'Catalogue of Ideas,'... as Lascaux condensed." [...] Eighty-five artists from twenty-six nations returned envelopes to Jacob, a selection of which were reproduced in the periodical along with {{a complete list of}} participants enclosed in a bank envelope marked [...] "Artists."

50|$|C) Papafragou, Cassidy, Gleitman (2007) —Participants {{were asked}} to {{identify}} verbs {{within the context of a}} video. Papafragou et al had children watch 12 videotaped stories. 4 stories about the subject's desires and 8 stories that varied in the subject's beliefs and the framing of a novel verb. At the end of the tape, they would hear a sentence describing the scene but the sentence's verb was replaced with a novel word. Children <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> with what they thought the word meant. Their responses were categorized 4 ways: Action, Belief, Desire, and Other. They found that action words were easily interpreted by children. However, false belief scenes with the complementizer phrase caused for children to respond with belief words more often. Results showed that participants in the experiment identified the verb most accurately when they could use both the video and sentence contexts. When it comes to attitude verbs, children are sensitive to the syntactic framing of the verb in question.D) Wellwood, Gagliardi, and Lidz (2016) —Showed that four-year-olds can understand the difference between a quantitative or qualitative word, based on its syntactic position within a sentence. In “Gleebest of the cows are by the barn,” the novel word “gleebest” is in a determiner position, and is inferred to mean “most” or “many.” In “the gleebest cows are by the barn,” “gleebest” is in an adjective position, and children infer it to mean “spotty” or another quality. These results are significant because they show children using syntax to understand word meanings.|$|E

5000|$|Modeling {{after the}} National Issues Forums, Citizen Voices was a Philadelphian newspaper's [...] "attempt to engage" [...] across the diverse city during a 1999 mayoral race between a white Republican against a black Democrat. After noticing skewed {{responses}} from more educated and affluent white readers in this racially divided city, Citizen Voices aimed {{to encourage more}} public involvement from lower class minorities by creating a citizens’ issues-oriented mayoral campaign. To invite participants from all backgrounds, Citizen Voices invented [...] "The Oprah Show" [...] as a comedic parody of the [...] "The Oprah Winfrey Show" [...] {{as a way to}} get citizens to think about problems and solutions within their city. The second phase of the project included a National Issues Forum-style discussion where citizens deliberated on position papers that the mayoral candidates submitted and drafted five issues with their questions for the mayoral debate including: education, jobs, neighborhoods, public safety, and reforming city hall. The issue of race was added to these five topics due to race relations complicating Philadelphia's effort to address its problems. [...] "Throughout the year, Citizen Voices remained a frequent presence on The Philadelphia Inquirer 's opinion pages." [...] Editorials on the campaign revolved around the issues that were picked by Citizens Voices and were even published on the commentary page in full-page layouts. Candidates <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to these questions on the issues that were drafted by citizens. As a result, it appeared that low-income participants were more willing and more confident to express their political views.|$|E

50|$|In practice, the GNAT appears {{similar to}} the Implicit Association Test in that {{participants}} <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> categorize targets representing either a concept (such as race; ex. white or black names) or words which have obvious positive or negative valence. Participants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> ('go') or decline <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> ('no-go') during a short interval after each of the stimuli are presented. In test trials, participants <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> one of the concepts (white or black) and words with either positive or negative valence; these are then switched so that the concept is then paired with the opposite valence category. When paired with words with positive valence, faster and more accurate responding indicates greater association, and therefore positive attitude towards the target concept (either white or black race). A full demonstration of the GNAT procedure {{can be found in}} the external links below.|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} employing {{two groups}} of bilinguals, Korean-English and Spanish-English, and two modalities of presentation, visual and auditory, were performed. Split-language sentences were presented to the bilingual subjects. The point in the sentence at which the language changed was varied.

Another group <b>was</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> sentences in which the language change occurred within one of the constituents. Longer response times resulted from the sentences in which the language change occurred within a constituent. Ladefoged and Broadbent (1960) presented evidence that the unit of speech per-ception must be longer than a single speech sound. Fodor and Bever (1965) suggested that the unit of speech perception corresponded to the constituent.
