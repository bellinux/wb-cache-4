5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß enables them to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, <b>warning</b> <b>that,</b> “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1973, {{there was}} serious debate among the Hanoi {{leadership}} over future military policy as the Central Committee of the Lao Động Party convened to assess the progress of its efforts in the south. General Văn Tiến Dũng, PAVN chief of staff, and Defence Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp strongly urged the resumption of conventional military operations, <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> increasing passivity would affect {{the morale of the}} army. Premier Phạm Văn Đồng, however, feared resuming operations would drain vital resources needed for reconstruction in the north.|$|E
5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It is thus often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E

5|$|Duckles {{observes that}} by 1651, the {{transition}} from the lute song to the continuo song was complete. Printed versions of songs can not be entirely trusted to represent what was sung, since, in order to keep engraving costs manageable, they would economize on written vocal embellishments. That's why manuscript sources are crucial to our understanding of transition to Baroque vocal styles. Duckles concludes by <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> those who study early 17th century lyric poetry must do so in conjunction with their intended musical settings, since words and music are inseparable.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on the subject at the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the extent to which}} predicted responses to ANSI Z 535 -style warning signs and labels correspond to actual responses. In previous studies, lay people's impressions of the influence of warning attributes have not been found to accurately predict actual responses to warnings or to reflect the effects obtained in behavioral studies for different warning conditions. However, these studies have not specifi-cally focused on the connection between predicted and actual responses to <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> vary according to conformance with an ANSI standard for product warnings. Four warning scenarios were employed in the present study, with warnings varying according to the extent of ANSI-conformance. Participants consis-tently and incorrectly predicted that people {{would be more likely to}} notice and/or comply with <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> were more consistent with ANSI as opposed to those <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> were less-consistent with ANSI. Collectively, people's perception of differences in response to warnings was not consistent with what has been reported in observational studies...|$|R

Some historians have called these stories improbable.|$|E

In a bar, she relapses. Jenny and Dave drive her home, where she starts an altercation with Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> injury is occurring.|$|E

When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E

5|$|The ANC {{threatened}} to withdraw support for South Africa's next test match against Australia, {{which could have}} led to the cancellation the match due to safety concerns and Australia stated they would not play if the match didn't have ANC support. However, the future South African sports minister Steve Tshwete asked for the ANC to give the supporters another chance and the ANC did not withdraw their support. Instead they issued a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> if it happened again they would oppose all future tours and the 1995 Rugby World Cup.|$|E
