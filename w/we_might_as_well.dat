I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> recognize this.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} prepare for his {{entrance}} into Edinburgh University where he was to study modern languages, Marjoribanks spent 1927–28 in Paris and at the Convitto Maschile Valdese in Torre Pellice, Italy where he became fluent in Italian. This was to prove useful to him later. He graduated from Edinburgh University with a first class honours Master of Arts (Scotland) in 1932 and then studied German further in Bonn and Tübingen, Germany. He stayed for four months with a German newspaper proprietor’s family which coincided with the accession to power of Adolf Hitler in January 1933. Marjoribanks noted that the general attitude was “We’ve tried everything else, so <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> try Adolf. If he’s no good we’ll get rid of him.” But, he also noted, it wasn’t as easy as that. After the war, Marjoribanks discovered that a bomb had destroyed {{both the house and}} the parents. Two of the three sons had died on the Eastern Front.|$|E

Lanford Beard of Middlebury College Student Weekly, in review of the video, wrote that Timberlake's [...] "Mexicali saloon setting" [...] for the video [...] "embraced a certain macho, trashy playa aesthetic" [...] for him [...] "so we'll take {{it on the chin}} that this is the image he's {{building}} for himself and [...] love it or hate it [...] <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get used to it."

When shooting the music video, Jeremy Davis stated [...] "I've realized you can't really consider it making a music video unless you get hurt, because every video, we end up in pain ... It's awesome to do our own stunts; <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be Jackie Chan." [...] Taylor York adds [...] "A {{lot of people would}} hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love, but what was so appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ... He had so many ideas, and it definitely jumped out at us." ...|$|E

In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser, Loughnan outlined the band's future: [...] "If Beyond doesn't make it {{for us in the}} States <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> forget all about Ayers Rock." [...] From May to July they toured the US again, [...] "only achiev limited success overseas." [...] After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left, and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study. Brown, Doyle, and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members.|$|E
500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get a use out of it.' ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{tone and}} death scenes were {{positively}} received by critics. Writing for ReelViews, James Berardinelli described Final Destination 3 as incorporating more humor {{in comparison to}} its predecessors, and felt that it worked to the film's benefit. The Seattle Times agreed that the humorous tone helped to elevate the film, and believed fans of the franchise would enjoy the death sequences. Sarah Dobbs of Den of Geek!, a publication of Dennis Publishing, attributed the tone as what made Final Destination 3 {{the high point of}} the franchise. Dobbs commended the film's style as a [...] "brightly coloured [...] slightly silly meditation on how we're all gonna die one day, so <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> do it explosively". The tanning bed and nail guns scenes were singled out as the best death sequences from the film and the franchise as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. David Hinkley of The New York Daily News {{rated the}} pilot {{three out of}} five stars, stating [...] "The story and the {{chemistry}} work, but periodically the action feels rushed, as if {{we all know the}} drill and <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get it over with. Future episodes may correct that, because they'll need less setup work." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety stated [...] "On paper, [...] "Hawaii Five-0" [...] appears destined for can't-miss success, offering a pre-sold name, an attractive cast and a stunning location," [...] but felt the millions spent on the pilot [...] "doesn't necessarily indicate smooth sailing, relying as it does on playful banter (more like frat-boy hazing) between the leads that grows tiresome even before the hour's over." [...] Ellen Gray of the Philadelphia Daily News felt it was [...] "a huge let down," [...] and was critical of the cast's performance, in particular O'Loughlin and Caan.|$|E

He was also the highest money-earning horse and only the fourth two-year-old to be named World Champion. During his first year of racing, he started 26times, won22 and placed (came in second) in another three. Most two-year-old Quarter Horses race on average under five times in their first year of racing, and the average for all ages is just over five starts per year. Many people criticized Merrick for {{starting}} Easy Jet so often. Merrick said, however, [...] "You had to run him about once every ten days or he'd have got so high you couldn't hardly stand to be around him. As long as we were going to run him, we figured <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make it count for something." [...] Despite all of the starts, Easy Jet had enough energy to be difficult to handle; in this respect, he was considered high-spirited rather than mean.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{reception}} {{has been}} very favorable. Trans-Europe Express has the highest possible ratings from publications including AllMusic, Drowned in Sound, Mojo, Rolling Stone and Slant Magazine. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that the album [...] "is often cited as perhaps the archetypal (and most accessible) Kraftwerk album ... Overall, Trans-Europe Express offers the best blend of minimalism, mechanized rhythms, and crafted, catchy melodies in the group's catalog". Q, in a 1995 review, wrote that the album [...] "changed the face of American dance music" [...] {{and that it was}} one of the most compelling beats of this or any other era". In 2009, Drowned in Sounds Chris Power stated that [...] "Trans-Europe Express is all at once antique, timeless, retro and contemporary. Its status as modern electronic music's birth certificate is well-earned, but its hallowed reputation should never be allowed to disguise its true value and power as a work of art. Nor should it obscure a longevity that, 32 years on, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> start calling by its real name: immortality".|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just going to wear the jumpsuits...we figured <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E
500|$|The many {{historical}} {{meanings of}} the emblem, while provide a solid ground for its power as the national emblem of Iran, have also provided the rich ground for competing symbols of Iranian identity. One important campaign to abolish the emblem was initiated by Mojtaba Minuvi in 1929. In a report prepared {{at the request of}} the Iranian embassy in London, he insisted that the lion and sun is Turkic in origin. He recommended that the government replaces it with Derafsh-e-Kaviani: [...] "One cannot attributed a national historical story to the lion-and-sun emblem, for it has no connection to ancient pre-Islamic history, there is no evidence that Iranians designed or created it.... <b>We</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> get rid of this remnant of the Turkish people and adopt the flag that symbolizes our mythical grandeur, that is Derafsh-e-Kaviani". His suggestion was ignored. The symbol was challenged during World War I, while Hasan Taqizadeh was publishing the Derafsh-e-Kaviani newspaper in Berlin. In his newspaper, he argued that the lion and sun is neither Iranian in origin nor very ancient as people assume. He insisted that the lion and sun should be replaced by the more Iranian symbol of Derafsh-e-Kaviani.|$|E

The reception was very poor, but the Northwest captain made out the sentence: [...] "As {{long as we have}} to land, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> land here." [...] Weather near Elmendorf at the time was very bad with heavy clouds. The C-124 was flying without visual references, using just altitude, a radio beacon and a stopwatch.
