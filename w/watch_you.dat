25|$|In 1998, Death By Stereo {{was signed}} to Indecision Records, and {{released}} their first album-If Looks Could Kill, I'd <b>Watch</b> <b>You</b> Die- {{in the following}} year. Shortly after Jarrod moved to Boston to pursue music full-time at the Berklee School Of Music, {{and was replaced by}} Tim Bender. Keith also left the band, to pursue his other bands Throwdown and Eighteen Visions. He was replaced by Dan Palmer, formerly of the band Eyelid. They toured {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{lineup of}} The Fall of Troy reunited for three nights in December 2013 in Austin, Texas. Each night, the band performed {{one of their}} first three albums (The Fall of Troy, Doppelgänger and Manipulator) in their entirety. During the VIP reunion show, the band announced they would continue making music in 2014 by releasing an album free of charge. In December 2014, Thomas Erak announced that he left Chiodos to focus on The Fall of Troy's new album and his family. The Fall of Troy went on a 10th anniversary U.S. tour of their second album Doppelgänger in September and November 2015 with And So I <b>Watch</b> <b>You</b> from Afar and Kylesa as direct support for each respective leg.|$|E

500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I <b>watch</b> <b>you</b> perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must <b>watch,</b> <b>you</b> must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E

2500|$|Death By Stereo's music blurs {{the lines}} between traditional, punk rock, hardcore, and metal. Their music mixes metal riffs, solos, melodies and hooks, and results in a sound that is noted for its originality, among a punk rock scene that some say has become {{stagnant}} in recent years. [...] The music has evolved over time, mainly due to the unstable lineup, which has included 5 guitarists, 2 bassists, and 4 drummers. [...] Their first album, If Looks Could Kill, I'd <b>Watch</b> <b>You</b> Die, was punk rock with a heavy influence of hardcore. Their later albums, especially Death for Life, are more heavy metal, with less punk rock and hardcore elements.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "We're gonna {{ride to the}} Abbey of Thelema" [...] in {{the song}} [...] "Misery Machine" [...] is a {{reference}} to Aleister Crowley's Abbey of Thelema, which {{was used as the}} Headquarters from which the doctrines of Thelema would be spread throughout the world.

Doesn't she ever <b>watch</b> <b>you!?</b> Tell her this isn't some Communist daycare center! Tell your mother I hate her! Tell your mother I hate you!" [...] is spoken by Stole from the Waters film Desperate Living. After this, a telephone can be heard ringing very quietly for several minutes, which is then followed by an irate answering machine message, presumably from a mother of a Manson fan.|$|E

There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?...

[...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X.
