He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, {{rather than as a}} possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped {{in the middle of his}} dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, [...] "I've blown up. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> from here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E

[...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E

[...] Kot went on to state that a [...] "funeral organ" [...] hovers over the song, and [...] "the narrator longs for a second chance: [...] "'So <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> from here/With all of this fear in your eyes?'" [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that both [...] "Crawl" [...] and another song from Graffiti, [...] "So Cold", come off as [...] "thoughtful, even if they're not quite mea culpas" [...] and further suggested that [...] "In these moments Mr. Brown is pining, mildly apologetic." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "genuinely affecting second single", and stated that [...] "Less forgiving listeners" [...] looking for [...] "signs of contrition" [...] may find them on the track. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that, of the six tracks on the album's deluxe edition that could be interpreted as dealing with Brown's relationship with Rihanna directly, [...] "Crawl" [...] is [...] "by far the most catchily contrite." [...] Rap-Up said that the song shows Brown [...] "taking baby steps back to love and into the spotlight," [...] and said that it found Brown [...] "longing to mend a broken relationship" [...] as in his 2008 Jordin Sparks collaboration, “No Air”.|$|E

And how a great tall Indian a-horse-back can carry his war-bonnet at a canter through thick timber without {{brushing}} a feather beats me! My silly head was banged often enough by low branches, but they slipped through like running elk. We had evening hymn-singing every night after they'd blown their pipe-smoke to the quarters of heaven. <b>Where</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>go?</b> I'll tell you, but don't blame me if you're no wiser. We took the old war-trail {{from the end of}} the Lake along the East Susquehanna through the Nantego country, right down to Fort Shamokin on the Senachse river. We crossed the Juniata by Fort Granville, got into Shippensberg over the hills by the Ochwick trail, and then to Williams Ferry (it's a bad one). From Williams Ferry, across the Shanedore, over the Blue Mountains, through Ashby's Gap, and so south-east by south from there, till we found the President at the back of his own plantations. I'd hate to be trailed by Indians in earnest. They caught him like a partridge on a stump. After we'd left our ponies, we scouted forward through a woody piece, and, creeping slower and slower, at last if my moccasins even slipped Red Jacket 'ud turn and frown. I heard voices--Monsieur Genet's for choice--long before I saw anything, and we pulled up at the edge of a clearing where some niggers in grey-and-red liveries were holding horses, and half-a-dozen gentlemen--but one was Genet--were talking among felled timber. I fancy they'd come to see Genet a piece on his road, for his portmantle was with him. I hid in between two logs as near to the company as I be to that old windlass there. I didn't need anybody to show me Big Hand. He stood up, very still, his legs a little apart, listening to Genet, that French Ambassador, which never had more manners than a Bosham tinker. Genet was as good as ordering him to declare war on England at once. I had heard that clack before on the Embuscade. He said he'd stir up the whole United States to have war with England, whether Big Hand liked it or not.|$|R

The three questions addressed by a comprehensive roadmap are: <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> want to <b>go?,</b> <b>Where</b> are <b>we</b> now?, and How can we get there? The review identified 13 roadmaps/plans that have been produced by: peak industry bodies (Australian Institute of Refrigeration Air Conditioning and Heating); academic research groups (e. g. Sustainable Built Environment National Research Centre, Institute for Sustainable Futures); private consultancies; and non-profit research groups. Some were funded by peak bodies (e. g. Australian Sustainable Built Environment Council) or by state and federal government departments. The identified roadmaps indicate the increasing attention on low carbon transitions and important gaps and areas of divergence in existing analysis. The critical review draws on relevant theories of roadmapping, innovation management, sustainable urban development and governance...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Mwanza Urban Water and Sewerage Authority (MWAUWASA) has been encountering {{a lot of}} challenges, which {{includes}} inter alia, the still high UfW, great outstanding balances by debtors, high power costs, underdeveloped management system and low sewerage network coverage. This lead {{to the need to}} improve utility management and thus the urge of the organisation to participate in the Water Utility Management & UfW project. One of the issues addressed is the developing of Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) to guide the organisation in its performance including reduction in UfW. This required the organisation to address the four key questions: where are <b>we</b> now, how <b>did</b> <b>we</b> get here, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> want to <b>go,</b> how might <b>we</b> get there, and how <b>do</b> <b>we</b> ensure success.
