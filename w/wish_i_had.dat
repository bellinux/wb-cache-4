500|$|Thief was {{the first}} 3D stealth game for a {{personal}} computer, and its stealth gameplay innovations influenced later games in the genre. The game has been cited as {{the first to use}} light and shadow as a stealth mechanic, and the first to use audio cues, such as the ability to eavesdrop on conversations and alert guards with loud footsteps. The game's use of sound wave propagation, which allowed sounds to travel around corners and through rooms, became widely considered by game developers. Thiefs influence has been recognized in other stealth games, such as Assassin's Creed, Hitman, Splinter Cell, and Tenchu. Marc Laidlaw, writer and designer on Half-Life, said that [...] "Thief is the single most terrifying, immersive, and rewarding game I have played and the one single-player game I continue to replay. [...] There are countless books I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> written; Thief {{is one of the few}} games I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> worked on." [...] Laidlaw called Thief his favorite game, an opinion shared by Fallout 3 lead designer Emil Pagliarulo.|$|E

He invented unflattering nicknames; he wrote later, [...] "I did not (though I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had)</b> think of calling Sir Hartley Shawcross Sir Shortly Floorcross, but I did call Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller Sir Reginald Bullying-Manner". When the latter was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dilhorne, Levin renamed him Lord Stillborn.|$|E
500|$|Morris {{took only}} two wickets in Tests, {{one of them}} Bedser in 1953; he was rarely used as a bowler and was a {{reliable}} catcher. Despite his success, he was a pessimist {{who claimed to be}} low on self-confidence, saying that he was always surprised not to be dismissed for a duck. In an interview in 2000, he said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the confidence of some of the players today." [...] After reaching Test cricket, Morris began smoking to relieve tension ahead of an innings.|$|E

In 1973, however, Yorkshire failed to win any of the 8 championship games with Boycott in charge, and Wisden called the season [...] "disturbingly unsuccessful". [...] It led to further calls for Boycott to be stripped of the captaincy. He was also coming into increased conflict with Richard Hutton, Close, and {{several members of the}} committee and senior players.

500|$|Newman, a {{professional}} artist from Minneapolis, {{responded to the}} curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure {{how to use a}} canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store.

500|$|Alice's {{death was}} felt in both Britain and Hesse. The Times wrote: [...] "The humblest of people {{felt that they}} had the kinship of nature with a Princess who was the model of family virtue as a daughter, a sister, a wife and a mother...Her {{abundant}} sympathies sought for objects of help in the great unknown waste of human distress". The Illustrated London News wrote that the [...] "lesson of the late Princess's life is as noble as it is obvious. Moral worth is far more important than high position". The death was also heavily felt by the royal family, especially by Alice's brother and sister-in-law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Princess of Wales, upon meeting the Queen after Alice's death, exclaimed [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> died instead of her". The Prince, meanwhile, wrote to the Earl of Granville that Alice [...] "was my favourite sister. So good, so kind, so clever! We had gone through so much together..." ...|$|E
500|$|Jack, {{believing that}} Don Geiss {{will give him}} the CEO job, and after {{learning}} about Liz's high school reunion, says [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a Princeton reunion right now.

At the reunion, Rob Sussman, a past classmate of Liz's, complains that Liz said he was gayer than the volleyball scene in the 1986 action film Top Gun. During the reunion, Liz's former classmates play Seven minutes in heaven, {{a game in which}} two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and do whatever they like for seven minutes, often kissing. Later, Liz's classmates plan to [...] "Carrie" [...] her on stage as revenge for her being mean to them, but is stopped by Jack saying [...] "we cannot Carrie Liz Lemon". This is a reference to the 1976 horror film Carrie in which the title character is drenched with pig's blood.|$|E

500|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West {{gave the}} book a {{favourable}} review, writing [...] "Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects {{all aspects of}} public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid—but never mind, since what matters is not actually doing anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'". [...] The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, [...] "Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is tucked away in an endnote about tattoos: 'I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'. If only someone had awarded him that space". The book was also {{the subject of a}} spoof review by John Crace in The Guardian, which satirised the book and its author.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Myles McNutt from The A.V.

[...] However, McNutt appreciated Jim's presentation, noting that [...] "the final presentation was a pretty decent setpiece." [...] What Culture! reviewer Joseph Kratzer awarded the episode three out of five stars, noting that the episode fell victim to [...] "the overall lack of focus and believability that has plagued The Office all season." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave gave the episode a review of seven out of ten, noting that [...] "The Office continues to get the comedy boost it needs from the Florida storyline." [...] Hyatt called the scene featuring Dwight and Jim imitating Kelly and Ryan's mom as [...] "one of my favorite moments of the season so far." [...] Despite this, he did call the episode [...] "uneven," [...] noting that the Scranton story-line was [...] "ho-hum." [...] Dan Forcella from TV Fanatic awarded the episode {{four out of five}} stars and praised Jim's presentation, writing, [...] "Between Jim's outfit and makeup, the fact that he embraced the presentation throughout, and all of the Chuck references, I was speechless {{by the end of that}} thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Members of Ferraro's {{family were}} indeed facing legal issues. Her husband John Zaccaro had {{pleaded guilty in}} , to fraudulently obtaining bank {{financing}} in a real estate transaction and had been sentenced to 150hours of community service. Then in , he was indicted on unrelated felony charges regarding an alleged 1981 bribery of Queens Borough President Donald Manes concerning a cable television contract. A full year later, he was acquitted at trial. The case against him was circumstantial, a key prosecution witness proved unreliable, and the defense {{did not have to}} present its own testimony. Ferraro said her husband never would have been charged had she not run for vice president. Meanwhile, in , the couple's son John had been arrested for possession and sale of cocaine. He was convicted, and in , sentenced to four months imprisonment; Ferraro broke down in tears in court relating the stress the episode had placed on her family. Ferraro worked on an unpublished book about the conflicting rights between a free press and being able to have fair trials. Asked in , whether she would have accepted the vice-presidential nomination had she known of all the family problems that would follow, she said, [...] "More than once I have sat down and said to myself, oh, God, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never gone through with it...

500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't go back to that person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E
500|$|Wright was {{prompted}} {{to publish the}} book after two incidents of his text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without attribution. He had allowed his table of meridional parts {{to be published by}} Thomas Blundeville in his Exercises (1594) and in William Barlow's The Navigator's Supply (1597), although only Blundeville acknowledged Wright by name. However, an experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he took on Sir Francis Drake's 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In 1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his work. Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short time after promising not to publish its contents without his permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations without acknowledging him for several regional maps and in his world map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Christian Knight Map" [...] for its engraving of a Christian knight battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit and greed in the preface to Certaine Errors. He wryly commented: [...] "But the way how this [...] should be done, I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els. And in that point I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> beene as wise as he in keeping it more charily to myself".|$|E
500|$|In 1958 he {{was second}} {{in the league in}} both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was {{followed}} by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce's first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, [...] "Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed 'em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won." [...] At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year's pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, [...] "I'm a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox." [...] In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, [...] "The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn't feel that badly about it, really. It didn't mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got it. It would have been nice." [...] His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.|$|E
