5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive <b>wave</b> <b>machine</b> (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E

25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his <b>wave</b> <b>machine)</b> at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
500|$|John Northrup Shive (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. [...] In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's point contact transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive <b>wave</b> <b>machine</b> in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E

40|$|Against the {{backdrop}} of increasing energy demands, the threat of climate change and dwindling fuel reserves, finding reliable, diverse, sustainable/renewable, affordable energy resources has become a priority for many countries. Marine energy conversion systems are {{at the forefront of}} providing such a resource. Most marine renewable energy conversion systems require tribological components to covert wind or tidal streams to rotational motion for generating electricity while <b>wave</b> <b>machines</b> typically use oscillating hinge or piston within cylinder geometries to promote reciprocating linear motion. This paper looks at the tribology of three green marine energy systems, offshore wind, tidal and <b>wave</b> <b>machines.</b> Areas covered include lubrication and contamination, bearing and gearbox issues, biofouling, cavitation erosion, tribocorrosion, condition monitoring as well as design trends and loading conditions associated with tribological components.

In this work, a detail computational model for {{unsteady flow}} analysis of real natural gases is established. The real effect on unsteady behaviors of natural gases in shock tubes have been studied extensively. Results show that the non-classical flow of the gases will not exist. The discipline of reflection and refraction of various gas waves or discontinuities remain unchanged for natural gases. Attention should be paid only to the deviations between perfect gas model and real gas model for gasdynamic waves...|$|R
