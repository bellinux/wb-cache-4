5|$|Bulgarian {{historian}} Hristo Matanov conjectures {{that after}} 1355, John may have minted his own coinage intended for trade with partners outside the inner Balkans. He bases this theory {{on a new}} reading of several Latin-language coin inscriptions as Monita despoti Ioanni instead of Monita despoti Oliveri, as previously thought. The new reading, which <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> the coins as being minted by John, was proposed by Yugoslav numismatist Nedeljković, who rejects the initial attribution of these coins to Jovan Oliver.|$|E
5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, sometimes the data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria Dock at midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E

5|$|Grossman and Schafer brainstormed {{regularly}} to devise the time travel puzzles, and collaborated {{with members of}} the development team as well as other LucasArts employees. They <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> puzzle problems and work towards a solution similar to how the game plays. Most issues were addressed prior to programming, but some details were left unfinished to work on later. The staff conceived puzzles involving the U.S.'s early history based on their memory of their compulsory education, and using the more legendary aspects of history, such as George Washington cutting down a cherry tree to appeal to international audiences. To complete the elements, Grossman researched the period to maintain historical accuracy, visiting libraries and contacting reference librarians. The studio, however, took creative license towards facts to fit them into the game's design.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of director Sir Ridley Scott {{is the theme}} of artificial intelligence present in his science fiction films. Scott's earliest foray into the philosophy of artificial intelligence was with the android character Ash, in the original Alien film released in 1979. Ian Holm portrayed Ash as a character who may uncannily assume a human form, yet he maintains a sense of superiority that is only humbled {{by the nature of the}} Alien, which runs counter to the very future of the human race. In the book The Culture and Philosophy of Ridley Scott, the authors- Adam Barkman, Ashley Barkman and Nancy Kang- reason that though Ash is designed to appear human, his innards are bio-mechanical and he himself does not presume to be a sentient being with a semblance of life, but an artificial construct whose personality is dictated by machinery. Every subsequent installment in the Alien film series directed by Scott features at least one synthetic (android) character designated to maintain order aboard their respective space ship. In 2017, Scott explained that the synthetics featured in the Alien films he directed are designed to subvert their robotic nature and to impeccably mimic humans. The original form of androids introduced in Alien would contradict the observable nature of David in Prometheus; though both would serve the same corporate masters and have the same non-human innards, David <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> himself as a sentient entity who is capable of expressing - if not feeling - emotion.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, a poll {{conducted}} by the Taiwan Braintrust showed that about 90 {{percent of the population}} <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese if they were to choose between the two. Also, 31.2 percent of respondents said they support independence for Taiwan, while 56.2 percent would prefer {{to maintain the status quo}} and 7.9 percent support unification with China.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based {{and the other is}} pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
25|$|Keegan was {{the only}} son of Denis Francis Keegan, {{a member of the}} Indian Civil Service born in London (although both father and son <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> {{themselves}} as Irish).

25|$|According to Robert Giroux,"Even {{though the}} police decided, after severe questioning, that Peavey {{was not the}} murderer, the Hollywood {{correspondent}} of the New York Daily News, Florabel Muir, came to a private conclusion that Peavey was the murderer. In that era of ingenious women reporters, Muir thought she could engineer a scoop by tricking Peavey into a confession. She knew (from the movies) that blacks were deathly afraid of ghosts. With the help of two confederates, Frank Carson and Al Weinshank, she offered Peavey ten dollars if he <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> Taylor's grave in the Hollywood Park Cemetery (which she had already visited).|$|E
25|$|In the Pro League's early years, several clubs {{played their}} home matches on fields within their {{respective}} communities. In particular, Queen's Park Oval, constructed in 1896 and {{considered to be}} one of the most picturesque cricket venues in the West Indies, served as the home for Defence Force and San Juan Jabloteh, whereas W Connection and Police hosted league matches, respectively, at nearby Gilbert Park in Couva and San Fernando's Skinner Park. It was expected that supporters <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> with their respective community club and its players.

25|$|As morning dawned, Grant {{realized}} his assumptions about Lee's dispositions were wrong and that Hancock {{was facing a}} significant threat on his front. However, this opened a new opportunity. He guessed (incorrectly) that the troops facing Hancock had been withdrawn from Laurel Hill. He ordered Hancock to withdraw north of the Po, leaving a single division in place to occupy the Confederates in that sector, {{while the rest of}} his army was to attack at 5 p.m. across the entire Confederate line, which <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> and exploit any potential weak spot. Hancock left Francis C. Barlow's division in behind hasty earthworks along Shady Grove Church Road and withdrew the remainder of his men north of the Po.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from having}} {{exhibited}} {{the ability to}} learn complex tricks, dolphins have also demonstrated the ability to produce creative responses. This was studied by Karen Pryor during the mid-1960s at Sea Life Park in Hawaii, and was published as The Creative Porpoise: Training for Novel Behavior in 1969. The two test subjects were two rough-toothed dolphins (Steno bredanensis), named Malia (a regular show performer at Sea Life Park) and Hou (a research subject at adjacent Oceanic Institute). The experiment tested when and whether the dolphins <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> {{that they were being}} rewarded (with fish) for originality in behavior and was very successful. However, since only two dolphins were involved in the experiment, the study is difficult to generalize.|$|E
25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of this feature {{is that the}} computers which are actually performing the calculations might not be entirely trustworthy. The designers of the system must thus introduce measures to prevent malfunctions or malicious participants from producing false, misleading, or erroneous results, and from using the system as an attack vector. This often involves assigning work randomly to different nodes (presumably with different owners) and checking {{that at least two}} different nodes report the same answer for a given work unit. Discrepancies <b>would</b> <b>identify</b> malfunctioning and malicious nodes. However, {{due to the lack of}} central control over the hardware, there is no way to guarantee that nodes will not drop out of the network at random times. Some nodes (like laptops or dial-up Internet customers) may also be available for computation but not network communications for unpredictable periods. These variations can be accommodated by assigning large work units (thus reducing the need for continuous network connectivity) and reassigning work units when a given node fails to report its results in expected time.|$|E
