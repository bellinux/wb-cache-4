5|$|Hsu {{described}} the localization {{work as a}} balancing act, and said that continuity and consistency was very important. To avoid situations where a small detail in one game is changed in localization, and then comes back as a major point in a sequel, Hsu avoided changing things unless necessary, such as when something in the original would not be understood by the target audience. One thing the localization team had {{to keep in mind}} was keeping the writing in-character: when substituting a Japanese joke with an English one, they had to consider whether it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that the character would say, and not simply that it was funny. They also worked towards having puns and references be appropriate for the dialogue, so that the dialogue still makes sense to players who do not get the reference or pun.|$|E

25|$|Often, when {{counting}} objects, {{one does}} not {{keep track of what}} numerical label corresponds to which object: one only keeps track of the subgroup of objects which have already been labeled, so as to be able to identify unlabeled objects necessary for Step 2. However, if one is counting persons, then one can ask the persons who are being counted to each keep track of the number which the person's self has been assigned. After the count has finished it is possible to ask the group of persons to file up in a line, in order of increasing numerical label. What the persons would do during the process of lining up <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> like this: each pair of persons who are unsure of their positions in the line ask each other what their numbers are: the person whose number is smaller should stand on the left side and the one with the larger number {{on the right side of}} the other person. Thus, pairs of persons compare their numbers and their positions, and commute their positions as necessary, and through repetition of such conditional commutations they become ordered.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{arrived at}} the studio one day {{after a series of}} {{meetings}} began to select the musical pieces for The Concert Feature. Disney made story writers Joe Grant and Dick Huemer gather a preliminary selection of music and along with Stokowski, Taylor, and the heads of various departments, discussed their ideas. Each meeting was recorded verbatim by stenographers with participants being given a copy of the entire conversation for review. As selections were considered, a recording of the piece was located and played back at the next gathering. Disney did not contribute much to early discussions; he admitted that his knowledge of music was instinctive and untrained. In one meeting, he inquired about a piece [...] "on which we might build something of a prehistoric theme... with animals". The group was considering The Firebird by Igor Stravinsky, but Taylor noted that his [...] "Le Sacre du printemps <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> on that order", to which Disney replied upon hearing a recording, [...] "This is marvelous! It would be perfect for prehistoric animals. There <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> terrific in dinosaurs, flying lizards, and prehistoric monsters. There could be beauty in the settings." ...|$|E

500|$|The art {{style for}} the game {{was based on the}} work of Frank Frazetta and {{inspired}} by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot rod-like engines that grow from the earth like a [...] "V8 Truffle Of Speed", with design inspired by the designs of Ed [...] "Big Daddy" [...] Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating [...] "another brown-gray game", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art. Cutscenes in the game use the game's engine, though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former Pixar employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes.|$|E

500|$|Aguilera and Ronson wrote [...] "Slow Down Baby" [...] {{alongside}} Kara DioGuardi and Raymond Angry, and Ronson {{completed the}} production with assistance from Aguilera. In {{an interview for}} Herald Sun, Ronson elaborated on the collaboration: [...] "I heard [...] was looking for tracks. I was a bit narrow-minded, I assumed nothing I was doing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> she'd be into.

[...] He stated that he had initially imagined offering [...] "Slow Down Baby" [...] to someone like rap duo M.O.P. Ronson provided the beats and played the guitar and bass, while Angry played the claviola, organ and piano. Ronson recorded Aguilera's vocals at Allido Sound in New York City and additional recording was helmed by Oscar Ramirez at The Record Plant in Los Angeles, California. Dave [...] "Hard Drive" [...] Pensado later completed the mixing process at Larrabee North in North Hollywood.|$|E

[...] Another assistant commissioner claimed the new design {{was intended as a}} [...] "terror to the able-bodied population", but the architect George Gilbert Scott was critical of what he called [...] "a set of ready-made designs of the meanest possible character". [...] Some critics of the new Poor Law noted the similarities between Kempthorne's plans and model prisons, and doubted that they were merely coincidental. [...] Augustus Pugin compared Kempthorne's hexagonal plan with the [...] "antient poor hoyse", in what Professor Felix Driver calls a [...] "romantic, conservative critique" [...] of the [...] "degeneration of English moral and aesthetic values".|$|E

Before the face was revealed, IGN's Scott Nichols ran an article about the possibility of revealing the face, concluding that fans did not just want to see her face but also [...] "the expressions it can make, adding yet another level of emotional depth and complexity to a fan favorite character". GamesRadar's Mikel Reparaz listed it as one of the 12 gaming mysteries he wanted solved in 2011, and hoped that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> unusual-looking; this sentiment was echoed by fellow GamesRadar writer Tyler Nagata, who felt that the face should be ugly.

Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible.

Reviewer Louis Pattison stated that [...] "Riot Act {{is the sound of}} a band entering a powerful middle-age. They still deserve your attention." [...] AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, saying [...] "given several plays, this does indeed seem like the richest record Pearl Jam has made in a long time." [...] Spin gave the album seven out of ten stars. The review said, [...] "Pearl Jam's seventh studio album balances emotive bombast with a taut-sweaty hard-rock attack." [...] Critic Robert Christgau described Pearl Jam on the album as [...] "masters of their own audio, with soft spots where their emotions can go." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer Keith Harris gave the album three out of five stars, saying that [...] "like Neil Young at his most deliberately despondent, Pearl Jam sound purposefully tired." [...] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B, saying that Vedder's lyrics [...] "rarely cohere", and that [...] "too few of the tense rhythmic setups build to the kind of...catharsis that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> to Riot home about." [...] Q gave the album three out of five stars. The review called the album [...] "An adult rock record in which nuance succeeds over bombast." ...|$|E

She went on to state that it [...] "make it hard to tell whether the California party girl can actually sing". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy met the song with a mixed review. He commented on the choice of the single, noting [...] "the glimpses of emotion shown on her last offering, 'Your Love Is My Drug', are as long gone as her sobriety." [...] Although he was not completely convinced he wrote, [...] " [...] the vocals are more processed than a cheese string [...] the combination of a playful nursery rhyme hook and Dr Luke's bubblegummy electro production make this a pretty irresistible little dancefloor ditty." [...] He went on to give the single three out of five stars. Fraser McAlpine of BBC met the song with a mixed review giving the song three out of five stars. Fraser criticized the choice of the song commenting, [...] "there's a fear that if Kesha reveals that she's a sensitive young flower after all, with real feelings and a good, pure heart, her appeal with disappear like a soap bubble on a cactus, can it?". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was negative in his review of the song, calling it [...] "outright stupid" [...] and noted it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> commonly heard on a playground. Adams wrote that the song touched on opposite-sex objectification, but wrote that the theme became wearisome on the album, using the song as one of the examples where the theme was overused.|$|E

500|$|Differing from Survivor in that {{previously}} Beyoncé {{had taken an}} active role in writing and producing, Destiny Fulfilled saw each member contributing inputs culled from personal experiences and individual opinions and points of view not dependent from the others'. In most cases, producers of the album would send them a CD containing a track that would be the group's basis in the songwriting process; without the producer's supervision of which part to sing, that formed a new direction of their style different from their previous records. The traditional approach where each member sang one verse and chimed in the chorus was replaced; in some songs in Destiny Fulfilled, their vocals were alternated in every line of the lyrics, a technique similar to hip hop artists. Destiny's Child took the role of executive producing alongside their manager, Mathew Knowles. Beyoncé, who vocally produced the songs, commented that it was important for her to make sure their voices were audible and identifiable. Taking it as one of her goals, the group decided to focus on mid-tempo songs and on few dance numbers and ballads—which they considered people cannot sing with. Beyoncé elaborated [...] "We {{wanted to make sure that}} the songs <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that we were proud of 10 years from now, 20 years from now. We wanted it to be something that people can really feel an emotion to. Up-tempo songs can do that, but they more make you wanna dance." [...] As Rowland was recently engaged in the time of the writing of the album, it further influenced her songwriting. She also cited that being apart from the group affected the album as well: [...] "All of us have been in three different places... so there's a lot to talk about, a lot that's gone on, personally. I think it's important to talk about that on this new record, to put what we've been going through separately into the new record." ...|$|E
