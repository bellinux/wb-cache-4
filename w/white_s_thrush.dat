40|$|The {{research}} {{aim of this}} study is to determine the contemporary relevance of the collaboration between Victor White, theologian, and Carl Gustav Jung the founder of Analytical Psychology. There are three objectives. The first is to place <b>White</b> <b>s</b> interest in Jung in a personal, professional and ecclesiastical context. Secondly, the intention is to try to understand the impasse that occurred between Jung and White about how evil is understood. The third objective of this thesis is to demonstrate that <b>White</b> <b>s</b> work, exploring the interdisciplinary frontier of theology and psychology is both valuable in its own terms, and of contemporary significance. This work explores the narrative of human flourishing based on a study of the interdisciplinary dialogue between White and Jung. The Jung-White dialogue is of particular interest because it demonstrates the challenge and the value of rigorous interdisciplinary engagement. Although theology and psychology each share the same subject matter the human person the distinction lies in the way in which the subject is knowable. <b>White</b> <b>s</b> investigation of the identity of soul and psyche demonstrates how the understanding of soul as a concept is reached by philosophical inference in theology. Inference is a different methodology to the field of investigation of the empirical psychologist. This work demonstrates that in working from two different methodologies the collaboration between Jung and White enabled conflicts in understanding to come to light that were unlikely to have been identified otherwise. This work recommends <b>White</b> <b>s</b> rational anthropology, which is grounded in the tradition of Aristotle and Aquinas, as a basis for interdisciplinary dialogue with view to paving the way towards a general consensus on what it means to be a flourishing human person. The aim is to draw attention to the value of <b>White</b> <b>s</b> scholarship as a potentially significant contribution to contemporary discourse on mental health. In providing a philosophical / theological / psychological synthesis of the flourishing human person <b>White</b> <b>s</b> corpus has much to contribute towards a greater understanding of what constitutes mental health.

40|$|This was an {{interesting}} spring season, with something for everyone. Interesting data in terms of numbers are being produced by the North American Migration Count (NAMC), especially this spring in Sarpy County; examples are 499 Swainson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Thrushes,</b> 76 Gray-cheeked Thrushes, and 118 Black-and-white Warblers, and others. Some species appeared in large numbers such as 5, 000 Western Grebes, 16 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 10, 000 Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Phalaropes, 300 each of Black-bellied Plover and Sanderling, 54 Whimbrels, and two flocks of over 100 Great-tailed Grackles. Some interesting early and late dates {{are included in the}} species accounts, but several observers noted unexpected species such as Indigo Bunting and Rose-breasted Grosbeak, at feeders; this may have been due to-the cold, wet spring keeping insect numbers at a low level.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat {{industry}} {{relies heavily}} on export markets. Since the early 1960 s these markets have been geographically concentrated in a few countries in Asia. This suggests that developments in a few Asian countries may significantly affect the prospects for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat exports and thereby the economic well being of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat production-consumption system. However, very {{few studies have been}} undertaken of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat market in these Asian countries. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze and evaluate the effects of variations in: U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat price, income, domestic wheat production, the availability of other food grains, shipments of U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat under P. L. 480 programs, imports of Australian standard (white) wheat, and exchange rates on the Japanese and Korean import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat. Three short-run empirical models of the U. S. -Japan- Korea market for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat are estimated by fitting regression curves using annual data over the period 1963 - 1964 to 1980 - 1981. The results of the study indicate that an inelastic import demand curve for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat is present in both Japan and Korea. This finding along with other evidence suggest that both the Japanese and Korean governments have greatly distorted the Japanese and the Korean import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat. In the Japanese case, import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat is strongly affected by domestic (soft) wheat production as well as the quantity imported of Australian standard (white) wheat. Per capita real income, the quantity of rice available, and the real exchange rate (as an interaction with average shipping costs paid in U. S. dollars), however, did not meaningfully affect the Japanese purchases of U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat. In the Korean case, import demand for U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat is closely associated with the quantity of rice available, the amount of U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat imports under P. L. 480 programs, the quantity of barley available and Korean per capita real income. On the other hand, domestic (soft) wheat production and the real exchange rate (as defined earlier) did not meaningfully affect the Korean purchases of U. <b>S.</b> <b>white</b> wheat...|$|R

40|$|Introduction As {{many of you}} know, the American Ornithologists 2 ̆ 7 Union (AOU) {{has changed}} some generic names and rearranged the taxonomic order for shortbirds in the {{expanded}} genus Tringa and for the terns. This Spring Report uses the new taxonomic order. Observers (thank you, I think!) submitted {{a huge amount of}} data that I distilled for this report; I entered more than 3, 500 sightings into my database, which allows for a comprehensive overview of what birds were doing this spring. As has been the case the last few years, there were several record or near-record early arrival dates, some requiring documentation (readily supplied!) and some only marginally early relative to the previous early dates. Shorebirds had several of these early dates, with at least eight species at or near record-early arrival dates. Two species of grebes and Blue-winged Teal also were early. Three species of swallow, along with Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Rock Wren, Swainson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Thrush,</b> and American Pipit also showed up early. Finally, three 2 ̆ 2 southern 2 ̆ 2 warblers that breed north to Nebraska were record early: Yellow-throated, Prothonotary and Louisiana Waterthrush...|$|R

40|$|Non-standard English (NSE) {{syntactic}} constructions {{occurring in}} the natural speech, behaviour {{of a group of}} 20 12 -year old Coloured children were identified  and analysed. Three syntactic classes were isolated as having contained NSE constructions used significantly  by the group: auxiliary/copula verb forms, number-verb agreement and tense. A bi-dialectal sentence repetition task was then adminstered to the same group and to a matched group of White children, in which the two groups were compared on their ability to reproduce sentences containing (1) NSE constructions used significantly by the Coloured group, and (2) the standard English (SE) forms of these constructions. Results indicated that while Coloured Ss were able to reproduce many of the SE constructions, their overall performance  on these items was significantly inferior  to that of  <b>White</b> <b>Ss.</b> Conversely, their repetition of  NSE items was significantly  superior to that of  <b>White</b> <b>Ss.</b> The implications of these findings for the clinical language assessment of Coloured children were discussed...|$|R
