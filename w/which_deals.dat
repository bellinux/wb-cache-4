The first three scenes, from the story of Noah, contain a much larger number of small figures than the later panels. This is partly because of the subject matter, <b>which</b> <b>deals</b> with the fate of Humanity, but also because all the figures at that end of the ceiling, including the prophets and Ignudi, are smaller than in the central section. As the scale got larger, Michelangelo's style became broader, the final narrative scene of God in the act of Creation was painted in a single day.|$|E

Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles. Greece's ARCHELON works for their conservation. The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, <b>which</b> <b>deals</b> with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} German words which are {{singularly}} and powerfully effective. For instance, those which describe lowly, peaceful, and affectionate home life; those <b>which</b> <b>deal</b> with love, in {{any and all}} forms, from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing stranger, clear up to courtship; those <b>which</b> <b>deal</b> with outdoor Nature, in its softest and loveliest aspects--with meadows and forests, and birds and flowers, the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the moonlight of peaceful winter nights; in a word, those <b>which</b> <b>deal</b> with any and all forms of rest, repose, and peace; those also <b>which</b> <b>deal</b> with the creatures and marvels of fairyland; and lastly and chiefly, in those words which express pathos, is the language surpassingly rich and affective. There are German songs which can make a stranger to the language cry. That shows that the SOUND of the words is correct--it interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is informed, and through the ear, the heart.|$|R
