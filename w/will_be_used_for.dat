5|$|From 1932 to 1992, Birkebeinerrittet, a mass ski {{marathon}} between Rena and Lillehammer, {{has used}} Stampesletta as a start or goal area, depending on if the race ran from Lillehammer to Rena {{or in the}} opposite direction. Since 1992, the goal area was moved to Birkebeineren Ski Stadium. Birkebeinerrittet, a cycle version of the ski marathon, has its goal area at Stampesletta. The half-marathon terrain race Birkebeinerløpet uses Stampesletta as its start and goal area. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Stampesletta was used for medal ceremonies for all non-skating events. The backdrops for the podium was built using ice and snow, with the podium itself being made from ice from the glacier Jostedalsbreen. This contrasted with the surrounding pine elements. Attendance was free, and between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the medal ceremonies. Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics. The Stampesletta area <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the opening and closing ceremonies with a spectator capacity of 6,000 to 8,000; existing and new buildings nearby <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the Olympic Village.|$|E

40|$|In {{this final}} project, Microcontroller MC 68705 R 3 has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as CPU in {{counting}} and time recorder. To follow that function required a base time that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> counting.

How circuit work is, firstable to take base time that achieved by sensor reading to the target 1 and then target 2 respectively. The process is started by comparing base time to the time that achieved from sensor that reading the following target. In the laboratorium test proved that Microcontroller MC 68705 R 3 can be implemented as CPU in counting and time recording.

5|$|Most of the ATP {{synthesized}} in the mitochondria <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> cellular {{processes in}} the cytosol; thus it must be exported from its site of synthesis in the mitochondrial matrix. The inner membrane contains an antiporter, the ADP/ATP translocase, which is an integral membrane protein used to exchange newly synthesized ATP in the matrix for ADP in the intermembrane space. This translocase {{is driven by the}} membrane potential, as it results in the movement of about 4 negative charges out of the mitochondrial membrane in exchange for 3 negative charges moved inside. However, it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate, partially dissipating the proton gradient.|$|E

Develop and placements of tourism are dependent on factors (conditions) that influence its use in concrete regions. These factors are classified into selectable, localisation, and realisation (localisation and realisation factors issue was published as a part of solution of the research plan of FBE No. MSM 6215648904, part 03). The selectable factors determine the possibilities of the region to develop tourism in demand function. The landscape character and the environment appertain to these objective presumptions.
