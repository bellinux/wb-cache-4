5|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{supposed}} to be developed for the PlayStation 3, but due to the long wait for the PS3, {{the game was}} developed for the PlayStation 2 instead. From the outset, the games director Hideo Kojima wished to drastically change the setting from previous games. He stated that the jungle setting is <b>what</b> <b>both</b> his development team, and the Metal Gear fans, wanted. However, he acknowledged that the elements of a jungle environment, such as the weather, landscape and wildlife, were features that would present problems during the game's development. Whereas in previous installments the player starts out close to, or even within, the enemy base, Kojima wished Snake Eater to be more realistic, with Snake starting out miles from civilization and having to work his way to the enemy encampment.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} episodes of Carnivàle, Ben's {{parentage}} {{is one of}} the big puzzles. As a man named Henry Scudder seems connected to everything and everyone, it is Ben's job to piece together the mystery of his own past. The progressing series indicates many characters are more closely interrelated than <b>what</b> <b>both</b> the characters and the audience would imagine at first. Although these links rarely receive plot attention, the immediate genealogy of the main characters is cleared up {{by the end of the}} second season. Other character links that were largely unanswered after Carnivàles cancellation concern the trench war and the Hyde&Teller Company in relation to the emergence of the Carnivàle. Show creator Daniel Knauf, character biographies on the HBO website and the Pitch Document later provided detail for what was originally envisioned. Although the nature of these sources does not qualify them for canon status, they provide a framework for hints dropped in the series.|$|E

25|$|The sleeve design {{may also}} {{refer to the}} Krzysztof Kieślowski's film : it uses the same color and font that the one {{appearing}} on the screen of the PC {{responsible for the death}} of the main character's son; furthermore, mourning a deceased son is <b>what</b> <b>both</b> the film and this album are about.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, <b>what</b> <b>both</b> {{religion}} and spirituality {{have in common}} is a sense of the supernatural, while others see supernatural thought unnecessary for spirituality. In colonial America, some people had a supernatural curiosity that was often combined with free-thinking rationalism advocated by intellectuals such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson. Robert Fuller has characterized the SBNR phenomenon as a mix of intellectual progressivism and mystical hunger, impatient with the piety of established churches.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s Hebron, {{became the}} center of the Kach movement, a {{designated}} terrorist organization, whose first operations started there, and provided a model for similar behaviour in other settlements. Hebron is one of the three West Bank towns from where the majority of suicide bombers originate. In May 2003, three students of the Hebron Polytechnic University carried out three separate suicide attacks. In August 2003, in <b>what</b> <b>both</b> Islamic groups described as a retaliation, a 29-year-old preacher from Hebron, Raed Abdel-Hamed Mesk, broke a unilateral Palestinian ceasefire by killing 23 and injured over 130 in a bus bombing in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|However, <b>what</b> <b>both</b> Takeda {{and his son}} Tokimune says {{should be}} taken with a big pinch of salt. Famous proponents of the art {{including}} Kondo sensei and Sagawa sensei have {{been quoted as saying}} Takeda and his son had the same teaching system ie only to teach one or two people the real 'techniques' ie the aiki of the art. The rest are only taught the 'basics' or the external form of the art. As it stands, only a few were ever taught the real stuff and what the true masters of the art said or did was done to mislead a particular group of people into thinking that they were learning true aikijitsu. The same can be said for teachers of the modified form of daitoryu, the art of aikido.|$|E
25|$|Egypt and Syria {{launched}} the Yom Kippur War against Israel in the Sinai {{and in the}} Golan Heights on 6October 1973 without Hussein's knowledge. Between 10September and 6October, Hussein secretly met with Israeli prime minister Golda Meir in Tel Aviv on 25September. Israeli leaks of the meeting led to rumors in the Arab World that Hussein had tipped off Meir about Arab intentions. Hussein only discussed with Meir <b>what</b> <b>both</b> already knew, that the Syrian army was on alert. On 13October Jordan joined the war and sent the 40thbrigade to assist the Syrians in the Golan Heights. Some see it as ironic {{that it was the}} same brigade that had been sent to deter the Syrian invasion during Black September in 1970. Subsequent peace talks with Israel collapsed; while Jordan wanted a complete Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, Israel preferred to retain control but with Jordanian administration.|$|E
25|$|Russia and India {{have decided}} not to renew the 1971 Indo-Soviet Peace and Friendship Treaty and have sought to follow <b>what</b> <b>both</b> {{describe}} as a more pragmatic, less ideological relationship. Russian President Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993 helped cement this new relationship. Ties have grown stronger with President Vladimir Putin's 2004 visit. The pace of high-level visits has since increased, as has discussion of major defence purchases. Russia, is working {{for the development of the}} Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, that will be capable of producing 1000 MW of electricity. Gazprom, is working for the development of oil and natural gas, in the Bay of Bengal. India and Russia, have collaborated extensively, on space technology. Other areas of collaboration include software, ayurveda, etc. India and Russia, have set a determination in increasing trade to $10 billion. Cooperation between clothing manufacturers of the two countries continues to strengthen. India and Russia signed an agreement on joint efforts to increase investment and trade volumes in the textile industry in both countries. In signing the document included representatives of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs of Textile and Light Industry Council and apparel exports of India (AEPC). A co-operation agreement provides, inter alia, exchange of technology and know-how in textile production. For this purpose, a special Commission on Affairs textile (Textile Communication Committee). Counter-terrorism techniques are also in place between Russia and India. In 2007 President Vladimir Putin was guest of honour at Republic Day celebration on 26 January 2007. 2008, has been declared by both countries as the Russia-India Friendship Year. Bollywood films are quite popular in Russia. The Indian public sector oil company ONGC bought Imperial Energy Corporation in 2008. In December 2008, during President Medvedev's visit, to New Delhi, India and Russia, signed a nuclear energy co-operation agreement. In March, 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed an additional 19 pacts with India which included civilian nuclear energy, space and military co-operation and the final sale of Admiral Gorshkov (Aircraft Carrier) along with MiG-29K fighter jets.|$|E

M orders Bond to use a new gun and sends him on a holiday assignment, which Bond resents. The writer Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees M at his most authoritarian in Dr. No, punishing Bond both in terms of stripping him of his gun and then sending him on <b>what</b> <b>both</b> Bond and M considered at first to be a [...] "soft" [...] assignment.|$|E
500|$|It is {{commonly}} and mistakenly {{thought that if}} the condensation funnel of a tornado does not reach the ground, then the tornado cannot cause substantial damage. This is another deadly myth. A tornado {{appears to be on}} the ground only when its condensation funnel descends to the surface, but this is misleading. The circular, violent surface winds, not the condensation funnel, are <b>what</b> <b>both</b> define the tornado and cause the tornado's damage. Spotters should keep sight of swirling debris directly under any visible funnel or rotating wall cloud, even if such structures appear to not descend entirely to the ground.

500|$|California Republicans were {{impressed}} with Reagan's political views and charisma after his [...] "Time for Choosing" [...] speech, and in late 1965 he announced his campaign for Governor of California in the 1966 election. He defeated former San Francisco mayor George Christopher in the GOP primary. In Reagan's campaign, he emphasized two main themes: [...] "to send the welfare bums back to work," [...] and, in reference to burgeoning anti-war and anti-establishment student protests at the University of California at Berkeley, [...] "to {{clean up the mess}} at Berkeley." [...] In 1966, Reagan accomplished <b>what</b> <b>both</b> U.S. Senator William F. Knowland in 1958 and former Vice President Richard Nixon in 1962 had attempted to do: he was elected, defeating two-term governor Edmund G.

2500|$|In {{the most}} notable {{expression}} of Nebbiolo, the wines of Barolo, there is division between what is considered a [...] "traditional" [...] approach to Nebbiolo and a [...] "modernist" [...] approach. The roots of both styles can trace their history to the early [...] "pre-technology" [...] production of Nebbiolo. Prior to the advent of temperature-controlled fermentation, the late harvest dates for Nebbiolo meant that the wines began fermentation when the weather turned cold. These cool temperatures would delay fermentation for several days, extending the maceration period and extraction of phenolic compounds such as tannins. When fermentation did begin, temperatures would reach excessive levels of 95-100 °F (35-38 °C), which would drastically reduce potential aromas and flavors. With {{the high levels of}} tannins, these early Barolos would require five years or more of aging in oak barrels to soften some of the astringency. Lack of understanding of proper hygiene lead to less sanitary conditions than <b>what</b> <b>both</b> traditional and modernist producers maintain today. Those conditions lead to the development of bacterial infection of cement fermentation tanks and old wood barrels, which contributed to the development of off flavors and potential wine faults that would require at least 24 hours decanting to alleviate.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, O'Donnell criticized Donald Trump {{for holding}} {{a press conference}} to {{reinstate}} Miss USA Tara Conner, who had violated pageant guidelines, accusing him of using her scandal to [...] "generate publicity for the Miss USA Pageant" [...] (to which he owns the rights) by announcing he was giving her a second chance. O'Donnell commented that due to Trump's multiple marital affairs and questionable business bankruptcies, he was not a moral authority for young people in America. She stated, [...] "Left the first wife, had an affair. Left the second wife, had an affair – but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America." [...] In response, Trump began a [...] "vicious" [...] mass media blitz in which he appeared on various television shows, either in person or by phone, threatening to sue O'Donnell (he never did). He called her names, threatened to take away her partner Kelli, and claimed that Barbara Walters regretted hiring her. Walters was stuck in the middle as a social acquaintance of Trump's, and said O'Donnell didn't feel like Walters defended her enough, which led to <b>what</b> <b>both</b> women agreed was an unfortunate confrontation in one of the dressing rooms. [...] "I had pain and hurt and rejection," [...] O'Donnell said, [...] "sometimes [...] overwhelm me. Sometimes I get flooded." [...] Walters denied that she was unhappy with O'Donnell, saying, [...] "I have never regretted, nor do I now, the hiring of Rosie O'Donnell." ...|$|E
