50|$|A {{low-temperature}} separator is {{a special}} one in which high-pressure <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> is jetted into the vessel through a choke or pressure reducing valve so that the separator temperature is reduced appreciably below the well-fluid temperature. The temperature reduction is obtained by the Joule-Thomson effect of expanding <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> as it flows through the pressure-reducing choke or valve into the separator. The lower operating temperature in the separator causes condensation of vapors that otherwise would exit the separator in the vapor state. Liquids thus recovered require stabilization to prevent excessive evaporation in the storage tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Weight {{material}} that settles {{is referred to}} as sag, this causes a wide variation in the density of <b>well</b> <b>fluid,</b> this more frequently occurs in high angle and hot wells.|$|E
50|$|A line wiper {{operates}} {{in much the}} same way as a pack-off sub, except that the rubber element is much softer. Hydraulic pumps exert force on the rubber element until a light pressure is exerted on the wireline, cleaning grease and <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> off the line in the process.|$|E
50|$|When {{the well}} has been drilled, it is {{completed}} {{to provide an}} interface with the reservoir rock and a tubular conduit for the <b>well</b> <b>fluids.</b> The surface pressure control is provided by a Christmas tree, which is installed {{on top of the}} wellhead, with isolation valves and choke equipment to control the flow of <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> during production.|$|R

50|$|A {{production}} separator is used {{to separate}} the produced <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> from a well, group of wells, or a lease on a daily or continuous basis. Production separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. Production separators {{range in size from}} 12 in. to 15 ft in diameter, with most units ranging from 30 in. to 10 ft in diameter. They range in length from 6 to 70 ft, with most from 10 to 40 ft long.|$|E

50|$|Much of the {{offshore}} seabed diving work is inspection, {{maintenance and repair}} of the blow-out preventers (BOPs) and their permanent guide bases. The primary functions of a blow-out preventer system are to confine <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> to the wellbore, provide a way to add fluid to the wellbore and to allow controlled volumes of fluid to be withdrawn from the wellbore. Dive work includes assistance with guiding the blowout preventer stack (BOP stack) onto the guide base, inspection of the BOP stack, checking connections, troubleshooting malfunctions of the hydraulic, mechanical and electrical systems, and inspection of the rig's anchors.|$|E
5000|$|Petroleum {{production}} engineers {{design and}} select subsurface equipment to produce {{oil and gas}} <b>well</b> <b>fluids.</b> [...] They often are degreed as petroleum engineers, although they may come from other technical disciplines (e.g., mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, physicist) and subsequently be trained by an oil and gas company.|$|R
50|$|The {{function}} of separating <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> into oil, gas, {{and water and}} metering the liquids can be accomplished in one vessel. These vessels are {{commonly referred to as}} metering separators and are available for two-phase and three-phase operation. These units are available in special models that make them suitable for accurately metering foaming and heavy viscous oil.|$|R

5000|$|The ESP system {{consists}} {{of a number of}} components that turn a staged series of centrifugal pumps to increase the pressure of the <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> and push it to the surface. The energy to turn the pump comes from a high-voltage (3 to 5 kV) alternating-current source to drive a special motor that can work at high temperatures of up to [...] and high pressures of up to , from deep wells of up to 12000 ft deep with high energy requirements of up to about 1000 horsepower (750 kW). ESPs have dramatically lower efficiencies with significant fractions of gas, greater than about 10% volume at the pump intake. Given their high rotational speed of up to 4000 rpm (67 Hz) and tight clearances, they are not very tolerant of solids such as sand.|$|E
50|$|These can {{be either}} {{hydraulic}} or electric submersible. The hydraulic uses high pressure power fluid to operate down hole fluid engine. The engine in turn drives a piston that moves the fluid to the surface. The power fluid system {{can be either}} open or closed, it depends on whether the power fluid can be mixed with <b>well</b> <b>fluid.</b> This type of system usually has above ground power fluid pumps and a reservoir. The electric submersible is another type of rodless pumping system. This uses an electric pump submerged in the well and connected {{to a series of}} transformers and control equipment that power and control the pumping rate. In this system the electric motor is isolated from the oil by a protector. The fluid intake which is before the pump mechanism has a gas separator, also the junction box on the surface helps to dissipate any gas that may have come up the power lines.|$|E
50|$|The three {{configurations}} of separators {{are available for}} two-phase operation and three-phase operation. In the two-phase units, gas is separated from the liquid with the gas and liquid being discharged separately. Oil and gas separators are mechanically designed such that the liquid and gas components are separated from the hydrocarbon steam at specific temperature and pressure according to Arnold et al (2008). In three-phase separators, <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> is separated into gas, oil, and water with the three fluids being discharged separately. The gas-liquid separation section of the separator {{is determined by the}} maximum removal droplet size using the Souders-Brown equation with an appropriate K factor. The oil-water separation section is held for a retention time that is provided by laboratory test data, pilot plant operating procedure, or operating experience. In the case where the retention time is not available, the recommended retention time for three-phase separator in API 12J is used. The sizing methods by K factor and retention time give proper separator sizes. According to Song et al (2010), engineers sometimes need further information for the design conditions of downstream equipment, i.e., liquid loading for the mist extractor, water content for the crude dehydrator/desalter or oil content for the water treatment.|$|E
30|$|The {{total power}} {{consumed}} by the system comprises, {{in addition to the}} energy required to lift <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> to the surface (i.e. the hydraulic power Phydr), all the energy losses occurring in downhole and surface components. Thus, the required electrical energy input at the surface is always greater than the useful power; the relation of these powers defines the ESP systemâ€™s power efficiency.|$|R

50|$|In 1924 {{the first}} {{successful}} blowout preventer was brought to market. The BOP valve affixed to the wellhead could be closed {{in the event of}} drilling into a high pressure zone, and the <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> contained. <b>Well</b> control techniques could be used to regain control of the well. As the technology developed, blowout preventers became standard equipment, and gushers became a thing of the past.|$|R
5000|$|The total {{pressure}} {{acting on the}} wellbore is affected by pipe movement upwards or downwards.Tripping pipe {{into and out of}} a well is one other common operation during completions and workovers. Unfortunately, statistics indicate that most kicks occur during trips. Therefore, understanding the basic concepts of tripping is a major concern in completion/workover operations.Downward movement of tubing(tripping in) creates a pressure that is exerted on the bottom of a well. As the tubing is being run into a well, the fluid in the well must move upward to exit the volume being entered by the tubing.The combination of the downward movement of the tubing and the upward movement of the fluid (or piston effect) results in an increase in pressure at any given point in the well. This increase in pressure is commonly called Surge pressure.Upward movement of the tubing(tripping out) also affects the pressure which is imposed {{at the bottom of the}} well. When pulling pipe from the <b>well,</b> <b>fluid</b> must move downward and replace the volume which was occupied by the tubing. The net effect of the upward movement of the tubing and the downward movement of the fluid creates a decrease in bottomhole pressure. This decrease in pressure is referred to as Swab pressure.Both surge and swab pressures are affected by the following parameters: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} {{of water with}} oil {{continues to be a}} problem for engineers and the oil producers. Since 1865 when water was coproduced with hydrocarbons, it has challenged and frustrated the industry on how to separate the valuable from the disposable. According to Rehm et al (1983), innovation over the years has led from the skim pit to installation of the stock tank, to the gunbarrel, to the freewater knockout, to the hay-packed coalescer and most recently to the Performax Matrix Plate Coalescer, an enhanced gravity settling separator. The history of water treating for the most part has been sketchy and spartan. There is little economic value to the produced water, and it represents an extra cost for the producer to arrange for its disposal. Today oil fields produce greater quantities of water than they produce oil. Along with greater water production are emulsions and dispersions which are more difficult to treat. The separation process becomes interlocked with a myriad of contaminants as the last drop of oil is being recovered from the reservoir. In some instances it is preferable to separate and to remove water from the <b>well</b> <b>fluid</b> before it flows through pressure reductions, such as those caused by chokes and valves. Such water removal may prevent difficulties that could be caused downstream by the water, such as corrosion which can be referred to as being a chemical reactions that occurs whenever a gas or liquid chemically attacks an exposed metallic surface. Corrosion is usually accelerated by warm temperatures and likewise by the presence of acids and salts. Other factors that affect the removal of water from oil include hydrate formation and the formation of tight emulsion that may be difficult to resolve into oil and water. The water can be separated from the oil in a three-phase separator by use of chemicals and gravity separation. If the three-phase separator is not large enough to separatethe water adequately, it can be separated in a free-water knockout vessel installed upstream or downstream of the separators.|$|E

40|$|The Hydro-Balanced Stuffing Box is a seal {{assembly}} for polished rod pumping installations commonly used in oil and gas pumping well installations to contain produced <b>well</b> <b>fluids.</b> The improved stuffing box was developed and patented by Harold H. Palmour of The Palmour Group of Livingston, TX. The stuffing box is designed to {{reduce the incidence of}} seal leakage and to utilize an environmentally safe fluid, so that if there is any leakage, environmental damage is reduced or eliminated. The unit was tested on two wells at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center. During the test period, the performance of the stuffing box was measured by monitoring the pressure on the tubing and the inner chamber with a Barton Two-pen recorder. The amount of safe fluid consumed, fluid leakage {{at the top of the}} stuffing box, pressure supplied from the nitrogen bottle, ambient temperature, and polish rod temperature was recorded. The stuffing box is capable of providing a better seal between <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> an d the environment than conventional stuffing boxes.

50|$|Hydrocarbon {{producing}} wells {{are designed}} and managed {{on the basis}} of the 'barriers' in place to maintain containment. A 'dual barrier' philosophy is typically used whereby two independently verified barriers to the hydrocarbon reservoir and the environment are required at all times. The failure of a single barrier would not lead to a hydrocarbon release. During the different phases of drilling, production, workover and abandonments, many different pieces of equipment will be used to maintain control of the <b>well</b> <b>fluids</b> and pressures.|$|R

30|$|For {{an ideal}} design {{when all the}} {{necessary}} parameters of the well and the reservoir are perfectly known the pump will produce exactly the design liquid rate since it will work against the design TDH (1997; 2001; 2002).
