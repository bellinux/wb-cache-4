The years 1905–1908 saw half a million new Jewish {{immigrants}} to New York, and once again the largest audience for Yiddish theater was for lighter fare. Adler hung on, but the Thomashefskys were making a fortune at the Thalia; plays <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Minke the Servant Girl were far outdrawing fare like Gordin's Dementia Americana (1909). It would be 1911 before Adler scored another major success, this time with Tolstoy's The Living Corpse (also known as Redemption), translated into Yiddish by Leon Kobrin.|$|E

25|$|A Defense Committee {{publicist}} {{wrote an}} article about the first trial that was published in The New Republic. In the winter of 1920–1921, the Defense Committee sent stories to labor union publications every week. It produced pamphlets <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Fangs at Labor's Throat, sometimes printing thousands of copies. It sent speakers to Italian communities in factory towns and mining camps. The Committee eventually added staff from outside the anarchist movement, notably Mary Donovan, who had experience as a labor leader and Sinn Féin organizer. In 1927, she and Felicani together recruited Gardner Jackson, a Boston Globe reporter from a wealthy family, to manage publicity and serve as a mediator between the Committee's anarchists and the growing number of supporters with more liberal political views, who included socialites, lawyers, and intellectuals.|$|E

These included proposals for a city railway loop, the redevelopment of the Rocks, and a bridge to the North Shore. His obituary in The Sydney Morning Herald noted, [...] "Mr. Selfe for over twenty years was a strenuous advocate of a circular city railway that should connect up the eastern, western, and northern suburbs of the city with the marine suburbs of the harbour, and stations adjacent to the ferries". He published plans and proposals elaborating on his ideas, and produced major articles <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Sydney: past, present and possible" [...] and [...] "Sydney and its institutions, as they are, and might be from an engineer's point of view".|$|E

2500|$|The early titles {{produced}} at Ōkura Eiga {{indicate that the}} films from Ōkura's new studio continued the themes pioneered at Shintōhō. Director Satoru Kobayashi's all-color 1963 film, The Mysterious Pearl of the Ama, for example, looks back to Shintōhō's boundary-pushing female pearl-diver films of the mid-1950s, starring Michiko Maeda and Yōko Mihara. Kobayashi also directed ghost stories {{in the style of}} the films of Shintōhō's Nobuo Nakagawa, <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> [...] (1962), [...] (1963), and [...] (1964). Kobayashi continued to occasionally make films in this style for Ōkura as late as 1995 with [...] starring actresses Nao Saejima and Yumi Yoshiyuki, who would become a prominent pink film director herself, releasing mainly through Ōkura.|$|E

[...] He began changing his answering machine greeting {{every couple of}} weeks to various quotes by Patrick Henry such as [...] "Give me liberty or give me death." [...] He began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices. The government also imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 that McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.|$|E
2500|$|Merengue {{experienced}} a sudden elevation of status during dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo's reign from 1930 to 1961. Although {{he was from}} the south rather than the Cibao, he did come from a rural area and from a lower-class family, so he decided that the rural style of perico ripiao should be the Dominican national symbol. He ordered numerous merengues to be composed in his honor. <b>With</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Literacy", [...] "Trujillo is great and immortal", and [...] "Trujillo the great architect", these songs describe his virtues and extol his contributions to the country. Trujillo's interest in and encourangement of merengue created {{a place for the}} music on the radio and in respectable ballrooms. Musicians like Luis Alberti began to play with [...] "big band" [...] or orquesta instrumentation, replacing the accordion with a horn section and initiating a split between this new, mostly urban style and mostly rural perico ripiao. Today, New York City Latino radio is still dominated by orquesta merengue.|$|E

2500|$|During his 1904 {{retreat from}} Tibet, Younghusband had a mystical {{experience}} which suffused him with [...] "love for the whole world" [...] and convinced him that [...] "men at heart are divine." [...] This conviction was tinged with regret for the invasion of Tibet, and eventually, in 1936, profound religious convictions invited a founder's address to the World Congress of Faiths (in imitation of the World Parliament of Religions). Younghusband published {{a number of books}} with what one might call New Age themes, <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> The Gleam: Being an account of the life of Nija Svabhava, pseud.

The latter drew the admiration of Lord Baden-Powell, the Boy Scouts founder. Key concepts consisted of the central belief that would {{come to be known as}} the Gaia hypothesis, pantheism, and a Christlike [...] "world leader" [...] living on the planet [...] "Altair" [...] (or [...] "Stellair"), exploring the theology of spiritualism, and guidance by means of telepathy.|$|E

2500|$|Just as {{in other}} types of fiction, smoking has had an {{important}} place in literature and smokers are often portrayed as characters with great individuality, or outright eccentrics, something typically personified {{in one of the}} most iconic smoking literary figures of all, Sherlock Holmes. Other than being a frequent part of short stories and novels, smoking has spawned endless eulogies, praising its qualities and affirming the author's identity as a devoted smoker. Especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century, a panoply of books <b>with</b> <b>titles</b> <b>like</b> Tobacco: Its History and associations (1876), Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy (1906) and Pipe and Pouch: The Smokers Own Book of Poetry (1905) were written in the UK and the US.

The Fragrant Weed: Some of the Good Things Which Have been Said or Sung about Tobacco, published in 1907, contained, among many others, the following lines from the poem A Bachelor's Views by Tom Hall that were typical of the attitude of many of the books: ...|$|E
