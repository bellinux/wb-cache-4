5|$|Although {{a distant}} planet such as Planet Nine <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> little light, {{it would still}} be {{radiating}} the heat from its formation as it cools due to its large mass. At its estimated temperature of 47 K, the peak of its emissions would be at infrared wavelengths. This radiation signature could be detected by Earth-based infrared telescopes, such as ALMA, and a search could be conducted by cosmic microwave background experiments operating at mm wavelengths. Additionally, Jim Green of NASA is optimistic that it could be observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, that is expected to be launched in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could identify it based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet {{is more likely to be}} closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E
5|$|Nolan {{worked with}} {{production}} designer Nathan Crowley {{to create the}} look of Gotham City. Crowley built {{a model of the}} city that filled Nolan's garage. Crowley and Nolan designed it as a large, modern metropolitan area that <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> the various periods of architecture that the city had gone through. Elements were drawn from New York City, Chicago, and Tokyo; the latter for its elevated freeways and monorails. The Narrows was based on the slummish nature of the (now demolished) walled city of Kowloon in Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May, German Army Group A broke the defences at Sedan and was now free to drive for the English Channel. The Allies {{considered}} a wholesale withdrawal from the Belgian trap. The withdrawal <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> three stages: the night of 16/17 May to the River Senne, the night of 17/18 May to the river Dendre and the night of 18/19 May to the river Scheldt. The Belgians were reluctant to abandon Brussels and Leuven, especially as the Dyle line had withstood German pressure well.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick voiced {{concerns}} {{about the need for}} such pure plutonium to make a feasible bomb. He also suspected that the gun method of detonation for a plutonium bomb would lead to premature detonations due to impurities. After Chadwick met Robert Oppenheimer at the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1943, he learned of a proposed bomb design which they were calling an implosion. The sub-critical mass of plutonium was supposed to be surrounded by explosives that were arranged to detonate simultaneously. This would cause the plutonium core to be compressed and become supercritical. The core would be surrounded by a depleted uranium tamper which <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> the neutrons back into the reaction, and contribute to the explosion by fissioning itself. This design solved Chadwick's worries about purity because it did not require the level that would be needed for the gun-type fission weapon. The biggest problem with this method was creating the explosive lenses. Chadwick took this information with him and described the method to Oliphant who then took it with him to England.|$|E

5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed to hear this case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered {{to the ends of the}} earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E
25|$|Charlotte {{would face}} their third ranked {{opponent}} of the season, and their third Big South opponent in the Charleston Southern Buccaneers.

25|$|The second, funding, {{notes that}} the outlets derive the {{majority}} of their funding from advertising, not readers. Thus, since they are profit-oriented businesses selling a product—readers and audiences—to other businesses (advertisers), the model would expect them to publish news which <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> the desires and values of those businesses.|$|E
25|$|ABC later {{approached}} her {{to create a}} show that <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> a more contemporary tone. That program became One Life to Live, and it debuted in 1968. After the show became a success, the network asked her for another program, and she obliged by reviving her All My Children bible and the Erica Kane character.|$|E

25|$|Larocque {{had worked}} in the Canadian North since 1930. Before {{becoming}} a missionary, he had worked as a carpenter, an experience that had led to him designing various buildings for the distant communities he worked in despite his lack of formal architectural training.

25|$|On March 28, 2015, {{a former}} elder {{of the church}} {{revealed}} that Driscoll had not been involved in initiating nor signing the contract with Result Source. The elder stated that the business relationship with the marketing firm was initiated by a pastor who resigned shortly thereafter, and remaining church leaders disagreed over {{the completion of the}} contract, stating that it <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> badly on the church and Mark Driscoll.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah Joseph Duggan {{received}} fatal {{head injuries}} {{when he ran}} into the road in Wiesbaden and was hit by two private motor cars. What other fact {{do we know that}} I must add? I really must add that he had earlier been in a state of terror. It is a word not commonly used in a Coroner's court but no other word <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> his state of mind at the time.|$|E
50|$|A rifle green {{coat was}} issued to Berdan's Sharpshooters, 1st and 2nd Sharpshooter Regiment {{as an early}} form of camouflage. These had black rubber Goodyear buttons that <b>would</b> not <b>reflect</b> the light and give away the sniper's position.|$|R

25|$|If {{the general}} {{process by which}} {{sporadic}} colon cancers arise is {{the formation of a}} pre-neoplastic clone that spreads by natural selection, followed by formation of internal sub-clones within the initial clone, and sub-sub-clones inside those, then colon cancers generally should be associated with, and be preceded by, fields of increasing abnormality reflecting the succession of premalignant events. The most extensive region of abnormality (the outermost yellow irregular area in the diagram) <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> the earliest event in formation of a malignant neoplasm.|$|E
25|$|Miklos further {{developed}} his technical skills at 'Ateliers Brugier, a lacquer workshop in Paris. In Jean Dunand's studio his interested turned towards metal panel-beating, enameling and rock-crystals. During {{this time he}} associated with the Paresian avant-garde. Subsequently, Miklos devoted {{most of his time}} to sculpture, a medium in which his style became less convoluted, purist in nature, retaining an element of mystery. Miklos personally supervised the casting of his bronzes and the application of various patinas, so that light <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> desirably off their surfaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{reforms of}} the 1990s did not achieve their objectives. It had been {{expected}} that privatization would bring investment in new generation, but very little capacity was added {{in the years that}} followed the reform. Moreover, the generation capacity added in the last decade has been mainly dependent on liquid fuels, making the country more vulnerable to rising oil prices. In addition, as mentioned, distribution losses have remained at very high levels (28%). The reform also aimed at implementing gradual changes in electricity tariffs that <b>would</b> <b>reflect</b> costs, which proved to be politically unfeasible.|$|E
