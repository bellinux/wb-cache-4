25|$|On {{the episode}} {{broadcast}} on Monday, August 30, 2010, {{it was revealed}} that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day's episode dealt with Nancy's memorial service. Nancy Hughes's memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show's producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner's death – they had hoped that Wagner <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> final lines of the last episode just as she had said the first words of the first episode.|$|E
25|$|This disease {{attacks the}} brain and makes the {{patients}} unable to stop shaking. The effects could be difficulty in walking, communicating, or functioning. Over time the symptoms go from mild to severe, which can cause extreme difficulties in a person's life. Many psychologists relate Parkinson's disease to Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia, which would cause a person to have comprehension deficits {{and being able to}} recognize irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> dog goed home.|$|E
25|$|Receptive aphasia: The {{patients}} {{suffer from}} lesions or damage {{located in the}} left temproparietal lobe. Receptive Aphasic patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty saying things or describing things, these people showed {{that they could do}} well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance using the example of the dog went home, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> dog goed home.|$|E

Conversely, {{if one were to}} work this example in euro terms rather than dollar terms, the perspective would be reversed and one <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>the</b> dollar is trading at a discount against the Euro.|$|R

25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt {{there was no need}} to call on Orfila to do it. The president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what they <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E
25|$|The Yang {{family first}} became {{involved}} in the study of t'ai chi ch'uan (taijiquan) in the early 19th century. The founder of the Yang-style was Yang Luchan (楊露禪), aka Yang Fu-k'ui (楊福魁, 1799–1872), who studied under Ch'en Chang-hsing starting in 1820. Yang became a teacher in his own right, and his subsequent expression of t'ai chi ch'uan became known as the Yang-style, and directly {{led to the development of}} other three major styles of t'ai chi ch'uan (see below). Yang Luchan (and some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> art of t'ai chi ch'uan, in general) came to prominence as a result of his being hired by the Chinese Imperial family to teach t'ai chi ch'uan to the elite Palace Battalion of the Imperial Guards in 1850, a position he held until his death.|$|E
25|$|The pilgrims {{that brought}} the Bikkurim to the Temple were obligated to recite a declaration, {{also known as the}} Avowal, set forth in Deuteronomy 26:3-10 (cf. Mishnah, Bikkurim 3:6). Native-born Israelites and proselytes would bring the Bikkurim and <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> Avowal, but women who brought the Bikkurim were not {{permitted}} to say the Avowal, since they were unable to claim inheritance in the Land bequeathed unto the tribes by their male lineage. This Avowal was incorporated into a beautiful and grand festive celebration with a procession of pilgrims marching up to Jerusalem and then the Temple with gold, silver or willow baskets to which live birds were tied. (Bikkurim 3:3,5 and 8). The pilgrims were led by flutists to the city of Jerusalem where they were greeted by dignitaries (Bikkurim 3:3). The procession would then resume with the flutist in lead until the Temple Mount where the Levites would break out in song (Bikkurim 3:4). The birds were given as sacrificial offerings and the declaration would be made before a priest while the basket was still on the pilgrim's shoulder (Bikkurim 3:5-6). After the basket was presented to the priest, it was placed by the Altar and the pilgrim would bow and leave (Bikkurim 3:6).|$|E

500|$|By 11 August 1958, Pearkes {{requested}} {{cancellation of}} the Arrow, but the Cabinet Defence Committee (CDC) refused. Pearkes tabled it again in September and recommended installation of the Bomarc missile system. The latter was accepted, but again the CDC refused to cancel the entire Arrow program. The CDC wanted to wait until a major review on 31 March 1959. They cancelled the Sparrow/Astra system in September 1958. Efforts to continue the program through cost-sharing with other countries were then explored. In 1959, Pearkes <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> ballistic missile was the greater threat, and Canada purchased Bomarc [...] "in lieu of more airplanes".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] {{or any of the other}} things... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd." [...] Approximately 1.2million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.|$|E
500|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Tomas Gonzalez-Torres, the Lead EVA Officer, and Hubble Program Manager Preston Burch both {{explained}} that the spare RSU would not impact {{the life of the}} telescope, as it had been fully refurbished on the ground with two of the three improvements incorporated in newer models. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> difference in the projected longevity of the observatory in the out years is very small. We don't see this is a significant detriment at all to the observatory. This was a tremendous accomplishment for us." [...] Burch noted. Lead Flight Director Tony Ceccacci noted that due to the length of the spacewalk, and the resulting slip in the timeline, the crew's sleep shift would have to be moved an hour later, to allow them to get the proper amount of rest, {{and the rest of the}} docked timeline would also be shifted forward an hour.|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who {{reviewed}} both versions, {{praised the}} game's ambition and {{the elements that}} worked, but said that people would focus on the faults with its narrative delivery and gameplay structure; he summed up the game as a [...] "great and original experience that's well worthwhile". Steve Butts of IGN said that, while some <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> gameplay made too many concessions towards casual players, {{it was still a}} well-built and enjoyable video game, praising most of the alterations made by the developers. Ryan McCaffrey of Official Xbox Magazine called the game a [...] "brilliant RPG" [...] despite noting its short length, praising its narrative, gameplay freedom, and in-game physics. Kieron Gillen, reviewing the game for PC Gamer, praised the game's wide variety of choice despite some elements such as the biomod upgrade system not evolving. He noted that the elements that had not been directly carried over from Deus Ex would taint people's perception of the game.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, O'Hara {{marked the}} end of a {{collaboration}} with John Ford with The Wings of Eagles, which was based on the true story of an old friend of Ford's, Frank [...] "Spig" [...] Wead, a naval aviator who became a screenwriter in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "Wayne and O'Hara interact well in these early scenes, giving effortless performances and exhibiting a strong chemistry. One can sense the offscreen friendship in little nuances between them". Though not a major commercial success, it fared better {{in the eyes of the}} critics. The relationship between O'Hara and Ford grew increasingly bitter, and that year he referred to her as a [...] "greedy bitch" [...] to director Joseph McBride, who had shown an interest in casting her for The Rising of the Moon. O'Hara later referred to him as an [...] "instant conman" [...] who <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> opposite of what he felt said of his bitterness: [...] "He wanted to be born in Ireland and he wanted to be an Irish rebel. The fact that he wasn't left him very bitter".|$|E
500|$|LeMond grew {{up living}} an active, outdoor life. Hiking, hunting, skiing and flyfishing were boyhood pastimes. The ranch country [...] of the Sierra Nevada {{mountain}} range lent itself to such pursuits. A hyperactive youngster, LeMond believes these outdoor activities helped {{keep him out}} of trouble. [...] "I was a boy who just could not sit still. I had trouble focusing in school. Parents and educators then did not have the skill set to diagnose and cope with what we know now was a classic case of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD certainly was not the frequently medicated childhood disease it is today. My triumph over the symptoms was found atop two thin tires over many dusty miles." [...] Said LeMond: [...] "That's one of the traits. It's the inability to sit down [...] to something you are not really interested in and absorb it. If they are interested in it, people with ADD excel in really good ways. When I got into cycling I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> sport itself took a fog off my brain. I was able to absorb stuff I read. It changed my life." ...|$|E

500|$|The Way of All Flesh was {{released}} on 13 October in Europe via Listenable Records and 14 October in North America through Prosthetic Records in 2008. On 25 July 2008, the band announced the track listing and revealed the final cover art for the record. Joe Duplantier stated about the album, [...] "This record is a lot darker — like, a lot darker, I <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>The</b> music is darker and more violent." [...] Duplantier stated the album will be [...] "more intense, more brutal, and more melodic" [...] than its predecessor. [...] "That's the theme — it's about death itself," [...] he explained. [...] "It's also about the immortality of the soul. That's the main subject for us". Randy Blythe from the American band Lamb of God appeared as a guest vocalist on the song [...] "Adoration for None" [...] The album took four months to write and record, and three months to mix. On 17 March 2009, the band's first North American headlining tour was announced. The opening bands were The Chariot and Car Bomb. Gojira accompanied Metallica on their tour from 14 September to 18 October, performing before Lamb of God.|$|E
500|$|Paul Babeu, {{the sheriff}} of Pinal County, Arizona, {{appeared}} on The Political Cesspool on July 10, 2010 to discuss illegal immigration; during the interview, {{he referred to}} James Edwards as a [...] "great American". Less than two weeks later, Babeu's spokesman issued an apology, {{saying that he had}} not researched the show thoroughly enough before scheduling the interview and that Babeu has a policy of not conducting interviews with hate groups. Babeu himself said that he was [...] "hoodwinked" [...] into appearing on the show and that he rejects [...] "any hate or bigotry". Prior to the interview, cohost Eddie Miller said that [...] "Of all the people we’ve interviewed on this radio show, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> only people that came close to getting me this excited was Dr. David Duke." [...] Following Babeu's spokesman's apology, Edwards alleged that Babeu was aware of the show's true ideology prior to appearing on the show, saying: [...] "For Sheriff Babeu to change his mind and now regret coming on our show, for whatever reason, is his right. For him to act as though he had no idea of our ideology is a lie." [...] As a result of the controversy surrounding Babeu's appearance on the show, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate J. D. Hayworth asked his primary opponent, John McCain, to drop several campaign ads featuring McCain and Babeu. In 2011, another sheriff, Dennis Spruell of Montezuma County, Colorado, also apologized after appearing on the show without knowing its actual agenda.|$|E
500|$|On 18 March 1941, the 2/3rd Battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard HMS Gloucester, {{arriving}} in Greece and {{landing in the}} port of Piraeus on the following day, after a 22-hour voyage during which their convoy had been attacked numerous times by Axis aircraft. After {{the invasion of the}} country on 6 April, they were moved north to attempt to turn back the German forces. The following day they occupied Veria, and on 12 April the 6th Division was grouped together with the 2nd New Zealand Division and a lone British brigade to form an Anzac Corps. This formation did not last long, however, as the Greek government requested Allied forces withdraw from Greece on 16 April before ceasing organised resistance on 18 April. Due to a series of withdrawals elsewhere, the battalion was forced to pull back from its positions at Veria and did not come into contact with the Germans until 18 April when they attempted to block passage of the Tempe Gorge. Fighting alongside the 2/2nd Battalion and New Zealanders, the rearguard action was successful and enabled the Allies to withdraw to the south. Brigadier Arthur Allen, commander of the 16th Brigade, later wrote of this encounter: [...] "it was a fantastic battle. Everyone was on top, with no time to dig in, and all in the front line, including artillery, Bren carriers and infantry, as well as headquarters, with transport only yards in the rear. Some confusion could be expected in the circumstances, with every weapon firing and aircraft almost continually strafing from above. If you saw it in the cinema you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> author had never seen battle." ...|$|E

500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E
