25|$|Interslavic is a zonal {{constructed}} language {{based on}} the Slavic languages.

25|$|It is {{one thing}} to worship a picture, it is another by means of {{pictures}} to learn thoroughly the story that should be venerated.

25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts seem likely to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E
25|$|The {{sub-field}} {{of translation}} includes {{the translation of}} written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within computational linguistics setups like Google Translate for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another {{in order to reach}} varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.|$|E

25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned to read in Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E
25|$|Dear Princess, as I {{have already}} cabled you, I granted leave to Gogo , {{but only for}} your sake. He himself, of course, has not earned it, and {{unfortunately}} I must again repeat that I am extremely dissatisfied with his services. Both when on duty and on board during cruises he simply {{does not want to}} do anything at all; neither advice, nor the example of others have any effect whatever on him. Laziness, untidiness, and total lack of self esteem make him the laughing stock of his comrades and draw upon him the dissatisfaction of his superiors, <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> what to do with him. Today I gave him a severe reprimand, and have ordered his superior, that is the Commander of the Ship, to punish him severely for every misdemeanor! Perhaps that will have some effect. I am writing you all this, because I am afraid that Gogo will hide the truth from you, all the more as he is past-master at inventing excuses and talking himself out of trouble. It seems to me he would do better to transfer to land service, for he will never make a good sailor! It is very unpleasant for me to have to write you all this, but what can I do. I send you my best wishes for the New Year, and trust that you and the children are well.|$|E

On 21October, El Gusano de Luz published a [...] "detailed critique" [...] {{as part of an}} internet petition that attracted 11,000 signatories, 85% of whom self-identified as Venezuelan. Directed at the European broadcasters that financed and aired the film, the petition said in part, [...] "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is being presented as an author's film, as an objective journalistic research film, while it is really a very well plotted and accomplished propaganda operation, supported logistically by the Venezuelan government, with the aim of misleading unprepared spectators of countries <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the totality of events." [...] The petition submitted 18 specific points of contention with the film. Venezuelan private television soon aired two programs [...] "dissecting and denouncing" [...] the film, and similar newspaper articles followed.|$|E
500|$|The Indian Constituent Assembly was {{established}} on 9 December 1946, for drafting a Constitution when India became independent. The Constituent Assembly witnessed fierce debates {{on the language}} issue. The adoption of a National Language, the language in which the Constitution was to be written in and the language in which {{the proceedings of the}} Constituent Assembly were to be conducted were the main linguistic questions debated by the framers of the Constitution. On one side were members from the [...] "Hindi-speaking provinces" [...] like Algu Rai Sastri, R.V. Dhulekar, Balkrishna Sharma, Purushottam Das Tandon, (all from United Provinces), Babunath Gupta (Bihar), Hari Vinayak Pataskar (Bombay) and Ravi Shankar Shukla, Seth Govind Das (Central Provinces and Berar). They moved a large number of pro-Hindi amendments and argued for adopting Hindi as the sole National Language. On 10 December 1946, Dhulekar declared [...] "People <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> Hindustani have no right to stay in India.

500|$|Vincent Canby {{began his}} review {{by calling the}} film [...] "very {{beautiful}} and the first truly interesting American-made Western in years. It's also so full of violence--of an intensity that can hardly be supported by the story—that it's going to prompt {{a lot of people}} <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the real effect of movie violence (as I do not) to write automatic condemnations of it." [...] He said, [...] "Although the movie's conventional and poetic action sequences are extraordinarily good and its landscapes beautifully photographed ... it is most interesting in its almost jolly account of chaos, corruption, and defeat". Among the actors, he commented particularly on William Holden: [...] "After years of giving bored performances in boring movies, Holden comes back gallantly in The Wild Bunch. He looks older and tired, but he has style, both as a man and as a movie character who persists in doing what he's always done, not because he really wants the money but because there's simply nothing else to do." [...] Time also liked Holden's performance, describing it as his best since Stalag 17 (a 1953 film that earned Holden an Oscar); said Robert Ryan gave [...] "the screen performance of his career"; and concluded that [...] "The Wild Bunch contains faults and mistakes" [...] (such as flashbacks [...] "introduced with surprising clumsiness"), but [...] "its accomplishments are more than sufficient to confirm that Peckinpah, along with Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Penn, belongs with the best of the newer generation of American filmmakers." ...|$|E
