With home brew kegs, you can put whatever liquid you want inside the keg, pressurize it and dispense it with a kegerator. Different types of liquids require different alterations to the dispense system. Wine and cold brewed coffee use a CO2/Nitrogen blend to pressurize the kegs.

5000|$|However, the {{effectiveness}} of decanting is a topic of debate, with some wine experts such as oenologist Émile Peynaud claiming that the prolonged exposure to oxygen actually diffuses and dissipates more aroma compounds than it stimulates, {{in contrast to the}} effects of the smaller scale exposure and immediate release that swirling the wine in a drinker's glass has. [...] In addition {{it has been reported that}} the process of decanting over a period of a few hours does not have the effect of softening tannins. The softening of tannins occurs during the winemaking and oak aging when tannins go through a process of polymerization that can last days or weeks; decanting merely alters the perception of sulfites and other chemical compounds in the wine through oxidation, which can give some drinkers the sense of softer tannins in the <b>wine.</b> In <b>line</b> with the view that decanting can dissipate aromas, wine expert Kerin O'Keefe prefers to let the wine evolve slowly and naturally in the bottle, by uncorking it a few hours ahead, a practice suggested by wine producers such as Bartolo Mascarello and Franco Biondi Santi.|$|R

Similar samples collected from Concannon Vineyard in Livermore Valley, CA show similar variations as those from Napa Valley, CA. Grape berry and grape leaf waters are up to 59 per mil in 8 D and 18 per mil in 8180 more enriched than soil water. Grape leaf water was more responsive to pre-harvest precipitation, shifting 15 per mil in 8 D and 8. 1 per mil in 8180, than grape berries which showed a delayed shift of 13 per mil in 8 D and 4. 6 per mil in 8180. Yearly variations in isotopic values for wines produced in Napa Valley in the last 30 years range from 0 to 13 per mil in 8 D and 0. 1 to 4. 8 per mil in o 180. Variations average 6 per mil in oD and 1. 7 per mil in o 180 between each consecutive year.

The correlation with annual precipitation (0. 30) suggests that amount of rainfall has nominal affect on stable isotopic ratios of wine.

Electronic commerce may represent a competitive strategy to make enterprises of the agro-food sector more visible to consumers, if usability is adequately taken into account. The main barrier to the development of successful e-commerce business is represented by websites not meeting basic accessibility and usability features. To tackle this issue, heuristic evaluation and the gap analysis approach has been adopted. The parameters taken into account stemmed from World Wide Web Consortium recommendations. Website usability issues have been measured by a panel of consumers assessing a selected website each. Potential e-consumers simulated an online purchase, thereby allowing them to acquire insights on the importance and satisfaction on each of the usability issues taken into consideration. The success factors for ecommerce mainly involve efficiency of navigations (useful navigation tools or sequence of navigation), accuracy in content and supplied information. Consumers are more conduced to purchase by easy structure of websites than design and style. Additional information underlining the connection of producers to its territory enhances end-consumers’ feel in supply chain identification.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to propose a {{methodology}} for architectural generation, selection and reconfiguration of hardware/software (h w/sw) testable systems, {{as well as the}} sw tools that implement it. Object-oriented (O O) modelling techniques and Design for Testability (DFT) techniques, extended from the h w to the h w/sw domain, are used. Design reuse is taken into account through the inclusion in the architecture of non-re configurable objects. Graph partitioning techniques are used to generate a limited subset of cohesive, loosely coupled objects, among which as few loops as possible remain. Architectural valued characteristics reflect performance and testability issues. Quality metrics, quantifying these characteristics, are proposed, and decision criteria, to guide the design team in the selection of the target architecture, are introduced. A trade-off analysis is carried out, for several reconfiguration possibilities, using different DFT techniques, to guarantee that testability requirements are met. In such analysis, the additional resources and the performance degradation test functionality eventually introduces are taken into account. The methodology is implemented by two tools: (1) SysObj, developed in this work, which performs the automatic generation of system architectures and computes the quality metrics; (2) test-adder, developed {{in the context of a}} M. Sc. thesis, which automatically reconfigures an architecture, to introduce DFT. The usefulness of the methodology and supporting tools is assessed through two case studies.

If the methods of thought of any individual in this central body are not practical and positive, he will tend to drift out of it to some more congenial employment. He will almost necessarily have a strong imperative to duty quite apart from whatever theological opinions he may entertain, because if he has not such an inherent imperative, life will have very many more alluring prospects than this. His religious conclusions, whatever they may be, will be based upon some orderly theological system that must have honestly admitted and reconciled his scientific beliefs; the emotional and mystical elements in his religion will be subordinate or absent. Essentially he will be a moral man, certainly so far as to exercise self-restraint and live in an ordered way. Unless this is so, he will be unable to give his principal energies to thought and work--that is, he will not be a good typical engineer.

He will be a father of several children, I think, because his scientific mental basis will incline him to see the whole of life as a struggle to survive; he will recognize that a childless, sterile life, however pleasant, is essentially failure and perversion, and he will conceive his honour involved in the possession of offspring.|$|R
