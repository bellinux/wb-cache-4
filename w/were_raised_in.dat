5|$|Alexander Stepanov and Meng Lee {{presented}} the Standard Template Library to the C++ standards committee in March 1994. The library received preliminary approval, {{although a few}} issues <b>were</b> <b>raised.</b> <b>In</b> particular, Stepanov was requested to make the library containers independent of the underlying memory model, {{which led to the}} creation of allocators. Consequently, all of the STL container interfaces had to be rewritten to accept allocators.|$|E

In 2008, a Local Housing Allowance for people on low incomes or on benefits who were renting from private landlords was introduced.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the speech}} were {{published}} the next day by the radical Daily News (founded in 1846 by Charles Dickens), and questions <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the House of Commons, particularly by Sir Frederick Banbury, a Conservative MP and sponsor of a bill aimed at ending vivisection demonstrations. Bayliss demanded a public apology, and when by 12 May it had failed to materialize he issued a writ for libel.|$|E

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II led to {{expansion of the}} regiment, the 4th Battalion being re-raised in 1940; the 5th <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1941. An 11th (Territorial) Battalion had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Peshawar in 1939 for line of communication protection duties; the 6th Battalion <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> from this <b>in</b> 1941.|$|R
5|$|The stakes <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the {{conflict}} on 10 October, when the High Court declared valid the Act granting the territories two senators each. In a half-Senate election, most successful candidates {{would not take}} their places until 1 July 1976, but the territories' senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats, would assume their seats at once. This gave Labor an outside chance of controlling the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976.|$|E
5|$|A {{monument}} {{was raised}} in 790 although {{the name of the}} ruler responsible is not preserved. Two more <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 800 and three in 810. No monument was erected to commemorate the important Bak'tun-ending of 830 and it is probable that political authority had alreadly collapsed at this time. Important cities such as Oxpemul, Nadzcaan and La Muñeca that were Calakmul's vassals at one time now erected their own monuments, where before they had raised very few; some continued producing new monuments until as late as 889. This was a process that paralleled events at Tikal. However, there is strong evidence of an elite presence at the city continuing until AD 900, possibly even later.|$|E
5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 of them <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the province of Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan. The runestone tradition probably died out before 1100, and at the latest by 1125.|$|E
50|$|The Surrey Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1794, but disbanded in 1828. A Southwark Troop <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1831 {{and became}} a full Regiment in the same year. That too was disbanded in 1848.|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation, and the situation was so bad that questions <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimately}} {{the number of}} men that joined the units of the 2nd AIF from the Militia was in fact lower than anticipated, a large number of such personnel left to seek an opportunity to serve overseas. In this time the 61st Battalion lost many of its experienced senior officers and non-commissioned officers to the 2/25th and 2/33rd Battalions that <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Queensland, {{as well as to the}} Royal Australian Air Force. Of note was the loss of the battalion's pipe and drum band, which joined the 2/25th en masse. A 61st Battalion officer, Major Charles Withy, also went across with them serving initially as the second in command and then later as the 2/25th's commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Among the runestones of the Viking Age, 9.1–10% {{report that}} they <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> memory of people who went abroad, and the runestones that mention Greece {{constitute}} {{the largest group of}} them. In addition, there is a group of three or four runestones that commemorate men who died in southern Italy, and who were probably members of the Varangian Guard. The only group of stones comparable in number to the Greece runestones are those that mention England, followed by the c. 26 Ingvar runestones raised {{in the wake of the}} fateful Ingvar expedition to Persia.|$|E

5|$|As the Classic Maya {{collapse}} {{swept across}} the Maya region, city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements. At the important city of Calakmul, two stelae <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence. At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859. Stela11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal. The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are Toniná Monument101, which was erected in 909 to mark the k'atun ending that year, and Stela6 from Itzimté, dated to 910.|$|E
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it {{to the fact that it}} was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|By early 1570, the Ottoman {{preparations}} and {{the warnings}} {{sent by the}} Venetian bailo at Constantinople, Marco Antonio Barbaro, had convinced the Signoria that war was imminent. Reinforcements and money were sent post-haste to Crete and Cyprus. In March 1570, an Ottoman envoy was sent to Venice, bearing an ultimatum that demanded the immediate cession of Cyprus. Although some voices <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Venetian Signoria advocating the cession of the island in exchange for land in Dalmatia and further trading privileges, the hope of assistance from the other Christian states stiffened the Republic's resolve, and the ultimatum was categorically rejected.|$|E
5|$|Constitutional {{objections}} <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> House debates as {{to whether}} both houses of Congress could constitutionally authorize admission of territories, rather than states. Moreover, if the Republic of Texas, a nation in its own right, were admitted as a state, its territorial boundaries, property relations (including slave property), debts and public lands would require a Senate-ratified treaty. Democrats were particularly uneasy about burdening the United States with $10 million in Texas debt, resenting the deluge of speculators, who had bought Texas bonds cheap and now lobbied Congress for the Texas House bill. House Democrats, at an impasse, relinquished the legislative initiative to the southern Whigs.|$|E
5|$|Despite safety measures, {{incidents}} {{may happen}} during the Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse {{under the weight}} of the many visitors. During 2015 Hajj, a stampede resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others, according to the Saudi authorities. A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries, making it the most deadly such episode to date. Concerns <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj.
