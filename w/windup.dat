5|$|Addie Joss {{was born}} in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was {{involved}} in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life {{as a result of his}} father's death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team. He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed with the quality of play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching <b>windup,</b> which involved hiding the ball until the very last moment in his delivery.|$|E

This marked {{a change in the}} band's sound. Tip was produced by Arnold Lanni (Our Lady Peace). By then, they managed to tour alongside bands such as Creed and Fuel.|$|E
25|$|After the <b>windup</b> of John Roach & Sons {{and sale}} of assets to pay creditors, Roach's heirs found {{themselves}} still in possession of the Delaware River Works and the Morgan Iron Works, and they continued to build ships at the Delaware Works under the management of Roach's eldest surviving son John Baker Roach until the latter's death in 1908. In all, John Roach and his heirs built a total of 179 ships between 1871 and 1908. After the retirement of the Roach family from the business, railroad heir W. Averell Harriman acquired the Chester shipyard, renamed it the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, {{and used it to}} build merchant ships during World War I.|$|E

25|$|Brock {{remained}} {{best known}} for base-stealing and starting Cardinals rallies. He {{was said to have}} disdained Maury Wills' method of base-stealing, instead shortening his leads and going hard. He was also an early student of game films. He used an 8mm movie camera from the dugout to film opposing pitchers and study their <b>windups</b> and pickoff moves to detect weaknesses he could exploit.|$|R

Jaya Chandra also feels remorse and all of them go to bring back Shanta home, at the same time Sangliyana kidnaps her. Finally, Vijay destroys Sangliyana, in the attack Jaya Chandra is injured and he gives the sectarian mark to Shanta with his blood. Rajeswari Devi also realizes, says sorry to everyone and movie ends with the marriage of Vijay & Nirmala Devi.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, Hamaguchi {{scored the}} anime series Oh! My Goddess and contributed {{arrangements}} {{to the third}} Symphonic Game Music Concert. The same year, Hamaguchi decided to enroll at the Berklee College of Music in a one-year jazz composition course to further his opportunities as an anime composer. He has since scored , Big <b>Windup!,</b> Ah! My Goddess: Fighting Wings, and Rosario + Vampire. He orchestrated the late composer Ingo Nugel and his brother Henning Nugel's arrangements from The Settlers II 10th Anniversary for performance at the fifth Symphonic Game Music Concert in August 2007. In September 2010, he arranged a suite containing the music from Starwing and Lylat Wars for the Symphonic Legends concert in Cologne.|$|E
25|$|A.C. Fiorentina S.p.A. {{was unable}} to {{register}} for 2002–03 Serie B due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to Article 52 of N.O.I.F., while the old company was liquidated. At that time the club was heavily relying on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increased the cost by the increase in amortisation of player contracts (an intangible assets). For example, Marco Rossi joined Fiorentina for 17billion lire in 2000, {{but at the same}} time Lorenzo Collacchioni moved to Salernitana for 1billion lire, meaning the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1billion lire to be amortised in 5-years. In 1999, Emiliano Bigica also swapped with Giuseppe Taglialatela, which the latter was valued for 10billion lire. The operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 Italian lire (minus €58,499,835). It was only boosted by the sales of Francesco Toldo and Rui Costa in June 2001 (a profit of 134.883billion lire; €69.661million). However, it was alleged they were to transfer to Parma for a reported 140 million lire. The two players eventually joined Inter Milan and A.C. Milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. Failing to have financial support from the owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori, the club was forced to <b>windup</b> due to its huge imbalance in operating income.|$|E
500|$|When Kendrick {{was first}} {{promoted}} to the major leagues, he relied almost exclusively on a sinker, but as he became more predictable, he had to adjust by adding pitches, including the changeup, cutter, and curveball that now comprise his repertoire. He throws from a slightly deceptive, deliberate <b>windup,</b> and his sinker ranges anywhere from [...] to [...] He lacks requisite confidence in his secondary pitches, however, which contributes to batters being able to consistently make solid contact against him.|$|E

With a small team she returned home and coordinated a one-day experiential event for Morales to coincide with the last day of Justin’s concert date in London. The success of the ‘Timberlake Promotional Dance Workshop’ opened the flood gates as she became known as the ‘young girl who builds brands’. Her following contracts included Eminem’s 8 Mile After Party, GenArt Style Awards, Aspirations Exhibition, London Fashion Week, Nike Midnight Madness, Blackberry UK Launch, Trey Songz UK Concert, and Rio Ferdinand’s Rio’s World Up <b>Windups</b> TV show (broadcast on ITV), to name a few.|$|R
5000|$|As {{disclosed}} in a blog on Submersed' Myspace, the band parted ways and was dropped from Wind Up Records. In the blog entry written by vocalist Donald Carpenter, {{he explained the}} breakup:I know that {{all of you are}} wondering, what happened to Submersed? Well, the answers is... A lot.. This business and struggle to make it took its toll on the members... Two weeks before [...] "Price of Fame" [...] was slated for release, Tj, Kelan and Justin decided to move on with their lives and left SubmerseD. Garrett and I believing in [...] "Price of Fame" [...] made the choice to press on and see what could happen. Well, nothing happened... the single never had a chance... mind bottling... The fact is, is that a majority of our fanbase is unaccounted for due to Burning, making it impossible for the labels to understand just how many people really support us out there... When {{it comes down to it}} now, SubmerseD no longer has a place on <b>Windup's</b> roster and will be dropped shortly... I was trying to wait until things were a little more official before an announcement but you guys and gals are smart and I felt you deserved an explanation now rather than later.On November 24, 2008 the band posted a blog on their MySpace that simply said [...] "SUBMERSED WILL BE BACK!" [...] No other details have been disclosed.|$|R
500|$|Within a month Benson was injured, however, and Feldman {{took his}} place in the {{rotation}} on April 25. [...] "I'm excited", said Feldman. [...] "I love starting." [...] At the suggestion of pitching coach Mike Maddux, he changed his <b>windup</b> to a full windmill. He remained in the rotation thereafter. [...] In early May, Washington noted: [...] "He has real life on his fastball, his slider is harder than it has been, his breaking ball is much crisper, and he's getting a good feel for his changeup. He's got four pitches he can throw over the plate." ...|$|E
500|$|This [...] "70/30 Law" [...] was {{not only}} applied to the visual designs for the film, {{but also for the}} sound effects and music. Sound {{designer}} Dane Davis mentioned that he and his team [...] "scoured hobby shops and junk stores for antique <b>windup</b> toys and old spinning mechanisms" [...] in order to create the sound effects for John Silver to [...] "avoid sounding slick or sci-fi". The team did some experimentation with the sound used in dialogues, especially with the robot B.E.N., but opted to keep Short's natural voice because everything they tried [...] "affected his comedy", and [...] "the {{last thing you want to}} do in a story like this is affect performances".|$|E
500|$|Joss's {{repertoire}} {{included a}} fastball, a [...] "slow ball" [...] (today {{known as a}} changeup), and an [...] "extremely effective" [...] curve. Baseball historians Rob Neyer and Bill James ranked Joss' fastball third (1900–1904) and sixth (1905–1909) in the major leagues. George Moriarty explained that Joss had only one curveball because [...] "he believed that with a few well mastered deliveries he could acquire great control and success with less strain on his arm." [...] In an era filled with spitball pitchers, Joss achieved his success without ever altering the baseball. Joss threw with a corkscrew <b>windup</b> motion, described as [...] "an exaggerated pinwheel motion." [...] Shortstop Roger Peckinpaugh described his windup: [...] "He would turn his back toward the batter as he wound up, hiding the ball all the while, and then whip around and fire it in." ...|$|E
500|$|Kershaw's {{pitching}} style {{relies on}} deception, movement and changes of velocity. He keeps the ball hidden {{so that it}} is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent overhand delivery on all of his pitches, he also consistently lands low on the strikezone below the catcher's knees, causing batters to chase the ball even when the ball is clearly going to hit the dirt. Out of the <b>windup,</b> Kershaw lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate. The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a [...] "kickstand move" [...] drawing comparison with one setting a kickstand on a bicycle. Out of the stretch, he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him. He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up, Roger Clemens.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Day was {{recognized}} as the ace of the recently relocated Newark Eagles pitching staff, bringing [...] "a lot of intangibles to his game—his tenacity in going after hitters, his speed and quickness in fielding the ball, and his dedication to the game", as Day's teammate of five years Max Manning recalled. His best season in the Negro leagues came in 1937, when Day was backed by the vaunted [...] "million-dollar infield" [...] consisting of Ray Dandridge, Willie Wells, Dick Seay, and Mule Suttles. Though just 5-foot-9 inches, Day delivered a 90–95 mph fastball. The pitch was deceptively fast because Day delivered with no <b>windup,</b> and threw the competition off-balance with his pinpoint accurate curveball. Day posted a perfect 13–0 season, coupled by a 3.02 earned run average (ERA), [...]320 batting average, and eight home runs. When he was not active on the mound, Day {{at one point or}} another played at every position, with the exception of catcher, and was a dangerous bat in the line-up, excelling {{to such an extent that}} Day drew comparisons to Babe Ruth's legendary batting talent. Some writers like Daniel Nathan and Thomas Kern even argue that Day should have been a full-time outfielder to have his bat in the line-up every game.|$|E
500|$|The live {{performance}} for [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as part of}} 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, where it served as the closing song, was taped and premiered online on November 16, 2011. It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} <b>windup</b> about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. I searched all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it to all of you guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "approach" [...] or [...] "3/4 swing" [...] {{is used in}} medium- {{and long-distance}} {{situations}} where an exact distance and good accuracy is preferable to maximum possible distance, such as to place {{the ball on the}} green or [...] "lay up" [...] in front of a hazard. The <b>windup</b> or [...] "backswing" [...] of such a shot typically ends up with the shaft of the club pointing straight upwards or slightly towards the player.|$|E
2500|$|Wood's awful start, {{the fact}} that he'd {{continued}} to pitch with a full <b>windup</b> instead of going into the stretch position with Giants [...] on base, and the sloppy play of the Red Sox led to ugly rumors. [...] Boston fans and respected sportswriter Tim Murnane each believed that the Boston players, angry that they didn't get a cut from the gate receipts for Game2 and further alienated by O'Brien's Game6 start, bet on the Giants to make their losses good. [...] Whatever went down, the Series was tied three games apiece, setting up a decisive Game8 for the championship.|$|E
2500|$|Fernando Valenzuela Anguamea ( [...] ; born November 1, 1960) is a Mexican former Major League Baseball (MLB) {{pitcher who}} played {{seventeen}} seasons, from 1980 to 1997, for six teams, primarily the Los Angeles Dodgers. [...] He batted and threw left-handed. [...] He has a career won-loss record of 173–153 and a 3.54 {{earned run average}} (ERA). [...] Valenzuela was notable for his unorthodox <b>windup</b> and for being one of {{a small number of}} pitchers who threw a screwball regularly. [...] Never a particularly hard thrower, the Dodgers felt he needed another pitch; he was taught the screwball in 1979 by teammate Bobby Castillo.|$|E
2500|$|Martínez {{maintains}} fastball fleetness {{from both}} the <b>windup</b> and stretch.

2500|$|On {{the days}} {{following}} 9 September, both nations' premiere formations were routed in unequal battles.

The Division divided itself into two prongs, was forced back by the Pakistani 6th Armoured Division at Chawinda {{and was forced to}} withdraw after suffering heavy losses of nearly 100 tanks. The Pakistanis followed up their success by launching Operation <b>Windup,</b> which forced the Indians back farther.

2500|$|Central {{sensitization}} of the {{dorsal horn}} neurons that is evoked from C fiber activity {{is responsible for}} temporal summation of [...] "second pain" [...] (TSSP). This event is called ‘windup’ and relies on a frequency greater or equal to 0.33Hz of the stimulus. <b>Windup</b> is associated with chronic pain and central sensitization. This minimum frequency was determined experimentally by comparing healthy patient fMRI’s when subjected to varying frequencies of heat pulses. The fMRI maps show common areas activated by the TSSP responses which include contralateral thalamus (THAL), S1, bilateral S2, anterior and posterior insula (INS), mid-anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and supplemental motor areas (SMA). TSSP events are also associated with {{other regions of the}} brain that process functions such as somatosensory processing, pain perception and modulation, cognition, pre-motor activity in the cortex.|$|E
2500|$|The role {{reversal}} between Travolta and Cage was {{a subject of}} praise, as were the stylized, violent action sequences. Critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film {{three out of four}} and remarked that, [...] "Here, using big movie stars and asking them to play each other, Woo and his writers find a terrific counterpoint to the action scenes: All through the movie, you find yourself reinterpreting every scene as you realize the [...] "other" [...] character is [...] "really" [...] playing it." [...] Rolling Stones Peter Travers said of the film, [...] "You may not buy the premise or the <b>windup,</b> but with Travolta and Cage taking comic and psychic measures of their characters and their own careers, there is no resisting Face/Off. This you gotta see." [...] Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "isn't just a thrill ride, it's a rocket into the thrilling past, when directors could scare you with how much emotion they packed into a movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} September 1974, the Royals {{announced}} that Boros was being elevated to the major league club to replace Charley Lau on the team's coaching staff for the 1975 season. He was the Royals third base coach in 1975 under manager Whitey Herzog. From 1976 to 1979, he was the Royal's first base coach and was [...] "credited with helping the Royals develop an aggressive baserunning style." [...] While Boros was in Kansas City, he began to attract media attention for his [...] "scientific approach" [...] to baseball. In July 1977, the UPI published a feature story about Boros in which it observed:"Boros began putting a book together on all the pitchers and catchers in the American League last year, noting their strengths and weaknesses and any tipoffs that might give Royal runners an edge on the basepaths. His observations were written into a small 25-cent notepad along with a flock of stopwatch readings that represent {{the time it takes}} a pitcher to throw the ball to home plate out of both the stretch and <b>windup,</b> and how long it takes a catcher to peg the ball to second and third base." ...|$|E
