5|$|In {{the process}} of {{destroying}} NESTS, he becomes allied with Maxima, a cyborg whose best friend was killed by NESTS agents and is seeking to avenge the death. While Maxima sees K' as a friend and his partner, K' is stoic and cynical. He also meets Whip, who it is revealed is a clone of his sister, Seirah. Even though Whip reveals her identity to K', he ignores this, saying he <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> he pleases. Although he hates The King of Fighters tournaments, he commonly enters them, being asked by someone, or to find NESTS. The participants often criticize him for being antisocial. After destroying NESTS, K' starts recovering his memories, but he suspects he could forget all the people he has met. He also becomes determined to prove he is better than Kyo, instead of being only a clone.|$|E

However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> they can to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E

25|$|Chimène {{is alone}} in {{a room in the}} palace and is torn apart by {{conflicting}} emotions: love, desire for revenge and honour. But she vows to avenge her father (Scene 1). The king enters and tries to console Chimène, treating her as his own daughter: he declares how fond he was of her dead father, but also reveals the respect in which everyone holds Rodrigue, the one man capable of leading the fight against the Moors. Nevertheless, the king promises to capture and punish her father's killer (Scene 2). Left alone with her maids, Chimène reveals her undying love for Rodrigue. She adored him before the fatal duel, and now that fate has divided them and all hope is dead, their love still remains intact. Nevertheless, she says she <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> honour demands, and the more she loves Rodrigue, the more she will seek to punish him (Scene 3). The next scene is taken up by a dramatic duet between Chimène and Rodrigue, who has just arrived: he begs her to kill him, but she fails to follow through with her vow of revenge, and the two are left in despair (Scene 4). Alone again, Rodrigue contemplates death (Scene 5), until he is met by his father and his followers, and asked to march against the army of the Moors which has just laid siege to the city. If he is to die, he should do so nobly for his king and country. Encouraged by his father's words, Rodrigue agrees to fight and the first act ends with a martial chorus (Scene 6).|$|E
500|$|The first commandment, {{according}} to Church teaching, [...] "means that [...] must worship and adore God alone because God is alone." [...] The Catechism explains that this prohibits idolatry, providing examples of forbidden {{practices such as}} the worship of any creature, and of demons... power, pleasure, race, ancestors, the state [...] money. Augustine interpreted this commandment as [...] "Love God and then do what you will". Explaining this sentiment, Kreeft states that all sin [...] "serves some other god, obeys another commander: the world or the flesh or the devil", if God truly be loved then one <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> God wills.|$|E
500|$|During the 1892 campaign, Tillman {{called for}} the defeat in the Democratic primary for the {{legislature}} {{of most of the}} men elected as his supporters, urging the selection of more loyal men. Tillman urged the voters, [...] "turn out this cattle, these driftwood legislators, and send me a legislature that <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I say, and I'll show you reform." [...] South Carolinians dutifully voted out their representatives as Tillman requested. Although no primary for governor was permitted, the delegates to the nominating convention were elected by the Democratic voters, and Tillman won an overwhelming victory over Sheppard, who took only four of thirty-five counties. The convention was mostly Tillmanite, and gave the governor an easy triumph. The Conservatives had agreed not to bolt the party, and Tillman won uncontested re-election.|$|E

500|$|... "Nice Is Different Than Good" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. It marked the debut of Drea de Matteo as Angie Bolen, the matriarch of an Italian family. While brainstorming ideas for the sixth season, the Desperate Housewives writing staff decided to introduce an Italian New Yorker housewife, as she would be unlike the other title characters. When she was offered the role of Angie, de Matteo was {{best known for her}} Emmy Award-winning performance as Adriana La Cerva on The Sopranos, an HBO drama series about the Italian Mafia. She accepted the offer without knowing the character's name or storyline. Cherry described the Angie character as [...] "a very loving but tough Italian woman who comes [...] with her husband and her kid... <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> she has to to protect her family." [...] Jeffrey Nordling and Beau Mirchoff made their series debuts in this episode as well, appearing as Nick, Angie's landscaper husband, and Danny, their [...] "tightly-wound" [...] son, respectively. Maiara Walsh also joined the cast as a series regular, having made her debut as Ana Solis in a guest starring capacity during season five.|$|E
500|$|Before the character's debut, de Matteo {{described}} Angie as [...] "brassy" [...] and a [...] "liberal New Yorker," [...] {{which she}} said contrasts with the more conservative nature of the other characters. She commented that Angie [...] "is less of a housewife {{than the rest of}} them. She's a real broad." [...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> she has to protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing what they need to survive, no matter what the price." [...] Within the series, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) describes Angie as blunt and tactless.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2015, the EPB issued another statement, {{this time}} warning that [...] "they <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> is necessary" [...] {{according}} to the moment's circumstances and that [...] "the people should not pay a debt that {{does not belong to}} the people". Thorough its spokesman, the group anticipated that [...] " [...] ineptitude and impotency" [...] the government would exploit the crisis to privatize profits and socialize losses, citing the privatization of the turnpike system, Luis Munoz Marin Airport, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company and the Teodoro Moscoso Bridge as previous examples of this tendency. The EBP expressed dissatisfaction in what they perceived as [...] "an environment of indifference" [...] within sectors of local society that [...] "still expect magic solutions" [...] from those responsible for the crisis, which serves as a hindrance to the militant action that they pursue. Commander Guasábara then offers an alliance that oversees previous differences. In asking the rhetoric question [...] "What would you do for yourself, your children and your country?" [...] the Macheteros urged the public to hold an investigation and [...] "judge those responsible" [...] for what they consider an [...] "irresponsible and unnecessary debt [...] the corrupt administrations that we have tolerated for 50 years". The EPB concluded this press release by urging the public to [...] "take the streets and manifest their anger {{in the way that they}} prefer", but not before stating that the time for marches was gone and that it is [...] "time to take action".|$|E

500|$|According to Metcalfe, during Mercedes' {{hospitalisation}} and recuperation she [...] "starts {{putting it}} on to get sympathy. She's determined to get what she wants". Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee is being a bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E

[...] The press release also indicated that Sarah Lawrence [...] "plans not to participate in the peer reputational survey or data collection for U.S. News and World Report’s rankings" [...] as, according to Myers, [...] "by submitting data and the peer reputation survey we have tacitly been endorsing these rankings [...] all the information we have provided to U.S. News in the past will be available to the public through other channels.” ...|$|E

Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield records the last words heard from him: [...] "God who placed me here <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> He pleases with me hereafter and He knows best what to do". He died on 12 December 1751, aged 79, his second wife having predeceased him by one year.

Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara, that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation. Johnson said, [...] "Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we ought to do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly.

Auftragstaktik led to the stereotyping of decisions at the expense of flexibility to respond to the unexpected, something increasingly likely after first contact with the opponent. Moltke doubted that the French would conform to Schlieffen's more optimistic assumptions. In May 1914 he had said [...] "I <b>will</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> I can. We are not superior to the French."

2500|$|It {{was backed}} by [...] "One of the Survivors" [...] for its UK release, where {{it came out in}} June; for its August release in the US, [...] "Sweet Lady Genevieve" [...] was substituted. The single was given little {{promotion}} {{on either side of the}} Atlantic, and failed to chart, but was well received by the American rock press. Alan Betrock of Rock Marketplace wrote: [...] "The new Kinks record has to bring smiles onto a lot of faces. ...
