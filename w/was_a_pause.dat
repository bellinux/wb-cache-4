5|$|After 1898, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in admitting new members. Four were {{admitted}} between 1906 and 1908, followed {{by only one}} in the 1915, three in 1924, and two in 1935. In 1940 the average member age was 69.|$|E
5|$|After Henry's death there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the {{conflict}} with France, during which {{many of the new}} fortifications were alllowed to deteriorate. There was little money available for repairs and the garrisons were reduced in size. East Cowes was abandoned around 1547 and fell into ruin, while the bulwarks along the Downs were defaced and their guns removed; they were formally removed from service in 1550. In 1552 the Essex fortifications were decommissioned, and several were subsequently pulled down. The expense of maintaining the fortifications in Hull led the Crown to agree a deal with the town authorities to take over management of them. Milton and Higham were demolished between 1557 and 1558. Mersea Fort was temporarily decommissioned, before being brought back into active service.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the advance}} to the Hongorai, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> of about a week as the Australians {{had to wait for}} roads to be {{improved}} and supplies to be brought up, before attempting to cross the Hongorai en masse. This allowed Savige to re-evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the Hari and Mivo Rivers. As they waited for the advance to resume, the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and {{there were a couple of}} significant engagements during this time. As a part of these, the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the Hongorai and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as Egan's Ridge, which, due to its location, commanded the main Australian axis of advance.|$|E

5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> of {{uncertain}} length (eyewitness estimates {{ranged from}} several seconds to two minutes), {{after which the}} soldiers fired into the crowd. Rather than a disciplined volley (Preston gave no orders to fire), a ragged series of shots was fired, which hit eleven men. Three Americans—ropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucks—died instantly. Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen, {{was struck by a}} ricocheting musket ball {{at the back of the}} crowd, and died a few hours later, in the early morning of the next day. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later. Christopher Monk, another apprentice, was one of those seriously wounded in the attack. Although he recovered to some extent, he was crippled and eventually died in 1780, purportedly due to the injuries he had sustained in the attack a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|The main blitz, {{a series}} of {{sustained}} nighttime raids, started on 23 November 1940. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> until 30 November, when the resumption of raids destroyed repairs that had made during the lull. The blitz continued on 1 December, but these raids were sporadic and smaller. A total of 137 people died {{during the period of}} the Blitz, of which 96 were lost to direct hits on public air raid shelters.|$|E
25|$|By 28 July, GM 16 from Muang Soui encamped on the {{mountain}} {{just east of the}} Route 7/13 intersection. GM 11 was only a hill away to the north. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> to coordinate action between the two columns. The following day, three ADC companies of irregulars led by CIA case officer Tony Poe were heli-lifted into Sala Phou Khoun by Air America. On impulse, Poe ignored CIA restrictions on engaging in combat, and led his troops in the unauthorized assault. At 2100 hours, the three companies of guerrillas occupied the empty intersection. GM 11 and GM 16 did not move in until the following day.|$|E
50|$|During declamation, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> between stanzas, {{as well as}} <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> {{between the}} fourth and fifth lines of each ten-line stanza. This is {{reflected}} {{in the structure of the}} poems as well: a transcription of a décima will invariably have a period or a semicolon at the end of the fourth line. Some older decimeros add <b>an</b> additional <b>pause</b> between the eighth and ninth line of each ten-line stanza.|$|R

25|$|As a young adult, Bonciu {{obtained}} {{his main}} income from trading in umbrellas and curtains. He made his literary debut in 1912, when he published in Bucharest's theatrical magazines Rampa and Cortina. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in activity {{during most of}} World War I, when Romania fought against Germany and the other Central Powers—he was possibly in enemy territory, but, judging by references in his novels, he may also have seen action in the Romanian Land Forces. One other story places Bonciu in Vienna during much of 1917. According to this account, the expatriate Romanian salesman met and closely befriended the Hungarian poet-activist Endre Ady.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{which later}} {{became known as}} the Tower of London was begun by William the Conqueror in 1066. It began as a timber {{fortification}} enclosed by a palisade. In the next decade work began on the White Tower, the great stone keep that still dominates the castle today. The precise date of the White Tower's foundation is unknown, and it is also uncertain how long building took. It is traditionally held that construction began in 1078. This is because the Textus Roffensis records that Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, oversaw the building work under instruction from William the Conqueror. Dendrochronological evidence suggests construction of the White Tower began in 1075–1079. The archaeology of the standing building suggests there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in construction between 1080 and 1090–1093, although it is unknown why. Gundulf did more than just oversee work and was a skilled architect. Rochester's castle and cathedral were rebuilt under his auspices. As the main castle in England's capital, the Tower of London was an important royal building. The keep built by Gundulf bears testament to this as {{it was one of the}} largest in Christendom.|$|E

"The Convention" [...] was {{the fourth}} episode of the series written by the writing team of Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, and the third episode of the series {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. This episode originally had a scene with Angela and Dwight in the office kitchen. Producer Greg Daniels stated: [...] "They had a couple lines, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> and then Angela said, 'I'm late', turned around, and left." [...] This would imply that she may be pregnant. The scene was cut because Daniels ultimately concluded, [...] "It was a big move, but we had it in a show that {{had a lot of}} other big moves. ... You don't introduce a C plot line of an illicit office romance {{and then all of a}} sudden have one of the characters get knocked up!" [...] Executive producer and show runner Greg Daniels had hoped to get Mackenzie Crook, Martin Freeman, and Lucy Davis from the original British Office series to appear in the episode as their respective characters (Gareth Keenan, Tim Canterbury, and Dawn Tinsley) but was unsuccessful due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E

Sur dynasty rule lasted till 1555 AD when Humayun regained his kingdom by defeating Sikander Suri, the last ruler of the dynasty. During the Mughal period, in later years, while building the Red Fort and Shahjahanbad, several Mughal rulers including Emperor Shahjahan who is credited with completing Shahjahanabad in 1639 AD had camped at this fort. It is said that Humayun had camped at this fort for three days before launching his successful attack for recapturing Delhi.|$|E

2500|$|The USS President was {{an unusually}} fast frigate and by noon had gained on Belvidera, now only some {{two and a}} half miles distant, {{approximately}} 75 miles south-west of Nantucket island. While President was closing with Belvidera Captain Byron began clearing the decks and preparing for action and made ready his stern guns. By 4:30 the wind had relaxed some but Belvidera was now close enough to be engaged. Seizing this first and tenuous possibility, President's forecastle bow chasers fired the first shot of the war, by Rodgers himself, with two more almost immediately following. All three shots struck Belvidera at her stern, striking the rudder assembly and captain's quarters, killing or wounding nine men. [...] With only a few more shots needed to disable the British vessel President fired again, but the tide of battle turned when one of its guns burst, killing 16 men, wounding others, including Rodgers, who was violently thrown back with his leg broken from the impact. [...] There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> of panic about the entire ship, as now every gun was suspected. Byron seized the opportunity and fired his stern chasers, killing yet another six men.
