The programme’s main focus was to provide answers {{to the question of}} the causes of dioxins and furans formation in the plant and to look for ways to reduce dioxin and furan emissions, including waste management measures and technical measures taken inside the plants. The investigations confirmed the finding that a major proportion of the dioxin and furan emissions is due to de novo synthesis. Two areas have to be mentioned here, the cooling zone behind the combustion chamber and the dust removal system. Significant differences in dioxin and furan concentration levels were ascertained between variations of operating parameters, e. g. much air, little air, extremely unfavourable operating conditions (i. e. start-up and shut-down without auxiliary burners) and the normal operating conditions specific to a plant. To comply the limit value of 0. 1 ng I-TE m- 3 it is necessary that conventional thermal treatment plants take additional measures to remove dioxins and furans from the flue gas.

This paper focuses on logistic determinants in a MWMS, taking into account existing legal requirements, organizational factors and economic aspects (on the example of Poland). Problems associated with effective logistics are essential for the quality and safety of a MWMS and these issues seem to be still undervalued. In Poland, there is approximately 40 thousand waste generators and each year they produce on average 45 thousand tons of medical waste, of which more than 90 % is classified as infectious. The biggest flow comes from hospitals and large health care units; other sources are private medical practices, research units, hospices and pharmacies. All units generating medical waste must comply with strict requirements for the collection, storage and disposal, {{particularly with regard to}} infectious waste.

We show that waste generation in developed countries goes in parallel with the trends of industrial production and that several regions are showing a declining trend which may be interpreted in terms of “peaking” just as it is often done for the production of fossil fuels. Therefore, the “waste problem” in terms of increasing amounts of waste to be processed and disposed may not be so urgent as it is commonly perceived...|$|R

This decision is complex, because many factors {{must be taken into account}} at the field and farm scales, including increasingly constraining environmental regulations. To evaluate the environmental impact of waste allocation strategies, these strategies have to be translated into consistent decisions. The objective of the current study was to reproduce the decisions made by farmers, in a wide range of contexts. For this purpose, a linear programming model that could help in generating yearly waste allocations was developed. The model, called Fumigene, takes into account the farmer's preferences and environmental, agronomic and feasibility constraints. It was applied on two case farms and the Simulated waste allocations were compared to those chosen by the farmers over periods of 3 and 4 years, respectively. The evaluation showed that the waste allocations generated by the model were consistent with the strategies of the farmers. Fumigene was then used in investigating the impact of taking into account the phosphorus (P) fertilization constraints instead of only the nitrogen constraints. In the case studied, balancing P fertilization over 5 years led to small changes in <b>waste</b> allocation. <b>Balancing</b> P fertilization every year caused bigger changes and led to export of a part of the wastes. In a general way, Fumigene can be coupled with environmental evaluation tools to compare the impacts of different waste allocation strategies...|$|R

One of the obstacles of a manual assembly line nowadays is an awkward line design with over manpower, a lot of <b>wastes,</b> and low <b>balance</b> efficiency. As a result, the production line may not satisfy customer demand and ends up with low production line efficiency. This is due to the fact that this type of production line is operated by human and the customer demand or requirements are frequently fluctuated. Human workers are prone to make mistakes, inefficient, and unorganized. Thus, the major causes of production line down time are discussed with suggestion of remedy actions to improve the productivity. In addition, calculation of line balancing is demonstrated.

40|$|Uncontrolled {{growth of}} the urban {{population}} in developing countries {{in recent years has}} made solid waste management an important issue. Very often, a substantial amount of total expenditures is spent on the collection of solid waste by city authorities. Optimization of the routing system for collection and transport of solid waste thus constitutes an important component of an effective solid waste management system. This paper describes an attempt to design and develop an appropriate storage, collection and disposal plan for the Asansol Municipality Corporation (AMC) of West Bengal State (India). A GIS optimal routing model is proposed to determine the minimum cost/distance efficient collection paths for transporting the solid wastes to the landfill. The model uses information on population density, waste generation capacity, road network and the types of road, storage bins and collection vehicles, etc. The proposed model {{can be used as a}} decision support tool by municipal authorities for efficient management of the daily operations for transporting solid <b>wastes,</b> load <b>balancing</b> within vehicles, managing fuel consumption and generating work schedules for the workers and vehicles. The total cost of the proposed collection systems is estimated to be around 80 million rupees for the fixed cost of storage bins, collection vehicles and a sanitary landfill and around 8. 4 million rupees for the annual operating cost of crews, vehicles and landfill maintenance. A substantial amount (25 million rupees/yr) is currently being spent by AMC on waste collection alone without any proper storage/collection system and sanitary landfill.

MFA allows the calculation of the amount and composition of <b>wastes</b> by <b>balancing</b> the process of waste generation {{and the process of}} waste treatment.

The industrial waste management system in Thailand is still lacking comprehensive data on industrial waste generation and flow. Therefore, MFA can be used to determine inputs-outputs of the waste treatment processes. This study estimated the annual amount of the total industrial waste generation in Thailand from 1999 through 2004. It calculated industrial waste flows and employed MFA to illustrate the flows of industrial waste from waste generators to waste disposers. Using the industrial waste flow was effective in analyzing the waste management system in Thailand.

We found that the subducting Hikurangi Plateau carries about 2 km of sediments above a 2 km mixed layer of volcaniclastics, limestone, and chert. The upper plateau crust is characterized by Vp = 4. 9 – 6. 7 km/s overlying the lower crust with Vp > 7. 1 km/s. Gravity modeling yields a plateau thickness around 10 km. The reactivated Raukumara fore‐arc basin is > 10 km deep, deposited on 5 – 10 km thick Australian crust. The fore‐arc mantle of Vp > 8 km/s appears unaffected by subduction hydration processes.

The annual C input from the shrimp farm exceeded carbon metabolism in creek water and sediments, indicating high sedimentation and burial of excess organic material in {{the upper reaches of}} the effluent creek. The rate of natural N flow was small compared with the rate of N supply from pond effluent. Ammonium uptake in creek water and sediment denitrification each accounted for less than 10 % of the annual effluent N supply. Immediately downstream from the farm discharge point, mineralisation and release of dissolved inorganic and organic N from the sediments were not greatly enhanced compared to the control creek, despite 25 % of the annual N supply and 10 % of the annual C supply depositing in proximity to the discharge point. Further downstream, rapid bacterial growth and high rates of primary production were controlled by very high micro-zooplankton grazing rates. The remaining nutrients were exported from the upper reaches to the seaward end of the effluent creek via tidal flushing. On an annual basis, {{the upper reaches of the}} creek appeared to mineralise only a small fraction of the nutrients derived from the shrimp farm wastes. However, discharge of pond waste C and N during shrimp harvest periods did not cause eutrophication further downstream, probably due to a combination of physical mechanisms (intensive tidal flushing) and biological nutrient transformations by pelagic microbes and their subsequent grazing by micro-zooplankton and fish.

Furthermore, formaldehyde was found to be toxic to acetoclastic methanogenesis in a dual character. Formaldehyde toxicity was partly reversible because once the formaldehyde concentration was extremely low or virtually removed from the system, the methane production rate was partially recovered. Because the degree of this recovery was not complete, we conclude that formaldehyde toxicity was partly irreversible as well. The irreversible toxicity likely can be attributed to biomass formaldehyde-related decay. Independent of the mode of formaldehyde addition (i. e., slug or continuous), the irreversible toxicity was dependent on the total amount of formaldehyde added to the system.

The foliar diagnostic accuracy of reached 93 % using isometric log ratios and knn classification, generating reliable foliar nutrient and concentration ranges at high yield level. The plant mined the soil K reserves without any significant effect on fruit yield and foliar nutrient balances involving K. High guava productivity {{can be reached at}} lower soil test K and P values than thought before. Parsimonious dosage of fresh guava waste should be supplemented with mineral K fertilizers to recycle guava waste sustainably in guava agroecosystems. Brazilian growers can benefit from this research by lowering soil test P and K threshold values to avoid over-fertilization and using fresh guava waste supplemented with mineral fertilizers, especially K. Because yield was negatively correlated with fruit acidity and Brix index, balanced plant nutrition and fertilization diagnosis will have to consider not only fruit yield targets but also fruit quality to meet requirements for guava processing...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{an innovative}} system used for aerobic biostabilisation and biological drying of solid municipal waste. A mechanical–biological process (MBT) of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) treatment were carried out and monitored in 5 bioreactors. A two-stage biological treatment process {{has been used in}} the investigation. In the first step an undersize fraction was subjected to the biological stabilisation for a period of 14 days as a result of which there was a decrease of loss on ignition, but not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of MBT technology. In the second stage of a biological treatment has been applied 7 -days intensive bio-drying of MSW using sustained high temperatures in bioreactor. The article presents the results of the chemical composition analysis of the undersize fraction and waste after biological drying, and also the results of temperature changes, pH ratio, loss on ignition, moisture content, combustible and volatile matter content, heat of combustion and calorific value of <b>wastes.</b> The mass <b>balance</b> of the MBT of MSW with using the innovative aeration system showed that only 14. 5 % of waste need to be landfilled, 61. 5 % could be used for thermal treatment, and nearly 19 % being lost in the process as CO 2 and H 2 O...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of evapotranspiration {{is essential for}} understanding {{the dynamics of the}} atmosphere in a region. At a time when discussions occur on the growth of agricultural production in Brazil and its insertion in the international market also growing concern about the environmental impacts caused by land use change, especially in the Brazilian savana (cerrado) biome. This study aimed to estimate the surface radiation fluxes and evapotranspiration daily mesoregion South Goiano grow where agricultural activities of cultivating sugar cane and soybeans on grassland areas. The SEBAL algorithm was implemented with images of MODIS / Terra, supplemented with data from automatic weather station of Morrinhos, to estimate the surface radiation fluxes and evapotranspiration in daily mesoregion South Goiano. The values of energy flows Rn, G, H and &# 955;ET, were calculated separately and the value of &# 955;ET was obtained as <b>waste</b> of energy <b>balance.</b> Also identified were the values of these parameters in pixels cerrado, cane sugar and soybeans as land use representative of the study area. The results showed that the values of cane sugar were closer to the cerrado. The values of soybeans were different compared with the savanna and cane sugar. The daily values of actual evapotranspiration reached 6. 0 mm. d- 1 and slightly exceeded this value. Pages: 15 - 2...|$|R
