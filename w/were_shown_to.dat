5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with gastroenteritis.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a captive}} yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} and two free-living tawny frogmouths (Podargus strigoides) suffering neurological symptoms <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be hosting the rat nematode Angiostrongylus cantonensis.

A species of feather mite, Psittophagus calyptorhynchi, has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of the 20th century, {{information}} about the types and distances of stars became more readily available. The spectra of stars <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. Annie Jump Cannon and Edward C.

50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play a {{large role}} in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death.|$|R
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the animal is at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|The ship's timbers and {{artefacts}} <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{the public}} {{for the first time}} in 2011. The world debut exhibition of the collection of artefacts, as well as timbers from the ship, took place in the ArtScience Museum, adjacent to Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. The significance of the discovery of the shipwreck led to the decision to construct the Jewel of Muscat as an exact reconstruction of the shipwrecked dhow.|$|E

50|$|The AP-1 {{transcription}} factor has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play numerous roles in cell growth and proliferation. In particular, c-Fos and c-Jun {{seem to be}} major players in these processes. C-jun has <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essential for fibroblast proliferation, and levels of both AP-1 subunits have <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> expressed above basal levels during cell division. C-fos has also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> increase in expression {{in response to the}} introduction of growth factors in the cell, further supporting its suggested involvement in the cell cycle. The growth factors TGF alpha, TGF beta, and IL2 have all <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> stimulate c-Fos, and thereby stimulate cellular proliferation via AP-1 activation.|$|R

5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include the medial septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E
5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|German cinema {{has made}} major {{technical}} and artistic contributions to film. The first {{works of the}} Skladanowsky Brothers <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> an audience in 1895. The renowned Babelsberg Studio in Berlin's suburb Potsdam was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Today it is Europe's largest studio. Other early and still active studios include UFA and Bavaria Film. Early German cinema was particularly influential with German expressionists such as Robert Wiene and Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau. Director Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927) {{is referred to as}} the first major science-fiction film. In 1930 Josef von Sternberg directed The Blue Angel, the first major German sound film, with Marlene Dietrich. Films of Leni Riefenstahl set new artistic standards, in particular Triumph of the Will.|$|E

5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means that it is not known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|Jeunet hired French {{special effects}} {{supervisor}} Pitof and cinematographer Darius Khondji, {{both of whom}} he had worked with on The City of Lost Children. Jeunet and his crew watched the latest science fiction and Alien films as reference material, and obtained production reports from the Alien films to study the camera setups. Jeunet was given creative control, contributing several elements to the script including five different endings, although the expensive ones were dismissed. He also opted to make the film a dark comedy and was encouraged to include more violence. In June 1996, Jeunet's frequent co-director, conceptual artist Marc Caro had drawn rough sketches of characters' costumes, which <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> veteran costume designer Bob Ringwood. Ringwood made several modifications for the final design.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about {{the cause of the}} disease until 1903 when Adelchi Negri (1876–1912) first saw {{microscopic}} lesions– now called Negri bodies– in the brains of rabid animals.

Thirty years later, Negri bodies <b>were</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be accumulations of particles 100–150nanometres long, now known to be the size of rhabdovirus particles– the virus that causes rabies.|$|E
