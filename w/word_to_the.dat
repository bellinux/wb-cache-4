Aquino later acknowledged Xem as a worthwhile magical concept for Setians to explore, but found Barrett's insistence on its exclusivity as incompatible with the Temple's individualistic philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Dexagoridas, {{one of the}} two {{garrison}} commanders, sent <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Roman legate that he {{was willing}} to surrender the city. This plan fell through when Gorgopas, the other commander, learned of it and slew Dexagoridas with his own hands. Gorgopas continued to resist fiercely until Flamininus arrived with 4,000 additional troops that he had recently recruited. The Romans renewed their assault and Gorgopas was forced to surrender, though he did secure the condition that he and his garrison could leave unharmed and return to Sparta.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} Lamason {{negotiated}} with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E
30|$|The {{features}} in the subset WordSeg are extracted after the word segmentation and include word length, syllable position in a word, and word position in a sentence-like unit. Regarding word length, the lengths of neighboring words are conventionally included because PWs are usually composed of several words with some length constraints. Most studies consider a window of five words [16, 25]; thus, the current <b>word,</b> two <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, and two <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, are included. In this study, we extended <b>the</b> window <b>to</b> seven words; thus, the current <b>word,</b> three <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, and three <b>words</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right were included. The positional {{features in}} this subset are also essential to syllable duration patterns. The most significant evidence {{for this is that}} syllable position in a word affects the degree of syllable duration lengthening [4].|$|R

5|$|Later {{that day}} in the United States, word of Senna's death reached Talladega, Alabama where NASCAR was running the Winston Select 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. ESPN, which {{televised}} the San Marino Grand Prix for the American audience, had race commentator Bob Jenkins relay <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> viewers during the race. During the postrace festivities, race winner Dale Earnhardt (who would meet a similar fate seven years later) dedicated the victory to Senna.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a thousand feet high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E

5|$|The {{family name}} most likely {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> name Kačić. Based on etymology, {{it is likely that}} the Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E
5|$|When the {{war started}} Seward turned his {{attention}} to making sure that foreign powers did not interfere in the conflict. When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.|$|E
5|$|Comanche War Chief Buffalo Hump was {{determined}} {{to do more than}} merely complain about what the Comanches viewed as a bitter betrayal. Spreading <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other bands of Comanches that he was raiding the white settlements in revenge, Buffalo Hump led the Great Raid of 1840.. University of Oklahoma Press. 1952. Buffalo Hump gathered a huge raiding party, at least 400 warriors, with wives and young boys along to provide comfort and do the work. Altogether as many as a thousand Comanche may have set out from West Texas on the Great Raid. On this raid the Comanches went {{all the way from the}} plains of west Texas to the cities of Victoria and Linnville on the Texas coast. In what may have been the largest organized raid by the Comanches to that point, they raided and burned these towns and plundered at will.|$|E

5|$|The balloting {{began the}} {{following}} morning, July 10, with {{a two-thirds vote}} necessary to nominate. Bryan, who remained at his hotel, sent <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nebraska delegation to make no deals on his behalf. He stood second out of fourteen candidates in the first ballot, behind Bland. On the second ballot, Bryan still stood second, but had gained as other candidates had fallen away. The third ballot saw Bland still in the lead, but Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot. According to Jones, {{it was clear that}} Bland could not win, and that Bryan could not be stopped. On the fifth ballot, the Illinois delegation, led by Governor Altgeld, switched its votes from Bland to Bryan. Other delegations, seeing that Bryan would be nominated, also switched, securing the victory. Nevertheless, he won the nomination without the votes of the gold delegates, most of whom either left the convention or refused to vote.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent <b>word</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E
