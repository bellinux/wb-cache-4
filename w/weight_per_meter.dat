40|$|Abstract: Reinforced bars (rebars) are Thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) bars {{hot rolled}} from steel billets {{produced}} from scrap melted in an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) at {{a temperature of}} about 1600 ℃ (usually 1580 ℃). <b>Weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> of a low carbon steel rebar is one aspect which has been neglected by some steel producers during the tensile testing in the rod mill. Determination of weight per metre is explicitly required for a TMT rebar. Any reduction in mass will mean a lowering in capacity of the steel reinforcing bar. A series of “heat” numbers or batches of molten steel from an EAF {{for the production of}} steel sample A, (Y 10 and Y 12 rebars), were observed at a Steel plant to investigate the effect of <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> of reinforced bar on the mechanical properties and microstructure. The rolling speed range was 3 m/s to 14 m/s for different “heats”. Two other steel samples B and C were sourced from the local market to compare with Sample A. Samples collected from different sources on the local market, however, showed lower values of <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> different from the prescribed standards. This did not only affect the ultimate tensile strengths which were higher than normal but also the microstructure which deviated from the standard for this material. Sample A, did not only show a good combination of tensile strength and yield stress of 450 MPa and a maximum tensile strength of 650 MPa but also a standard pearliteferrite microstructure, while sample B and C exhibited excessive high strengths and brittle behaviour and can be prone to failure...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 16 - 18) Herbivorous fishes are {{an important}} component of the marine reef communities. They convert primary production directly into fish tissue. Grazing of algae by herbivores can also alter marine communities by impacting the growth, recruitment, and mortality of algae. By grazing algae, herbivorous fishes therefore serve as a vital link between primary producers and secondary consumers in aquatic communities. The halfmoon (Medialuna californiensis: Kyphosidae), is one of the few herbivorous fishes in the temperate waters of Southern California. Specimens were taken from various coastal locations around southern California including three of the southern Channel Islands (Santa Catalina, San Clemente and Anacapa) from 2005 - 2007 to examine age and growth, gut contents, and secondary productivity of this abundant species. The von Bertalanffy parameters for all the aged halfmoons based on lengths were L??? = 290. 5, K = 0. 5581 and to = - 0. 0091. Most adults examined were two to four years-old, indicative of a fast growing, short-lived species.

Virus-free plantlets were transferred to isolated greenhouse and planted in 20 × 20 × 15 cm in plastic pots beds made by 1 : 1 volume of Biolan peat moss and perlite. During growth period traits like plant height, leaf and stem number <b>per</b> plant, mini-tuber <b>weight</b> and number <b>per</b> plant and square meter, and mini-tuber size were average measured.

The present study investigated the impact performance of five styles of Kevlar fabrics K 310, K 706, K 720, K 745 and K 779 from Hexcel. The fabrics are different in many aspects, i. e., <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> square <b>meter,</b> yarn counts, yarn size, Kevlar fiber type, friction and breaking strength. Silica nanoparticles were impregnated into the fabric to enhance the ballistic impact performance. The fabric impregnated with nanoparticles exhibit significant enhancement in impact performance over their neat counterparts. Fabrics experience large deformation under impact. More or less yarn pull-out was observed on all the fabrics. The in-plane yarn pull-out force has good correlation to the impact performance: fabrics with higher pull-out force performed better in impact tests. A two-dimensional finite element model was proposed to simulate the single yarn pull-out procedure and predict the maximum pull-out force. The most important fabric features are included in this model: yarn count, yarn size, fabric thickness, yarn waviness, fiber modulus, fiber diameter and coefficients of friction et al. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimentally measured pull-out forces. To understand the impact process, a constitutive model was developed to characterize the nonlinear anisotropic properties of the fabric in large deformation. The nanoparticles largely increase the shear stiffness, while only slightly affect the tension behavior along warp and weft yarn directions. This constitutive model was incorporated in the commercial FEA software ABAQUS through the user-defined material subroutine and used to simulate deformations with various loads. Finally the out-of-plane yarn pull-out force was predicted from the in-plane yarn pull-out results using finite {{element method and the}} proposed constitutive model. ...|$|R

40|$|Difficulties in {{chemically}} controlling {{large crabgrass}} in corn in South Africa {{have recently been}} attributed to the occurrence of naked crabgrass. In contrast to large crabgrass, naked crabgrass is not easily controlled with acetanilide herbicides. Critical periods of weed control (CPWC) for naked crabgrass in corn was determined in field studies during the 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 growing seasons at two separate localities for an early and late planting date of corn. Weed-free and weed–crop interference treatments of increasing duration were maintained at various crop growth stages {{in the presence of}} naked crabgrass. Biomass of naked crabgrass was determined as dry <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> square <b>meter</b> quadrant, which yielded 428 g m 22 at Potchefstroom and 594 g m 22 at Wesselsbron. An exponential regression model was used to determine the CPWC expressed as growing degree days after crop emergence, on the basis of an estimated 10 % relative yield loss in corn. The onset and ending, as well as the duration of the CPWC, differed between seasons and localities. At 10 % relative yield loss, the onset of the CPWC ranged between the two-leaf (V 2) and six-leaf (V 6) stages, and the ending between the 12 -leaf (V 12) stage and 2 wk after tasseling (T + 2). The duration of the CPWC ranged between 22 and 80 d for the respective planting dates, years, and localities. Yield losses ranged from 28 to 82 % in the season-long weedy plots. The shifting of planting dates alone did not reduce yield losses since the effect of late infestations of naked crabgrass is significant. Naked crabgrass control from crop emergence is essential, followed by POST herbicide application during the critical period of weed control to lower the risk of corn yield losses.

40|$|A {{simple and}} viable {{technology}} has been developed for the culture of green mussel Perna viridis on ropes suspended from floating rafts in the open sea at Calicut and Karwar along {{the west coast of}} India. Rafts varying in size from 5 x 5 m to 8 x 8 m were constructed using teak and bamboo poles and moored in the open sea at 8 - 10 m depth. Collection of seeds for the culture was done during October-December from the intertidal and submerged mussel beds. The average seed size for farming was 15 - 30 mm and 0 5 - 1. 0 kg seeds ere required for seeding one meter length of the rope. Synthetic and coir ropes of 15 - 20 mm diameter ware found suitable for growing mussels from the rafts. The seeds ware placed around the rope and securely wrapped with knitted cotton cloth. The seeded portion of the ropes varied from 5 - 8 m and the ropes were suspended from the rafts 0. 5 - 1. 0 m apart. Growth of mussels in the farm at Callcut ranged 11. 6 - 12. 9 mm in length and 5. 9 - 7. 3 g in <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> month. At Karwar the growth ranged 7. 6 - 10. 0 mm in length and 3 18 - 3. 5 g in <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> month. A production rate of 12. 3 kg <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> length of rope at Calicut and 10 kg <b>per</b> <b>meter</b> length at Karwar was obtained. Harvesting was dona at the end of five months. The possibilities and constraints of mussel farming in the open sea conditions are discussed in the Paper...|$|R
