His chief influences were from English Palladianism, and several of his houses have been likened to designs reproduced in Colen Campbell's Vitruvius Britannicus, but Adam mixed these with English Baroque motifs from Gibbs and Vanbrugh. He relied greatly on a range of French, Italian and English pattern books, including Gibbs' Book of Architecture, from which he borrowed freely <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> consistency of style. In addition, he took inspiration from earlier Scottish renaissance architecture, and from his predecessors Bruce and Smith. During his nearly 30-year career as an architect, Adam designed, extended or remodelled over 40 country houses, and undertook numerous public contracts. He also laid out landscape garden schemes, for instance at Newliston and Taymouth Castle.|$|E

The Christian Byzantines and Serbians, as well as the Muslim beyliks of Germiyan, Saruhan, Karaman and Dulkadir were all potential enemies and marriage was seen as a way of securing alliances with them. Marriage with foreign dynasties seems to have ceased in 1504, with the last marriage of a sultan to a foreign princess being that of Murad II and Mara Branković, daughter of the Serbian ruler Đurađ Branković, in 1435. By this time, the Ottomans had consolidated their power in the area and absorbed or subjugated many of their former rivals, and so marriage alliances were no longer seen as important to their foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary boroughs in England ranged {{widely in}} size from small hamlets to large cities, partly because they had evolved haphazardly. The {{earliest}} boroughs were chosen in the Middle Ages by county sheriffs, and even a village might be deemed a borough. Many of these early boroughs (such as Winchelsea and Dunwich) were substantial settlements {{at the time of}} their original enfranchisement, but later went into decline, and by the early 19th century some only had a few electors, but still elected two MPs; they were often known as rotten boroughs. In later centuries the reigning monarch decided which settlements to enfranchise. The monarchs seem mostly to have done so capriciously, often <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> the merits of the place they were enfranchising. Of the 70 English boroughs that Tudor monarchs enfranchised, 31 were later disenfranchised. Finally, the parliamentarians of the 17th century compounded the inconsistencies by re-enfranchising 15 boroughs whose representation had lapsed for centuries, seven of which were later disenfranchised by the Reform Act. After Newark was enfranchised in 1661, no additional boroughs were enfranchised, and the unfair system remained unchanged until the Reform Act of 1832. Grampound's disenfranchisement in 1821 was the sole exception. Most English boroughs elected two MPs; but five boroughs elected only one MP: Abingdon, Banbury, Bewdley, Higham Ferrers and Monmouth. The City of London and the joint borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis each elected four members. The Welsh boroughs each returned a single member.|$|E
5|$|Stroma's violent storms {{occasionally}} wrought destruction on the island. In December 1862, a great storm broke {{over the}} island {{with such force that}} it swept right across the northern end of Stroma, leaving wreckage, rocks and seaweed {{on the top of the}} 100-foot-high cliffs and destroying the channels leading to the watermill. However, the sea's destructive power had one positive benefit for the islanders, if not for those caught out by the currents and shoals of the Pentland Firth. Over the last two hundred years, over sixty vessels ranging from fishing boats to large cargo vessels have been wrecked on the shores of Stroma, with many more vessels coming to grief on the reefs and shoals of the neighbouring mainland and Orkney coasts. Many vessels – at least 560 between 1830 and 1990 – have had to be refloated in the Pentland Firth after getting into difficulties. Shipwrecks were a valuable source of income, timber and goods for the islanders, who would salvage liberally – and often <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> legality – whenever a stranded ship was abandoned. The building of Stroma's first lighthouse in the late 19th century was initially opposed by some of the islanders who were more concerned with profiting from shipwrecks than preventing them.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>regard</b> <b>for</b> narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads.

The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the experiences of}} two groups of nurses {{who served in the}} Vietnam War, the members of Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps (RAANC) and the women who volunteered as members of the civilian aid surgical teams who served in Vietnam under the humanitarian aid clauses of the Southeast Asian Treaty Organisation (SEATO). The oral testimonies of 31 members of both RAANC and the civilian aid teams provided the evidence used for this thesis. The thesis argues that both groups of women, irrespective of their mode of deployment worked within a tradition of Australian nursing: the military nursing tradition, first established by the Boer War nurses, and developed further by Australian nurses in subsequent world wars. The military nursing histories and the development of that tradition provide the context {{for the study of the}} testimonies of the 31 nurses. The study notes that traditions have a malleable quality that allows for adaptation and change and reflect the conditions in which the nurses found themselves and the common elements that link the experiences over different wars. The presence of civilian aid nurses in Vietnam raises a question concerning a nursing tradition that historians have identified within Australian military nursing, which the thesis explores further. This was the first time a large group of Australian civilian nurses (210) had served in an overseas region of conflict, but the histories, except one, and the Australian government saw only the nurses in the armed forces as part of the military structure, and the civilian aid nurses distinct from that structure administered by the Australian Defence Forces (ADF). This thesis argues that the attitudes, working conditions and experiences of both groups of nurses, particularly the civilian aid nurses, reflected the experiences of nurses in past wars in perpetuating a military nursing tradition. This suggests that the attitudes and responses to nursing in a war zone may not simply be a nursing tradition associated with the military, but is more a general response of nurses to their work in areas of conflict, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>regards</b> <b>for</b> age, race, or enemy affiliation...|$|R
