30|$|During the 16 -week {{period of}} 3 DP {{education}} in the fashion design major, one major limitation of 3 DP for wearable fashion products was identified, which is connected with its technical aspect, specifically materials used for 3 DP. The 3 DP material is mainly plastic, which is inappropriate for wearable fashion products in terms of flexibility. Flexible filaments made from the material of rubber properties are available, but still lack of flexibility {{to be used as}} a wearable material although it can be acceptable for sandals or other accessories. In addition, in the case of flexible filaments, it is difficult to remove the supporter of 3 D printed objects and there is a high possibility of failure when an object is printed at high speed. Therefore, it is urged to develop and universalize more flexible and eco-friendly materials that can be used for 3 D <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> design. To overcome the lack of flexibility of such materials, it is also suggested to print objects as thin and small as possible, which can supplement the hard feeling of plastics. This can be considered as a modular design approach; small pieces of 3 D modular objects are printed and those pieces connected together, which leads to enhance the mobility of a <b>wearable</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Reverse Engineering (RE) {{techniques}} and the Finite Element Modelling (FEM) {{are widely used}} tools in many scientific fields. They were firstly developed for the mechanics {{but in the last}} times became common for other disciplines. In the thesis these techniques are used for the customization of the wearable products. It is possible to observe that the geometry of whatever <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> is fundamental for the comfort. In particular, starting from the need of <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> it is possible to analyse the relative body part and to study the products most appropriate interface geometry to maximize the comfort. The related disciplines are biometrics, biomechanics and anthropometry. In the thesis four different non-contact RE techniques are taken into account: shape from stereo, shape from silhouette, shape from laser and range finding. The first instrument which has been developed is based on the multi stereo vision, focusing the attention to the data filtering and to the generation of the solid model represented by mesh. The second instrument is based on the model generation starting from the silhouette. These two techniques are compared to another laser instrument available on the market. The tolerance on the reconstruction give an error on the total length of the foot of about 2 mm. The tolerance is acceptable for the study of a footwear product anyway it is not sufficient for a scientific research. For this reason a fourth RE system based on range finding is studied. A lot of possible methods were analysed, the multifrequencies, belonging as Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP) group, has been considered the best compromise between precision, accuracy and elaboration times. An instrument has been developed which in few seconds performs the reconstruction using common, cheap products such as a projector and a camera. The use of the aforementioned RE techniques allowed to adequately reconstruct the geometrical model of the foot, then the deformation of the foot is studied using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A model characterized by nearly 200000 elements has been developed. The deformations are congruent with literature data. Anyway, considering the complex validation process of the FE model, caused by the difficulties on measuring the real displacement of the foot under loading condition, a direct matching between the acquired geometry and the final shape of the <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> has been preferred. A function, capable to analyse the fitting between foot and shoe, through a coefficient called comfort index has been developed...|$|E

30|$|In the 3 DP {{course for}} this case study, types of {{materials}} available for 3 DP were not thoroughly introduced and {{explained to the}} students {{because of the time}} constraints. The students only had tactile experiences of their simple and small 3 D printed objects by touching. To advance this course more focusing on <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>products</b> (e.g., vest, jacket, dress), it is necessary for instructors to teach students the woven and knit structures of fabrics and the way to incorporate these structures when creating <b>wearable</b> <b>products</b> by applying articulated hinges or links using computational design. In addition, it is suggested for instructors to introduce students the use of other technologies (e.g., 3 D body scanner, portable object scanner) in the 3 DP process for developing 3 D printed <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>products.</b>|$|R
30|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{obstacles}} in integrating DDM in the current supply chain, particularly using technology like 3 DP, {{is embedded in the}} design and product development sector. Designers today will be mostly challenged in developing digital design skills, such as applying 3 D modeling CAD programs, and translating traditional training knowledge into the virtual design environments to develop various unique yet efficient and sustainable design and product development processes. The current 3 D CAD modeling and rendering programs are based on x–y–z coordinate system, including Solidworks, 3 D Studio Max, Google Sketchup, and Rhino were not developed with the traditional fashion designer in mind. They are limited in a type of structure and its intuitive interface for typical <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> design. Often, the software terminology or jargon used is rather foreign to fashion designers who are familiar with techniques from the traditional studio.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{adoption}} of digital fabrication technologies, such as 3 D printing, the textile and apparel industry is recognizing the unique advantage of efficiently prototyping complex objects for various customized products. Today, 3 D apparel design pioneers who have been trained in traditional practice lack the knowledge in 3 D CAD and are often collaborating with 3 D CAD experts in 3 D printing product development. More importantly, the most popular 3 D CAD programs are designed for engineers and thus lack intuitive features suitable for traditional apparel designers and products. This design case study investigates the effectiveness of popular 3 D CAD program (Rhino) and tools (3 D mouse) for the traditional apparel designer in <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> prototyping. Findings suggest that 3 D CAD program like Rhino challenges the way an apparel designer interprets CAD tools in creating various complex forms and reconsider orders of operation in product development...|$|E
40|$|Scenarios are {{considered}} {{a useful tool for}} designers and HCI communities to generate detailed problem descriptions, future predictions, concept generations, requirements analysis and detailed system design surrounding a design problem. However, little is known about animated scenarios as a tool to co-evaluate and further explore early user research insights and themes with end users. In this study, previous research findings and insights concerning emergency alarm pendants were designed and presented as animated scenarios to older participants in a workshop. Emergency alarms are <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> technologies that allow the user to alert designated contacts in the event of falls or medical emergencies and were chosen as a case study for this paper. The findings indicate, that while the animated scenarios provide a basis for participants to describe problems associated with using the emergency alarm technology, participants also used the animated scenarios to discus and evaluate the key emotions and themes that were presented. We refer to this process as co-evaluate. It is argued that animated scenarios can be used to validate the HCI designers' understanding and interpretation of early user research insights and themes...|$|E

30|$|One {{semester}} was {{not sufficient}} {{for the students to}} learn and develop <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>products</b> using 3 D modeling software and 3 D printer. This 16 -week period was enough to learn the modeling software, create simple 3 D objects, and print those. There was not enough time to introduce key design elements (e.g., mobility, functionality, durability) that students need to consider when creating <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>products.</b> It is crucial to teach different types of fabric structures so students can consider those when developing 3 DP clothes since the flexibility of a material is the key feature for wearers’ comfort and mobility; this is the current challenge of 3 DP in fashion. It is good to offer another 3 DP course focusing on designing and developing flexible fabric structures using Rhino tools as well as creating 3 D printed <b>wearable</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

The wearables are both waterproof and the line also has nine additional accessories all jointly designed by both companies.|$|R
30|$|Third, the 3 D CAD {{modeling}} or rendering {{processes are}} often {{supported by the}} use of 3 D scanning technology, which is capable of producing real world measurement data for a variety of objects from small jewelry pieces to large building structures. A human avatar is often utilized in the 3 D CAD process as a “virtual dress form” for <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> design (Sun and Parsons 2014). Such an approach would eliminate much of the procedures in traditional product development like various fitting sessions using live models. Alternatively, 3 D scanning procedures may be utilized in a reverse engineering approach, in which various object iterations or modifications can be made quickly based on scan data without having to develop the base model from the start. The turn around time would consequently become reduced in the prototyping process, particularly considering the streamlined design modification timeline. Such versatility also stimulates various bespoke designs that accommodate targeted end users with a customized design feature or tailored fit (3 D Printed XYZ 2013; Nike football 2014). Thus, the impact of integrating 3 DP in the fashion industry would thus result in a change in design prototyping efficiency and the ability to move toward mass customization.|$|E
30|$|Third, {{the speed}} in which DDM can be {{integrated}} efficiently also relies on the capability of relevant technologies. The current advancement in 3 DP has expanded the material availability and the relevant ability in material mixing during production. However, limitations still exist in material resilience and feasibility for <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> development. At the manufacturing scale, product quality for real world proofing and product post finishing techniques and processes {{is yet to be}} tested. The capability in 3 DP technology will also impact the strategy implemented in areas including production planning, labor distribution, and new talent training. Fourth, various DDM technologies are currently coupled with the new trend in open sources, such as online 3 D models for 3 DP, free software for 3 D model processing, white paper for do-it-yourself tutorials ranging from learning new 3 DP materials to building a 3 D printer (e.g., RepRap). These repositories would thus support individuals from various supply chain sectors, especially the prosumer group. Previously, study has examined the investment on household 3 D printers that utilize open source downloads and found they would yield a return over 100 % of return in 5  years (Petersen and Pearce 2017). Consequently, the movement of home manufacturing, localized manufacturing, and the demand in product customization would become more viable in the near future (Laplume et al. 2016).|$|E
30|$|Unlike the {{traditional}} design approach where designers rely on intuition and tacit knowledge {{to solve problems}} (Treadaway 2009), computational design enables encoding design decisions using computer language and predefines the steps needed to achieve a result (Kilkelly 2016). Fashion designers and product developers {{will be expected to}} adapt to the change in the order of operation in developing various garment structures. Further, 3 DP pioneers today have also been advancing 3 DP based wearable design through 3 D CAD simulation technology. In response to the limitation in 3 DP building volume, one can create hundreds or thousands of interlocking or articulating structures to allow movement using 3 D simulation for material drape evaluation (Kinematics Dress 2014). This ultimately eliminates or reduces post-printing processes such as assembly. Moreover, fashion design and product development have traditionally relied heavily on hand-on based practices and intuitive decision making, and a steep learning curve exists in a digital design adaptation for designers who have more training in haptic skills (Danaher 2004; Harris 2005; Treadaway 2009). For 3 DP based <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> design, scholars (Sun and Parsons 2014) have found that traditional fashion designers would need to efficiently apply their spatial visualization ability (Kozhevnikov et al. 2010) and their tacit knowledge in order to effectively translate or convert the conventional hand-on based tools, procedures, and workflow into the 3 D CAD processes.|$|E

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. June 2016. Major: Design, Housing and Apparel. Advisor: Karen LaBat. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 174 pages. The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop a textile component system mimicking anatomical structures that when added to a typical shapewear product will straighten and balance a person’s posture. The experimental system is referred to as the “Posture Modification System using Soft materials structures” or PMSS. Current posture modification garments fall into two categories: 1) health and rehabilitation garments focused on physical changes using rigid materials and 2) lingerie-type garments typically called shapewear that focus on achieving an ideal body using compression qualities of knit fabrics. This study explored the middle ground of designing a comfortable, <b>wearable</b> <b>product</b> that aligns posture using textile correction forces strategically placed in the garment. A biomimicry approach was used in designing the prototype using the inspiration of anatomical features of a woman’s torso to determine size and placement of textile components (PMSS) in a garment. A prototype was developed by incorporating the PMSS into a commercially available shapewear product. After a pilot test, the prototype was refined and a more comprehensive test was conducted. Twelve women participated in the study to determine effectiveness of the prototype including: 1) posture changes, 2) posture correction force, and 3) wearer acceptability. Participants were scanned three times; while wearing the prototype, wearing a typical shapewear product, and in their own underwear. Posture differences in wear conditions were analyzed. Posture correction forces of the textile materials were measured using standard fabric tests. Participants completed questionnaires on wearer acceptability. Results included: 1) body angle assessment indicated that wearing the prototype affected posture including more balanced shoulders, aligned lateral center of gravity, and straighter spine, 2) textile characteristics of the PMSS incorporated into a shapewear compression garment contribute to a more erect and balanced posture, and 3) participants were more satisfied with posture and body shape when wearing the prototype then when wearing the shapewear garment. This study indicates that the inherent properties of textiles (compression and tensile force from stretch) can be manipulated in a garment in various ways to modify posture...|$|E
40|$|Sizing and grading {{are widely}} used to create {{products}} to fit selected populations. Currently, the sizing and grading rules are derived from anthropometric measures; however past researches have indicated {{that it is not}} very accurate. This study proposes a new technique to use principal component analysis (PCA) on 3 D surface points for sizing and grading <b>wearable</b> <b>products.</b> The accuracy of the proposed method is illustrated by developing a sizing and grading rule for the feet. After developing a model using the feet data of 60 participants and validating using the feet data of 10 different participants, results showed that sizing and grading using PCA is more accurate than traditional techniques. Compared with traditional foot sizing, PCA based sizing and grading showed an improvement of about 25 % in accuracy. In addition, results also indicated that the grading rule derived from PCA loading was better than the proportional grading. This research provides a new direction to consider when developing the sizing and grading rules.

30|$|In addition, engineering-based 3 D {{modeling}} software {{have been}} taught at many private institutes; however, their curricula are mostly organized for general product design and (or) 3 D modeling software learning instead of being specialized into 3 D <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>product</b> design (e.g., dress, jacket). 3 DP tutorials have been provided by most of 3 D printer manufacturers, but this simple tutorial (e.g., making a simple 3 D object) is in sufficient for fashion students to design sophisticated <b>wearable</b> <b>products</b> using 3 DP. Therefore, the course used for this experimental case study was indeed a great trial (1) to introduce 3 DP to fashion design students by integrating this topic into the fashion design curriculum and (2) to experiment 3 DP education in fashion for one semester in order to seek out suggestions, which can guide for future implementation of 3 DP.|$|R

40|$|Emotional {{expression}} {{is an important}} human behavior, which enriches communication. Sensory organs play crucial role in emotional perception.

30|$|For {{enhancing}} students’ {{level of}} understanding for wearable 3 DP, {{it would be good}} to incorporate the analysis of current designers’ 3 DP examples into 3 DP course contents (e.g., analyzing the structural characteristics of 3 DP design works by Iris Van Herpen). This tells that <b>wearable</b> fashion <b>products</b> with 3 DP are beyond having the skills of 3 D modeling and 3 DP. Students should have in-depth knowledge of science, technology, education, and mathematic (STEM), along with creative and innovative thinking skills.

30|$|The {{market for}} <b>wearable</b> {{technologies}}, <b>wearable</b> <b>products</b> and related technologies that incorporate fashion, computer sciences, advanced electronic technologies and other interdisciplinary areas, have significantly developed {{and a number}} of companies have released different types of wearables since 2014 (Büyüközkan et al. 2016; Page 2015). Among various wearable technologies, wearable trackers {{are one of the most}} common types.
