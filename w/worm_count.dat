40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) {{associated}} with resistance to an intestinal worm in a well-defined murine model are described. These {{have been identified}} in an F(2) population derived from resistant (SWR) and susceptible (CBA) parental mouse strains infected with the gastro-intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus.

Faecal egg counts, pasture larval <b>counts</b> and <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> from permanent grazing animals were recorded for 12 months. H. contortus (24. 6 %) was found to be predominant of gastrointestinal nematode parasites, Trichostrongylus spp. (18. 0 %) was the next most prevalent species, others, including: O. circumcincta, S. papillosus, T. ovis, Oe. columbianum and Chabertia ovina were found in varying percentages. The highest faecal egg counts (FEC) were recorded in September, whereas the lower FEC were in February. Statistical analysis revealed that the FEC were significantly (P< 0. 01) affected by months (seasons). The peak of pasture infectivity was in August and declined to lower level in January.

40|$|Abstract Teladorsagia circumcincta is {{the most}} {{economically}} important gastrointestinal (abomasal) nematode parasite of sheep in cool temperate regions, to which sheep show genetically-varying resistance to infection. Lambs, from parents with genetic variation for resistance, were trickle infected with L 3 larvae over 12 [*]weeks. 45 lambs were identified {{with a range of}} susceptibilities as assessed by: adult <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> at post mortem, faecal egg count (FEC) and IgA antibody levels. This project investigated the correlation of T cell cytokine expression and resistance to infection at the mature stage of response, when the resistant lambs had excluded all parasites. Histopathology showed only minor changes in resistant animals with a low level lymphocyte infiltration; but in susceptible lambs, major pathological changes were associated with extensive infiltration of lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. Absolute quantitative RT-qPCR assays on the abomasal lymph node (ALN) revealed a significant positive correlation between IL 6, IL 21 and IL 23 A transcript levels with adult <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and FEC. IL 23 A was also negatively correlated with IgA antibody levels. Significantly positive correlation of TGFB 1 levels with adult <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and FEC were also seen in the abomasal mucosa. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the inability to control L 3 larval colonization, adult worm infection and egg production is due to the activation of the inflammatory Th 17 T cell subset. </p...|$|E

40|$|Nematode infections {{of sheep}} may be {{influenced}} by secondary compounds in the diet, e. g. condensed tannins. A study was performed with 7 groups of lambs experimentally infected with Teladorsagia circumcincta and Trichostronglylus vitrinus. All groups were grazed on clean clover-grass pasture and then moved to paddocks with bioactive forages with either sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) (groups Pre-S and Post-S), chicory (Cichorium intybus, cv. Grasslands Puna) (Pre-C and Post-C) or clover-grass as reference (Pre-G and Post-G). Pre-groups were infected before the move to bioactive forages, whereas all Post-groups were infected after the move. Group Pre-ctrl. was slaughtered for <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> {{at the time of the}} move while the other groups were slaughtered after 5 - 8 weeks on bioactive forages. The faecal egg counts of pre-groups dropped markedly after the move, and Pre-S showed the fastest decline, by 80 % within 3 weeks after the move. The mean faecal egg counts of Post-S was reduced by 40 % 4 weeks p. i. compared to Post-G (p< 0. 01) whereas Post-C was 30 - 100 % higher (p< 0. 01). T. circumcincta <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> of Pre-S, Pre-C and Pre-G were 4300, 3200 and 7000 but differences were not significant due to large variation within groups (Pre-C vs. Pre-G: p= 0. 12).

All nine flocks were located in the southwest of Western Australia in areas with a winter rainfall pattern (Mediterranean climate). There was no difference (p = 0. 304) in WEC of diarrhoeic sheep (loose faeces and severe breech faecal soiling) and "normal sheep" (pelleted faeces and mild or no breech faecal soiling). Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta and Trichostrongylus spp. were the nematodes most commonly identified by total <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> and differentiation of larvae recovered from faeces and pasture. Larval stages of strongyle worms accounted for the largest proportion of total <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> in both diarrhoeic and normal sheep. Adult worm burdens were small in most sheep. Diarrhoeic sheep had higher numbers of fourth stage larvae than normal sheep (p = 0. 046). There was no histopathological evidence of bacterial or viral causes of diarrhoea in any of the flocks or bacteriological evidence of bacterial infections associated with diarrhoea. Two flocks had marginal selenium glutathione peroxidase (selenium) levels.

Thirty-six hookworm infected dogs, a minimum of 10 weeks of age and of various breeds and genders were used. Fecal egg counts were done on three separate days prior to treatment for randomization purposes. Dogs were ranked by descending order of the fecal egg count arithmetic means and randomly assigned to either the two milbemycin treatment groups or the placebo control group in blocks of three dogs each, 12 dogs per group. Dogs were dosed according to the product label with blinding maintained by separation of function. Worm counts were done at necropsy 7 days after treatment. Reduction in A. braziliense worm counts in the milbemycin groups were compared to the placebo control group using analysis of variance of the A. braziliense logarithmic mean worm counts and percent efficacy was based on geometric means. Efficacy {{was defined as the}} ability of the test products to significantly (p≤ 0. 05) reduce parasite load by 90 % or greater in treated dogs when compared to adequately infected placebo control dogs. The placebo control group had a geometric mean <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> of 19. 2.

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} are {{arguably the}} most important disease restricting domestic ruminant production. Control rests heavily on chemotherapy but resistance to anthelmintic drugs by the parasites poses {{a major threat to}} livestock industries worldwide. An alternative is to produce through selective breeding or genetic modification stock with enhanced resistance to infection. Rodent infections provide valuable models to analyse factors controlling resistance to economically important gastrointestinal nematode parasites. It has been shown that resistance and susceptibility in mice are genetically determined making it possible to identify genetic markers and then look for homologues in target ruminants or humans. This thesis reports mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to Helgmosomides polygyrus (H polygyrus) in mice, a strongyloid worm whose biology is similar to the trichostrongyloid nematodes of economic importance in domestic ruminants. An F 2 intercross of SWR and CBA strains that are resistant and susceptible to H polygyrus was used as resource population to map chromosomal regions associated with resistance. A total population of 520 F 2, 120 SWR and 120 CBA mice were infected with H polygyrus given weekly for six weeks. Resistance phenotypes measured were a three-time point faecal egg count at week 2, 4 and 6, total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and granuloma score on intestinal mucosa at necropsy, immunoglobulin E and G 1 titres and mucosal mast cell proteases 1. A least square analysis ofvarriance showed a significant variation for all traits in both the pure lines and F 2 intercross. A genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping was undertaken to evaluate the genetic basis of variation in the resistance traits in the F 2 cross by selective DNA pooling and selective genotyping of individuals based on total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and an average of total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and the three time point faecal egg count. Analysis of selective DNA pools revealed QTL on chromosome 1, 13, 17 and 19 associated with total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> which were also confirmed by selective genotyping for individual DNA samples hence showing the potential utility of this approach in QTL detection. Interval mapping (1 M) analysis using maximum likelihood and least square methods detected 31 significant QTL affecting {{at least one of the}} resistance associated traits. Considering the relative positions and direction of additive and dominance effects of the detected QTLs, and taking the concept of pleiotropy into account, it can be envisaged that this experiment has detected 18 loci on 14 chromosomes controlling resistance to H. polygyrus infection in mice. A number of candidate genes for nematode infection resistance can be identified based on the QTL locations. Among the more interesting candidates are those that influence T cell responses, pro-inflammatory and other cytokines or particular components of the inflammatory response, the MHC region, supporting earlier work indicating the involvement of MHC-linked genes in resistance to H. polygyrus, mast cell proteases 1 and IgE production. However, the relative importance of these individual genes, and' others mapping to the identified QTL, remains to be determined although it is possible to see an overall role in regulating inflammatory responses, T cell and antibody responses and factors controlling the functionally important mast cell response. High resolution mapping of the detected QTL is going on using FdF 7 advanced intercross lines (AIL) approach and the QTL on chromosome 1 and 17 have been confirmed and fine mapped to 5 cM in preparation for positional cloning upon further dissection of the QTL. This may lead to identification of the homologous genes in domestic ruminants through comparative mapping and as well provide valuable insights into the molecular basis of host resistance to GI nematodes, which will have important implications for the development of novel disease control strategies in man and livestock...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAngiostrongylus vasorum is an {{increasingly}} reported parasite in Europe that develops in dogs after ingestion of infective third stage larvae (L 3) that reside in gastropod molluscs which {{are needed to}} complete the parasite's life-cycle. Infection can produce a diversity of clinical signs, determined by involvement of the respiratory, neurological, and/or coagulation system, with a likely fatal outcome {{in the absence of}} treatment. Few drugs have been shown to reliably prevent infection, and data on treatment of infections is limited. A controlled, randomized, partially blinded laboratory study was therefore executed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination tablet of spinosad/milbemycin oxime in dogs inoculated with approximately 250 A. vasorum L 3. Sixteen healthy nematode free adult dogs were randomly allocated to two study groups of 8 dogs each. Thirty days post inoculation (dpi) all dogs in the fed state were treated: dogs in group B were treated with spinosad and milbemycin oxime at the dose rates of 45 – 60 mg/kg and 0. 75 – 1. 0 mg/kg bodyweight, respectively, approximately the lower half portion of the expected full unit dose range; dogs in group A were treated with placebo tablets. All dogs were euthanized and necropsied 56 – 58 dpi. The heart and lungs were examined to determine the presence of A. vasorum. All placebo group dogs were infected at necropsy with counts ranging from 22 to 98 adult worms and a geometric mean <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> of 55. 2. In contrast, the geometric mean <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> in the spinosad/milbemycin oxime group was 0. 7 with worm numbers ranging from 0 to 8. The results of this study demonstrate that a single treatment with the tablet combination of spinosad and milbemycin oxime administered 30 dpi provided 98. 8 % preventive efficacy against development of adult A. vasorum infections. Monthly treatments with spinosad and milbemycin oxime have the potential to prevent the establishment of infections with A. vasorum in dogs...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on aspects of the {{treatment}} and control of gastrointestinal nematodes and D. viviparus in red deer, under New Zealand farming conditions. In addition, the relationship between faecal egg count and gastrointestinal <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> was investigated. In the first study an anthelmintic-impregnated supplementary feed treatment regime incorporating 200 mg albendazole per kg of deer nuts (medicated nuts), fed to give 5 mg albendazole per kg liveweight daily for three 10 -day treatments with 21 day intervals between treatments, was given to eight weaner deer in the autumn. This treatment was compared with 3 -weekly single oral administration of albendazole (10 mg/kg) to eight similar deer under the same conditions (set-stocked in small pasture plots and given 2 kg concentrate feed per head, per day) and a similarly treated group rotationally grazed on pasture alone. Reductions in faecal egg and larval counts were {{the same for all}} three groups, but reinfestation in spring was more rapid in the pasture-fed deer. Liveweights were the same for all groups throughout the experimental period from March to November. As an adjunct to this trial, medicated nuts were fed at the same dose-rate to 16 adult hinds. All faecal egg and larval counts were reduced to zero within 10 days. Thus, anthelmintic-impregnated concentrate feed is an effective way of controlling gastrointestinal and lung nematodes in deer. The above trial and another on a commercial property showed that high faecal larval counts may be found in weaner deer where deer are set-stocked from before calving up to weaning, or if parasite control programmes are delayed until six weeks after weaning in March. A single oral dose of albendazole at 10 mg/kg was found to reduce D. viviparus faecal larval counts and gastrointestinal nematode faecal egg counts by approximately 99 % seven days after treatment. Faecal larval and egg counts were usually slightly elevated 21 days after treatment, suggesting either a rapid reinfestation and short prepatent period of the parasites in deer and/or an efficacy of albendazole of less than 100 % against immature stages of the gut and lung nematodes. In a third study, cutaneous application of levamisole (20 % W/V) at a dose-rate of 10 mg levamisole per kg was found to be ineffective in reducing faecal egg or larval counts in a group of 23 red deer under two years of age. The fourth study involved collection of abomasa and intestines of 46 deer sent to a deer slaughter premises. A faecal egg count was performed and the gastrointestinal nematodes were identified and counted. The largest gut parasite burdens were of Trichostrongylus axei with counts up to 12, 900. Five deer-specific species of the tribe Ostertagiea, Spiculopteragia spiculoptera, Spiculopteragia asymmetrica, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Skrjabinagia kolchida and Skrjabinagia lyratiformis were also common (counts up to 2470). Few other parasites were found and numbers were low (0 to 90). The relationship between <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> and faecal egg count was described by the relationship: Total <b>Worm</b> <b>Count</b> = 18. 8 (Faecal Egg Count) - 341.

Further, we show that {{over half of the}} variability in average worm counts among households is explained by household risk factors. This implies that exposures to infectious roundworm eggs shared by household members are important determinants of household clustering. We argue that these results support the hypothesis proposed in the literature that the household is a key focus of roundworm transmission...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the anthelmintic effect of Neem (Azadirachta indica) on nematode parasites of sheep. Twelve Santa Ines cross bred sheep from a government farm were randomly selected and equally divided into control (n = 6) and treated groups (n = 6). Faecal egg counts (FEC) using the modified McMaster technique and the FAMACHA score for assessing clinical anaemia were carried out daily and recorded for 6 weeks. At {{the end of the study}} all the animals were slaughtered and the total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> (TWC) was done. The results of FEC showed that there was no significant difference between the control and treated group (p = 0. 081). However, worm burden estimations showed that the number of parasites was significantly higher in the control group compared to the treated group (p < 0. 05). This result indicated that feeding Neem had an effect on worm numbers in sheep, but was not reflected in their faecal egg counts. Further work is needed to reconfirm the effect of Neem on helminth infections of sheep...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Over {{the last}} few decades, canine and feline thelaziosis caused by Thelazia callipaeda eye worms has gained the {{attention}} of the veterinary community due to the spread of this ocular infestation in geographical areas previously regarded as non endemic. The therapeutic efficacy of milbemycin oxime/praziquantel tablets (Milbemax®) against T. callipaeda was tested in naturally infested dogs and cats. Methods From January 2009 to July 2011 a placebo controlled and randomized field study was conducted in T. callipaeda endemic areas of Switzerland (CH) and Italy (ITA) involving client-owned animals. Dogs (n[*]=[*] 56) and cats (n[*]=[*] 31) were physically examined at enrolment Day 0 (D 0) and twice afterwards (D 7 and D 14). Infested animals were orally treated with Milbemax® or with placebo tablets on D 0 and, if an animal was found still infested with T. callipaeda, also on D 7. On D 14 nematodes were flushed from the conjunctiva, identified and counted. Results Out of 56 dogs, 43 were included in the statistical analysis, whereas 13 were excluded because the products under investigation were not administered with food, as required by the label. On D 7 and D 14, 72. 7 % and 90. 9 % of treated dogs were eye worm free, whereas in the placebo group 95. 2 % and 76. 2 % still harbored nematodes, resulting in a mean percentage <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> reduction for the Milbemax® group of 86. 1 % and 96. 8 %, respectively. Both results were significantly higher (p [*]=[*] 0. 0001) than the placebo group. Out of the 31 cats included in the study at D 7 and D 14, 53. 3 % and 73. 3 % treated with Milbemax® were free of T. callipaeda, while 81. 3 % and 73. 3 in the placebo group were still harbouring eye worms, resulting in a mean percentage <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> reduction for the treated group of 62. 2 % and 80. 0 %, respectively. Both results were significantly higher (p [*]=[*] 0. 0106 and p [*]=[*] 0. 0043) than the placebo group. Conclusions The commercial formulation of milbemycin oxime at the minimal dose of 0. 5 mg/kg and 2 mg/k in dogs and cats, respectively, showed a high therapeutic efficacy in curing T. callipaeda infestations. The advantages of an oral application are additionally increased by the large spectrum of activity of praziquantel and milbemycin oxime against Cestodes and Nematodes infesting dogs and cats. </p...|$|E
40|$|Sheep in winter-rainfall regions {{typically}} show {{a rise in}} faecal <b>worm</b> egg <b>count</b> (WEC) {{over the}} summer-autumn period, when pasture larval challenge is low or near zero. This rise is important epidemiologically for worm control. Our {{study found that the}} peak WEC of sheep bred for worm-resistance was reduced by 43 % compared to unselected control sheep during the summer-autumn period. Total <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> confirm that the rise in WEC was not due to an increased worm burden. Explanations for the summer-autumn rise in WEC include an increased fecundity of existing adult worms or maturation of existing immature worms. However, at this stage the precise mechanisms behind the rise in WEC remain unclear. A marked increase in the WEC for both genotypes of sheep occurred when they were removed from pasture and housed for 3 - 4 weeks...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{correlation}} between the immunological assay and the antibody titer can offer a tool for the experimental analysis of different phases of the disease. METHODS: Two simple immunological assays for Schistosoma mansoni in mice sera samples based on specific IgG detection for worms soluble antigens and eggs soluble antigens were standardized and evaluated in our laboratory. Fifty mice were used in negative and positive groups and the results obtained by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assays were compared {{with the number of}} <b>worms</b> <b>counted</b> and the IgG titers at different times of infection. RESULTS: Data showed that ELISA using adult worm antigens (ELISA-SWAP) presented a satisfactory {{correlation between}} the absorbance value of IgG titers and the individual number of <b>worms</b> <b>counted</b> after perfusion technique (R²= 0. 62). In addition, ELISA-SWAP differentially detected positive samples with 30 and 60 days post infection (p= 0. 011 and 0. 003, respectively), whereas ELISA using egg antigens (ELISA-SEA) detected samples after 140 days (p= 0. 03). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the use of different antigens in immunological methods can be used as potential tools for the analysis of the chronological evolution of S. mansoni infection in murine schistosomiasis. Correlations with human schistosomiasis are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematode}} infections {{were evaluated}} in sheep raised in Botucatu, state of São Paulo, Brazil between April 2008 and March 2011. Every month, two tracer lambs grazing with {{a flock of}} sheep were exposed to natural infection with gastrointestinal nematodes for 28 consecutive days. At {{the end of this}} period, the lambs were sacrificed for <b>worm</b> <b>counts.</b> Haemonchus contortus presented 100 % of prevalence. The seasons exerted no significant influence on the mean intensity of H. contortus, which ranged from 315 worms in November 2010 to 2, 5205 worms in January 2011. The prevalence of Trichostrongylus colubriformis was also 100 %, with the lowest mean intensity (15 worms) recorded in February 2011 and the highest (9, 760 worms) in October 2009. In the case of T. colubriformis, a significant correlation coefficient was found between <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> vs. rainfall (r = − 0. 32; P < 0. 05). Three other nematodes species were found in tracer lambs, albeit in small numbers. Their prevalence and mean intensity (in parenthesis) were as follows: Oesophagostomum columbianum 28 % (25. 2), Cooperia curticei 7 % (4. 5) and Trichuris spp. 2 % (1). In conclusion, the environmental conditions of the area proved to be highly favorable for the year-round transmission of H. contortus and T. colubriformis...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were to {{evaluate}} the in vitro and in vivo schistosomicidal properties of the methanolic extract of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus (MFM) and to determine its HPLC profile. For the in vitro experiment, four pairs of adult worms, obtained from infected mice, were exposed to different concentrations of MFM (100 to 400 [*]μg/mL) for 24 and 48 [*]h and analyzed under an inverted microscope. For the in vivo experiment, mice were inoculated with cercariae and, 20 days after infection, MFM (100 and 300 [*]mg/kg) was administered orally for the following 25 days. Mice were euthanized after 60 days. MFM showed in vitro schistosomicidal activity, exhibiting {{the opening of the}} gynaecophoral canal of some male schistosomes, the presence of contorted muscles, vesicles, and the darkening of the paired worms skin. In vivo experiments showed that MFM treatments significantly reduced total <b>worm</b> <b>count,</b> as praziquantel, showing a decrease in liver and spleen weight. Also, a significant reduction in granuloma density was observed. MFM treatment did not cause alterations in the liver function of either infected or noninfected mice.

40|$|With the {{increased}} incidence of parasite resistance to chemical anthelmintics worldwide novel approaches to manage parasite infection, such as medicinal plants and their extracts, are {{being investigated by}} the scientific community. The current study tested the effect of three rates of garlic (0. 9, 1. 8 and 3. 6 %) in a pelleted ration on Haemonchus contortus in sheep. Thirty-nine Merino wether lambs aged 6 months were divided into five treatment groups, including three garlic dose rates and two control groups that received no garlic. All animals were infected with 4000 L 3 H. contortus larvae 3 weeks after allocation to treatments. A positive control group was drenched with abamectin 28 days after infection. The synthetic drench was effective in controlling the parasites, {{but there was no}} reduction in either worm egg counts (WEC) or total <b>worm</b> <b>count</b> due to the garlic. The 3. 6 % garlic treatment had significantly lower (P < 0. 05) liveweight, feed intake, body condition score and feed conversion ratio {{than any of the other}} treatment groups, suggesting that this level of garlic had a low level of anti-nutritional properties.

40|$|Coleus blumei is a herbal plant {{used in the}} {{traditional}} medicine in Indonesia to expel the intestinal worm infections. Previous in vitro study showed that ethanol extract had the strongest anticestode activity compared to chloroform, hexane and aquaous extracts. The aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effectivity of anticestode of ethanol leaves extract againts Hymenolepis microstoma infections in mice. The plant extract was tested against H. microstoma infections in the single doses of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg kg- 1 body weight. Dose were administered to H. microstoma infected mice for 3 consecutive days. The efficacy of the leave extract was determined in terms of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and worms reduction at necropsy. The results showed that the efficacy of leaves extract was dose dependent. The maximum efficacy of leave extract was observed with 2000 mg/kg dose reducing the EPG and <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> by 55. 46 %- 69. 75 % and 63. 83 % respectively.

40|$|This {{report was}} {{presented}} at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. The study was designed to examine the hypothesis that chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Lotus sp. (Lotus corniculatus) have the potential to affect the naturally acquired nematode burden in grazed lambs. Organic male castrate lambs (48) with a naturally acquired parasite burden grazed replicate combination plots (0. 6 ha) of chicory, Lotus corniculatus, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). Lamb performance was determined by weekly weight gain and condition score assessments. Nematode burden was assessed by individual lamb faecal egg count (FEC) before and after drenching (levamisole). The range of parasitic helminths present was assessed by faecal culture and by total <b>worm</b> <b>counts</b> performed on a proportion of the lambs at slaughter. Weekly pasture larval counts (PLCs) were conducted on the trial plots. A concurrent small plot study (6 x 1 m 2 replicates) of each of the forages used in the grazing trial was run to assess the potential effect of forage type on the development and survival of Teladorsagia circumcincta assessed by weekly PLCs. Preliminary data suggest that lambs grazing chicory or a combination of lotus and chicory had lower FECs than those grazing PRG/WC, however {{there was no significant difference}} in the total <b>worm</b> <b>counts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The peri-parturient {{period is}} crucial for {{controlling}} worms as the acquired immunity of ewes is disrupted, resulting {{in an increase in}} faecal <b>worm</b> egg <b>counts.</b> Two hypotheses were tested in this experiment that ewes bred for worm resistance would have lower faecal <b>worm</b> egg <b>counts</b> than unselected control ewes, during late pregnancy and lactation, under similar but separate grazing areas; and also that numbers of infective nematode larvae would be lower on pastures grazed by resistant ewes than pastures grazed by unselected control ewes. Faecal samples were collected from resistant and unselected ewes in late pregnancy and early lactation, during the winter rainfall season, and analysed for numbers of Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Teladorsagia circumcincta. Pasture samples were taken 1 week before and 7 weeks after lambing started and analysed for infective larvae. In all sheep, <b>worm</b> egg <b>counts</b> rose 2 weeks prior to lambing and continued into lactation. <b>Worm</b> egg <b>counts</b> were significantly lower in the resistant ewes from 1 week before lambing to 2 weeks after lambing. There were no differences in egg counts between single- and twin-bearing ewes in the resistant line. However, twin-bearing control ewes had significantly higher egg counts than single-bearing control ewes. Following lactation, plots grazed by resistant ewes had substantially less contamination with T. colubriformis larvae, but there were no differences in numbers of T. circumcincta larvae. Our results demonstrate that sheep bred for worm resistance has lower worm burdens during the peri-parturient phase and that lambs born to resistant ewes face a lower larval challenge during their introduction to grazing. In our environment, selection for low <b>worm</b> egg <b>counts</b> has produced sheep highly resistant to T. colubriformis, but has had less impact on resistance towards T. circumcincta...|$|R
