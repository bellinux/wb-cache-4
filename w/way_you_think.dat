If only he or some acolyte could spin a worldview around those observations, we might really have something to go on." [...] Musician Stephin Merritt wrote that Miller [...] "manages actual humor (a first in music criticism) and major insights that may change the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about, for example, 1967. Almost a new art form." [...] In a book review in Ugly Things magazine, Miller was described as [...] "a sort of fourth-generation rock and roll renaissance man capable of making the printed page jump and sing as deftly as the complex conversations that his Les Paul conducts with a Marshall stack." ...|$|E

[...] PC Gamer UK awarded the game a 91%, saying [...] "Spores triumph is painfully ironic. By setting out to instill a sense of wonderment at creation and the majesty of the universe, it's shown us that it's actually a lot more interesting to sit here at our computers and explore the contents of each other's brains." [...] In its 4.5 (of 5) -star review, GameSpy wrote [...] "Spore is a technological triumph that introduces {{a whole new way}} of tapping into a bottomless well of content." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Assistant State Attorney Jeff Ashton {{gave his}} first {{interview}} {{about the case}} on The View. Ashton said of the verdict, [...] "Obviously, it's not the outcome we wanted. But {{from the perspective of}} what we do, this was a fantastic case." [...] He disagrees with those who state the prosecution overcharged the case, saying, [...] "The facts that we had... this was first-degree murder. I think it all came down to the evidence. I think ultimately it came down to the cause of death." [...] Ashton additionally explained that if the jury did not perceive first-degree murder when they saw the photograph of Caylee's skull with the duct tape, [...] "then so be it". He said he accepts the jury's decision and that it has not taken away his faith in the justice system. [...] "You can't believe in {{the rule of law and}} not accept that sometimes it doesn't go the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it should", stated Ashton, and explained that he understands why the case [...] "struck such a nerve" [...] with the public. [...] "I think when people see someone that they believe has so gone away from , it just outrages them." [...] Ashton also made appearances on several other talk shows in the days following, and complimented Jose Baez on his cross-examinations and as having [...] "the potential to be a great attorney".|$|E

I presently saw there was no help for it but to tell him the plain truth, and explain all the danger and trouble we had suffered through this misadventure, and, in particular, our earnest wish to be speedily quit of the ship altogether; for which reason we had resolved to carry her up to Nankin.|$|E
6000|$|SIR,--I was {{spending}} a few days at Sir William Murray's, Ochtertyre, and did not get your obliging letter till to-day I came to town. I was still more unlucky in catching a miserable cold, for which the medical gentlemen have ordered me into close confinement under pain of death-- the severest of penalties. In two or three days, if I get better, and if I hear at your lodgings that you are still at Dalswinton, I will take a ride to Dumfries directly. From something in your last, I would wish to explain my idea of being your tenant. I {{want to be a}} farmer in a small farm, about a plough-gang, in a pleasant country, under the auspices of a good landlord. I have no foolish notion of being a tenant on easier terms than another. To find a farm where one can live at all is not easy--I only mean living soberly, like an old-style farmer, and joining personal industry. The banks of the Nith are as sweet poetic ground as any I ever saw; and besides, Sir, 'tis but justice to the feelings of my own heart and the opinion of my best friends, to say that I would wish to call you landlord sooner than any landed gentleman I know. These are my views and wishes; and in whatever <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> best to lay out your farms I shall be happy to rent one of them. I shall certainly be able to ride to Dalswinton about the middle of next week, if I hear that you are not gone.--I have the honour to be, Sir, your obliged humble servant, ...|$|E

Assuming {{those two}} persons to be {{appointed}} lay members, will you state in what <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they would do mischief in the councils of the Academy?--We should be disturbing elements, whereas what I should try to secure, if I {{had anything to do}} with its arrangements, would be entire tranquillity, a regular system of tuition in which there should be little excitement, and little operation of popular, aristocratic, or any other disturbing influence; none of criticism, and therefore none of tiresome people like myself;--none of money patronage, or even of aristocratic patronage. The whole aim of the teachers should be to produce work which could be demonstrably shown to be good and useful, and worthy of being bought, or used in any way; and after that the whole question of patronage and interest should be settled. The school should teach its art-grammar thoroughly in everything, and in every material, and should teach it carefully; and that could be done if a perfect system were adopted, and above all, if a few thoroughly good examples were put before the students. That is a point which I think of very great importance. I think it very desirable that grants should be made by the Government to obtain for the pupils of the Academy beautiful examples of every kind, the very loveliest and best; not too many; and that their minds should not be confused by having placed before them examples of all schools and times; they are confused enough by what they see in the shops, and in the annual exhibitions. Let engraving be taught by Marc Antonio and Albert Dürer,--painting by Giorgione, Paul Veronese, Titian and Velasquez,--and sculpture by good Greek and selected Roman examples, and let there be no question of other schools or their merits. Let those things be shown as good and right, and let the student be trained in those principles:--if afterwards he strikes out an original path, let him; but do not let him torment himself and other people with his originalities, till he knows what is right, so far as is known at present.|$|E
