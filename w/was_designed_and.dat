5|$|As the {{popularity}} of waterparks increased, the H20hhh Zone was added in 1985. In 1989, the park expanded across the Loyalhanna Creek by adding a trolley ride based on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, a popular children's television show. The ride <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> voiced by children's entertainer Fred Rogers, a native of Latrobe. The area was expanded the following year to include Raccoon Lagoon, an area for children. A Ferris wheel, Tilt-A-Whirl and a water raft ride were added {{by the end of}} the 1980s, along with games, new food stands and restaurants.|$|E
5|$|At his request, Henry {{was buried}} in Westminster Abbey {{in front of the}} church's high altar, in the former resting place of Edward the Confessor. A few years later, work began on a grander tomb for the King and in 1290 Edward moved his father's body to its current {{location}} in Westminster Abbey. His gilt-brass funeral effigy <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> forged within the abbey grounds by William Torell; unlike other effigies of the period, it is particularly naturalistic in style, but it is probably not a close likeness of Henry himself.|$|E

5|$|British {{aircraft}} manufacturer Avro built {{a factory in}} south Chadderton in 1938–39, later known as BAE Chadderton. It {{was one of the}} largest employers in the area, producing a variety of aircraft models including Ansons, Manchesters and Bristol Blenheims. During the Second World War, 3,050 Avro Lancaster bombers were built at the Chadderton factory—over 40percent of the Royal Air Force's fleet. Post World War Two the Avro Vulcan <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> built, as well as the Avro Shackleton and Avro Lincoln. After the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977, Avro became part of the nationalised British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) and produced commercial aircraft for Boeing and Airbus.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses {{of the funeral}} and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the late 18th century, very few of the selected delegates were present on the designated day of May 14, 1787, and it was not until May 25 that a quorum of seven states was secured. (New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until more than halfway through the proceedings, on July 23.) James Madison arrived first, and soon most of the Virginia delegation arrived. While waiting for the other delegates, the Virginia delegation produced the Virginia Plan, which <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> written by James Madison. On May 25, the delegations convened in the Pennsylvania State House.|$|E

5|$|Fort Tanjong Katong <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> {{built in}} 1879 by Henry Edward McCallum, {{who was the}} Colonial Engineer and Architect of the Singapore History Museum on Stamford Road. The fort {{reflected}} the British concerns that other European powers such as the Netherlands and Russia, might attack the strategically located colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. On the island of Sentosa, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Fort Serapong were built {{around the same time}} as Fort Tanjong Katong, to guard the western and eastern entrances to the New Harbour (now Keppel Harbour).|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Haifa became {{important}} to the Bahá'í Faith when {{the remains of the}} Báb, founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of Bahá'u'lláh in the Bahá'í Faith, were moved from Acre to Haifa and interred in the shrine built on Mount Carmel. Bahá'ís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh in Acre. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bahá'u'lláh himself to his eldest son, `Abdu'l-Bahá, in 1891. `Abdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> completed several years later by his grandson, Shoghi Effendi. In a separate room, the remains of `Abdu'l-Bahá were buried in November 1921.|$|E
5|$|Innovations to the {{mechanical}} clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, {{and discovered that}} it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10seconds, very accurate for their time.|$|E

According to lead graphics designer Alvar Jansson, new graphical features {{were introduced to the}} engine during the development of Mad Max and it <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> optimized for open-world games. The team also worked on improving the world's draw distance and ensuring that gameplay across the three major platforms have no significant difference.|$|E
5|$|Nouakchott was a {{small village}} of little {{importance}} until 1958, when it {{was chosen as the}} capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. It <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> built to accommodate 15,000 people, but droughts and increasing desertification since the 1970s have displaced a vast number of Mauritanians who resettled in Nouakchott. This caused massive urban growth and overcrowding, with the city having an official population of just under a million as of 2013. The resettled population inhabited slum areas under poor conditions, but the living conditions of a portion of these inhabitants have since been ameliorated.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of the land walls stands the second major {{entrance}} to the city, the Gate of Ploče. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch. The Outer Gate of Ploče <b>was</b> <b>designed</b> <b>and</b> constructed by architect Mihajlo Hranjac in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in the 15th century by Paskoje Miličević. Miličević was also designed the Pile Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges. Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pile, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.|$|E
