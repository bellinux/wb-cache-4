Increases were made in unemployment benefits, while substantial improvements in benefits were made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, {{which led to a}} doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period. By 1979, old age and survivors’ benefits were 53% higher in real terms than in 1970, while family benefits were 95% higher.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his lack}} of a clear {{strategy}} and political experience, however, Torres soon alienated all sectors of Bolivian society. He found {{it very difficult to}} organize groups on the left because they confronted him with demands that he could not meet, such as giving them half of all cabinet seats. The workers, students, and parties of the left wanted a socialist state and saw the Torres government only as a step in that direction. In June 1970, the Torres regime established the Popular Assembly (Asamblea Popular) in an attempt to form an alternative popular government. Consisting mainly of representatives of workers' and peasants' organizations, the Popular Assembly was intended to serve as a base for the radical transformation of society. However, the left remained divided by ideological differences and rivalry for leadership. They could not agree on controversial issues dealing with full <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> in state and private enterprises, the creation of armed militias, and the establishment of popular tribunals having legal jurisdiction over crimes against the working class. No consensus was achieved, and many delegates, resenting the lack of power to enforce the resolutions and running short of funds, returned home prematurely. The Popular Assembly did, however, succeed in weakening the government by creating a climate in which popular organizations acted independently from the state.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of economic effects of <b>workers</b> <b>participation</b> is not simple from the methodical {{point of view}} because of specific characteristics of establishments with works councils. Especially recent studies show contradictory results. In this study problems are pointed out, discussed, and options for solution are presented on the example of <b>workers</b> <b>participation</b> in East German establishments of industry and construction by the IABEstablishment Panel. An optimal matching-algorithm which supplies good matching-results for small samples to assign ‘statistical establishment-twins’ is applied. But by reason of very short primarily spells it can only calculate short time effects. Therefore, the matching method is additionally used to construct longer observation periods. By this new application establishments with recently founded works councils are matched with so called ‘proxy establishments’ with existing works councils. As a result short observation periods are prolonged and information about long-term effects can be given. The effects on productivity, profitability and qualification level of employees show neither in short-term nor in long-term {{a significant impact on}} workers’ <b>participation.</b> <b>workers</b> <b>participation,</b> works councils, microeconometric evaluation, matching method...|$|R
2500|$|Bieber was GM Department Director {{for just}} {{two and a}} half years, but {{negotiated}} a historic contract with General Motors (GM) in 1982. The early 1980s recession and competition from Japanese automakers had cut very deeply into GM's market share, and the company had laid off more than 140,000 of its 330,000 production workers (roughly half its workforce). UAW membership had fallen to 1.2 million from a peak of 1.5 million in 1979. In March 1981, nine months after Bieber became GM Department head, GM asked the union to reopen its contract and negotiation concessions but the union refused. In November 1981, however, GM began using its <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> program to convince its unionized employees to reopen their contract. Bieber strongly criticized the company for generating [...] "distrust of the U.A.W. leadership", [...] "spoonfeed" [...] a [...] "captive audience", and perverting the <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> program into a means to [...] "propagandize or parrot the current views of {{the chairman of the board}} of G.M. as to how to save G.M. through worker sacrifice." [...] But behind the scenes, UAW President Douglas Fraser, Bieber, and others were secretly already talking with GM about reopening the contract. The union agreed to enter into talks in January 1982, hoping to win job security commitments for its members in exchange for wage and benefit concessions. The decision was a historic one, as it was only the second time in UAW history that the union had agreed to reopen a contract. It was historic as well as it was the first concessionary contract the union had negotiated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} strategy of General Velasco's government {{was shaped by}} a conception frequently advocated in Latin America but rarely put into practice. The idea {{was to find a}} [...] "third way" [...] between capitalism and socialism, with a corporatist society much more inclusionary than that possible under capitalism but without rejecting private ownership or adopting any of the compulsory methods identified with communism. Under this strategy, land reform was designed to override existing property interests in order to establish cooperative ownership, rejecting both individual private farming and state farms. Promoting <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> in ownership and management was intended to reshape labor relations. Foreign influences were reduced through tight restrictions on foreign investment and nationalization of some of the largest foreign firms. On a more fundamental plane, the Velasco government saw its mission as one of eliminating class conflict and reconciling differences among interest groups within its own vision of a cooperative society.|$|E
2500|$|Rathenau was a {{moderate}} liberal in politics, and after World War I, {{he was one}} of the founders of the German Democratic Party (DDP), but he moved to the Left in the advent of post war chaos. Passionate about rights of social equality, he rejected state ownership of industry and instead advocated greater <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> in the management of companies. [...] His ideas were influential in postwar governments. [...] He was put forward as a socialist candidate for first President; but on standing in the Reichstag was dismissed amid [...] "rows and shrieks of laughter" [...] which visibly upset the man. [...] Ebert's election by the Left failed to heal the deep rifts and social divisions in German society that occurred throughout the Weimar. [...] Rathenau advised that a small town in central Germany was the wrong place for the capital and seat of Government. [...] But his own adequacy was under-appreciated; immediately giving rise to extreme right-wing organizations within months of the Communist-inspired Spartacist Revolt, [...] "the product of a state in which for centuries no one has ruled who was not a member of, or a convert to military feudalism....," [...] he told the Reichstag, at once deploring the foundation of the Fatherland Party in 1917. In 1918 he established the ZAG living through his philosophy of Deutsche Gemeinwirtschaft a collective economic community.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the modern}} scheme of {{legislation}} and regulation engenders {{a comprehensive approach}} to enforcement and <b>worker</b> <b>participation</b> for health and safety matters, the common law remains relevant for getting civil law compensation, and some limits on an employers' duties. Although the legislative provisions are not automatic, breach of a statutory duty is evidence that a civil law duty has been breached. Injured employees can generally claim for loss of income, and relatives or dependents recover small sums to reflect distress. In principle, employers are vicariously liable for all actions of people acting {{for them in the}} [...] "course of employment" [...] whenever their actions have a [...] "close connection" [...] to the job, and even if it breaks an employer's rules. Only if an employee is on a [...] "frolic of his own", and the employer cannot be said to have placed him in a position to cause harm, will the employer have a defence. Under the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969, employers must take out insurance for all injury costs, and insurance companies are precluded by law and practice from suing their employees to recover costs unless there is fraud. However, until the mid-20th century there were a series of major limitations. First, until 1937, if an employee was injured by a co-worker, the doctrine of common employment, the employer could only be liable if it was shown they were personally liable by carelessness in selecting staff. The House of Lords changed this in Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English, holding an employer had a non-delegable duty of care for all employees. Lord Wright held there were [...] "fundamental obligations of a contract of employment... for which employers are absolutely responsible". The second old restriction was that, until 1891, volenti non fit injuria meant workers were assumed to voluntarily accept the dangers of their work by agreeing to their contracts of employment. Only if an employee callously ignores clear directions of the employer will he be taken to have voluntarily assumed the risk, like in ICI Ltd v Shatwell where an experience quarry shotfirer said he [...] "could not be bothered" [...] to wait 10 minutes before setting of a detonation, and blew up his brother. Third, even if a worker was slightly at fault, until 1945 such contributory negligence precluded the whole of the claim. Now the court will only reduce damages by the amount the employee contributed to their own injury. The fourth defence available to employers, which still exists, is ex turpi causa non oritur actio, that if the employee was engaged in any illegal activity they may not claim compensation for injuries. In Hewison v Meridian Shipping Services Pte Ltd Mr Hewison concealed his epilepsy so that he could work offshore was technically guilty of illegally attempting to gain a pecuniary advantage by deception under the Theft Act 1968 section 16. After being struck in the head by a defective gangplank he suffered worse fits than before, but the Court of Appeal, by a majority, held his illegal act precluded any compensation.|$|E

The survey will cover the main features of <b>workers???</b> <b>participation</b> systems in the United States, Britain, Norway, France, West-Germany and Yugoslavia. The typology of those systems considered here will include: collective bargaining, profit sharing, joint consultation, joint management, co-determination and self-management. The theoretical part will posit an ???anthropological prolegomena. ??? That is, it will deal with man, in general, as being subject to dialectic of existence. This dialectic will make a distinction between ???forms of man???s being" and??? contentual aspects of man's existence. ???These two interrelated ???constellations??? are argued to be at the basis of a phenomenon known as alienation, the latter being a theme constantly recurring throughout the thesis. My essential proposal is for democracy as a "way of life??? conducive to the realization of permanent change. By this I suggest a positive orientation toward social change as an intrinsic good. Implied here, is a reconstructive approach, by way of planning, toward a "genuine??? democratic society.

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} results and experiences from development of new technology, a training program and implementation of strategies {{for the use of}} a video exposure monitoring method, PIMEX. Starting point of this study is an increased incidence of asthma among workers in the aluminium industry. Exposure peaks of fumes are supposed to play an important role. PIMEX makes it possible to link used work practice, use of control technology, and so forth to peaks. Nine companies participated in the project, which was divided into three parts, development of PIMEX technology, production of training material, and training in use of equipment and related strategies. The use of the video exposure monitoring method PIMEX offers prerequisites supporting <b>workers</b> <b>participation</b> in safety activities. The experiences from the project reveal the importance of good timing of primary training, technology development, technical support, and follow up training. In spite of a delay of delivery of the new technology, representatives from the participating companies declared that the experiences showed that PIMEX gave an important contribution for effective control of hazards in the companies. Eight out of nine smelters used the PIMEX method {{as a part of a}} strategy for control of workers exposure to fumes in potrooms. Possibilities to conduct effective control measures were identified.
