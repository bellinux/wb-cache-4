50|$|Some {{chunks of}} the MSR {{partition}} may {{also be used for}} remapping damaged sectors by software (in the device driver), or used as a temporary mirror for critical operations on the core GPT structure or in emergency for fast writing of the internal disk cache memory in case of power failure (many disks have a fast write-through cache memory generally not exceeding 32 MB, and the MSR created by Windows is generally 128MB by default but may be larger in some systems), and for fast recovery <b>when</b> <b>powering</b> <b>up</b> the system. Contents in the MSR generally have some data signature to identify the content and make sure it is meaningful, but this signature is vendor-specific to each hardware component using it.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} microcomputers, {{such as the}} Altair 8800 (released {{first in}} 1975) and an even earlier, similar machine (based on the Intel 8008 CPU) had no bootstrapping hardware as such. When started, the CPU would see memory that would contain executable code containing only binary zeros—memory was cleared by resetting <b>when</b> <b>powering</b> <b>up.</b> The front panels of these machines carried toggle switches for entering addresses and data, one switch per bit of the computer memory word and address bus. Simple additions to the hardware permitted one memory location {{at a time to}} be loaded from those switches to store bootstrap code. Meanwhile, the CPU was kept from attempting to execute memory content. Once correctly loaded, the CPU was enabled to execute the bootstrapping code. This process was tedious and had to be error-free.|$|E

Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries.

A-type is Volcanic Fire, a flamethrower that gains <b>power</b> and length <b>when</b> <b>powered</b> <b>up.</b> Its alternate attack is a lock-on that will allow it to curve around obstacles to hit the enemy. B-type is Corrosive Acid, which resembles a fire hose, and can be changed between a tight flow and a wide spout. C-Type is Molten Metal, which bursts in arcs causing heavy damage. For its alternate attack, Tempest spins and fires homing bursts from all four arms at once. In addition to his unique alien weaponry, Tempest features a bullet reflecting shield. As bullets approach him, the shield slows them and turns them green. If the player stops firing briefly, all the slowed bullets reflect back at the enemy.|$|R

In {{addition to the}} standard walk, the player can perform a crouching walk by pressing the joystick diagonally downward. The player can jump to higher or lower floors by pressing the jump button while holding the joystick up or down. The protagonist Joe Musashi's standard weapons are an unlimited supply of shurikens, along with punches and kicks when attacking at close range. Rescuing certain hostages in each stage will grant him an attack upgrade. <b>When</b> <b>powered</b> <b>up,</b> his throwing stars are replaced by a gun that fires large, explosive bullets, and his close-range attack becomes a katana slash. Musashi's ninjutsu techniques can only be used once per stage and will clear the screen of all enemies, {{or in the case}} of enemy bosses, greatly damage them. There are three ninjutsu techniques in the game (a thunderstorm, a tornado and a doppelganger attack) that vary depending on the stage, although the effect is the same no matter which technique Musashi uses (only the animation changes).|$|R
