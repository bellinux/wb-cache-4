5|$|Beyond {{these initial}} prosecutions, the ecclesia {{attacked}} Pericles himself by {{asking him to}} justify his ostensible profligacy with, and maladministration of, public money. According to Plutarch, Pericles <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of the oncoming trial {{that he did not}} let the Athenians yield to the Lacedaemonians. Beloch also believes that Pericles deliberately brought on the war to protect his political position at home. Thus, {{at the start of the}} Peloponnesian War, Athens found itself in the awkward position of entrusting its future to a leader whose pre-eminence had just been seriously shaken for the first time in over a decade.|$|E
25|$|On August 12, 1996 22-year-old Cindy Nannay was {{fatally shot}} outside Bozorth Hall by her estranged boyfriend, who then killed himself. Nannay <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of Scott Lonabaugh, 27, {{that when he}} arrived on the campus to see her, she asked friends to {{accompany}} her to the parking lot, the Gloucester County Prosecutor's office said. As her friends looked on, Mr. Lonabaugh shot Ms. Nannay twice with a shotgun and then {{shot himself in the}} head, prosecutors said. Both died at the scene.|$|E
25|$|In 1380, Hồ Quý Ly had a minor {{victory over}} the troop of Chế Bồng Nga in Thanh Hóa, as a result, Đỗ Tử Bình {{had to give up}} his control of Đại Việt army to Hồ Quý Ly. However, in June 1383, Chế Bồng Nga opened a major {{campaign}} against Đại Việt, this time Trần Nghệ Tông <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of the ennemy that he escaped from Thăng Long ignoring advice from the royal court. This coward decision of Nghệ Tông was heavily criticized by the historian Ngô Sĩ Liên in his work Đại Việt sử kí toàn thư. In the northern border, the Ming Dynasty also began to expose their ambition of invading southern kingdoms like Đại Việt and Champa.|$|E

He later said that [...] "We have no word for downhill in Senegalese because we have no mountains. I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> I almost threw up.

500|$|Ross Kananga {{suggested}} the stunt of Bond [...] jumping on crocodiles, and was enlisted by the producers to perform it. The scene took five {{takes to be}} completed, including {{one in which the}} last crocodile snapped at Kananga's heel, tearing his trousers. The production also had trouble with snakes. The script supervisor <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> that she refused to be on set with them; an actor fainted while filming a scene where he is killed by a snake; Jane Seymour became terrified as a reptile got closer, and Geoffrey Holder only agreed to fall into the snake-filled casket because Princess Alexandra was visiting the set.|$|E

[...] "Oh, my gosh, I <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> about that," [...] she said. [...] "I was trying to go for something completely different, but the problem was that the writers left it so ambiguous; the character was such a blank slate. I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] I kept the humor; I always like to play a little bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first ! So I went for heterosexual, pretty, funny. And smarter!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Athenian {{victory at}} Naupactus {{put an end}} to Sparta's attempt to {{challenge}} Athens in the Corinthian gulf and the Northwest, and secured Athens' dominance at sea. [...] At Naupactus, the Athenians' backs had been against the wall; a defeat there would have lost Athens its foothold in the Corinthian gulf and encouraged the Peloponnesians to attempt further aggressive operations at sea. [...] In 428 BC, the Spartans would be so cowed by the memory of their defeats at Phormio's hands that they sent no aid to Athens' rebellious subject Mytilene in that year. In 427, when they finally did send a fleet, the commander <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of being caught at sea by the Athenians that he fled home without accomplishing anything.|$|E
2500|$|Although Burton's {{testimony}} did {{not prove}} that any crime had been committed, the grand jury <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> that more fires would occur that they decided to believe her. The city council also decided to pay a high reward to anybody who provided useful information about the conspiracy: £100 to a white person, £45 to a free black or Indian, and £20 and freedom to a slave. Such prices attracted more testimony. On May 2, the court found Caesar and Prince guilty of burglary and condemned them to death. The next day seven barns caught fire. Two blacks were caught and immediately burned at stake. On May 6, the Hughsons and Peggy were found guilty of burglary charges. Peggy, [...] "in fear of her life, decided to talk." [...] Some of the blacks who had been imprisoned in the dungeons also decided to talk. Two who did not talk were Caesar and Prince, who were hanged on May 11.|$|E
2500|$|The largely unenthusiastic press {{reaction}} to the album caused the individual members of the band to lose faith {{in the concept of}} an ongoing, periodic series of band reunions and ultimately, all five members returned to their own careers following the album's release. [...] In the following years, the band themselves would echo many of the sentiments expressed by the music press, with the general consensus being that the recording of the album was rushed and ill-thought out. [...] Gene Clark offered his thoughts on the album during a 1977 interview: [...] "I am disappointed in that album. Some of the harsh criticism is unjust, because, if you listen to it carefully, the album isn't that bad, but it just hasn't got the punch that it could have had if we'd taken the time." [...] Chris Hillman concurred with Clark, telling The Byrds' biographer Johnny Rogan [...] "In all honesty, we didn't have enough time on the album. They gave us one-and-a-half months to do that album, expecting guys to regroup after a five to six year absence." [...] Hillman also cited the band's eagerness to avoid conflict as a contributing factor to the album's artistic failure: [...] "everybody <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>afraid</b> of stepping on the other person's feet because of the tension that had gone down six years prior to that, that it became a bland album. Everybody was being too nice to each other." [...] McGuinn blamed the reunion album's lack of success, at least partly, on the hedonism exhibited by members of the band during the recording process: [...] "David had this incredibly strong pot. Half a joint and you couldn't do anything. We were stoned out of our minds the whole time. I don't remember much recording." ...|$|E
