500|$|First {{collected}} on 4 September 1966, southeast of <b>Walkaway,</b> Banksia scabrella {{was described by}} Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus Banksia. He gave it the epithet scabrella, a diminutive of the Latin adjective scaber [...] "rough", referring to the leaves. George placed B.scabrella in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He initially thought its closest relative to be Banksia leptophylla, which {{is found in the}} same region, and later felt it to be B. lanata, which has similarly coloured inflorescences but longer smooth leaves. It was one of several new species previously regarded as a form of Banksia sphaerocarpa.|$|E
500|$|Banksia scabrella {{is found}} in two disjunct areas of {{scattered}} populations; the first discovered being southeast of {{the small town of}} <b>Walkaway</b> south of Geraldton, while a more populous cluster is found southeast of Mount Adams in Western Australia.

It has been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List, where it is classified as a [...] "Priority Four – Rare" [...] taxon; although it is rare, it is not currently threatened by any identifiable factors. These taxa require monitoring every 5 to 10 years. Many stands are populous, and number over 100 plants. However, over half the known population of B. scabrella is found on road verges. Found in deep pale yellow or white sand in kwongan scrubland and heathland, B. scabrella grows on flat areas or gentle slopes and {{is found in}} association with B. leptophylla and a dwarf form of B. attenuata.|$|E

50|$|The {{primary reason}} for bank <b>walkaways</b> is that a bank expects to lose money by foreclosing - when {{proceeds}} from a foreclosure sale {{are expected to be}} insufficient {{to cover the cost of}} the foreclosure itself, together with securing, maintaining, and marketing the home for sale.

This article explores {{what is happening to}} homeowners caught up in the strange world of bank <b>walkaways</b> as the economy is beginning to improve.
