500|$|In a floridly worded proclamation, {{published}} on 10 November and addressed “To The Men of New York”, Smyth wrote that, “in {{a few days}} the troops under my command will plant the American standard in Canada” and he urged New Yorkers not to “stand <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> folded and look on in this interesting struggle” but to “advance…to our aid. I will wait for you a few days.” [...] Smyth’s statement of intent appears to have attracted no attention from his opponents across the border.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> rebellious dog!" [...] {{shouted the}} colonel, carried beyond himself by the ardor of the fray; [...] "down to the dust, and implore {{the mercy of}} your injured prince!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Bah!” Ossipon contradicted. “Don’t be {{too sure}} of that. What’s to prevent half-a-dozen of them jumping upon you from {{behind in the}} street? <b>With</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> pinned to your sides you could do nothing—could you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{would sit}} in {{chambers}} shady, [...] When the light was growing dim, [...] Ah, my fickle-hearted lady! [...] <b>With</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> embracing him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> {{and that}} sort of thing, yes. But I may have to look to you for {{something}} more. I feel as if something were going to happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Ernest," [...] {{the marquis}} called as they approached, [...] "we {{thought you had}} lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the matter <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> {{and what have you}} got there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But is it possible, Philip," [...] {{the countess}} said in tones of horror, [...] "that {{you used to}} wrestle and to fight? Fight <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> and fists against rough boys, the sons {{of all sorts of}} common people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> you Englishmen!" [...] {{said the}} daring intruder; [...] "and you, who {{fight in the}} cause of sacred liberty, stay your hands, that no {{unnecessary}} blood may flow. Yield yourself, proud Briton, {{to the power of the}} Thirteen Republics!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are growing}} up mightily like your father, and promise to be as big and as strong as we both are. Your eyes speak of a bold disposition, and my brother tells me that you are already well practised <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No!" [...] said McTurk firmly. [...] "He's a {{dirty little}} brute, and he'd mess up everything. Besides, we ain't goin' {{to have any}} beastly Erickin'. D'you want to walk about <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> round his neck?" ...|$|R
60|$|FRANK. My dear Viv: she wouldn't {{appreciate}} it: the {{two cases}} require different treatment. But what on earth has happened to you? Last night we were perfectly agreed as to your mother and her set. This morning I find you attitudinizing sentimentally <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> around <b>your</b> parent's waist.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would, only you mustn't stand <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> round <b>your</b> partner {{in this way}} when you are done. You must seat and fan her, if she likes it," [...] said Rose, anxious to perfect a pupil who seemed so lamentably {{in need of a}} teacher.|$|R
6000|$|... "Down <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> you mutinous dogs, or I {{will blow}} {{you into the}} air. It is useless to resist. We are {{prepared}} for you, and you are without ammunition. Throw down the arms on the decks, every man of you, before I count three, or I fire. One--two--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We propose," [...] Jack said, [...] "to {{allow you}} to march out <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> and five rounds of {{ammunition}} to each man, on you and your officers giving me your parole to consider yourselves and your men as prisoners of war, and not to serve again until exchanged." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{dreamed it}} last night. I saw you and Mistress Margaret sitting sweet as sugar, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> around each other's middles, while I {{talked to the}} master, and {{the sun went down}} with the wind blowing stiff from sou-sou-west, and a gale threatening. I tell you that I dreamed it--I who am not given to dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{changed the}} catcher and, {{ordering}} Ken to the pitcher's box, he stepped over behind him. [...] "Peg," [...] he said, speaking low, [...] "you're not tryin' for pitcher, I know, but you've got speed and control and I {{want you to}} peg 'em a few. Mind now, easy <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm.</b> By that I mean hold in, don't whip it. And you peg 'em as near where I say as you can; see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was I {{who first}} met you, Squire," [...] {{the old man}} went on, [...] "when you tottered home that night across the park, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> hanging helplessly by your side, and the blood {{streaming}} down your face and clothes, and the red light in your eyes--murderous fire, they called it. I heard her ladyship go into hysterics. I saw her laugh and sob like a maniac, and, God help us! that's what she's been ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my captive," [...] said Gallus, {{drawing his}} stool near to her, [...] "I {{want you to}} tell me what you can {{remember}} of your story. Ah! you don't know that for many days past we have dined together and that it had been your fashion to sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> round my old neck and call me your uncle. Nay, child, you need not blush, for I am more than old enough to be your father, let alone your uncle, and nothing but a father shall I ever be to you." ...|$|R
60|$|Dor. Can I speak! Alas, I cannot {{answer to}} Alonzo!-- No, Dorax cannot answer to Alonzo; Alonzo was too kind {{a name for}} me. Then, when I fought and conquered <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> In that blest age, I was the man you named: Till rage and pride debased me into Dorax, And lost, like Lucifer, my name above.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but {{you shall}} march <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> bound {{until we are}} there, and the fight wi' the redskins is over," [...] said the robber-chief, [...] "and if I find treachery in your acts or looks I'll blow your brains out on the spot. My left hand, you shall find, can {{work as well as}} the right wi' the revolver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My master says," [...] {{answered}} the tall man, [...] "that {{you have with}} you that which is of more value than all the king's gold--a very fair lady, of whom someone has urgent need. Give her up now, and go your way <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> and horses, for you are gallant young men, whose blood we {{do not wish to}} shed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Miss Bessie," [...] {{he called}} out in English, [...] "there you are, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> pretty <b>arms</b> all bare. I'm in luck to be {{just in time to}} see them. Shall I come and help you to wash the feathers? Only say the word, now----" ...|$|R
60|$|How do you do, ma'am? You {{are looking}} charming to-day! I am {{delighted to see}} you. Favour me <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> ma'am; we'll have a little walk together, you and me, if you'll honour me <b>with</b> <b>your</b> company.' And so escorted Mr F.'s Aunt down the private {{staircase}} of the counting-house with great gallantry and success. The patriarchal Mr Casby then rose with the air of having done it himself, and blandly followed: leaving his daughter, as she followed in her turn, to remark to her former lover in a distracted whisper (which she very much enjoyed), that they had drained the cup of life to the dregs; and further to hint mysteriously that the late Mr F. {{was at the bottom}} of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brave!" [...] she repudiated. [...] "I love you. I {{never knew}} how much, how really much, I loved you as when I was losing you. And now let's work for shore. I want you all alone <b>with</b> me, <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> around me, while I tell you all you are to me and shall always be to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will find, Matteo, {{that your}} arms will ache, {{so that you}} cannot hold them up, {{before the end of}} the three hours. Sawing like that, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> above your head, is most fatiguing; and even the short spells of work we have been having made my arms ache. However, each must do as much as he can in his three hours; and as we are working in the dark, we must work slowly and carefully, or we shall break our tools." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now brace yourself! Spread your legs. And {{straighten}} out." [...] With {{his hands}} he manipulated {{her arms and}} shoulders into position. [...] "Remember, you've got to meet {{the first of the}} strain <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> straight out. After the strain is on, you couldn't bend 'em if you wanted to. But if the strain catches them bent, the wire'll rip the hide off of you. Remember, straight out, extended, so that they form a straight line {{with each other and with}} the flat of your back and shoulders. That's it. Ready now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You think not! What did {{you mean}} then? What were you {{thinking}} of when we were coming back in the carriage from Stamford,--when <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> round me you swore that you loved me better than all the world? Is that true? Did you so swear?" [...] What a question {{for a man to}} have to answer! It was becoming clear to him that there was nothing for him but to endure and be silent. Even to this interview the gods would at last give an end. The hour would pass, though, alas, so slowly, and she could not expect that he should stand there to be rated much after the accustomed time for feeding. [...] "You acknowledge that, and do you dare to say that I had no right to tell my friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray don't {{give the}} little service I {{rendered}} so dignified a name as `rescue.' But it rejoices {{me to know}} that I can be of further service to you--all the more that you are now so helpless; for if you found climbing the precipices difficult before, you will find it impossible now <b>with</b> <b>your</b> injured <b>arm.</b> By the way, I was very glad to find that I had been mistaken in thinking that <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> was broken. Has it given you much pain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will soon}} acquire that, lad. <b>With</b> <b>your</b> {{strength}} of <b>arm,</b> length of wind, quickness of eye, and activity, {{you will make}} a famous swordsman, in time.|$|R
60|$|The Chamber of Torture! And {{the roof}} was made of that shape to stifle the victim's cries! Oh Goblin, Goblin, let us think of this awhile, in silence. Peace, Goblin! Sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> short <b>arms</b> crossed on <b>your</b> short legs, upon that heap of stones, for only five minutes, and then flame out again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now {{you will}} be disappointed, for instead of telling you to come and study with me, or go and act in some second-rate theatre at once, I advise {{you to go back}} to school and finish your education. That is the first step, for all accomplishments are needed, and a single talent makes a very {{imperfect}} character. Cultivate mind and body, heart and soul, and make yourself an intelligent, graceful, beautiful, and healthy girl. Then, at eighteen or twenty, go into training and try your powers. Better start for the battle <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> in order, and save the hard lesson which comes when we rush on too soon. Now and then genius carries all before it, but not often. We have to climb slowly, with many slips and falls. Can you wait as well as work?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Surajah, we {{had better}} let you down first. You will be tied quite securely, {{and there will be}} no risk whatever, as you know, of the rope giving way. I should advise you to keep your eyes shut, till you get to the bottom, for the rope will {{certainly}} twist round and round; but keep your arms well in front of you, and whenever you feel the rock, open your eyes, and send yourself off <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> and legs. I don't think you will touch, for at this point it seemed to me, as I looked down, that the rock projects farther out than anywhere else on the face of the precipice, and that a stone dropped straight down would fall some fourteen or fifteen feet from its foot. Would you like me to bandage your eyes?" ...|$|E
60|$|If a mob is {{climbing}} the stairs thirsting for your blood, {{you do not want}} to stand upright <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> stretched out, a good eighteen inches from the door, while you go over at some length the varied incidents leading up to the annoyance. If your desire were to act naturally you would push against that door for all you were worth, and yell for somebody to bring you a chest of drawers and a bedstead, and things like that, to pile up against it. If you were a king, and were giving a party, you would not want your guests to fix you up at the other end of the room and leave you there, with nobody to talk to but your own wife, while they turned their backs upon you, and had a long and complicated dance all to themselves. You would want to be in it; you would want to let them know that you were king.|$|E
50|$|Use Your Attacker's Force {{against him}} Take {{advantage}} of the force your opponent gives you. If an opponent pulls you toward him, use that energy {{as part of your}} attack. Or if an opponent pushes the left side of your body, you can act as a revolving door and use that force in an attack <b>with</b> <b>your</b> right <b>arm.</b>|$|R
40|$|My Darling: I got {{two letters}} from you today. One of them only 8 days old. It seems amazing that I could have {{something}} that you had {{such a short time}} ago. I’m sorry mail to you isn’t so good, but it really is understandable when they have to carry in so many supplies etc. Anyway I have been writing quite often so I hope they all catch up with you eventually. It is wonderful to be able to send you sentences that you will sometime read. 2 ̆ 6 it’s very wonderful to get letters from you reminding me that you love me and that we’re both looking forward to the same things. But I would so much love to sit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> around me and talk for hours [...] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, {{with his}} hand to his head; [...] "some such thought was in my mind this {{afternoon}} when I heard of your riding. Stay! I have it! I was at Ampthill, Ossory's place, just before I left. Some insupportable coxcomb was boasting a marvellous run with the hounds nigh across Hertfordshire, and Miss Manners brought him up with a round turn and a half hitch by relating one of your exploits, Richard Carvel. And take my word on't she got no small applause. She told how you had followed a fox over one of your rough provincial counties, which means three of Hertfordshire, <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> broken, by Heaven! and how they lifted you off at the death. And, Mr. Carvel," [...] said my Lord, generously, looking at my flushed face, [...] "you must give me your hand for that." ...|$|R
