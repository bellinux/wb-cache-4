5|$|The {{preference}} for sons over daughters in India {{is rooted in}} social, economic and religious reasons. Women are often believed to be of a lower value in society due to their non-breadwinner status. Financial support, old age security, property inheritance, dowry and beliefs surrounding religious duties all contribute to the preference of sons over daughters. One {{of the main reasons}} behind the preference of sons is the potential burden of having to find grooms for daughters. Families of women in India often have to pay a dowry and all expenses related to marriage in order to marry off a daughter, which increases the cost associated <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> daughter.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> {{significant effect on the}} wider war through the disruption of French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E

Throughout the pregnancy, Taylor suffers with tuberculosis, although she delivers the children without medication. Steffy and Phoebe Forrester are born on September 21, 1999, as Taylor almost dies. Steffy is named after her grandmother, Stephanie Forrester (Susan Flannery). In February 2001, a family trip to Saint Thomaswhere Ridge and Taylor renew their vowsends in devastation when two-year-old Steffy supposedly falls overboard during a storm and is presumed dead. However, Steffy has been kidnapped by Ridge's unstable ex-girlfriend Morgan DeWitt (Sarah Buxton)who was previously obsessed <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child with him and Steffy is confined her to the walls of Morgan's home. Months after Steffy's supposed death, Taylor visits Morgan and discovers that Steffy is alive. Morgan then takes Taylor and Steffy hostage, but they are saved by Ridge. Morgan tries to flee but is arrested. The next year, Taylor is supposedly killed after being shot by another unstable resident, Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown), while trying to save Ridge's former love Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) from being shot. Much to Thomas, Phoebe and Steffy's dismay, Ridge marries Brooke months later. The children have difficulty accepting Brooke as their stepmother. In 2005, Taylor is found alive and she returns to her marriage to Ridge, having missed much of Steffy's childhood. In 2006, Steffy leaves town for boarding school in England after Taylor and Ridge divorce.|$|E

Amongst other things this grounds the practice of informed consent that should be respected by the nurse, although much of the debate lies in the discussion of cases where people are unable to make choices about their own treatment due to being incapacitated or having a mental illness that affects their judgement. A suggested way to maintain autonomy is for the person to write an advance directive, outlining how they wish to be treated in the event of their inability to make an informed choice, thus avoiding unwarranted paternalism.|$|E

The inner Burgos defenses contained a stronghold known as the Napoleon Battery. Historians differ as to how many heavy guns Wellington had available. Michael Glover wrote that the British had only three 18-pound cannon with 1,306 rounds. David Gates asserted that Wellington only brought eight siege guns though many more recently captured pieces were available. Chris McNab credited the British <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> total of eight 24-pound guns.|$|E
25|$|Phased array radars {{have been}} in use since the {{earliest}} years of radar in World War II (Mammut radar), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example Safeguard Program). They are {{the heart of the}} ship-borne Aegis Combat System and the Patriot Missile System. The massive redundancy associated <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, Phased array radars have been used in Weather Surveillance. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of Multi-Function Phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} version contains hints of Romantic themes when it mourns {{the death of}} Chatterton. Coleridge was influenced by John Milton's Lycidas, Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and the poetry of both William Bowles and Thomas Warton. Gray's particular influence was in word choice and Coleridge's incorporating the image of Chatterton as a young poet. Warton's The Suicide provides a connection to Chatterton by describing a poor poet killing himself. Although Warton {{made it clear that}} he was not thinking of Chatterton when composing the poem, Coleridge believed that there was a connection, and he believed that Warton's depiction was too unfavourable towards Chatterton. Coleridge was personally affected by the idea of Chatterton's death and how the poet was ruined by debt. Of the later point, Coleridge knew of poverty affecting many poets that he admired along <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> lot of experience with his own debt and poverty.|$|E
25|$|The game's story {{focuses around}} Vyse, a young air pirate in a fantasy world, {{and his friends}} {{as they attempt to}} stop the Valuan Empire from {{reviving}} ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world. The game contained the traditional Japanese role-playing game mechanics of early Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, entries, such as turn-based battles and experience point-based character progression, but put its own twist on the genre <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> greater focus on exploration, through allowing the player to fly and battle with, a large airship in 3D space among many floating islands and landmasses. The game was well received by critics, even becoming one of the best reviewed games on the Dreamcast, but the critical success did not translate to sales, with the game generally not considered to have performed well commercially. Sequels and re-releases have arisen over time as possibilities, but to date have not materialized to any actual releases, though the characters have been featured in a number of Sega-related properties, notably the Valkryia Chronicles series of video games.|$|E
25|$|Braathens SAFE {{conducted}} {{its first}} landing {{at the airport}} on 9 May 1952, using a de Havilland Heron aircraft. Regular services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu commenced on 18 August 1953. The airline marketed itself <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> much more central airport than SAS, allowing for shorter travel times than those traveling via Værnes. The lack of a hard landing surface caused seasonal disruptions in operations and in rainy periods Braathens SAFE had to reroute its services to Værnes. As the aircraft also had to use visual flight rules, during foggy weather it was also forced to land at Værnes. During the period that Braathens operated at Lade, it had the responsibility for local air traffic control. Passengers were checked in at the reception of Hotel Astoria in the city center and then bused to the airport. At first there were three weekly round services, increasing to a daily except Saturday service from May 1954. The route had 3900 in 1953. Braathens moved their Lade services to Værnes in 1956, as Lade {{was not able to}} accommodate their new, larger Fokker F-27 Friendship aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, Unomásunos {{circulation}} in Mexico City was of 7,000. Several of its closes competitors greatly surpassed Unomásunos circulation; La Jornada had 60,000, while Excélsior had 40,000. The following year, Unomásuno {{was not among}} the top newspapers in Mexico with certified daily circulation above 18,000. Its rival Excélsior was on {{the top half of}} the list with 55,492 confirmed daily circulations. Without the financial backing from the PRI that it once benefited from, Unomásuno was unable to increase its daily circulation. It was also because Unomásuno was marginalized by its readers following the defeat of the PRI by the National Action Party (PAN) in the 2000 presidential elections. By 2005, Unomásunos quality and readership had declined, in large due to its publications being characterized <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> cult of personality, yellow journalism, and for reporting gossip short-stories as factual accounts. In addition, the design was not appealing to many its readers, was difficult to read, was sometimes poorly printed, and was made from recycled paper.

25|$|A {{different}} {{method for}} determining sentiment {{is the use}} of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.|$|E

Danielle is devastated, and is later seen clutching a locket containing {{a photograph of}} Ronnie, revealing herself to be Ronnie's daughter. It transpires that Danielle {{is the result of}} a teenage romance between Ronnie and her first boyfriend, Joel Reynolds (Cavan Clerkin). Archie disapproved of the pregnancy and put Danielle—named Amy by Ronnie—up for adoption. Danielle was adopted by Lizzie and Andy Jones (Aneirin Hughes), and is now trying to locate her birth mother. On Archie and Peggy's wedding day, Danielle tells Ronnie that she is her daughter. Ronnie does not believe her because Archie told her that her daughter is dead, and throws her out. She later realises that Danielle was telling the truth and tries to apologise to Danielle but she is hit by Janine Butcher's (Charlie Brooks) car and dies in Ronnie's arms. Danielle's adoptive father, Andy, comes to London to get her and takes Danielle's remains back to Telford and bans Ronnie from the funeral. Despite this, Ronnie goes to Telford and Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) convinces Andy to talk to Ronnie about Danielle. Grieving for the daughter she was not allowed to raise, Ronnie becomes obsessed <b>with</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> baby.
