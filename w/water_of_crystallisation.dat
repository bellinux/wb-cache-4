Materials synthesised were characterised {{using a variety}} of techniques, including powder neutron and X-ray diffraction, Rietveld analysis, thermogravimetic analysis and environmental scanning microscopy. Monovalent ion exchange (with Na, K, Rb, Cs and Ag) gave complete and facile exchange of the host’s hydrogen ions and gave crystalline products. A thermodynamically favoured phase with two <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> was observed for all monovalent cation exchanges. The alkali metals also showed metastable phases with differing numbers <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation,</b> four for Na and one for K, Rb and Cs. Unit cells have been assigned to the exchanged phases, with all showing a more than doubling of the a parameter. Structural characterisation of the rubidium and caesium phases show this to be a result of a change of symmetry to C 2 /c causing adjacent layers to shift half a unit cell along [010] with respect to one another. Ion exchange with divalent cations (Cu, Mn, Zn, Ca and Sr) has also been shown to be possible, with phases showing altered XRD patterns and decomposition products. Intercalation with a range of increasingly complex amines was found to be possible in AlTP. Multifunctional molecules, including amino acids, were also found to intercalate into AlTP, with evidence in the intercalation of 6 -aminohexanoic acid that interactions between intercalated molecules within the inter-lamellar region are possible. Trends were found to be similar to other layered phosphates with respect to the amounts and angles of intercalation of simple monoamines and the effects of pK_b and sterics upon an amines ability to intercalate into AlTP. In addition, intercalation with silver exchanged AlTP was also found to be possible. This was able to intercalate several similar amines to AlTP, but showed its own unique intercalation properties including the ability to intercalate thiols.

60|$|The {{phosphate}} {{of ammonia}} {{is much more}} powerful than the nitrate. A drop containing 1/3840 of a grain (.0169 mg.) placed on the disc of a sensitive leaf causes most of the exterior tentacles to be inflected, as well as the blade of the leaf. A minute drop containing 1/153600 of a grain (.000423 mg.), applied for a few seconds to a gland, acts, as shown by the movement of the tentacle. When a leaf is immersed in thirty minims (1.7748 ml.) of a solution of one part by weight of the salt to 21,875,000 of water, the absorption by a gland of only the 1/19760000 of a grain (.00000328 mg.), that is, about the one-twenty-millionth of a grain, is sufficient to cause the tentacle bearing this gland to bend to the centre of the leaf. In this experiment, owing to the presence of the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation,</b> less than the one-thirty-millionth of a grain of the efficient elements could have been absorbed. There is nothing remarkable in such minute quantities being absorbed by the glands, [page 272] for all physiologists admit that the salts of ammonia, which must be brought in still smaller quantity by a single shower of rain to the roots, are absorbed by them. Nor is it surprising that Drosera should be enabled to profit by the absorption of these salts, for yeast and other low fungoid forms flourish in solutions of ammonia, if the other necessary elements are present. But it is an astonishing fact, on which I will not here again enlarge, that so inconceivably minute a quantity as the one-twenty-millionth of a grain of phosphate of ammonia should induce some change in a gland of Drosera, sufficient to cause a motor impulse to be sent down the whole length of the tentacle; this impulse exciting movement often through an angle of above 180o. I know not whether to be most astonished at this fact, or that the pressure of a minute bit of hair, supported by the dense secretion, should quickly cause conspicuous movement. Moreover, this extreme sensitiveness, exceeding that of the most delicate part of the human body, as well as the power of transmitting various impulses from one part of the leaf to another, have been acquired without the intervention of any nervous system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} {{phosphonium}} cations {{to act as}} intracellular transport vectors is well-established. Phosphonioalkylthiosulfate zwitterions, and ω-thioacetylalkylphosphonium salts, which act as 'masked thiolate' ligands, are useful precursors {{for the formation of}} phosphonium-functionalised gold nanoparticles, enabling the nanoparticles to be transported into cells for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In this study we have completed cytotoxicity studies of ω-thioacetylpropylphosphonium salts derived from triphenylphosphine and tri(4 -fluorophenyl) phosphine, which show that the compounds are only toxic towards PC 3 prostate cancer cells at high concentrations and at prolonged incubation periods and display IC 50 values of 67  μM and 252  μM respectively, significantly higher than those of other phosphonium salts. MALDI-TOF-MS has been used to investigate the uptake of the compounds by PC 3 cells and to quantify detectable levels of the compounds inside the cells. The structures of ω-thioacetylpropyl(tri- 4 -fluorophenyl) phosphonium bromide and the corresponding tri(4 -fluorophenyl) phosphoniopropylthiosulfate zwitterion have been investigated by single crystal X-ray crystallography. The results show that molecules of the zwitterion are held together through an extensive array of electrostatic and non-covalent interactions. The unit cell of ω-thioacetylpropyl(tri- 4 -fluorophenyl) phosphonium bromide contains eight cations together with eight bromide anions and two <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation,</b> all held together through a complex network of hydrogen bonds.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis, characterisation and structures of new geminal bisphosphonate complexes and ion-pair salts, mainly featuring (4 -amino- 1 -hydroxybutylidene) - 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (alendronate) ions. These include Group 1 (Chapter 2), Group 2 (Chapter 4), first row transition (Appendix 3) and lanthanoid metal (Appendix 1) alendronate complexes. They also include aminium ion-pair salts containing alendronate (Chapter 3) {{and two other}} related geminal bisphosphonates (Chapter 5). The Introduction (Chapter 1) discusses the fundamental properties and chemistry of the anions, cations and the bases used, with emphasis placed on alendronic acid and its’ compounds. The Introduction also includes a discussion {{of some of the}} biological aspects of geminal bisphosphonic acids. New crystal structures feature supramolecular assembles with extensive hydrogen bonding. The strongest hydrogen bonding occurred between -PO₂(OH) - and the -PO₃²⁻ groups i. e. –O₂P-O-H…O-PO₂- in doubly deprotonated alendronate ions. Presumably, this occurred to partly delocalise the charge on the two phosphonate groups. The alendronate anion showed an exceptional ability to coordinate to metal cations through a variety of different bonding modes, this possibility being alluded to in the Introduction. Geminal bisphosphonate anions have an affinity for metal ions because they are multi-oxygen donors and can be multiply charged. The varied binding modes can lead to polymorphism, exemplified by [Rb(H₄L) (H₂O) ]. H₂O and [Cs(H₄L) (H₂O) ]. H₂O (where H₅L = alendronic acid) and variable hydration (e. g. K₂(H₃L). 3 H₂O and [K(H₃L) (μ-H₂O) ₂K(H₂O) ₄]). An unusual [Rb(H₄L) (H₅L) ]. 2 H₂O structure is described which contained an uncharged alendronic acid moiety. The structure of an unexpected bimetallic complex [Cu₅ (H₂L) ₄Na₂(H₂O) ₈]. 5 H₂O, containing a triply deprotonated alendronate ion bound to Cu and Na ions, was elucidated. [Li(H₄L) (H₂O) ₂] was a mononuclear structure and all other compounds were coordination polymers. The Group 1 metal complexes are soluble and the growing of crystals was complicated by polymorphism and different hydrate formations. The Group 2, transition and lanthanoid complexes are insoluble in polar solvents making it difficult to grow crystals to use for structural evaluation. This was a major impediment to the initial thrust of the research. The ion-pair aminium alendronate salts were all soluble. None of them were ionic liquids (melting points < 100 °C). Although some salts appeared to melt close to 100 °C, this process mainly involved the loss <b>of</b> <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation.</b> The aminium salts feature several types of ring motifs which add to their structural stability. Hydrogen bonding also contributed to structural integrity and one salt contained as many as 38 such bonds. The alendronate anion has characteristic infrared absorption bands, of strong intensity, with the symmetric P-O stretching bands near 1040 cm⁻¹ clearly evident. The solid state phosphorus NMR spectra, although complex to interpret, proved a useful tool in identifying different phosphorus environments and in providing evidence that some compounds existed as polymorphs.

40|$|Lithium {{molybdate}} {{has been}} prepared by grinding LiOH x H(2) O with MoO(3) in air at room temperature. X-Ray powder diffraction {{data show that}} the formation of highly crystalline Li(2) MoO(4) is largely complete after 10 min. The phenacite structure of this material {{is the same as}} that derived from an X-ray diffraction study of a single crystal obtained from aqueous solution [R 3; a = 14. 3178 (14) A, c = 9. 5757 (9) A]. Anhydrous lithium hydroxide fails to give the same reaction indicating that the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> of LiOH x H(2) O is a vital component in this rapid synthesis. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements show that this reaction can proceed spontaneously between the two stable solid reagents at sub-ambient temperatures and is driven by the liberation of water from the crystalline lattice. Lithium molybdate prepared in this manner has significantly smaller and more regularly shaped particles than samples prepared by other synthetic methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{sorption}} {{properties of}} yapunyah (Eucalyptus ochropholia) and yellow box (Eucalyptus melliodora) honeys (Australian unifloral honeys) were investigated {{in a controlled}} relative humidity (RH) environment at 30 degreesC for 71 days. The original <b>water</b> activity <b>of</b> the honeys affected the sorption properties. These two honeys absorbed moisture at and above 67. 9 % RH and desorbed moisture at and below 51. 4 % RH. The <b>crystallisation</b> behaviour <b>of</b> tea tree (Melaleuca quinquenervia) and yapunyah honeys was studied during storage at 13 and 23 degreesC. The degree <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 660 and 665 nm using a spectrophotometer. The heat-treated honeys did not show any sign <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> after S months, whereas a seeding with precrystallised honey induced <b>crystallisation</b> <b>of</b> the same honeys. This crystallisation was more rapid at 13 than at 23 degreesC. (C) 2003 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research presented in this thesis were: (1) optimise the processing conditions {{for the production of}} water-in-cocoa butter emulsions; (2) understand the role <b>of</b> <b>water</b> droplets on the large deformation behaviour and <b>crystallisation</b> properties <b>of</b> emulsified systems. Results showed that a scraped surface heat exchanger could be used to produce tempered emulsions with a small average droplet size (3 µm). In all systems stability was provided by the emulsifier and fat crystals forming a network both in the bulk and at the interface <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> droplets. Characterisation <b>of</b> the large deformation properties of emulsions showed that the elastic behaviour remained constant at low aqueous phase percentages while the strength at fracture decreased. This result suggests that water droplets act as stress-concentrator elements, which is probably due to their partial sintering with the bulk network. Results <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> experiments have shown that the effect of droplets on kinetics <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> depends on the degree of supercooling: only at relatively high temperatures (15, 20 °C) the dispersed droplets increased the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>crystallisation</b> compared to bulk cocoa butter (CB). With respect to polymorphic evolution, emulsified systems evolved faster toward more stable forms than bulk CB at all temperatures...|$|R
