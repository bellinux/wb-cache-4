Given the limited availability of aircraft, even two lifts did not provide capacity to transport all of the Devonshire battalion, the rest of whom arrived by sea on 7June. The 6th Airlanding Brigade headquarters, 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles and the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment landed at LZN, the latter equipped with the Tetrarch light tank– the first time that any tank had been flown into battle by air.

500|$|Executions were {{a common}} {{feature of the}} Roman games. They took place around midday as an {{interlude}} between the animal entertainments of the morning sessions and the gladiatorial combat in the afternoon. Although the executions were seen as symbolizing Rome's power, the higher classes normally took advantage of this interval to leave the arena to dine; the Emperor Claudius was criticised by some authors for not doing so, so {{it is unlikely that}} Titus would have <b>watched</b> <b>this</b> part of the show. The executions of deserters, prisoners-of-war, and criminals from the lower classes were normally crucifixions or damnationes ad bestias in which they would face wild animals. Scipio Aemilianus had been the first to execute criminals in this way when he had deserters from his army exposed to wild beasts in 146 BC. These executions often took the form of the re-creation of some tragic scene from history or mythology with the criminal cast {{in the role of the}} victim killed by wild beasts. [...] Martial records one such execution, a version of the mime Laureolus by Catullus, in which a notorious bandit was executed by crucifixion. For the games this was adapted as a version of the legend of Prometheus, who each day would have his liver devoured by an eagle. The element of crucifixion from Catullus' mime remained, but a wild bear was substituted for the eagle from the Prometheus legend: ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that Cardigan had reached and overrun the enemy battery: he was {{recognised}} beyond the guns by Prince Radziwill, an enemy officer with whom he was acquainted before the war. Considering his duty then done and disdaining, as he later explained, to [...] "fight the enemy among private soldiers" [...] Cardigan turned about and made his way steadily—he himself said that his return was at the walk to avoid any unseemly appearance of haste—for his own lines. Lucan recalled things differently, later giving evidence that Cardigan had been galloping back, only slowing to walk when he realised he was being <b>watched.</b> <b>This</b> hurried retreat was also noticed by General Liprandi, Russian commander, who made enquiries to identify the English officer whom he saw galloping away after the attack. Officers and men of the second and third lines—men for whom as brigade commander Cardigan remained responsible—were still advancing at the charge when they saw their commander riding in retreat. Other officers too had noticed his absence and when Lord George Paget of the 4th Hussars, one of the last to return after some intense, hand-to-hand fighting, encountered a [...] "composed" [...] Cardigan, he challenged him to account for himself. Unsatisfied with the response, Paget wrote an official complaint to the new Commander-in-Chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Cambridge forwarded the letter to Cardigan for comment and Cardigan's reply in turn complained that Paget had not in fact taken his regiments into the attack that day. Inconclusive claim and counter-claim followed, until Cardigan's attentions were diverted to the allegations made public when Calthorpe's book Letters went on sale.|$|E

2500|$|Romanos, whose {{army was}} encamped in a barren plain {{during the summer}} heat, sent a force to survey the {{fortress}} of Azaz, but these troops were all killed or captured by the Mirdasids. Romanos subsequently decided to withdraw toward Byzantine territory. Disorder soon spread throughout the Byzantine camp, with Armenian mercenaries looting the camp's market and trench guards fleeing for safety. Nasr and his Kilabi warriors used this opportunity to launch a surprise sortie against the retreating Byzantine troops. The latter were decisively defeated and chaotically dispersed. According to the contemporary Byzantine historian Michael Psellus, Romanos [...] "himself was almost captured and made prisoner by the enemy [...] ", who, [...] "as if amazed {{at the sight of}} the Romans [...] routed and fleeing for no reason, merely stood and <b>watched</b> <b>this</b> outstanding triumph".|$|E
