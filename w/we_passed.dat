A {{studio was}} built in the basement; though it was poorly designed, the Beatles recorded Let It Be there before a new studio was constructed in 1971 at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Various artists, including Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, and Marc Bolan recorded in the basement studio until it closed in May 1975. The Beatles' final live performance, known as the [...] "rooftop concert", was held {{on the roof of the}} building, on 30 January 1969, and was recorded for the documentary film Let It Be; the last words of the band, spoken by John Lennon as the police stopped the performance, were [...] "I hope <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> the audition." ...|$|E

500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much as <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|The next morning, a {{news conference}} {{was held in the}} grand showroom. Giles {{emphasized}} the importance of the route as an indication of the future, both for civil and military aircraft. He warned: [...] "Now that we have proved that we can do it, we must now remember that any future enemy will also be able to do it". LeMay declared that he wanted a second chance to prove that the B-29 was capable of flying 6,500 miles nonstop. He said, [...] "When we took off at Hokkaido we had a little headwind and expected it. However, all our information indicated that once <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> Fairbanks it would drop. We didn't need a tailwind. All we needed was a nice normal wind to arrive on schedule. The buffeting headwind averaged 70 mph" [...] (110km/h). After the reporters were finished, Giles presented all the airmen with the Distinguished Flying Cross. Giles told the men that each one could keep his personal military equipment as a memento of the flight, including parachutes. They were offered free rides home on military aircraft. Potts refused the parachute and the ride, telling Giles, [...] "Thank you, general, I think I'll take the train!" ...|$|E
500|$|April 4 {{also saw}} the {{announcement}} of two new downloadable content packs for the coming weeks: an [...] "Orrery" [...] quest that would see gamers setting out to repair a Dwarven Orrery; and a [...] "Wizard's Tower" [...] that would offer a new home for player characters, complete with the capacity to grow herbs, summon atronachs, and make spells. 1UP predicted that, given Bethesda's response to customer criticism, those releases would be somewhat more substantial than the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] release was. On April 7, Bethesda priced the [...] "Orrery". Offering what GameSpot called [...] "more bang for less buck", Bethesda set the PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq offered their support—"'Big ups'"—to the company for the new price. [...] "Although <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> on the $2.50 horse armor this week, we'll definitely be messin' with that Orrery device when it hits the Marketplace." [...] The pack was eventually released on April 17. Also on April 7, EB Games and GameStop began offering a coupon promising one free download of the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] pack with every purchase of the PC edition of Oblivion. The [...] "Wizard's Tower", called the [...] "Frostcrag Spire" [...] in-game, was released on April 24 for the same price as the [...] "Orrery".|$|E

500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when you have nothing to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reactions to {{the global}} {{surveillance}} disclosures {{among members of the}} U.S. Congress initially were largely negative. Speaker of the House John Boehner and senators Dianne Feinstein and Bill Nelson called Snowden a traitor, and several senators and representatives joined them in calling for Snowden's arrest and prosecution. Arizona Senator John McCain criticized politicians who voted in favor of the PATRIOT Act but were outraged by the NSA spying on phone calls by saying, [...] "We passed the Patriot Act. <b>We</b> <b>passed</b> specific provisions of the act that allowed for this program to take place, to be enacted in operation.

COSATU is a key partner in the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), a registered charity and political force working to educate and promote understanding about HIV/AIDS, and to prevent new infections, as well as push for greater access to antiretrovirals. COSATU passed a resolution in 1998 to campaign for treatment.
