500|$|Despite {{the success}} the single reached, {{it would be}} one of the Kinks' final hits in either Britain or America, ending the {{comeback}} the band had during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Ray said in 1996, [...] " [...] wanted to quit in 1984, after 'Come Dancing.' I felt that that was the end of an era for the Kinks, and I wanted to stop the treadmill and step back and reappraise the whole thing, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> album to deliver. It seemed like we always had another album to deliver." [...] Mick Avory left the band in 1984, a year after [...] "Come Dancing" [...] peaked in the USA. He later said, [...] "I think leaving after a world wide hit with 'Come Dancing' was a good note to leave on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Crichton {{traveled}} to Junction, Texas, {{during the campaign}} to meet with former Democratic Governor Coke Stevenson, the official loser by eighty-seven votes in the 1948 runoff primary for the U.S. Senate against Lyndon Johnson. Stevenson had supported John Tower in the 1960 senatorial general election against Johnson and was backing Goldwater in 1964 {{as well in the}} presidential contest. Stevenson told Crichton that the election [...] "is an important part of American history, for it got Lyndon to the Senate, which he later controlled, and was a stepping stone to his becoming President. As for me, I was depressed for quite a while, but in retrospect it has allowed me to enjoy my ranch and my young daughter. With that, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> bourbon and branch water, and I thanked him and departed." ...|$|E
2500|$|After media {{outrage at}} the 1976 Look Out for Lefty strip about {{football}} hooliganism in the IPC comic Action, Gifford controversially drew parallels with the Wertham censorship of the US comics industry in the 1950s, remarking that [...] "Perhaps its time <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> outcry against products like Action. Action is {{a new kind of}} comic geared to the lowest form of behaviour in children. Just as pornography caters for a mass market for adults, stuff like this provides violence for a mass market of children. As far as the people who produce Action are concerned, the children are simply a market and moral considerations do not apply." [...] Despite 2000 AD (#1 published in 1977) producing iconic characters and innovative and critically acclaimed stortelling and art, Gifford had similar reservations about its violent content: [...] "Whether children would actually enjoy living in ... is another matter, for as depicted... the future is a world of unrelieved violence." [...] Gifford was clear that his preferences in comics writing and art were informed by his nostalgia for UK comics of the 1930s, reflecting that [...] "I look {{back to the days of}} my youth... when comics were things of joy and pleasure, rather than blood and guts." ...|$|E

60|$|Soon <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> captive safely chained and {{growling}} away in {{tune with}} the others.

6000|$|... "It {{was truly}} luxurious hunting!

6000|$|Next day <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> bishop, who {{occupied}} {{the very same}} berth his Grace of Beyrouth had quitted--was sick in the very same way-- {{so much so that}} this cabin of the [...] "Lady Mary Wood" [...] is to be christened [...] "the bishop's berth" [...] henceforth; and a handsome mitre is to be painted on the basin.|$|E
60|$|Another {{interval}} passed; {{and then}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> short visit from him. He was still unaltered. My father's temper suffered under this second disappointment.

I particularly mention the change thus produced in his disposition, because that change was destined, at no very distant period, to act fatally upon me.|$|E

60|$|Soon {{after five}} p.m. <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> meal, {{consisting}} of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread. I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more--I was still hungry. Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the {{glass of water and}} the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.|$|E
6000|$|This led {{my friend}} {{of course to}} declare once more that I was cold-blooded. On the {{afternoon}} of the morrow <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> talk, and she told me that in the morning Miss Mavis had paid her a long visit. She knew nothing about anything, but her intentions were good and she was evidently in her own eyes conscientious and decorous.

6000|$|My aunt {{would not}} {{undertake}} so long a journey, {{and in a}} fortnight <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> letter from my father, it was dated Edinburgh: he wrote {{that he should be}} with us in three days.

60|$|But I was not {{so unhappy}} neither, as it fell out, for Amy was not with us, {{and that was my}} {{deliverance}} indeed; yet <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> chance to get over still. As I resolved to put off the voyage, so I resolved to put off the visit, you may be sure, going upon this principle, namely, that I was fixed in it that the girl had seen her last of me, and should never see me more.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>another</b> odd {{specimen}} on board, of {{a different}} kind.

60|$|Ah, my dear child, {{of course}} that puzzles you, and I am afraid it must puzzle you still till <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> talk; or rather {{it seems to me}} that the best way to explain that puzzle to you would be for you and me to go a journey into the far west, and look into the matter for ourselves; and from here to the far west we will go, either in fancy or on a real {{railroad}} and steamboat, before <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>another</b> talk about these things.|$|R
