500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was <b>When</b> <b>All</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Said</b> and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded [...] "Earthling" [...] with a B. Unlike Isler, the A.V. Club {{reviewer}} {{loved the}} opening, calling it [...] "one of Fringes most effective freak-meets". Murray continued {{that he believed}} the episode to be [...] "an efficient action/adventure/horror hour, heavy on suspenseful moments and neat effects, light on character development and progress on the master-plot. <b>When</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> and done and Fringe eventually ends its run, I'm betting that a newcomer {{will be able to}} skip 'Earthling' without putting a dent in their overall understanding of the show. But that doesn't mean it wasn't still cool to see people get reduced to dust right in front of our eyes. Jane Boursaw from AOL TV responded negatively to the episode, wishing it had not been yet another [...] "stand-alone creature feature". While praising the special effects, Boursaw expressed disinterest in learning more about Broyles and compared the Fringe case to something already done in The X-Files. She concluded, [...] "Take the creepy alien factor out of it, and this could have been any other police procedural". UGO Networks reviewer Alex Zalben also noted similarities to The X-Files, writing that [...] "the reason [...] is weird for Fringe is that, aforementioned evidence aside, they’ve been very careful to avoid the overarching alien mythology X-Files is famous for. Oops." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gaudron's {{first major}} {{breakthrough}} was in 1970 with O'Shaughnessy v Mirror Newspapers Ltd, where as a 27-year-old junior counsel she successfully argued the matter single-handedly before the High Court after the plaintiff, Peter O'Shaughnessy, sacked his senior counsel, Clive Evatt QC, preferring her ability over the veteran. According to O'Shaughnessy, 'she cut a valiant figure, this [...] "slip of a girl", who stood unsupported before the five legal elders of the land. They were obviously impressed by her courage, her sheer elegant dash, her shining intellect finding expression in felicitous language, her good manners, charm, poise.

2500|$|The {{election}} of 1800 was {{the topic of}} the song 'The Election of 1800' from the Broadway musical Hamilton. In the song 'Hamilton' says [...] " [...] I have never agreed with Jefferson once, we have fought on 75 different fronts, but <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> and all is done: Jefferson has beliefs. Burr has none." [...] This angers Burr and leads directly into the song 'Your Obedient Servant': in which Burr stands up to Hamilton and declares a duel. This duel led to the death of Alexander Hamilton. The election's story and the eventual reconciliation between Jefferson and Adams was also retold in a second season episode of Comedy Central's Drunk History, with Jerry O'Connell portraying Jefferson and Joe Lo Truglio as Adams.|$|E

2500|$|The {{readers were}} left with a cliffhanger, not knowing the destiny of Catherine.

2500|$|In {{a review}} from Entertainment Weekly, Hilary Busis asks a [...] "Serious question: Is a Storybrooke in which everyone's suspicious, caustic, and attacking {{the people around}} them {{really going to be}} that {{different}} from the town's general status quo?

At least Once prepared for its off week by giving us both halves of a two-parter—a story that, <b>when</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>said</b> and done, maybe didn't need to be told over the course of two hours, though it was nice to see the show take some time to privilege character over plot tonight. The hour also revealed the answers to a few of the season's long-simmering unsolved mysteries—including how Elsa ended up trapped within the anti-magic urn. Could this indicate the end of the Arendelle fairybacks, considering that backstory seems to be fairly complete at this point? If it does, will you miss them—or are you looking forward to the show not spending quite so much time on the Frozen crew?" ...|$|E
