5|$|In Giessen, Forester Ritter {{was arrested}} {{because he said}} the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> last another three years. Two years ago R. was assassinated because he {{maintained}} that the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> last two years.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{legacy of the}} Battle of Long Island was that it showed {{there would be no}} easy victory, and that the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> be long and bloody.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, {{its role}} in the event of <b>war</b> <b>would</b> have been as a medium {{reconnaissance}} unit for the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). In 1971, a second Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry-based squadron was raised, as B squadron, Royal Wessex Yeomanry. This was initially a home defence unit trained as infantry, but later equipped with stripped down Land Rovers to perform reconnaissance duties.|$|E
50|$|The Act of 1652 said (paragraphs VI, VII VIII) {{that anyone}} who fought against the {{parliament}} in Ireland during the civil <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> lose some lands.|$|R
50|$|The secret {{group the}} Illuminati are {{eventually}} revealed to have visited the Kree and Skrull Empires, and advised the aliens that involving Earth in their <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> not be tolerated.|$|R
50|$|The British officer John Masters {{recorded}} {{in his autobiography}} that Pathans in British India during the Anglo-Afghan <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> behead enemy soldiers who were captured, such as British and Sikh soldiers.|$|R
5|$|In November 2006 he {{attended}} a press conference on HMS Illustrious, which was moored in the River Thames at Greenwich. He announced that the 25th anniversary of the Falklands <b>War</b> <b>would</b> be commemorated across 8,000 miles and four time zones – in London, Pangbourne and the Falkland Islands – from 14 to 17 June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon I {{embarked}} on an invasion of Russia in 1812. This <b>war</b> <b>would</b> {{prove to be the}} turning point in his fortunes, as the expedition failed miserably and Napoleon was forced to retreat with an army in tatters.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{division}} {{of the world was}} formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact; the long period of political tensions and military competition between them, the Cold <b>War,</b> <b>would</b> be accompanied by an unprecedented arms race and proxy wars.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of cobdenism {{claim that}} by {{removing}} tariffs and creating international free trade <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> become impossible, because free trade prevents a nation from becoming self-sufficient, {{which is a}} requirement for long wars.|$|R

5|$|The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces {{commanded}} by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing {{an invasion of}} Zeeland; the outlook was {{not good for the}} Swedes. Fortunately for them, the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> soon end.|$|E
5|$|As an {{opponent}} of the Vietnam War, Bedell signed a petition urging against United States military intervention in Iraq. This petition was signed {{with the names of}} 70 former Congressmen from the 1970s and was presented in a press conference on March 15, 2003. Bedell said that it was unbelievable for the United States to settle disputes with war, and he said that an Iraq <b>war</b> <b>would</b> be similar to the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European <b>war</b> <b>would</b> start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft as a more appropriate long-term solution.|$|E

50|$|It was {{announced}} on December 2, 2015 that Cake <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> be renewed {{for a second}} season. The new season will feature 13 episodes that include Star Wars, Dr. Seuss, and Willy Wonka cakes.|$|R
50|$|Fearing that Star <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> flop, {{the studio}} made a {{peremptory}} decision to grant prints of The Other Side of Midnight—a 2-hour-45-minute-long feature with sex and nudity—only to those theaters that agreed to book Star Wars, as well.|$|R
5|$|During 1943, Bulleid began {{planning}} for the post-war locomotive requirements of the railway and identified {{the need for a}} stop-gap steam locomotive design for those main lines in South East England scheduled for electrification, had the Second World War not taken place. Although the new Merchant Navy class was available for the heaviest Continental expresses, the resumption of frequent passenger services over poorly maintained infrastructure, following the <b>war,</b> <b>would</b> require a lighter locomotive with wider route availability.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 that the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> not be won quickly, the Navy department decided {{to replace the}} six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated in the UN recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E
6000|$|We may say, again, 'Ah {{that the}} Lord Jesus had but {{remained}} on earth, what just laws, what {{peace and prosperity}} would the world have enjoyed! <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> have ceased long ago; oppression and injustice would be unknown.' ...|$|R
50|$|He said {{he thought}} the Taliban would bring unity to Afghanistan, and the tribal and {{regional}} <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> disappear, and had gone to enlist with them. But they threw him in prison, because of his earlier association with HiG.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monarchical {{sovereignty}}, {{the enemy}} of mankind, {{and the source of}} misery, is abolished; and sovereignty itself is restored to its natural and original place, the nation. Were this the case throughout Europe, the cause of <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> be taken away." ...|$|R
5|$|In a {{combined}} offensive against Blanco strongholds, the Brazilian–Colorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory, taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in Montevideo, the national capital. Faced with certain defeat, the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived <b>war</b> <b>would</b> have {{been regarded as}} an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests, had Paraguayan intervention {{in support of the}} Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly Paraguayan War.|$|E
5|$|Increasing violence, {{especially}} by the Shawnee, Miami, and Wyandot tribes, led to Dunmore's War in 1774. Conflict with Native Americans continued throughout the American Revolution, as some {{hoped that the}} <b>war</b> <b>would</b> end with expulsion of the settlers from their territory. In 1777, Fort Pitt became a United States fort, when Brigadier General Edward Hand took command. In 1779, Colonel Daniel Brodhead led 600 men from Fort Pitt to destroy Seneca villages along the upper Allegheny.|$|E
5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> shape his military and political life. He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.|$|E
50|$|The Fidelity <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> {{be their}} next record (with the recent {{addition}} of multi-instrumentalist Jack Hayter); a darker collection of songs. In the official website {{of the band}} Darren has explained {{that all of the}} songs gravitate around the concept of breaking up.|$|R
50|$|The {{character}} of RiD Scourge made one appearance in Dreamwave comics Summer Special issue {{before the company}} went under. There was a contest in the issue as to whether RiD or Beast <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> be the next Dreamwave comic series. Beast Wars won.|$|R
30|$|Proxy wars {{as part of}} the {{aforementioned}} battle for regional hegemony. Similar to those taking place today in the Middle East, in scenarios such as Syria and Yemen. Participants in such <b>wars</b> <b>would</b> include not just powers in the region but offshore balancers also [25].|$|R
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield {{was put up}} for a vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed to gain more support. In polls, a large majority of the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union. In addition to Hitler's stated purpose of acquiring Lebensraum, this large-scale offensive (codenamed Operation Barbarossa) {{was intended to}} destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers. The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the <b>war</b> <b>would</b> drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5000|$|On 15 July 2008, it was {{announced}} at a Nintendo press conference that Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown <b>Wars</b> <b>would</b> be released to the Nintendo DS in the following Winter. According to Nintendo World Report, Chinatown Wars contains over 900,000 lines of [...] "hand-optimized" [...] code.|$|R
