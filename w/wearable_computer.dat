25|$|Wearable {{computers}} are computers {{which can be}} worn on the body. Wearable {{computers are}} especially useful for applications that require computational support while the user's hands, voice, eyes or attention are actively engaged with the physical environment. The <b>wearable</b> <b>computer</b> was first conceived by American mathematician Edward O. Thorp in 1955 and co-invented with American electronic engineer Claude Shannon.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} survey of {{pointing}} devices for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers,</b> which are body-mounted devices that users can access at any time. Since traditional pointing devices (i. e., mouse, touchpad, and trackpoint) were designed to be used on a steady and flat surface they are inappropriate for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers.</b> Just as the advent of laptops resulted {{in the development of}} the touchpad and trackpoint, the emergence of <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> is leading to the development of pointing devices designed for them. However, unlike laptops, since <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> are operated from different body positions under different environmental conditions for different uses, researchers have developed a variety of innovative pointing devices for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> characterized by their sensing mechanism, control mechanism, and form factor. We survey a representative set of pointing devices for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> using an “adaptation of traditional devices” versus “new devices” dichotomy and study devices according to their control and sensing mechanisms and form factor. The objective of this paper is to showcase a variety of pointing devices developed for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> and bring structure to the design space for wearable pointing devices. We conclude that a de facto pointing device for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers,</b> unlike laptops, is not likely to emerge...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis examines user interfaces for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers.</b> <b>Wearable</b> <b>computers</b> are {{a special kind of}} mobile computers that can be worn on the body. Furthermore, they integrate themselves even more seamlessly into different activities than a mobile phone or a personal digital assistant can. The thesis investigates the development and evaluation of user interfaces for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers.</b> In particular, it presents fundamental research results as well as supporting software tools for wearable user interface development. The main contributions of the thesis are a new evaluation method for user interfaces of <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> and a model-driven software toolkit to ease interface development for application developers with limited human-computer interaction knowledge. The research {{presented in this}} thesis motivates and validates the research hypothesis that user interfaces for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> are inherently different to stationary desktop interfaces as well as mobile computer interfaces and, therefore, have to be designed differently to make them usable without being a burden for humans...|$|R

25|$|The first {{variants}} of the ACMS system {{had a total}} weight of 25 kilograms. The weight proved to be bothersome since it forced wearers to move less than one kilometer in the field.

Currently, ACMS includes a soldier computer subsystem, which features a <b>wearable</b> <b>computer</b> and power pack, a communications subsystem supporting wireless radio and data connectivity through mesh networking, full color OLED based helmet mounted display and active noise diction hearing protection, indoor and outdoor navigation system with GPS support, and weapon-mounted camera with an ITL MARS reflex sight.|$|E

2500|$|Another early blog was Wearable Wireless Webcam, {{an online}} shared {{diary of a}} person's {{personal}} life combining text, digital video, and digital pictures transmitted live from a <b>wearable</b> <b>computer</b> and EyeTap device to a web site in 1994. This practice of semi-automated blogging with live video together with text {{was referred to as}} sousveillance, and such journals were also used as evidence in legal matters. Early blogs were simply manually updated components of common Websites. However, the evolution of electronic and software tools to facilitate the production and maintenance of Web articles posted in reverse chronological order made the publishing process feasible to a much larger, less technical, population. Ultimately, this resulted in the distinct class of online publishing that produces blogs we recognize today. For instance, the use of some sort of browser-based software is now a typical aspect of [...] "blogging". Blogs can be hosted by dedicated blog hosting services, or they can be run using blog software, or on regular web hosting services. Some early bloggers, such as The Misanthropic Bitch, who began in 1997, actually referred to their online presence as a zine, before the term blog entered common usage.|$|E

Specifically, this study examined how the capabilities of <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> may be used to aid a user in an inspection task, using as a case study the procedural task of preflight inspection of a general aviation aircraft. Two different configurations of a computer-based, voiceactivated task guidance system and the current method of preflight inspection were compared and evaluated. Initial results demonstrate an over reliance on the computer by the pilots and indicate the importance of the user interface design to the performance of the inspectors.

40|$|To {{ease the}} {{implementation}} of different <b>wearable</b> <b>computers,</b> we developed a low-power processor board (named LART) with a rich set of interfaces. The LART supports dynamic voltage scaling, so performance (and power consumption) can be scaled to match demands: 59 - 221 MHz, 106 - 640 mW. High-end wearables can be configured from multiple LARTs operating in parallel; alternatively, FPGA boards {{can be used for}} dedicated data-processing, which reduces power consumption significantly.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Wearable</b> <b>computers</b> {{and smart}} {{clothing}} started its development {{since the late}} 20 th century. Yet, {{it has not been}} widely used until the present, compared to other technological innovations that quickly gained successful diffusion. In view of this, the decision process of accepting or rejecting an innovation enumerated by Everett Rogers is reviewed to understand how target users may perceive <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> as an innovative technology. User-centered researches were also surveyed where user concerns and preferences with the said technology, involving cognitive, physical and social aspects that influence the individual’s decisions are extracted from. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} promote a higher rate of acceptance for <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> through understanding human behavior and attitude towards technological innovations while individuals go through the process of decision-making prior to utilization, and integrating the identified human issues in the design and development of <b>wearable</b> <b>computers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a system level design {{approach to the}} <b>wearable</b> <b>computers</b> project at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).
