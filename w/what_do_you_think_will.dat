6000|$|MARGARET. I am {{not quite}} sure whether I want you to. It makes such a difference. Perhaps you won't know me. Even the pool is looking a little scared.

3000|$|The {{second phase}} of {{fieldwork}} was conducted in 2011 by an anthropologist and included eight interviews centred on the contemporary scientific publications on moths, reindeer and mountain birches (e.g. Klemola et al. 2003, Klemola 2009, Tømmervik et al. 2009, Ammunét 2011). The results put forward in these publications were presented in popular form to the herders, who were asked key questions such as: <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> if outbreaks of both autumnal and winter moth become more common as the climate gets warmer? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{about the impact of}} global warming and reindeer on the growth of birch trees? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of reindeer herding? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the future of the mountain birch forests in your area?

6000|$|... "Aye! but I {{think you}} do, Sir Andrew. You {{must know that}} I am {{speaking}} the truth. Look these facts straight in the face. Percy has sailed for Calais, I presume for some lonely part of the coast, and Chauvelin is on his track.

6000|$|... "Do not, I beg," [...] said Mr. Lavender, [...] "remind {{me of that}} episode. I {{sometimes}} think," [...] he went on as dreamily as his hunger would permit, [...] "that {{being forced}} to deprive oneself awakens one's worst passions; that is, of course, speaking rather as a man than a public man. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> happen, Joe, when {{we are no longer}} obliged to sacrifice ourselves? ...|$|E

[...] "But an eccentricity is very bon ton at present, and if {{you feel}} any leaning towards one, I should certainly advise you to let it run its course. Petersham would have remained a mere peer all his life had it not come {{out that he had}} a snuff-box for every day in the year, and that he had caught cold through a mistake of his valet, who sent him out on a bitter winter day with a thin Sevres china box instead of a thick tortoiseshell. That brought him out of the ruck, you see, and people remember him. Even some small characteristic, such as having an apricot tart on your sideboard all the year round, or putting your candle out at night by stuffing it under your pillow, serves to separate you from your neighbour. In my own case, it is my precise judgment upon matter of dress and decorum which has placed me where I am. I do not profess to follow a law. I set one. For example, I am taking you to-day to see the Prince in a nankeen vest. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> be the consequence of that?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of milk of course, and cows, and sheep, and horses; and of {{your body}} and mine--for we shall drink the milk and eat the meat. And {{therefore}} it is a flesh and milk manufactory. We must put into it every year yard-stuff, tank-stuff, guano, bones, and anything and everything of that kin, that Madam How may cook it for us into grass, and cook the grass again into milk and meat. But if we don't give Madam How material to work on, we cannot expect her to work for us. And <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> happen then? She will set to work for herself. The rich grasses will dwindle for want of ammonia (that is smelling salts), and the rich clovers for want of phosphates (that is bone-earth): and in their places will come over the bank the old weeds and grass off the moor, which have not room to get in now, because the ground is coveted already. They want no ammonia nor phosphates--at all events they have none, {{and that is why}} the cattle on the moor never get fat. So they can live where these rich grasses cannot. And then they will conquer and thrive; and the Field will turn into Wild once more.|$|E
