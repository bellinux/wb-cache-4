30|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> {{differential}} operators defined {{on functions}} and on vector fields. These differential operators include Laplacian, Hessian, covariant derivative, and the connection Laplacian. We introduced {{the background of}} relevant geometric concepts.

We {{outlined the}} origins and history of peer review, {{as well as the}} process, ethics, and problems of tradition single and double-blind peer review. <b>We</b> <b>discussed</b> the responsibilities of authors and reviewers during the peer review process, and we reviewed case studies to discuss some of the complexities that can arise during peer review...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discussed}} descriptive {{skills and}} thought of time consciousness in Dong Po’s Tsz by “now and then” contrast of descriptive scheme. First, we introduced “now and then” contrast of descriptive scheme. Second, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the meanings of “now and then” contrast. This part included social conception and historical perspective. Then <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the functions of “now and then” contrast, and it’s downfall and making strides. 本文旨在透過「今昔對照」視域來探賾東坡詞中所豁顯的境遇感與其所發露出來的時間意識，論述理序：首論「今昔對照」之敘寫基模，再論「今昔對照」所表抒的境遇感，內含人世境遇及歷史諦觀二部份，次論「今、昔」之對照性作用何在，末論「今昔對照」之坎陷與超越以透顯東坡詞中的時間意識...|$|R
40|$|In this report, we {{described}} {{the basis for}} developing quality models {{that can be used}} by the PuLSE-Eco scoping approach to provide a quantitative basis for the scoping of the asset base. We {{described the}} general structure of these models as well as the necessary notation and terminology to discuss the specific models and perhaps needed deviations from the standard model. In particular, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the process aspects of product line development, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> the general structure of product line quality models, and discussed how specific quality models can be developed. Further, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> in detail the relationship between the meta-quality model and the specific quality model guides and how these can be instantiated for the specific projects...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> {{the design}} of a self-managed {{distributed}} column-store system. Architectural novelties of a column-store system hold a great promise for construction of an efficient self-managed database that would adapt its physical design to changing workloads. We surveyed state-of-the-art self-managed database systems and provided an overview of contemporary results. Next, we presented some thoughts on the organization of a self-managed distributed column-store system. <b>We</b> <b>discussed</b> the three core components: an alerter, a reorganization controller and a set of physical design options (actions) available to such a system. We described three approaches for {{the design of}} the alerter and two for the reorganization controller. Several physical design problems were formulated and <b>discussed.</b> Finally, <b>we</b> <b>discussed</b> available physical design options—the building blocks of an adaptive distributed column-store system.|$|R
