50|$|The {{properties}} of bent functions are naturally {{of interest in}} modern digital cryptography, which seeks to obscure relationships between input and output. By 1988 Forré recognized that the <b>Walsh</b> <b>transform</b> of a function {{can be used to}} show that it satisfies the Strict Avalanche Criterion (SAC) and higher-order generalizations, and recommended this tool to select candidates for good S-boxes achieving near-perfect diffusion. Indeed, the functions satisfying the SAC to the highest possible order are always bent. Furthermore, the bent functions are as far as possible from having what are called linear structures, nonzero vectors a such that f(x + a) + f(x) is a constant. In the language of differential cryptanalysis (introduced after this property was discovered) the derivative of a bent function f at every nonzero point a (that is, fa(x) = f(x + a) + f(x)) is a balanced Boolean function, taking on each value exactly half of the time. This property is called perfect nonlinearity.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{handling}} of sparse data {{is a key}} challenge in Computer Science. Binary convolutions, such as polynomial multiplication or the <b>Walsh</b> <b>Transform</b> are a useful tool in many applications and are efficiently solved. In the last decade, several problems required efficient solution of sparse binary convolutions. both randomized and deterministic algorithms were developed for efficiently computing the sparse polynomial multiplication. The key operation in all these algorithms was length reduction. The sparse data is mapped into small vectors that preserve the convolution result. The reduction method used to-date was the modulo function since it preserves location (of the " 1 " bits) up to cyclic shift. To date there is no known efficient algorithm for computing the sparse <b>Walsh</b> <b>transform.</b> Since the modulo function does not preserve the <b>Walsh</b> <b>transform</b> a new method for length reduction is needed.
