5|$|The 722 Sunshields <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding {{area near}} El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered. The crew of each tank {{was brought to}} Martello, told their number, shown {{where they would be}} parked and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield, which they would have to do at night.|$|E
5|$|While {{the real}} {{supplies}} {{in the north}} <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south. In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb, over 700 dummy stacks, representing food, petrol, ammunition and other supplies, were constructed.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the {{untested}} 29th Infantry Division, {{along with}} nine companies of U.S. Army Rangers redirected from Pointe du Hoc, were to assault the western {{half of the}} beach. The battle-hardened 1st Infantry Division was given the eastern half. The initial assault waves, consisting of tanks, infantry, and combat engineer forces, <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> planned to reduce the coastal defenses and allow the larger ships of the follow-up waves to land.|$|E

5|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to review children's books seriously and with a distinctive set of criteria. Trimmer's reviews <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> thought out; they influenced publishers and authors to alter {{the content of their}} books, helped to define the new genre of children's literature, and greatly affected the sales of children's books. The Guardian also offered the first history of children's literature; establishing a list of landmark books, which scholars still use today.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{employed}} maskirovka (military deception) to mask defensive {{positions and}} troop dispositions and {{to conceal the}} movement of men and materiel. These included camouflaging gun emplacements, constructing dummy airfields and depots, generating false radio-traffic, and spreading rumours among the Soviet frontline troops and the civilian population in the German-held areas. Movement of forces and supplies {{to and from the}} salient took place at night only. Ammunition caches <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> concealed to blend in with the landscape. Radio transmission was restricted and fires were forbidden. Command posts were hidden and motor transport in and around them forbidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of a final combined image at each wavelength was a complex process. Bright pixels caused by cosmic ray impacts during exposures were removed by comparing exposures of equal length taken one after the other, and identifying pixels that were affected by cosmic rays in one exposure but not the other. Trails of space debris and artificial satellites {{were present in the}} original images, and <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> removed.|$|E

5|$|After {{consulting}} with his family, Tiberius made his wishes known whereupon the Senate collected the honors into a commemorative decree, the Senatus Consultum de memoria honoranda Germanini Caesaris, {{and ordered the}} consuls of AD 20 to issue a public law honoring the death of Germanicus, the Lex Valeria Aurelia. Although Tacitus stressed the honors paid to him, the funeral and processions <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> modeled after those of Gaius and Lucius, Agrippa's sons. This served to emphasize {{the continuation of the}} domus Augusta across the transition from Augustus to Tiberius. Commemorative arches were built in his honor and not just at Rome, but at the frontier on the Rhine and in Asia where he had governed in life. The arch of the Rhine was placed alongside of that of his father, where the soldiers had built a funerary monument honoring him. Portraits of him and his natural father were placed in the Temple of Apollo on the Palatine in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Hosius {{brought to}} Poland the Jesuits and founded for them a college in Braniewo in 1564. Numerous Jesuit {{educational}} institutions and residencies {{were established in}} the following decades, most often {{in the vicinity of}} centers of Protestant activity. Jesuit priests <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> selected, well educated, of both noble and urban origins. They had soon become highly influential with the royal court, while working hard within all segments of the society. The Jesuit educational programs and Counter-Reformation propaganda utilized many innovative media techniques, often custom-tailored for a particular audience on hand, as well as time-tried methods of humanist instruction. Preacher Piotr Skarga and Bible translator Jakub Wujek count among prominent Jesuit personalities.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{claims of}} diamond {{synthesis}} were documented between 1879 and 1928; {{most of those}} attempts <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, systematic research began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as detonation synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.|$|E

5|$|On {{the edge}} of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage {{constructed}} three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed 'dummy' guns.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{polio vaccine}} (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} vaccine, {{produced by the}} passage of the virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E

5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for future use. For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and {{archivist}} Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{information}} about Lōʻihi comes from dives made {{in response to the}} 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These responses <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over. Because of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, {{it was not possible to}} arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E
5|$|When the East India Company {{was taken}} over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, Whitehall until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new India Office, which {{occupied}} part of the building still used by today's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in South Kensington, which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the Museum of Modern Art through the summer and spring.|$|E
5|$|All {{seventeen}} of the confirmed {{heads in}} the Olmec heartland were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz. Most were formed from coarse grained dark grey basalt known as Cerro Cintepec basalt after a volcano in the range. Investigators have proposed that large Cerro Cintepec basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains {{are the source of}} the stone for the monuments. These boulders are found in an area affected by large lahars (volcanic mudslides) that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes, which suggests that the Olmecs did not need to quarry the raw material for sculpting the heads. Roughly spherical boulders <b>were</b> <b>carefully</b> selected to mimic the shape of a human head. The stone for the San Lorenzo and La Venta heads was transported a considerable distance from the source. The La Cobata head was found on El Vigia hill in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas and the stone from Tres Zapotes Colossal Head1 and Nestepe Colossal Head1 (also known as Tres Zapotes MonumentsA andQ) came from the same hill.|$|E
