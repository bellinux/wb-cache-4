25|$|Cave arrows, Line arrows or Dorff markers (after Lewis Holtzendorff) are plastic {{arrowhead}} markers {{which are}} hooked onto a cave line by wrapping the line around the arrow through the slots. They {{are used to}} indicate the direction to the exit, and can be identified by feel. The message is simple, but of critical importance, as if a diver does not know {{which way to go}} at a line junction there is a risk of serious trouble. Line arrows are also used at a junction on the permanent line, and at a tie-off, so when the diver gets back to the tie-off, he or she can identify which <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

According to Eastwood's official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman Irving Glassberg. Glassberg arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Clint's appearance and stature at 6'4" [...] (193cm), disapproved initially of his acting skills, remarking, [...] "He was quite amateurish.

[...] Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth, a lifelong trademark.|$|E
