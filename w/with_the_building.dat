5|$|Despite {{suffering}} significant persecution {{from their}} peers and the state, Baptists erected their first chapel in Taunton in 1670, {{on or near the}} current site. This was replaced in 1712 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> that still stands today. During the 18th century, probably during the ministry of Joseph Jeffries, the chapel's form of worship became Unitarian, although this was forbidden by Parliament until 1813. The Presbyterians of Taunton merged with the Unitarian church in 1814, and later that century the chapel underwent significant renovation.|$|E

5|$|New South Wales and Victoria {{had signed}} an {{agreement}} towards constructing bridges for railways over the Murray to serve the settlements on the northern side. In 1923, a report was released that recommended going ahead <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of four bridges, one of those being the future Abbotsford Bridge. It was said a bridge in this area would benefit Curlwaa, Wentworth, and a proposed irrigation scheme to the north. The cost was estimated at £78,000. It had been considered {{that it might be}} appropriate to combine these four bridges with locks, but this idea was rejected due to siting concerns.|$|E

5|$|The Don River valley, formed {{during the}} last ice age, has played an {{important}} role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.|$|E
