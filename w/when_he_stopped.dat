5|$|Koushun Takami {{completed}} Battle Royale <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> {{working as}} a journalist in 1996. The story was rejected {{in the final round}} of the 1997 , which took place in March 1998, because of its controversial content. Masao Higashi, {{who took part in the}} award's preliminary selection committee, later suspected this was due to its backdrop of students killing each other being too reminiscent of the Kobe child murders committed the previous year. Battle Royale was first published in April 1999 by Ohta Publishing. In August 2002, it was released in a revised, two-part pocket edition by Gentosha.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was summoned}} to a Chapter Extraordinary of the Lateran Congregation, and his friends warned {{him that he had}} {{powerful}} adversaries. These increasingly foreboding events contributed to his decision to ignore the summons and flee, but he was finally persuaded by his conscience against the Masses he was bound to perform. Vermigli fled Lucca for Pisa on 12 August 1542 by horse with three of his canons. There he celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist for the first time. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> in Florence, staying in Badia Fiesolana where he had entered religious life, Vermigli learned that Bernardino Ochino had arrived there. Vermigli convinced Ochino, a popular preacher with Protestant leanings, to flee Italy as well. On 25 August Vermigli left for Zürich by way of Ferrara and Verona.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> {{at the side of}} the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E

Sergio Canamasas and Raffaele Marciello were fifth and sixth. Richie Stanaway was seventh-fastest, André Negrão eighth, Haryanto ninth and Norman Nato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Evans caused an brief early red flag period <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> his car {{at the top of the}} hall entering Massenet corner, and was unable to set a timed lap. Canamasas went into the Sainte Dévote run-off area, and Marco Sørensen locked his tyres, causing him hit the barriers at Rascasse corner, and reversed out of the turn.

5|$|Angle {{returned}} to in-ring action on TNA's debut on Destination America on January 7, 2015, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> a brawl, but started a street fight against MVP. On January 31, 2015 (aired March 20), Angle defeated Lashley {{to win the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship for a record sixth time. He lost to Eric Young on May 1, at Hardcore Justice, in a stretcher match with the title not on the line. He successfully retained his title against Lashley once and then again against both Lashley and Eric Young. On May 8, Angle defeated Young to retain his title with Bully Ray as the special referee. On the May 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, he successfully retained his title once again against Eric Young, this time in a I Quit match. At Destination X, Angle defeated Rockstar Spud, who gave up the X Division Championship in order to challenge for the title.

25|$|Although Cage {{had used}} chance {{on a few}} earlier occasions, most notably in the third {{movement}} of Concerto for Prepared Piano and Chamber Orchestra (1950–51), the I Ching opened new possibilities in this field for him. The first results of the new approach were Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for 12 radio receivers, and Music of Changes for piano. The latter work was written for David Tudor, whom Cage met through Feldman—another friendship that lasted until Cage's death. Tudor premiered most of Cage's works until the early 1960s, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> performing on the piano and concentrated on electronic music. The I Ching became Cage's standard tool for composition: he used it in practically every work composed after 1951.|$|E
25|$|Mencken {{served as}} a {{reporter}} at the Herald for six years. Less than {{two and a half}} years after the Great Baltimore Fire, the paper was purchased in June 1906 by Charles H. Grasty, the owner and editor of The News since 1892, and competing owner and publisher Gen. Felix Agnus, of the town's oldest (since 1773) and largest daily, The Baltimore American. They proceeded to divide the staff, assets and resources of The Herald between them. Mencken then moved to The Baltimore Sun, where he worked for Charles H. Grasty. He continued to contribute to The Sun, The Evening Sun (founded 1910) and The Sunday Sun full-time until 1948, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> writing after suffering a stroke.|$|E
25|$|In June, Burmese Days was {{published}} and Cyril Connolly's {{review in the}} New Statesman prompted Orwell (as he then became known) to re-establish contact with his old friend. In August, he moved into a flat in Kentish Town, which he shared with Michael Sayers and Rayner Heppenstall. The relationship was sometimes awkward and Orwell and Heppenstall even came to blows, though they remained friends and later worked together on BBC broadcasts. Orwell was now working on Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and also tried unsuccessfully to write a serial for the News Chronicle. By October 1935 his flatmates had moved out and he was struggling {{to pay the rent}} on his own.
