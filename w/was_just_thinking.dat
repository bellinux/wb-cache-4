500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really pushing yourself to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways that you could use this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{is able to}} empathise with others, feel as they do, {{think as}} they do and so become like them. When MacLeod {{revealed}} his immortality to Tessa in [...] "Counterfeit Part Two", she can show compassion instead of the fear or disgust he expects: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> how lonely you must be. Your parents, your friends... having them all die." [...] Tessa is a very empathic and understanding character, for example, in [...] "Saving Grace", she is jealous of MacLeod's former lover Grace; however, when MacLeod assures her {{that he no longer}} loves Grace, her response is simply that [...] "...that's all that need to be said. She's your friend and she's been hurt. You'll help her. I'd expect you to do no less." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tennis Court" [...] address Lorde's newly {{established}} fame and criticise the [...] "high life." [...] Lorde said {{she wrote the}} song [...] "after having had {{a glimpse into the}} music industry, and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about how superficial people can be and how we put up all these fronts." [...] She found the idea of a tennis court [...] "very visually beautiful" [...] and [...] "something I kept coming back to on Tumblr and all that sort of thing", saying it was [...] "kind of a symbol of nostalgia for me. It was something which was familiar and safe to me." [...] She also described the song as being [...] "about the town where she grew up and the friends [...] she would ... hang out all summer." [...] Paul Lester, writing for The Guardian, compared the song's lyrical theme to that of two other songs by Lorde: [...] "Royals" [...] and [...] "Million Dollar Bills" [...] (from The Love Club EP).|$|E

500|$|... "Movin' Down the Line", an ode to a love unrequited, {{features}} mellow horns, jangling guitar, heavy bass lines, and a swelling {{string and}} piano conclusion. In {{the opinion of}} Lloyd Bradley, the song exemplifies the album's combination of traditional styles and contemporary production: [...] "It has every bit of digital snap needed to succeed among today’s sounds; but Saadiq's masterful use of a big brass section lurking w-a-a-ay into the background picks the tune up and puts it down {{in a completely different}} era. The song turns out both laidback and urgent at the same time, and is utterly irrepressible for it". Containing a psychedelic funk sound, [...] "Just Don't" [...] is sung {{from the point of view}} of a dejected narrator as realizes his woman has moved on from him. The song features guest vocals by Yukimi Nagano and an extended Moog solo played [...] by Larry Dunn. [...] "Good Man" [...] contains plaintive lyrics, a hook co-written and sung by vocalist Taura Stinson, and lyrics about a man mourning his partner's unfaithfulness. The album's closing track, [...] "The Answer", features a wistful, jazz-funk sound, and lyrics expressing a call for collective and individual responsibility. Saadiq said, [...] "I always have a song similar to that on my albums. I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about growing up in Oakland and all the older people and mentors who helped me out at the time. So I just wanted to throw it back and say thank you, and tell all the kids out there to listen to the people trying to guide them".|$|E
2500|$|Necrobutcher {{recalls how}} Euronymous {{told him of}} the suicide:Øystein called me {{up the next day}} ... and says, [...] "Dead has done {{something}} really cool! He killed himself". I thought, have you lost it? What do you mean cool? He says, [...] "Relax, I have photos of everything". I was in shock and grief. He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> how to exploit it. So I told him, [...] "OK. Don't even fucking call me before you destroy those pictures".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Assembly Cut" [...] {{has several}} key plot {{elements}} {{that differ from}} the theatrical release. The alien gestates in an ox rather than a dog, {{and one of the}} inmates discovers a dead facehugger. Ripley's unconscious body washes up on the shore of the planet in the Assembly Cut instead of being found in the ship's wreckage as in the theatrical cut. Some scenes are extended to focus more on the religious views of the inmates. The inmates succeed in their attempt to trap the alien, but it is later released by the disturbed inmate Golic. In this version, the alien Queen does not burst from Ripley's chest as she falls into the furnace. There is also a scene in the prison's assembly hall in which one of the inmates suggests to Dillon that they lead the creature to the furnace so that they can incinerate it. One notable scene that was not restored for the DVD or Blu-ray extended versions was the full autopsy scene. Greg Cannom, who worked on the special make-up effects, said in the Alien Quadrilogy special features that, [...] "I saw the rough cut of the film, uncut, and there were some scenes in there that were pretty gross. There was an autopsy scene on the girl [...] and I like certain gore in the films. I do it , and it made me sick. It really grossed me out and I remember people got up and left, walked out of the theatre and I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking,</b> 'This will never be in the film. They can't show this stuff.' It was just too much I thought. And when the film came out, it wasn't in the film." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the contrary, we {{are always}} pleased to see you," [...] Mr. Parker {{declared}} warmly. [...] "Sit right down, Mr. Cullen! You'll join us, I trust? We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of ordering a little supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, so he is--I mean {{he has got}} a {{beautiful}} practice two hundred miles off; he has bought it with his own money, some that came to him.

6000|$|... "Very {{important}} for you, I have no doubt," [...] answered the Rocket, [...] "but I shall weep if I choose"; {{and he actually}} burst into real tears, which flowed down his stick like rain-drops, and nearly drowned two little beetles, who <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of setting up house together, and {{were looking for a}} nice dry spot to live in.|$|R

60|$|Long {{ago there}} lived two brothers, {{both of them}} very handsome, and both so very poor that they seldom had {{anything}} to eat but the fish which they caught. One day they had been out in their boat since sunrise without a single bite, and <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of putting up their lines and going home to bed when they felt a little feeble tug, and, drawing in hastily, they found a tiny fish {{at the end of}} the hook.|$|R

5000|$|Gabrels {{would later}} {{describe}} {{the songs on}} the album as the band [...] "screaming at the world", and Tony Sales, bassist for the band, described the band's approach to the music they created by saying: We were so sick of turning {{on the radio and}} hearing disco and dance music and drum machines; all that stuff, which I think in the business they call [...] "crap." [...] We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about doing a project that would put an end to rock 'n' roll.|$|R
5000|$|In Dr Adder music {{does not}} only have an {{aesthetic}} value. KCID plays Wozzeck, then he begins to interpret the opera by applying it to the situation of his listeners. [...] "Hohl, alles hohl! That's the way it is, all right. Isn't that what you <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking?</b> Ein Schlund, a gulf, an abyss, yawns beneath us and what can we do, friends? Some of us wait all our lives for something..." [...] (Jeter, 135-6). This rambling monologue closely resembles those of freeform radio DJs.|$|R
5000|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "Animal Farm", Ray Davies said, [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>just</b> me <b>thinking</b> {{everybody}} else's mad {{and we are}} all animals anyway - which is really the idea of the whole album." ...|$|R

500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season. He once again became showrunner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean said that [...] "the hardest thing at this point <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] In April 2001, in an interview with The New York Times, Jean stated that he wanted [...] "to take the show back to the family".|$|R

5000|$|In a 2013 interview, Duritz {{explained}} that the song is named for his friend Marty Jones, {{but that it is}} about Duritz himself. [...] "I wrote a song about me, I <b>just</b> happened to <b>be</b> out with him that night," [...] Duritz said. The inspiration for the song came as Duritz and Jones were drunk at a bar after watching Jones' father perform, when they saw Kenney Dale Johnson, longtime drummer for the musician Chris Isaak, sitting with three women. [...] "It just seemed like, you know, we couldn't even manage to talk to girls, ... we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> if we <b>were</b> rock stars, it'd be easier. I went home and wrote the song," [...] Duritz said.|$|R
6000|$|Then he explained: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> {{how much}} you were like Miss Lottie-if you'll excuse my being so personal. And it never struck me before." ...|$|E

500|$|Stylistically, [...] "Oh Love" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as power pop. Its musical style is reminiscent of the band's early albums Dookie (1994) and Nimrod (1997). It is a [...] "move away" [...] from the band's politically inspired releases like American Idiot (2004) and 21st Century Breakdown (2009). Bassist Mike Dirnt described the musical style of [...] "Oh Love" [...] by stating, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> about making a killer power-pop record– dirtier, back to basics. We tapped into our version of Exile on Main Street". Vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong also talked about his desire to write a power pop song, stating, [...] "What I really wanted to do was write real power-pop kind of music that had that old Green Day energy, so the original Green Day sound became ¡Uno!".|$|R

5000|$|In week six, having {{performed}} [...] "On My Own" [...] from Les Misérables, {{she received}} some {{criticism from the}} judges. Lloyd Webber suggested {{that she needed to}} learn how to disguise the break in her voice, and Charlotte Church agreed, saying that her top notes could get [...] "a little bit shouty". Sheila Hancock agreed with Church, but was still full of praise, saying that she saw a similar [...] "star quality" [...] to that of Catherine Zeta-Jones. In this sing-off, Hope competed against Jessica Robinson, who was the only remaining contestant not to have been in the bottom two. After performing [...] "Take That Look Off Your Face" [...] from Tell Me on a Sunday, Lloyd Webber once again saved Hope, stating that [...] "Both of you are really terrific girls, but I <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>thinking</b> of Dorothy here, so I am going to save Danielle".|$|R
