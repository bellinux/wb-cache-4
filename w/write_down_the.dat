5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can <b>write</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Mahavira's teachings were {{compiled}} by his Ganadhara (chief disciple), Gautama Swami. The sacred canonical scriptures comprised twelve parts. According to the Digambaras, Āchārya Bhutabali {{was the last}} ascetic who had partial knowledge of the original canon. Later, some learned Āchāryas started to restore, compile, and <b>write</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Mahavira that were {{the subject matter of}} the Agamas. Āchārya Dharasena, in the 1stcentury CE, guided Āchārya Pushpadant and Āchārya Bhutabali as they wrote down these teachings.

40|$|In {{mathematical}} instruction, {{problem solving}} {{in a real}} life is usually actualized in form of word problems. In fact however the student’s ability in word problems is very poor. The low of student ability is shown {{with the number of}} errors they made. Hence error analysis needs to do to know where the students make mistakes. The method {{that can be used to}} analyze student’s errors is Newman’s Error Analysis (NEA). There are five steps in Newman’s Error Analysis Method, they are: reading, comprehension, transformation, process skill, and encoding. This study is aimed to describe: (1) errors that very often done by students in solving word problems, and (2) forms of error done by students in solving word problems. The study is a quantitative descriptive research. The study was implemented to students of SMP Muhammadiyah 06 DAU Malang grade of VIII-A. The data collection used test and interview. The data analysis used descriptive analysis to the forms of student’s error. While the simple statistical analysis is used to level of errors made by students in solving word problems in Newman’s prompt. The result of study shown that errors which very often done by students in solving word problems placed in encoding step. The errors in reading step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase that is not very clear, give meaning of word/phrase incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> meaning of word/phrase at all. The errors in comprehension step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given components incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given components briefly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given and asked components incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> given and asked components at all. The errors in transformation step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method unproperly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method incompletely, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> method at all. The errors in process skill step are: doing computation in wrong method, doing errors in computation, doing misconception, not continuing the procedure of solution, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> procedure of solution. The errors in encoding step are: <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding incorrectly, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding in properer unit, <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding properly, and not <b>writing</b> <b>down</b> encoding at al...|$|R

5|$|When You Reach Me is a Newbery Medal-winning {{science fiction}} and mystery novel by Rebecca Stead, {{published}} in 2009. It {{takes place in}} the Upper West Side in New York during 1978 and 1979 and follows the protagonist, Miranda Sinclair. She receives a strange note asking her to record future events and <b>write</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> location of her spare key. As the novel progresses, Miranda receives three more notes with requests. The novel contains three story lines— the appearance of Miranda's mom on the game show, The $20,000 Pyramid, Miranda's best friend Sal suddenly not talking with Miranda, and the appearance of a laughing man. Central themes in the novel include independence, redemption and friendship. Stead also wanted to demonstrate the possibilities that she saw in time travel. The author hoped to show her children what New York was like in her childhood, and demonstrate how in an earlier time children were more independent.|$|E

5|$|The stadium had a {{book value}} of NOK230 million, {{way over the}} real value, causing Start Toppfotball to have to <b>write</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> investment. To finance this, Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, bought Start Stadion from Start Toppfotball for NOK2,600 on 23 December 2008. At the same time, the club signed a 40-year {{agreement}} to lease the stadium from Sparebanken Sør for NOK12 million per year. On 7 March 2009, the bank also bought the remaining shares of Start Toppfotball, becoming the sole owner of both the club and the stadium. Sparebanken Sør offered to sell Sparebanken Sør Arena to the municipality for NOK100 million, but the municipality rejected this on 29 May. The bank subsequently sold Start Stadion and Start Toppfotball to Ravnaas on 25 June for NOK1 each. Start Stadion {{had at the time}} a debt of NOK34 million to Start Toppfotball, NOK60 million to Sparebanken Sør and NOK40 million to Kristiansand Municipality. Sparebanken Sør lost NOK80 million in their transactions with Start and Sparebanken Sør Arena.|$|E
