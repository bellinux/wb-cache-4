What appeared to others as political arguments were for Priestley always, at their root, religious arguments. Many of what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> Priestley's political writings were aimed at supporting the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts, a political issue that had its foundation in religion.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine Ananda Vikatan criticised {{the gaps in}} the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters. K. Balamurugan of Rediff said, [...] "It was what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> parallel cinema these days." ...|$|E

Today, however, this music is disparaged and labeled as [...] "sweet music" [...] by jazz purists. The music that people consider today as [...] "jazz" [...] tended to be played by minorities. In the 1920s and early 1930s, however, {{the majority of people}} listened to what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> today [...] "sweet music" [...] and hardcore jazz was categorized as [...] "hot music" [...] or [...] "race music." ...|$|E
500|$|Almendra is {{considered}} a paradigm of the growing influence of the youth-led counterculture of the 1960s on Argentina at that time, {{as well as a}} representative of that generation. After Spinetta's death, President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said: [...] "That record of the teardrop, when <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> albums long plays, and [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", I will never forget them." [...] Charly García, also on the occasion of Spinetta's death, stated: [...] "I can not describe the shock that Almendra's first album caused me. For me, [...] "La balsa" [...] was the originator of Argentine rock, but without a doubt, Luis Alberto and company were its architects." ...|$|E

As a revolutionary activist in Cuba's long struggle for independence he translated into English a number of articles and pamphlets supporting that movement. In addition to fluent English, Martí also spoke French, Italian, Latin and Classical Greek fluently, the latter learned so he could read the Greek classical works in the original.|$|E

2500|$|Meucci {{separated}} the two directions of transmission {{in order to}} eliminate the so-called [...] "local effect", adopting what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> today a 4-wire-circuit.

As {{he was aware that}} his device required a bigger band than a telegraph, he found some means to avoid the so-called [...] "skin effect" [...] through superficial treatment of the conductor or by acting on the material (copper instead of iron).

2500|$|Bengali-Indian {{physicist}} Jagadish Chandra Bose {{was first}} to use a crystal as a radio wave detector, using galena detectors to receive microwaves starting around 1894. In 1901, Bose filed for a U.S. patent for [...] "A Device for Detecting Electrical Disturbances" [...] that mentioned {{the use of a}} galena crystal; this was granted in 1904, #755840. The device depended on the large variation of a semiconductor's conductance with temperature; today <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> his invention a bolometer. Bose's patent is frequently, but erroneously, cited as a type of rectifying detector. On August 30, 1906, Greenleaf Whittier Pickard filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906. Pickard's detector was revolutionary in that he found that a fine pointed wire known as a [...] "cat's whisker", in delicate contact with a mineral, produced the best semiconductor effect (that of rectification).|$|E

I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood.

2500|$|In short, {{he shifted}} {{attention}} to the perception of different sounds. Boas begins by raising an empirical question: when people describe one sound in different ways, is it because they cannot perceive the difference, or might there be another reason? He immediately establishes {{that he is not}} concerned with cases involving perceptual deficit—the aural equivalent of color-blindness. He points out that the question of people who describe one sound in different ways is comparable to that of people who describe different sounds in one way. This is crucial for research in descriptive linguistics: when studying a new language, how are we to note the pronunciation of different words? (in this point, Boas anticipates and lays the groundwork for the distinction between phonemics and phonetics.) People may pronounce a word {{in a variety of ways}} and still recognize that they are using the same word. The issue, then, is not [...] "that such sensations are not recognized in their individuality" [...] (in other words, people recognize differences in pronunciations); rather, it is that sounds [...] "are classified according to their similarity" [...] (in other words, that people classify a variety of perceived sounds into one category). A comparable visual example would involve words for colors. The English word [...] "green" [...] can be used to refer to a variety of shades, hues, and tints. But there are some languages that have no word for [...] "green". In such cases, people might classify what <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> [...] "green" [...] as either [...] "yellow" [...] or [...] "blue". This is not an example of color-blindness—people can perceive differences in color, but they categorize similar colors in a different way than English speakers.|$|E
