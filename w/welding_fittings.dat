50|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War II, in 1946, Sam Zidell's son Emery, who now headed the business, {{purchased}} the shipyard of Commercial Iron Works in Portland {{and turned it into a}} shipbreaking yard, called the Zidell Ship Dismantling Company. With scrap steel in high demand for rebuilding America's industrial base in the postwar period, business boomed and by the 1960s the company, now known as Zidell Explorations, Inc., had become America's largest shipbreaker. In the course of its thirty years of shipbreaking operations, Zidell dismantled a total of 336 ships, including many World War II-era Liberty ships and naval auxiliaries, and some warships.From 1948, Zidell also began to recover industrial valves from its shipbreaking operations and resell them, a business that was eventually spun off into the Zidell Valve Corporation. Zidell Valves was sold in 1997 to Pon Holdings of the Netherlands. In 1955, Emery Zidell also founded Tube Forgings of America, Inc. (TFA), which supplies <b>welding</b> <b>fittings</b> for a wide variety of applications. TFA was the first US manufacturer of carbon steel <b>welding</b> <b>fittings</b> to earn an ISO-90002 certification and is one of the world's largest manufacturers of such fittings today.|$|E

40|$|An {{opportunity}} {{given by}} {{the oil and gas}} industry, although initiated by Shell, has been met with a successful product development relationship between AB Sandvik Steel, Swagelok Co. and Edison Welding Institute. The result is a new integrated fluid system solution using Sandvik’s super duplex stainless steel; SAF 2507, which performs successfully in highly corrosive, chloride containing environments. The system comprises Swagelok gaugeable super duplex tube and <b>weld</b> <b>fittings,</b> an autogenous orbital welding process for welding SAF 2507 alloy components using the Swagelok welding system and the GTAW flux developed by Edison Welding Institute and Sandvik SAF 2507 super duplex tubing. The applied system solutions created by the synergy effect between Sandvik’s materials’ expertise, Edison Welding Institute’s diverse welding know-how and Swagelok’s <b>fittings</b> and <b>welding</b> expertise, has enabled an integrated fluid system to be built which has solved industry problems. For the first time, there are tube and <b>weld</b> <b>fitting</b> systems available which provide a solution for SAF 2507 super duplex applications which are easy to use and have proven reliability. The integrated team of the companies involved initiated the development of a SAF 2507 alloy product line in the later part of 1998.

40|$|Abstract – This study {{deals with}} the {{development}} of an electrofusion welding machine that is capable of joining plastic pipes using a recently developed electrofusion fitting. This fitting has built-in conductive plastics that are used to weld the joint together as a heating element. In order to explain the mechanism of the new machine, 1) the resistance characteristics of the heating element were explained, 2) the method of electric welding that uses the electrofusion fitting was described, and 3) the method of power supply based on controlling the firing angle was explained. A control system for an intelligent electrofusion welding machine was proposed. This system has the ability to recognize the diameter of an electrofusion fitting using a lookup-table based on the difference of resistance curves according to fitting types, and it is able to <b>weld</b> the <b>fittings</b> regardless of the ambient temperature. A new algorithm was developed to control the power of electric welding through the recognition of feature points from the resistance curve of the heating element.

The reality is that for most roadways and bridges today, it is more practical to bring concrete into the design as well. Most T-beam construction is not with steel or concrete alone, but rather with the composite of the two, namely, reinforced concrete. Though the term could refer {{to any one of}} a number of means of reinforcement, generally, the definition is limited to concrete poured around rebar. This shows that in considering materials available for a task, engineers need to consider the possibility that no one single material is adequate for the job; rather, combining multiple materials together may be the best solution.

40|$|Abstract At {{the plant}} of Outokumpu Stainless Tubular Products AB in Molkom {{a wide range}} of butt <b>weld</b> <b>fittings</b> are produced. These are aimed mainly for the process {{industries}} and one of the products are ninety degree bend elbows in various dimensions. The elbows are made from stainless sheet metal and when formed to a tube they need to be welded along its inner radius. This is made by a pick and place type industrial robot working in a closed compartment. The assignment given by Outokumpu aims to investigate and suggest a new concept for a more reliable manufacturing process within the work cell.   The cell consists of five main areas chronologically listed as passed by the elbow: ·          Automated, vibrating conveyor. ·          Fixture with the purpose to serve the robot with one elbow at a time, placed in the correct position. ·          Industrial robot to pick up the elbow and drag it along the welding head. ·          TIG inverter with a stationary welding head·          A hydraulic press with a template of the final shape of the elbow corrects flaws.  Almost every problem in the cell and defects on the products coming out of it {{can be traced back to}} the fixture and in some cases also to the robots pick up tooling. The focus of the task was therefore put mainly on those two areas. As the work proceeded Outokumpu chose to develop a new tool for the robot themselves which they did with good results. I chose to incorporate it into my study and change focus to the fixture instead.   The problems and possible causes to them were identified and discussed with my tutor: The elbows fall incorrectly into or beside of the fixture.   Fixtures are old and worn down. The elbows path between conveyor and fixture are somewhat out of control The smaller dimensions have room enough to slip past the fixture. Edges to be welded are to far from each other or badly shaped Commissioning time, some start up steps is more complex then they need to be. Some of the setting possibilities in the working cell are unnecessary and can be fixed instead. The positions of pick up and welding head are not really fixed in the robot software, these are reprogrammed every time elbow size are changed. ·          Various errors at weldingo    Robot managed to pick incorrectly placed elbow   Proposals to solve the above specified problems: All parts in contact with the elbows are to be made of harden able steel. A suitable one is C 45 E which can be casehardened to about 700 HV. On the outer edge of the conveyer a support are placed to prevent excessive wear. The fixture is partially redesigned with a support to control the elbows path better. Guide arms with dual purpose are added. First they guide the elbow into the fixture and secondly they turn it to the correct angle towards the robot. Pins are used along with quick lock clamps to obtain faster and easier commissioning.

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent <b>fitting,</b> <b>welding,</b> and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|R

Regarding the fitting of the acrylic, a suitable solution is to make a flange when vacuum forming the plastic casing to further support the design. This could also be used to waterproof the case by using a sealing material. A suggestion of using pre-molded PU-foam is also presented. Regarding the ability to open the case for maintenance, two solutions were recommended. Either the use of spire clips or having the clips integrated into the casing. Regarding the calculation of material usage when deep drawing the tank and collector, it is possible to do a reasonably accurate assumption. The complicated design in this product makes the estimation less accurate. It is recommended that test draws are done and often the machine producer has more precise numbers. Regarding the coloring of the collector; chemical coloration is not possible on a galvanized surface. The method used is painting, either with powder coating or with wet paint. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} {{considerable}} {{research in the area}} of polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites. This research has shown that the dispersion of small amounts of an organically modified layered silicate improves the polymer strength, modulus, thermal stability, and barrier properties. There have been several reports on the dispersion of layered silicates in an epoxy matrix. Potential enhancements to the barrier properties of epoxy/silicate nanocomposites make this material attractive for low permeability tankage. Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) have several advantages for cryogenic storage tanks. They are lightweight, strong, and stiff; therefore, a smaller fraction of a vehicle's potential payload capacity is used for propellant storage. Unfortunately, the resins typically used to make PMC tanks have higher gas permeability than metals. This can lead to hydrogen loss through the body of the tank instead of just at <b>welds</b> and <b>fittings.</b> One approach to eliminate this problem is to build composite tanks with thin metal liners. However, although these tanks provide good permeability performance, they suffer from a substantial mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion, which can lead to failure of the bond between the liner and the body of the tank. Both problems could be addressed with polymersilicate nanocomposites, which exhibit reduced hydrogen permeability, making them potential candidates for linerless PMC tanks. Through collaboration with Northrop Grumman and Michigan State University, nanocomposite test tanks were manufactured for the NASA Glenn Research Center, and the helium permeability was measured. An organically modified silicate was prepared at Michigan State University and dispersed in an epoxy matrix (EPON 826 /JeffamineD 230). The epoxy/silicate nanocomposites contained either 0 or 5 wt% of the organically modified silicate. The tanks were made by filament winding carbon fibers with the nanocomposite resin. Helium permeability was measured by Northrop Grumman, showing that the leak rate/day of the nanocomposite matrix tank was approximately 80 -percent less than that of the neat epoxy matrix tank...|$|R
40|$|In {{offshore}} subsea engineering, Flow Loops are {{the common}} name of pipings and <b>fittings</b> <b>welded</b> {{together to form}} a loop that carries production media from one point to another. Flow Loops are made of high strength stainless steels which are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. In combination with tensile loads, this may cause failure due to hydrogen induced stress cracking. Finite element simulations are made when investigating the risk of this type of failure. The analyses must follow recommended practice, issued by Det Norske Veritas, to be approved. Problems with these analyses are that the modelling of Flow Loops is time consuming and rather tedious. Also, the recommended practice has been difficult to interpret with the effect that different engineers perform the analyses in various ways. This project aims to solve these problems by creating a tool that automates the procedure of creating Flow Loop finite element models and from the obtained results evaluates the Flow Loop’s resistance against hydrogen induced stress cracking by following the recommended practice.

40|$|Propulsion {{systems that}} utilize hypergolic {{propellants}} {{have been used}} to power space vehicles {{since the beginning of the}} space program. Liquid methane and oxygen propulsion systems have emerged as an alternative and have proven to be more environmentally friendly. The incorporation of liquid methane/liquid oxygen (LOX) into the propulsion system has demonstrated an increase in engine performance, as well as a reduction in the volume, size and complexity of the system. Consequently, reducing the total mass of the vehicle which is a crucial aspect that is considered when planning space missions to both the Moon and Mars [1]. Project Morpheus has made significant advancements in liquid oxygen/liquid methane propulsion system technologies by incorporating a LOX/methane propulsion system to a vertical test bed. The vehicle consisted of a 5, 000 lb main engine and four 20 lb remote control system (RCS) engines that utilize liquid methane/LOX as its propellant [1]. The vehicle completed successful flight testing at Kennedy Space Center in 2014 which marked the completion of the Morpheus project. Subsequent projects utilizing Morpheus' vertical test bed have been developed to make further advancements. One of the subsequent projects consisted of the addition of a smaller 2, 000 lb main engine and a cold helium heat exchanger which would make it possible for a pressurant tank systems to be send to Mars or the Moon by significantly decreasing the overall mass and volume of the pressurant tank. The hot fire tests of the integrated system with the smaller main engine and cold helium heat exchanger were successful at sea level, but further studies are being conducted to better understand how the vertical test bed will behave under thermal-vacuum conditions. For this reason, the integrated vehicle will be taken to Plum Brook to be tested in a chamber capable of simulating these conditions. To ensure that the vehicle will function properly under vacuum conditions, testing will be first completed at the component level. During this process, the igniter of the main engine and the RCS thrusters will be tested under a vacuum. To complete the testing of the components, the test setup first needed to be finalized. The CryoCart is being used to feed the propellants to the test article. The CryoCart is a movable test set-up that was developed in 2009 to provide a mobile platform for testing oxygen/methane systems with hot-fire capability up to 100 lbf. The CryoCart consists of three different systems: Oxygen, Methane, and liquid Nitrogen. The Oxygen and Methane systems are placed into two different carts while the liquid nitrogen system is mainly located in the methane cart. Over the years, the CryoCart has been utilized for different projects and has undergone deterioration. For this reason, a new phase has been developed to rebuild it to working conditions once again. During my internship, I was aiding in the construction and restoration of the CryoCart. In the initial stages of the process, I updated the fluid and electrical schematics for the oxygen, methane, and test article systems. The original CryoCart consisted of an electrical panel that utilized electromechanical relays and a terminal to drive the igniter power and signal, as well as the main fuel and oxygen valves. This electrical panel connected to the CryoCart through various wire harnesses that could be found exiting from the CryoCart. First, it was determined how these harnesses connected to the electromechanical relays so that they worked correctly. Once the electrical system was understood, an alternative for the electromechanical relays and the Molex connectors used throughout the system was sought since these components can often prove to be unreliable. Solid State relays and MIL connectors were purchased to serve as replacements. Upon arrival of the parts, crimping and wiring was completed to install the new solid state relays and MIL connectors. During the replacement of the relays and connectors, system checks of the electrical system were ran to ensure that the system was working correctly. While completing system checks, the pressure transducers that were not functioning properly were also replaced and any issue with the wiring or signal was addressed. Once the electrical components were replaced, the restoration of the fluid system began. Parts of the tubing in the CryoCart had to be rebuild and often consisted of sizing, cutting, bending, filing, and sanding the tubing to prepare it to be flared. Many components had to be proof-tested to bring their certifications up to date, and several components had to be replaced. Various flex hoses, valves, and fittings were send to the Clean Lab because they were new, dirty, or had gone through proof-testing. Once they arrived from the cleaning lab they had to be put back to the system and leak checks and functional tests were conducted. In the Nitrogen system, the copper tubing located in the Oxygen cart was rebuild and Aerogel insulation was added to this section. A new gaseous nitrogen system was added to the CryoCart to purge the vacuum tube which will serve as the test chamber. Once the CryoCart was completed, construction of parts of the vacuum tube began. A flange was manufactured with <b>welded</b> <b>fittings</b> to hold the line of the vacuum pump as well as some extra fittings which will serve as extra inlets used to introduce fluid lines to the vacuum tube. Stress analysis was ran in this flange to ensure that it would not fail under vacuum conditions. The fluid lines leading from the air side of the vacuum to the test article were also constructed and added to the mount that had already been manufactured. Three different sets of tubing were constructed to accommodate the seven different RCS thruster and the main engine igniter that are going to be tested. Full electrical system checks were completed to ensure that all the wire harnesses and valves were functioning. Upon the completion of the CryoCart and the vacuum tube, hot fire testing for the RCS thrusters and the main engine igniter are going to begin. During this time any issues encountered with the engines or igniter will be addressed to ensure that the components function under vacuum conditions. After successful completion of testing, the vertical test bed, Morpheus, will be rebuilt and prepared to be sent to Plum Brook. In Plum Brook, the vehicle will be tested in the thermal-vacuum chamber to demonstrate that integrated lox-methane propulsion system operation in space-like conditions. This internship has allowed me the opportunity to gain valuable hands on experience and to develop skills that will aid in my education as well as in the workforce, while at the same time helping me determine that I would like to further pursue a career in propulsion engineering...|$|R
