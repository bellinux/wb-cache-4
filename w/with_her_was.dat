5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

She {{repeatedly}} apologized to him, but Omiya, {{unaware of the}} murder, assumed that she was apologizing for having taken another lover. In actuality, Abe's apologies were for the damage to his political career that she knew his association <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> bound to cause. After Ishida's body was discovered, a search was launched for Abe, who had gone missing. On May 19, 1936, the newspapers picked up the story. Omiya's career was ruined, and Abe's life was under intense public scrutiny from that point onwards.|$|E

She said she will continue to collaborate with Alicia Keys on her upcoming album, and she would be flattered to work with Knowles as her voice is unparalleled. Nicki Minaj was also someone who she would like to collaborate with on the album, but did not get the chance.

25|$|In 757, Prince Li Heng, who {{had taken}} the throne as Emperor Suzong, recaptured Chang'an and welcomed ex-Emperor Xuanzong, then Taishang Huang (retired emperor) back to the capital. Emperor Xuanzong went through Mawei {{on his way back}} to Chang'an. He wanted to locate Consort Yang's body and rebury her with honor. The {{official}} Li Kui spoke against it, pointing out that the imperial guard might again mutiny if he did so. However, Emperor Xuanzong secretly sent eunuchs to rebury her with a coffin. When they found the body, it had decomposed, but the fragrance bag buried <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> still fresh. The eunuchs returned with the fragrance bag, and upon its presentation to Emperor Xuanzong, he wept bitterly. When he returned to Chang'an, he had a painter create a picture of Consort Yang in a secondary palace, and often went there to view the portrait.|$|E

500|$|In May 1993 a victim's {{compensation}} {{case had}} awarded Leigh's {{mother and sister}} a combined total of $29,214. An appeal, aided by Carrington's research, was lodged against the original victim's compensation payout. In May 1995, in a landmark legal decision, Judge Joseph Moore approved the appeal, awarding Leigh's mother and sister an additional $134,048. Moore said the evidence indicated that Leigh rejected NC1's sexual advances, and that [...] "his intercourse <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> without her consent." [...] He also acknowledged that whoever sexually assaulted Leigh had never been brought to justice, {{and the lack of}} convictions for assault, specifically naming Jason Robertson and three other boys as those who assaulted her in addition to Webster and Wilson. Leigh's mother abandoned her efforts to have the case re-opened in 1997, citing [...] "exhaustion and survival".|$|E
500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit. Coming up with the lyrics was mainly [...] I'd tell her this is how I want it to go, and she would help with the lyrics, too, sometimes. She'd say, 'This doesn't really fit,' and if I was adamant, we'd make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / Got to let it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E

500|$|According to {{observations}} by Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, media {{references to}} Leigh being sexually assaulted [...] "almost completely disappeared" [...] {{in less than}} a year, as did the references to her being assaulted by the group of boys. They stated that the fact that NC1 was not charged with raping Leigh had created the legal fiction that his sex <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> consensual. The [...] "unsustainable assumption" [...] that Leigh consented to sex was the turning point in her being blamed for her own assault and murder on the grounds that, because she was supposedly sexually promiscuous, Leigh had somehow [...] "asked for [...] ". In addition to sexual promiscuity and the lack of parental supervision, Carrington states that media attention also shifted to the presence of drugs and alcohol at the party; Morrow and San Roque credit media attention to these factors as taking attention away from the abuse that Leigh suffered before she died. The epithet slut in a pretrial psychological report also became a topic of focus for the media: ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{involvement}} with Billy Abbott is another significant romance for Chloe, {{and the characters}} marry shortly after Delia is born. However, the marriage ended, {{paving the way for}} a reunion between Billy and his high school sweetheart, Mac Browning (Clementine Ford). In response {{to whether or not the}} Chloe and Billy pairing should be revisited, Hendrickson stated, [...] "You know what, I really hope so. I’ve definitely asked for it." [...] Chloe's next relationship is with Chance Chancellor (John Driscoll), Jill's grandson who is a virgin. Speaking of the developing romance, John Driscoll said, [...] "At this point Chloe is the object of his affection, and he is attracted to her. He is very interested in her because she has a very rocky background, but through and through she has just been herself. He respects her, and there is a spark and energy between them." [...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program. Of Chloe's [...] "heartbroken" [...] reaction to his [...] "death" [...] in spite of the bitter break-up, Hendrickson said, [...] "to open up and show what was going on <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> a great release for me, because that entire time she was remaining strong and stable, and like no one is going to mess with her. I mean, no one dumps Chloe Mitchell!" ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{factors have}} led to {{speculation}} that Webster was not alone when he killed Leigh. According to the transcript of Webster's confession, he was never asked if he acted alone. Carrington accused police of accepting Webster's confession at face value, ignoring both forensic and witness evidence. Her investigations highlighted several discrepancies in Webster's confession, and in the forensic evidence. For example, Webster stated in his confession that he had choked Leigh {{with his left hand}} as he knelt beside her although, according to the autopsy report, the bruises on Leigh's neck were consistent with being choked with a right hand. Carrington also questioned Webster's statement that he walked along lit streets {{to the other side of}} the Stockton peninsula to wash his bloodstained hands, when he could have washed his hands in total darkness at the beach less than [...] away. She also queried his claim that he had blood on his hands but none on his clothes, despite Leigh having been struck so hard blood was splattered 2.8 metres one way from her body and 1.3 metres the other way. Webster stated that he walked to the beach with Leigh, though according to police reports four witnesses said she walked to the beach alone; two witnesses stated they saw Webster and Wilson leave the surf club together. Neither NC1 nor Wilson had a reliable alibi for their whereabouts at the time of the murder; Wilson told police he was alone on the beach when Leigh walked past him as she left the club, minutes before she was murdered. Webster's statement that he only penetrated Leigh with his finger has been considered by various sources to be inconsistent with the autopsy findings of genital trauma, and the trauma is also inconsistent with NC1's account that his sex <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>was</b> consensual. In reviewing the autopsy, Boettcher said that the numerous blows which killed Leigh came from multiple directions, and were probably inflicted with different items, indicating the possibility of more than one perpetrator.|$|E
