5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp {{to the top of}} the stadium.

500|$|Two {{scenes in}} which Stewie {{graphically}} beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice, various household objects, and guns polarized people who viewed it. Several production members were offended. Cast members—as well as MacFarlane's mother and an animal rights advocate—enjoyed the scene; MacFarlane quoted his mother: [...] "I don't see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is? He (Brian) owed him (Stewie) money!", {{and so it}} was kept in the final cut. When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady, her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode. However, reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact. The gesture was also left intact on the DVD of [...] "Volume Four"; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom. After the initial airing of the episode, where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word, clemen, many viewers looked up the word on the Internet {{to try to find a}} definition. MacFarlane stated in the episode's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word, the show will have to stop using it (it has not been used since this episode).|$|E

500|$|While other [...] "new magazines—and {{many of the}} old—are {{dying of}} {{literary}} cirrhosis. The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction", Gold stated, Galaxy was profitable within five issues; an [...] "incredible" [...] achievement, in his words. The outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages—Gold wrote in a 1951 editorial that [...] "buying paper these days is like being mugged on a dark street"—that forced the magazine {{to find a new}} printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. That summer, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt Galaxys distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director {{and the head of the}} American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. [...] The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. [...] They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell Galaxy to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. [...] In Gold's words, [...] "he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".|$|E

The next day, Bart's class stops at the Krusty Burger after a field trip and Bart is shocked to discover Homer sitting at a booth alone. Homer comes clean and explains to Bart that his job interview did not go so well when his interviewer, the Rich Texan, discovered that Homer knows nothing about copper tubing. Bart convinces Homer that he should tell Marge what has happened and Homer calls her from a pay phone. But when Homer hears Marge’s happy voice he cannot bring himself to disappoint her and tell her the truth about his [...] "new" [...] job. Instead he concocts a story about him having to fly on the [...] "company" [...] jet for work and instructs Marge to meet him at the airport in an hour. Homer pays a Marine to fly him into the air, so he can tell Marge up in the air with luxury so she would not get upset. Once in the air, Marge cannot believe all the luxuries the private jet has to offer. Homer sits Marge down to tell her the truth, but just before he can, the plane endures turbulence. Homer and Marge head into the cockpit to see <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is, only to discover that the pilot had passed out. Homer shoves the pilot aside and takes hold of the jet’s controls. As the jet is about to hit the ocean, Marge pulls the jet's yoke up giving the jet altitude. Marge pulls out her cell phone and calls Colby Kraus and frantically asks for his guidance. Thanks to Colby's motivation, Homer manages to land the plane safely on the ground, however, his attempt to taxi back to the terminal fails and the plane falls into the ocean. After being airlifted out of the plane, Homer explains to Marge that flying in private jets is simply too dangerous and that he plans {{to go back to work}} at the Power Plant.|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s just different. We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
