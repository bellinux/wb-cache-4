5000|$|<b>Threaded</b> <b>inserts</b> are {{commonly}} used in plastic casings, housing, and parts to create a metal thread (typically: Brass or Stainless Steel) to allow for screws {{to be used in}} the assembly of many consumer electronics and consumer products. These may be cast in place in injection molded parts or they may be added by thermal insertion. In the latter, the insert is heated and then pressed into a hollow in the plastic part. The heat causes local melting in the plastic. [...] Ultrasonic Insertion is the process used to apply vibration and pressure to install the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> into a molded hollow boss (hole) of a plastic part. The ultrasonic vibrations melt the plastic where the metal insert is in contact, and pressure is applied to press it into position. The plastic material typically reforms around the knurled body of the <b>threaded</b> <b>insert</b> to ensure a good retention.|$|R

50|$|Here is some {{history as}} {{referenced}} {{in the forward}} of ASME B18.29.1. Helical coil screw <b>thread</b> <b>inserts</b> have been in use for many years. It was first invented in the 1930s and found initial acceptance in aircraft manufactured and serviced by the Allied Air Forces during World War II. Since that time, applications for helical coil inserts have come into broad usage in aerospace, automotive and industrial equipment. Usage originally included metric spark plus sizes that were delineated in Europe in the 1950s coming into inch using countries in the 1960s. ASME Subcommittee 29 of the B18 Committee put together {{the first version of}} a standard in 1993. In 2010, ANSI approved of recent revisions and ASME published a revision of B18.29.1 - Helical Coil Screw <b>Thread</b> <b>Inserts</b> - Free Running and Screw Locking (Inch Series).|$|R

50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a blind rivet nut or <b>threaded</b> <b>insert,</b> is a {{one-piece}} internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side.

50|$|Tiger {{tail wire}} (also simply called tiger tail or tiger-tail) {{is a kind}} of thin wire encased in nylon often used in beaded jewellery, and that is {{particularly}} suited to stringing heavy beads and sharp beads, which tend to fray other kinds of thread. For this reason, tiger tail is the thread of choice for gemstones. Some tiger tail has multiple intertwined <b>wire</b> <b>threads</b> under the nylon coating. The <b>wire</b> <b>threads</b> are made of stainless steel. Tiger tail cannot be fashioned into a knot in order to end a sequence of beads as other kinds of thread can, therefore crimp beads are often used for this purpose instead. Crimp beads are also used as spacers between other beads strung on tiger tail. Among the types of wire used for bead stringing, tiger tail is the most common. Tiger tail is easier to use than many other kinds of thread, and it does not require the use of a sewing needle. Tiger tail has high ultimate tensile strength and is therefore extremely difficult to tear, but if it is creased or twisted, tiger tail has a tendency to kink and then become brittle in the kinked area.|$|R
