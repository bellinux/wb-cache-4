2500|$|Regine {{had also}} made a strong {{impression}} on Kierkegaard, who began to pursue her {{over a long period}} of time, ingratiating himself first as a friend and later attempting to court her. [...] On 8 September 1840, Kierkegaard finally revealed his feelings to Regine when she was playing the piano for him at her family's house. [...] He recounted the events years later in his journal: [...] "'Oh! [...] <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for music, it's you I want, I have wanted you for two years.' [...] She kept silent." [...] Kierkegaard proceeded to plead his case to Etatsraad (Councilman) Olsen, Regine's father, immediately. [...] Her father granted Kierkegaard his blessing, and the two became engaged to be married.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1900s, the {{following}} tangos were being played: [...] "El queco" [...] (anonymous, attributed to clarinetist Lino Galeano in 1885), [...] "Señora casera" [...] (anonymous 1880), [...] "Andate a la recoleta" [...] (anonymous 1880), [...] "El Porteñito" [...] (by the Spaniard Gabriel Diez in 1880), [...] "Tango Nº1" [...] (Jose Machado - 1883), [...] "Dame la lata" [...] (Juan Perez, 1888), [...] "Que polvo con tanto viento" [...] (anonymous 1890), [...] "No me tires con la tapa de la olla" [...] (A.A. 1893), [...] "El Talar" [...] (Prudencio Aragon - 1895). One {{of the first}} women to write tango scores was Eloísa D’Herbil. She wrote such pieces as Y a mí qué (<b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care),</b> Che no calotiés! (Hey, no stealing) and others, between 1872 and 1885.|$|E

60|$|I {{had known}} him long enough not to take offense at his {{reminding}} me, in this considerate way, that I was a poor man. The proposed change of scene tempted me. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for the Channel passage? Besides, there was the irresistible attraction of getting away from home. The end {{of it was that}} I accepted Romayne's invitation.|$|R
60|$|Viewing this {{suggestion}} as another act of impertinence {{on the part}} of the Baroness, I persisted in my intention of going to the concert. It was for the Princess to decide what course of conduct I was bound to follow. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for the Doctor's report to the Duke! Shall I own my folly? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> really believe <b>I</b> was jealous of the Duke.|$|R
60|$|So {{he led her}} away, but <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> My {{heart was}} beating with the rapture of her {{backward}} glance. <b>I</b> <b>cared</b> neither for Ray nor the Duke nor any living person. For with me {{it was the one}} supreme moment of a man's lifetime, come too at the very moment of my despair. I was no longer {{at the bottom of the}} pit. The wonderful gates stood open.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about Harry? I {{hate him}} because he's stood {{between me and}} you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe! The {{woodland}} gods still live! And out there, {{the great}} land. It's beautiful as the mountains. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for Thanatopsises?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind that," [...] {{retorted}} Ruggedo. [...] "Tititi-Hoochoo {{lives on}} the other side of the world, so <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for his anger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dagont, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> {{about his}} hair? and {{yet to see}} her fondling it! I says to myself, 'Mrs. Dishart,' I says to mysel', 'I was the chief {{instrument}} under God in bringing him to Thrums, and I've come {{here to tell you}} that I'm to be the chief instrument under God in driving him out o't.' Ay, but when I focht to bring out these words, my mouth snecked like a box.|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about Rembrandt at that moment? I was {{thinking}} of my lost young lady; and I should probably have taken no notice of Mr. Pickup, {{if it had not}} occurred to me that the old wretch must know her father's name and address. I at once put the question. The Jew grinned, and shook his grisly head. [...] "Her father'sh in difficultiesh, and mum's the word, my dear." [...] To that answer he adhered, in spite of all that I could say to him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's right. Now {{you must}} see my house--lonely, isn't it, {{for a single}} person? People said it was odd for a young woman like me to keep on a house; but <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> If you knew the {{pleasure}} of locking up your own door, with the sensation that you reigned supreme inside it, you {{would say it was}} worth the risk of being called odd. Mr. Springrove attends to my gardening, the dog attends to robbers, and whenever there is a snake or toad to kill, Jane does it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MARY. If {{you have}} done wrong, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> If you have failed, does it change my twenty years of love and worship? Never! ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> {{so long as}} you love? You {{can think}} {{anything}} you like of me. The fact remains that you love me.|$|E
6000|$|... "My cash-box! My--he--look here, Captain Davidson! He ran {{off with}} a girl. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for the girl? The girl is nothing to me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} my intention, originally, to speak the strange ship, as I had told Sennit; but seeing there was no {{probability}} of her altering her course, so as to pass the boat, I changed my purpose, and stood directly athwart her fore-foot, at about half a mile's distance. I set the Yankee bunting, and she showed the English ensign, in return. Had she been French, however, {{it would have made}} no odds to me; for, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about my late captors becoming prisoners of war? They had endeavoured to benefit themselves at my cost, and I was willing enough to benefit myself at theirs.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hate her. I had pretended to, but {{the words}} came from the mouth. In my heart I loved her still, more passionately than ever. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> if she was heartless and cruel and faithless and vicious! It was nothing to me as long as I could hold {{her in my arms}} and cover her with kisses. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> despise her; <b>I</b> knew her for what she was, but still I loved her insanely. Oh, if she would only come back to me! I would willingly forget {{everything}} and forgive her. Nay, I would ask her forgiveness and grovel before her, if she would only let me enjoy her love again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had other}} lovers. You drove them away--No! no! I don't mean that. It was I that drove them away. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for lovers, for anything, {{when you were}} near? But as I said, Aunt Mildred and Uncle grew afraid. There has been talk--friends, busybodies, and all the rest. The time went by. You <b>did</b> not speak. <b>I</b> could only wonder, wonder. I knew you loved me. Much was said against you by Uncle at first, and then by Aunt Mildred. They were father and mother to me, you know. I could not defend you. Yet I was loyal to you. I refused to discuss you. I closed up. There was half-estrangement in my home--Uncle Robert with a face like an undertaker, and Aunt Mildred's heart breaking. But <b>what</b> could <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Chris? <b>What</b> could <b>I</b> do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|FENWICK. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> I {{loved you}} too. Little {{he thought of}} that, little either of you thought of that. His blood--I'll have his blood! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Object? no. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> {{about his}} being a fat? It's of no {{consequence}} to me. I'll {{invite him to}} Diplow again if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> {{why you are}} here? Why am I here? I, who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly {{virtue and}} propriety! ...|$|E
6000|$|But--that sort {{of thing}} {{is one of the}} aspects of the sport. I was sorry, for Captain Dan's sake. The rivalries between boatmen are keen and important, and they are fostered by unsportsman-like {{fishermen}}. And fishermen live among past associations; they grow to believe their performances unbeatable and they hate to see a new king crowned. This may be human, since we are creatures who want always to excel, but it is irritating to the young fishermen. As for myself, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> how much the swordfish weighed? He was huge, magnificent, beautiful, and game to the end of that four-hour battle. Who or what could change that--or the memory of those schools of flying-fish in the sunset glow--or the giant tuna, smashing the water all about me--or the eagles fighting over my head--or the beauty of wild and lonely Clemente under its silver cloud-banks? ...|$|R
60|$|REDPENNY. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> {{you suppose}} <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about the {{birthday}} honors? Get {{out of this}} with your chattering. Dr Ridgeon will be down before I have these letters ready. Get out.|$|R
60|$|It {{was exactly}} as I had expected. There were three great British steamers {{lying at anchor}} in Boulogne outer harbour. They were the Caesar, the King of the East, and the Pathfinder, none less than ten {{thousand}} tons. I suppose {{they thought they were}} safe in French waters, but <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about three-mile limits and international law! The view of my Government was that England was blockaded, food contraband, and vessels carrying it to be destroyed. The lawyers could argue about it afterwards. My business was to starve the enemy any way I could. Within an hour the three ships were under the waves and the Iota was streaming down the Picardy coast, looking for fresh victims. The Channel was covered with English torpedo-boats buzzing and whirling like a cloud of midges. How they thought they could hurt me I cannot imagine, unless by accident I were to come up underneath one of them. More dangerous were the aeroplanes which circled here and there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bah!" [...] {{burst out}} Pan in a scorn that was rude, though {{he meant it}} for Hardman. [...] "That pop-eyed skunk! <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has he? how? But <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care!</b> Tom, you'll {{drive me}} crazy--why can't you answer a simple {{question}} instead of going off into fifty other things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, {{thought a}} while, then added: [...] "Well, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> how she blows to others, {{so long as}} she blows hot to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard! Guess it is. <b>What</b> in thunder <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> {{about the}} old Carthaginians? Regulus was n't bad; but I 'm sick of him!" [...] And Tom dealt [...] "Harkness's Latin Reader" [...] a thump, which {{expressed}} his feelings better than words.|$|R
60|$|You'd have laughed--or the rewerse--it's {{according}} to your disposition--if you could have seen me trying to teach Sophy. At first I was helped--you'd never guess by what--milestones. I got some large alphabets in a box, all the letters separate on bits of bone, and saying we was going to WINDSOR, I give her those letters in that order, and then at every milestone I showed her those same letters in that same order again, and pointed towards the abode of royalty. Another time I give her CART, and then chalked the same upon the cart. Another time I give her DOCTOR MARIGOLD, and hung a corresponding inscription outside my waistcoat. People that met us might stare a bit and laugh, but <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care,</b> if she caught the idea? She caught it after long patience and trouble, and then we did begin to get on swimmingly, I believe you! At first {{she was a little}} given to consider me the cart, and the cart the abode of royalty, but that soon wore off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Without minding <b>what</b> any one <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not <b>care</b> for, said," [...] Frank interrupted. [...] "Certainly; {{why should}} I heed a bit <b>what</b> people <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>care</b> for say, {{so long as}} I feel that <b>I</b> am <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> is right." ...|$|R
60|$|LEE TAI. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> Perhaps if {{you loved}} me I shouldn't want you. Your hatred {{is like a}} sharp and bitter sauce that tickles my appetite.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, {{you think}} it's vulgar. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care?</b> You {{all of you}} think it's vulgar to be {{different}} from other people. I want to be unique." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh! <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for the Jinjin?" [...] asked Ruggedo scornfully. [...] "He never {{leaves his}} own kingdom, {{which is on}} the other side of the world." ...|$|E
60|$|I was so happy. The world went on; things {{happened}} in Forli, the rival parties agitated and met together and discussed; {{there was a}} general ferment--and to it all I was profoundly indifferent. What matter all the petty little affairs of life? I said. People work and struggle, plot, scheme, make money, lose it, conspire for place and honour; they have their ambitions and hopes; but what is it all beside love? I had entered into the excitement of politics in Forli; I was behind the veil and knew the intricacies, the ambitions, the emotions of the actors; but now <b>I</b> withdrew myself. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about the prospects of Forli, whether taxes were put on or taken off, or whether A killed B or B killed A, it really seemed so unimportant. I looked upon them as puppets performing on a stage, and I could not treat their acts with seriousness. Giulia! That was the great fact in life. Nothing mattered to me but Giulia. When I thought of Giulia my heart was filled with ecstasy, and I spat with scorn on all the silly details of events.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was {{indifferent}} {{to my own}} future,' Edward said, 'and was urged to promise adherence to my engagement with my cousin Adelaide by Miss Aldclyffe: now you are married I cannot tell you how, but it was on account of my father. Being forbidden to think of you, <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> <b>care</b> about anything? My new thought that you still loved me was first raised by what my father said in the letter announcing my cousin's marriage. He said that although you were to be married on Old Christmas Day--that is to-morrow--he had noticed your appearance with pity: he thought you loved me still. It was enough for me--I came down by the earliest morning train, thinking I could see you some time to-day, the day, as I thought, before your marriage, hoping, but hardly daring to hope, {{that you might be}} induced to marry me. I hurried from the station; when I reached the village I saw idlers about the church, and the private gate leading to the House open. I ran into the church by the small door and saw you come out of the vestry; I was too late. I have now told you. I was compelled to tell you. O, my lost darling, now I shall live content--or die content!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing. I want to gain nothing. Perhaps I shall {{discover}} {{some new}} species of antelope or some unknown plant. Perhaps I shall find some new waterway. That is all the reward I want. I love the sense of power and mastery. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> you think <b>I</b> <b>care</b> for the tinsel rewards of kings and peoples? ...|$|R
