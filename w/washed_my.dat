He wrote:Do not unjustly eat fish the water has given up,And do not desire as food the flesh of slaughtered animals,Or the white milk of mothers who intended its pure draughtfor their young, not noble ladies. And do not grieve the unsuspecting birds by taking eggs;for injustice is the worst of crimes.And spare the honey which the bees get industriouslyfrom the flowers of fragrant plants;For they did not store it that it might belong to others,Nor did they gather it for bounty and gifts.I <b>washed</b> <b>my</b> hands of all this; and wish that IPerceived my way before my hair went gray! ...|$|E

There are some pleasant notes upon dialect, including the story, often quoted, of the schoolboy whom Defoe saw and heard reading his Bible in class, and while following every word and line with his eye, translating it as he went into his own way of speech.
