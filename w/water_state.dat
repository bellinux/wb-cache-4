A controversial penny-a-pound (2 cent/kg) tax on sugar was proposed to fund {{some of the}} necessary changes {{to be made to}} help decrease phosphorus and make other improvements to <b>water.</b> <b>State</b> voters were asked to support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15million to encourage the issue. Sugar lobbyists responded with $24million in advertising to discourage it and succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history. How restoration might be funded became a political battleground and seemed to stall without resolution. However, in the 1996 election year, Republican senator Bob Dole proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200million to acquire land for the Everglades. Democratic Vice President Al Gore promised the federal government would purchase [...] of land in the EAA to turn it over for restoration.

40|$|The work {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the complexity and roles of <b>water</b> <b>states</b> in steam explosion process of corn stalk to enhance the treatment efficiency. Results showed that two main <b>water</b> <b>states</b> with different mobility existed in corn stalk and influenced steam explosion treatment. By correlating dynamic <b>water</b> <b>states</b> data to feedstock mechanical properties and treatment process characteristics, the bound water being the excellent plasticizer that reduced the mechanical strength of fibers by over 30 %, was conducive to treatment; while, the free water presenting buffering effects in treatment by hindering heat transfer which was reflected by the increase of temperature rising time by 1. 29 folds and steam consumption by 2. 18 folds, was not conducive. The distinguished point of these two waters was fiber saturated point. By considering treatment efficacy and energy consumption, the significance of fiber saturated point was highlighted as the optimal <b>water</b> <b>states</b> for steam explosion of corn stalk.

40|$|Thermomechanical {{relaxation}} {{events and}} different <b>water</b> <b>states</b> in cottonseed protein bioplastics are presented whilst investigating {{the effects of}} aldehyde cross-linking agents. Thermomechanical relaxation of cottonseed protein bioplastics associated with protein denaturation, moisture absorption and broad glass transitions (Tg) were observed from DSC and DMA measurements. It was shown that variation of the aldehyde influences the storage modulus at very low temperature (below Tg). From measurements of the water fusion point, enthalpy, vaporisation, and weight loss, three <b>water</b> <b>states</b> in the water-absorbed bioplastics are suggested; namely strongly-bound-to-polymer, weakly-bound-to-polymer and bulk-like water. The water content and unreacted cross-linking agents are influential factors in controlling formation of the different <b>water</b> <b>states,</b> whilst the selection of different aldehydes {{was found to be}} negligible. These results could be valuable for adjusting the thermomechanical relaxations of protein based bioplastics, and tailoring their properties in wet environments. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
