40|$|The annual {{incidence}} of Q fever in French Guiana {{was found to}} have increased in 1996 and was 37 / 100, 000 population over the last 4 years. Subsequent investigations in Cayenne and its suburbs indicated that a <b>wild</b> <b>reservoir</b> of the bacteria was responsible for the epi-demiologic pattern. A case-control study showed that residence near a forest and occupations and activities that result in exposure to aerosols of dusts from the soil are risk factors for Q fever. By means of time-series analysis, a strong positive correlation between rainfall and the incidence of Q fever with a time lag of 1 – 3 months was found. The spatial distribution of the cases showed that transmission occurs widely throughout greater Cayenne, which is incom-patible with a pinpoint source of contamination.

In each specimen adult worms of Dirofilaria immitis and hematic microfilariae were searched for. Species identification was performed by morphology, morphometry, the Barka staining technique applied to pulmonary and splenic blood smears, and, finally, by molecular diagnostics-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Twenty-three subjects (17. 4 %) proved to be positive for filarial parasites. Infection by Acanthocheilonema was more widespread than by Dirofilaria. Briefly, 8 foxes harbored mature adults of D. immitis; two of them (25 %) also had microfilariae that in one case were mixed with the microfilariae of D. repens. Twelve subjects had microfilariae of Acanthocheilonema reconditum, and 3 harbored microfilariae of A. dracunculoides. Molecular diagnostics confirmed all results. Our findings, drawn by the examination of a few microliters of blood obtained from foxes approximately < 2 years of age, {{support the hypothesis that}} this animal may be an abundant source of infection for ticks that transmit Acanthocheilonema parasites and for mosquitoes that act as vectors for dirofilarial nematodes.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the epidemiological transmission network of leishmaniasis, an endemic disease in Northeast Brazil, we investigated the susceptibility of Spix yellow-toothed cavies (Galea spixii) to the Leishmania infantum chagasi parasite. Nine cavies were experimentally infected, separated into three groups and monitored at 30, 90 and 180 days, respectively. Amastigotes were identified in the spleen slides of two cavies killed 180 days after infection. Antibodies against the L. i. chagasi were identified in one of the cavies. This demonstrates that G. spixii is in fact capable of maintaining a stable infection by L. i. chagasi without alterations in biochemical and hematologi-cal parameters of the host and without perceivable micro and macroscopic lesions.

The water rat Nectomys squamipes {{is one of the}} most important non-human hosts in the schistosomiasis mansoni transmission in Brazil, being considered a <b>wild</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Cellular mechanisms that contribute to the physiological adaptation of this rodent to the Schistosoma mansoni parasite are poorly understood. Here we identified, for the first time, that a hepatic steatosis, a condition characterized by excessive lipid accumulation with formation of lipid droplets (LDs) within hepatocytes, occurs in response to the natural S. mansoni infection of N. squamipes, captured in an endemic region. Significant increases of LD area in the hepatic tissue and LD numbers/hepatocyte, detected by quantitative histopathological and ultrastructural analyses, were paralleled by increased serum profile (total cholesterol and triglycerides) in infected compared to uninfected animals. Raman spectroscopy showed high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the liver of both groups. MALDI-TOFF mass spectroscopy revealed an amplified pool of omega- 6 PUFA arachidonic acid in the liver of infected animals. Assessment of liver functional activity by the levels of hepatic transaminases (ALT and AST) did not detect any alteration during the natural infection. In summary, this work demonstrates that the natural infection of the <b>wild</b> <b>reservoir</b> N. squamipes with S. mansoni elicits hepatic steatosis in the absence of liver functional harm and that accumulation of lipids, markedly PUFAs, coexists with low occurrence of inflammatory granulomatous processes, suggesting that lipid stores may be acting as a protective mechanism for dealing with the infection...|$|E

40|$|Zoonoses within <b>wild</b> <b>reservoir</b> host populations {{often occur}} focally obeying Pavlovskii’s rules of “natural nidality”. What {{appears to be}} a clear example is Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF), a disease endemic to northeastern Bolivia. The {{etiological}} agent is Machupo virus (MACV, Arenaviridae). The vertebrate reservoir, identified 30 years ago, was Calomys callosus a wild rodent common to open biomes in the lowlands of southeastern South America. The lack of concordance between the occurrence of MACV and the range of its rodent host has puzzled cadres of researchers and could be used as an exemplar of natural nidality. Here, we show that the populations of rodents responsible for the maintenance and transmission of MACV are an independent monophyletic lineage, different from those in other areas of South America. Therefore a clearer understanding of the systematics of the host species explains the apparent natural nidality of BHF.

Results: DNA was detected in tissues of one Cavia aperea (Brazilian guinea pig), five Cerdocyon thous (crab-eating fox), one Dasypus septemcinctus (seven-banded armadillo), two Didelphis albiventris (white-eared opossum), one Hydrochoerus hydrochoeris (capybara), two Myrmecophaga tridactyla (giant anteater), one Procyon cancrivorus (crab-eating raccoon), two Sphiggurus spinosus (porcupine) and one Tamandua tetradactyla (lesser anteater) from different locations in the Central Western part of Sao Paulo state.

Under the skin of two wolves (one from Serbia and one from Macedonia) and of a red fox from Serbia D. repens adults were found. In all three cases only one parasite was present. Further research on wild canids is needed, particularly on species widening their range (such as jackals) and those living near human settlements (foxes and jackals), which facilitates the transmission of the parasites to dogs and humans...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to collect precise data on every epizootic and to document the direct and indirect effects of each one. This situation {{makes it impossible to}} assess the damage that Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) causes in the Region of the Americas, as well as to identify new encephalitis strains, <b>wild</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> types of vectors in each enzootic cycle, and the period of immunity that the TC- 83 vaccine provides. This all shows that, in order to improve prevention and control activities, it is essential to have a standard information and epidemiological surveillance system that involves the official public health and animal health services. This text describes general aspects of VEE and the epidemiological features to consider in order to increase the predictive ability of epidemiological surveillance programs and to reduce the negative socioeconomic effects of the disease. The piece also describes laboratory diagnostic procedures to confirm suspected encephalitis cases. Finally, the text describes the characteristics and structure of an information system that will generate useful data to investigate enzootic foci and areas at risk, make forecasts on outbreaks and epidemics, detect encephalitides quickly, and guide prevention and control measures...|$|R
