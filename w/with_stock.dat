5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of the studio audience, with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version.

5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film <b>with</b> <b>stock</b> footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} {{other areas of}} South Australia, and Australia as a whole, {{settlers}} on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially, these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering <b>with</b> <b>stock</b> and other property, tactics which sometimes included violent clashes. Violence by settlers towards Aboriginal people often went unreported to the authorities, and became more secretive after a settler was hanged in March 1847 for murdering an Aboriginal man in the south east of the colony, the only such sentence {{in the history of}} South Australia's early white settlement.

5|$|After a {{continued}} lack of confirmation of a North American release, including it not being included in Nintendo's 2011 release schedule, a fan-based movement called Operation Rainfall started {{a campaign to}} raise awareness for The Last Story, Xenoblade Chronicles, and another Wii RPG titled Pandora's Tower. This campaign included letter writing to Nintendo and petitions for its overseas release. Despite acknowledging the effort, Nintendo stated {{that there were no}} plans for a North American release. Matsumoto was severely disappointed by this decision and thought The Last Story would never make it to North America. At this point, Xseed Games, who had developed a reputation for publishing niche Japanese games, took an interest in publishing the title. Initially approaching Nintendo in 2011, Nintendo confirmed that they had no plans to publish the title themselves. After playing through a Japanese copy of the game, and the staff were favorably impressed and decided to pitch to Nintendo for the game's North American publishing rights. They were helped by the connections between parent company AQ Interactive and Mistwalker. Xseed Games were the first publisher to ask Nintendo about The Last Story, and after being favorably impressed by their proposal, Nintendo granted Xseed Games publishing rights. While a new localization for North America was considered, it was decided to use Nintendo of Europe's localization as it better fitted the game's atmosphere and aesthetic. It officially released in North America on August 14, but problems <b>with</b> <b>stock</b> caused Amazon and GameStop to put orders on hold and push their release dates forward.|$|E

5|$|In March 1839, white {{settlers}} arrived from Adelaide, {{the capital of}} the colony of South Australia, to establish Port Lincoln on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula. There were significant clashes between settlers and Aboriginal people in the years that followed, as settlers spread out to establish pastoral runs around the township. In 1842, soldiers were sent to Port Lincoln from Adelaide to help protect the settlers, but the remoteness from Adelaide, and the vaguely defined powers and limited policing resources of the Government Resident, the local representative of the colonial government, meant that there were serious limitations on the rule of law in the region. This was especially true with respect to Aboriginal people, who were supposed to be treated as British subjects {{in the same way as}} the settlers. In common with other areas of South Australia, and Australia as a whole, settlers on the frontier employed various tactics to deal with Aboriginal resistance to being forced off their traditional lands. Initially these revolved around keeping them at a distance using threats of violence, but they soon escalated to terrorising Aboriginal people to stop them interfering <b>with</b> <b>stock</b> and other property, tactics which sometimes resulted in violent clashes.

This frontier violence has been described as an undeclared covert war between settlers and Aboriginal people.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the oncoming hurricane, the weather forecast office in New Orleans began to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches and advisories for the storm on August23. The first storm warnings were issued for areas of the United States Gulf Coast between New Orleans and Matagorda, Texas at 10:30 p.m CDT (0430UTC) that day, indicating an approaching system with considerable intensity. As the hurricane unexpectedly recurved to the north the next day, the previously issued storm warning was shifted eastward to include areas from Morgan City, Louisiana to Galveston, Texas, while a hurricane warning was issued by the weather forecast office for areas between Morgan City and Mobile, Alabama at 10:00p.m. CDT (0400UTC). A storm warning was also placed for areas east of Mobile to Apalachicola, Florida. After the hurricane rapidly weakened over land, warnings and advisories from the New Orleans weather office related to the storm were discontinued by 9:00p.m. (0500UTC) on August25. The warnings were communicated to potentially affected areas via mail, telegraph, {{and other forms of}} communication. During the time that the hurricane was approaching the coast, the United States Weather Bureau also began experimentally transmitting surface weather analysis maps to ships by radio. Small craft offshore of Mobile were recalled to the Port of Mobile, while floating dock property was removed in New Orleans. Due to the potential affects of the hurricane on the cotton industry, cotton stock markets reported gains of eight to fifteenpoints from the first trades, <b>with</b> <b>stock</b> prices closing with a net gain as high as 24points.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking Racing {{was meant}} to enable {{a broad range of}} strategies, such as keeping up but {{watching}} out for destruction opportunities, destroying the cars in front, and destroying everything without concern for position. This was hard to balance, but it proved possible to win with each of those strategies. Edmondson came up <b>with</b> <b>Stock</b> Car Racing after watching the Banger World Finals at Arena Essex and noticing that there were some cars simply racing rather than trying to destroy each other. The normal race mode was implemented simply because the engine could support running a traditional race. For Destruction Derby mode, more varied arenas were implemented {{to take advantage of a}} new physics system developed by Reflections. Edmondson decided against implementing features such as speed boosts and collectibles because he did not want the game to feel like an arcade game and wanted the car physics to be as realistic as possible. Destruction Derby 2 was released on the PlayStation in 1996, and a PC version soon followed. The next instalment in the Destruction Derby series, Destruction Derby Raw, was released in 2000.|$|E
