5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the <b>water</b> <b>course.</b> Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E
25|$|The {{story of}} {{gunpowder}} production at Waltham Abbey {{begins with a}} fulling mill for cloth production; originally {{set up by the}} monks of the Abbey on the Millhead Stream, an engineered <b>water</b> <b>course</b> tapping the waters of the River Lea. Mills were adaptable and in the early 17th century it was converted to an 'Oyle Mill', i.e. for producing vegetable oils. In the Second Dutch War gunpowder supply shortages were encountered and the oil mill was converted to gunpowder production, possibly in response to this. In 1665 it was acquired by Ralph Hudson using saltpetre made in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire.|$|E

25|$|The Brackenburn near Kilmaurs {{has been}} misnamed as the Garrier by the Ordnance Survey since the 1860s. When burns or rivers join {{it is usually}} the largest that decides the name of the river downstream, unless the name changes completely, such as the Kilmarnock Water forming from the Fenwick and Craufurdland Waters. Occasionally a <b>water</b> <b>course</b> is reduced in volume due to changes upstream, a case in point being the Garrier, which used to drain Buiston Loch near Kilmaurs. This was drained as part of {{agricultural}} improvements and now the Garrier is only seasonal, even though it keeps the name Garrier, even when joined by the Brackenburn and the Lochrig burns that flow all year.|$|E
500|$|The Sydney Cove {{panorama}} on the Museum punchbowl is dated between 1812 and 1818. The {{vantage point}} is from beneath Dawes Point, shown with its flagstaff {{and before the}} Dawes Point fortifications built 1818–1821 ⑦. Looking directly into Campbell's Cove, the immediate focal points are Robert Campbell's warehouse and the [...] "Wharf House" [...] roof of his residence ⑥. To the right of Campbell's Wharf are extensive stone walls marking boundaries between properties {{in this part of}} the Rocks district ⑧. First Government House can be seen at the head of Sydney Cove in the distance ② and around the eastern shore a small rendition of Billy Blue's 1812-house ①. The Governor and civil personnel lived on the more orderly eastern slopes of the Tank Stream, compared to the disorderly western side where convicts lived. The Tank Stream was the fresh <b>water</b> <b>course</b> emptying into Sydney Cove and supplied the fledgling colony until 1826. Further along is Bennelong Point – with no sign of Fort Macquarie built from December 1817 – and Garden Island – the colony's first food source. The distant vista of the eastern side of the Harbour goes almost as far as the Macquarie Lighthouse – Australia's first lighthouse – [...] built between 1816 and 1818 on South Head. There are seven sailing ships flying the white ensign of the British Royal Navy in the Harbour, along with three sailboats and two canoes.|$|E
