5|$|Many Southerners {{believed}} his warnings and read every political news {{story from the}} North as {{further evidence of the}} planned destruction of the white southern way of life. The climax came a decade after Calhoun's death <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, which led to the secession of South Carolina, followed by six other Southern states. They formed the new Confederate States, which, in accordance with Calhoun's theory, did not have any organized political parties.|$|E
5|$|On Baker's retirement, Gould was {{unanimously}} elected President on 20 February 1907. He endeavoured to {{keep the}} Senate representative of the states' interests and free from party politics, and his rulings focused on unparliamentary language and relevance. Gould, appointed Knight Bachelor in 1908, differed from his predecessor in his adherence to British influence. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> the Fisher Labor Government in 1910, Gould was defeated by Harry Turley for the presidency.|$|E

5|$|The Chicago {{bid for the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was an {{unsuccessful}} bid, first recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on September 14, 2007. The IOC shortlisted four of the seven applicant cities—Madrid, Spain; Tokyo, Japan; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Chicago, United States; over Baku, Azerbaijan; Doha, Qatar; and Prague, Czech Republic—on June 4, 2008, during a meeting in Athens, Greece.

5|$|While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the {{elections}} held in late-December, {{the release of}} the Agranat Commission's findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation's political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread public outrage. Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Menachem Begin and the Likud Party.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> President Richard M. Nixon in 1968 and the {{announcement}} of the new American policy of Vietnamization in 1969, America's relations with Cambodia began to change. The goal of the U.S. was now to buy time for their South Vietnamese allies (and to cover their own withdrawal). On 11 May 1969 Sihanouk welcomed a return to full diplomatic relations with the U.S. On 18 March Nixon, already anticipating this development, ordered the bombing of the Cambodian sanctuaries by B-52s.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} {{complaints}} between bishop and trustees were resolved, some salary disputes lingered into 1813.

Elsewhere in the diocese, Egan was more successful. In about 1811, he made his most extensive visitation of his diocese, travelling as far west as Pittsburgh after stopping in Lancaster and Conewago. He continued {{to raise funds for}} the Catholic orphanage and opened a new parish, Sacred Heart, in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1813, bringing the total number of churches in the diocese to sixteen.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's {{eventual}} defeat {{changed the}} balance of power in the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1589, Ernst of Bavaria became uncontested Prince-elector of Cologne, the first Wittelsbach to hold the position. Wittelsbach authority in northwestern German territories endured until the mid-18th century, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a succession of Bavarian princes to the archbishop's throne and to the Prince-Elector's seat. This gave the family two voices in the choice of imperial candidates, which had ramifications in the 18th century. In 1740, Charles Albert, Duke of Bavaria, laid claim to the imperial title; his brother Klemens August of Bavaria, then the Archbishop and Prince-elector, cast his vote for Charles and personally crowned him at Frankfurt am Main. The shift of the emperor's orb from the House of Habsburg to the Wittelsbach family, albeit a brief event, was only resolved by the ascension of Maximilian III Joseph who, with the Treaty of Füssen, eschewed any imperial pretensions.|$|E
5|$|Hayes {{declined}} to seek re-election in 1880, keeping his pledge {{that he would}} not run for a second term. He was gratified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> fellow Ohio Republican James A. Garfield to succeed him, and consulted with him on appointments for the next administration. After Garfield's inauguration, Hayes and his family returned to Spiegel Grove. In 1881, he was elected a companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He served as commander-in-chief (national president) of the Loyal Legion from 1888 until his death in 1893. Although he remained a loyal Republican, Hayes was not too disappointed in Grover Cleveland's election to the Presidency in 1884, approving of the New York Democrat's views on civil service reform. He was also pleased at the progress of the political career of William McKinley, his army comrade and political protégé.|$|E

5|$|Originally, lay status did not bar {{election}} to the See of Rome. Bishops of dioceses were sometimes elected while still catechumens, such as the case of St. Ambrose, who became Bishop of Milan in 374. In {{the wake of the}} violent dispute over the 767 election of Antipope Constantine II, Pope Stephen III held the synod of 769, which decreed that only a cardinal priest or cardinal deacon could be elected, specifically excluding those that are already bishops. Church practice, however, deviated from this rule as early as 817 and fully ignored it from 882 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Pope Marinus I, the Bishop of Caere. Nicholas II, in the synod of 1059, formally codified existing practice by decreeing that preference was to be given to the clergy of Rome, but leaving the cardinal bishops free to select a cleric from elsewhere if they so decided. The Council of 1179 rescinded these restrictions on eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the County of Portugal around 1095, Varzim was an administrative and military unit that stretched from the sea to Cividade de Terroso and São Félix Hills. Póvoa de Varzim was established as a municipality in 1308 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a town hall judge and boundary exemption. As the town achieved broad self-government in the 16th century, restricted borders were created, which split the town itself and since disputed by the town hall. Over time, these were expanded to approach the medieval lordship boundaries. However, Caxinas and Poça da Barca, south expansion areas of Póvoa de Varzim in the 18th and 19th centuries with fisher populations from Póvoa, are administrated by Vila do Conde, in spite of the centuries-old requests of Póvoa de Varzim for these to be incorporated in its municipality. Inland, the parishes of Rio Mau, Touginhó, and Arcos are also historically disputed.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) chose Rio de Janeiro as its bidding city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, during its Annual Assembly on September 1, 2006.

5|$|The TSR-2 was {{the victim}} of ever-rising costs and inter-service squabbling over Britain's future defence needs, which led to the {{controversial}} decision to scrap the programme in 1965. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> a new government, the TSR-2 was cancelled due to rising costs, in favour of purchasing an adapted version of the General Dynamics F-111, a decision that itself was later rescinded as costs and development times increased. The replacements included the Blackburn Buccaneer and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, both of which had previously been considered and rejected early in the TSR-2 procurement process. Eventually, the smaller swing-wing Panavia Tornado was developed and adopted by a European consortium to fulfil broadly similar requirements to the TSR-2.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the office of Governor is largely one of long periods of {{domination}} by a single party, though different parties were predominant in different eras. Federalists were rare among Kentuckians during the period of the First Party System, and Democratic Republicans won every gubernatorial election in the state until 1828. The Second Party System began when the Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats (the predecessor of the modern Democratic Party) and National Republicans (later to become Whigs). Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Metcalfe in 1828, the Whigs dominated the governorship until 1851, with John Breathitt being the only Democrat elected during that period.|$|E
5|$|The papal {{conclave}} of 1724 {{was called}} upon {{the death of}} Pope Innocent XIII. It began on 20 March 1724 and ended on 28 May that year <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>of</b> Vincenzo Maria Orsini, a Dominican friar, as Pope Benedict XIII. The conclave was made of largely the same electors that had elected Innocent in 1721 and the same factions dominated it. Multiple {{attempts were made to}} elect candidates that would be acceptable to the various Catholic monarchies at the time, but none were successful until May. Benedict resisted his own election for two days before being convinced to accept it.|$|E
