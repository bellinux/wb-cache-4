40|$|Specific {{respiratory}} muscle training (IMT) {{improves the}} function of the inspiratory muscles. According to literature and clinical experience, there are 3 established methods: 1.) resistive load 2.) threshold load and 3.) normocapnic hyperpnea. Each training method and the associated devices have specific characteristics. Setting up an IMT should start with specific diagnostics of respiratory muscle function and be followed by detailed individual introduction to training. The aim of this review is {{to take a closer look}} at the different training methods for the most relevant indications and to discuss these results in the context of current literature. The group of neuromuscular diseases includes muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, paralysis of the phrenic nerve, and injuries to the spinal cord. Furthermore, interstitial lung diseases, sarcoidosis, left ventricular heart failure, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), kyphoscoliosis and obesity are also discussed in this context. COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF-bronchiectasis are among the group of obstructive lung diseases.

40|$|Two {{unrelated}} {{children with}} {{congenital central hypoventilation syndrome}} (CCHS-Ondine syndrome) and long segment Hirschsprung disease are reported. Patient 1, a girl, {{is still alive}} at 3 years. Patient 2, a boy, died of viral pneumonia at 5. 5 years. Continuous mechanical ventilation was necessary for months and those children could never be <b>weaned</b> from the <b>respirator</b> during sleep. Seventeen cases of this complex neurocristopathy are reviewed. Only six children (including our cases) survived beyond 2 years of age. Hypotonia, delay in developmental milestones or epilepsy were frequently observed. Ventilator dependency does not improve with time. Multifocal congenital neuroblastoma occurred in two children.

40|$|Purpose Once open abdomen {{therapy has}} succeeded, {{the problem of}} closing the {{abdominal}} wall must be addressed. We present a new four-stage procedure involving {{the application of a}} two-component mesh and vacuum conditioning for abdominal wall closure of even large defects. The aim is to prevent the development of a giant ventral hernia and the eventual need for the repair of the abdominal wall. Methods Nineteen of 62 patients treated by open abdomen over a two-year period could not receive primary abdominal wall closure. To achieve closure in these patients, we applied the following four-stage procedure: stage 1 : abdominal damage control and conditioning of the abdominal wall; stage 2 : attachment of a tailored two-component mesh of polyglycolic acid (PGA) and large pore polypropylene (PP) in intraperitoneal position (IPOM) plus placement of a vacuum bandage; stage 3 : vacuum therapy for 3 – 4 weeks to allow granulation of the mesh and optimization of dermatotraction; stage 4 : final skin suture. During stage 3, eligible patients were <b>weaned</b> from <b>respirator</b> and mobilized. Results The abdominal wall gap in the 19 patients ranged in size from 240 cm 2 to more than 900 cm 2. An average of 3. 44 vacuum dressing changes over 19 days were required to achieve 60 – 100...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{evaluated}} {{the outcome of}} different surgical techniques for postintubation tracheoesophageal fistula. Methods: Thirty-two consecutive patients aged 51 ± 23 years had tracheoesophageal fistulas resulting from a median of 30 days of mechanical ventilation via endotracheal (n = 12) or tracheostomy (n = 20) tubes. Tracheoesophageal fistulas were 2. 5 ± 1. 2 cm long and were associated with a tracheal (n = 10) or subglottic (n = 3) stenosis in 13 patients. Results: All but 3 patients were <b>weaned</b> from <b>respirators</b> before repair. All operations were done through cervical incisions and included direct division and closure (n = 9), esophageal diversion (n = 3), muscle interposition (n = 6), or, more recently, tracheal or laryngotracheal resection and anastomosis with primary esophageal closure (n = 14). Nine thyrohyoid and two supralaryngeal releases reduced anastomotic tension. Twenty-three patients (74 %) were extubated after the operation (n = 16) or within 24 hours (n = 7), and 7 required a temporary tracheotomy tube. One postoperative death (3 %) was associated with recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula. Seven complications (22 %) included recurrent tracheoesophageal fistula (n = 1), delayed tracheal stenosis (n = 2), dysphagia (n = 2), and recurrent nerve palsy (n = 2). Complications necessitated reoperation (n = 1), dilation (n = 2), definitive tracheostomy (n = 1), Montgomery T tubes (n = 1), and Teflon injection of the vocal cords (n = 1). Twenty-nine patients (93 %) had excellent (n = 24) or good (n = 5) anatomic and functional long-term results. Complications have been less common (7 % vs 38 %) and long-term results better (93 % vs 65 %) recently with tracheal or laryngotracheal resection and anastomosis with primary esophageal closure as compared with previous procedures. Conclusions: Postintubation tracheoesophageal fistula is usually best treated with tracheal or laryngotracheal resection and anastomosis with primary esophageal closure {{even in the absence}} of tracheal damage.

40|$|Background: Stringy, {{tenacious}} tracheal secretions {{may prevent}} extubation in patients <b>weaned</b> from the <b>respirator.</b> This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with parallel assignment {{was performed to}} assess the influence of sublingually administered potassium dichromate C 30 {{on the amount of}} tenacious, stringy tracheal secretions in critically ill patients with a history of tobacco use and COPD. Methods: In this study, 50 patients breathing spontaneously with continuous positive airway pressure were receiving either potassium dichromate C 30 globules (group 1) [Deutsche Ho-möopathie-Union, Pharmaceutical Company; Karlsruhe, Germany] or placebo (group 2). Five globules were administered twice daily at intervals of 12 h. The amount of tracheal secretions on day 2 after the start of the study as well as the time for successful extubation and length of stay in the ICU were recorded. Results: The amount of tracheal secretions was reduced significantly in group 1 (p < 0. 0001). Extubation could be performed significantly earlier in group 1 (p < 0. 0001). Similarly, length of stay was significantly shorter in group 1 (4. 20 1. 61 days vs 7. 68 3. 60 days, p < 0. 0001 [mean SD]). Conclusion: These data suggest that potentized (diluted and vigorously shaken) potassium dichromate may help to decrease the amount of stringy tracheal secretions in COPD patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Neurally {{adjusted}} ventilatory assist (NAVA) {{is a new}} mode {{of mechanical}} ventilation controlled by diaphragmatic electrical signals. The electrical signals allow synchronization of ventilation to spontaneous breathing efforts of a child, as well as permitting pressure assistance proportional to the electrical signal. NAVA provides equally fine synchronization of respiratory support and pressure assistance varying {{with the needs of}} the child. NAVA has mainly been studied in children who underwent cardiac surgery during the period of <b>weaning</b> from a <b>respirator.</b> Case presentation We report here a series of 3 children (1 month, 3 years, and 28 days old) with severe respiratory distress due to RSV-related bronchiolitis requiring invasive mechanical ventilation {{with a high level of}} oxygen (FiO 2 ≥ 50 %) for whom NAVA facilitated respiratory support. One of these children had diagnosis criteria for acute lung injury, another for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Establishment of NAVA provided synchronization of mechanical ventilatory support with the breathing efforts of the children. Respiratory rate and inspiratory pressure became extremely variable, varying at each cycle, while children were breathing easily and smoothly. All three children demonstrated less oxygen requirements after introducing NAVA (57 ± 6 % to 42 ± 18 %). This improvement was observed while peak airway pressure decreased (28 ± 3 to 15 ± 5 cm H 2 O). In one child, NAVA facilitated the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome with extensive subcutaneous emphysema. Conclusions Our findings highlight the feasibility and benefit of NAVA in children with severe RSV-related bronchiolitis. NAVA provides a less aggressive ventilation requiring lower inspiratory pressures with good results for oxygenation and more comfort for the children. </p...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveExtubation {{failure is}} a serious {{complication}} after cardiac surgery. The role of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is unknown. This study aimed to assess the safety of implementing noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in this setting {{and its impact on}} lung function and operative outcomes. MethodsIn a 6 -month pilot prospective survey, the study population comprised 43 patients (32 were male {{with a mean age of}} 65. 73 ± 9 years; 3 heart transplantations, 18 coronary artery bypass grafts, 5 aortic dissections, and 17 valvular procedures; 34 active smokers, 25 with medically treated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 21 emergency/urgency procedures) who required noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure after initial <b>weaning</b> from a <b>respirator.</b> The cause of acute respiratory failure (classified as post-cardiopulmonary bypass lung injury in 48. 8 % [21 patients], cardiogenic edema in 30. 2 % [13 patients], and pneumonia in 21 % [9 patients]), length of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation support, respiratory ratios (arterial oxygen tension/fraction of inspired oxygen assessed immediately before noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, and every 6 hours after institution of pressure ventilation), and need for reintubation along with a set of predefined safety parameters were recorded. ResultsThe mean length of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation support was 33. 8 ± 24. 04 hours. Plotting respiratory ratios with length of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation supports a significant improvement was already evident within the first 6 -hour frame (133. 6 ± 39. 5 vs 205 ± 65. 7; P <. 001) for all causes. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation prevented intubation in 74. 4 % of the patients, with satisfactory recovery for post-cardiopulmonary bypass lung injury and cardiogenic dysfunction (90. 5 % and 69. 2 %, respectively) and poor results (55 % reintubated) in those treated for pneumonia. Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation safety approached 97. 7 %. ConclusionIn appropriate candidates, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation exerts favorable effects on lung function, preventing reintubation. The cost-effectiveness of its systematic use in this setting should be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Study {{objectives}} were {{to determine the}} clinical impact of diaphragmatic paralysis after congenital heart surgery in short and long-term outcome and to assess risk and benefit of diaphragmatic plication. Methods: A retrospective case control study was performed on all patients operated for congenital heart disease in the Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin from 1990 to 2000. The actual functional condition was evaluated by a questionnaire. Results: 59 patients with postoperative phrenic nerve paralysis were identified in an eleven year term: the incidence was 1. 18 %. Diaphragmatic paralysis is due to surgical procedures {{in the vicinity of}} the phrenic nerve: Particularly surgery of the great vessels. There was no difference in mortality between the two groups. Patients with postoperative phrenic nerve palsy had significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation (7 d vs 2 d, p= 0. 001), a higher frequency of weaning failure with the need for reintubation (63 vs 5, p= 0. 001), longer hospital stay (30 d vs 13 d, p= 0. 001) and a higher rate of ventilator-associated pulmonary infections (31 vs 3, p= 0. 001). In the long term follow-up (follow-up 5 months to eleven years) children with postoperative phrenic nerve palsy had a higher incidence of chronic obstructive lung disease. 30 of 59 patients underwent surgical diaphragmatic plication because of prolonged respiratory problems. Patients with diaphragmatic plication were significantly younger than patients without the need for surgical plication (4 m vs 13 m, p = 0. 008). After diaphragmatic plication there was a higher probability of successful <b>weaning</b> from the <b>respirator</b> and a significant reduction in the length of mechanical ventilation (13 d vs 4 d, p= 0. 001). Conclusion: Diaphragmatic paralysis increases length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay and the rate of secondary pulmonary infections particularly in young children. In cases of respiratory impairment surgical diaphragmatic plication is an effective treatment to minimize ventilator-associated pulmonary complications...|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{mechanical}} ventilation (CMV) {{plays a key}} role in triggering the impaired diaphragm muscle function and the concomitant delayed <b>weaning</b> from the <b>respirator</b> in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients. To date, experimental and clinical studies have primarily focused on early effects on the diaphragm by CMV, or at specific time points. To improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impaired diaphragm muscle function in response to {{mechanical ventilation}}, we have performed time-resolved analyses between 6 h and 14 days using an experimental rat ICU model allowing detailed studies of the diaphragm in response to long-term CMV. A rapid and early decline in maximum muscle fibre force and preceding muscle fibre atrophy was observed in the diaphragm in response to CMV, resulting in an 85 % reduction in residual diaphragm fibre function after 9 - 14 days of CMV. A modest loss of contractile proteins was observed and linked to an early activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, myosin:actin ratios were not affected and the transcriptional regulation of myosin isoforms did not show any dramatic changes during the observation period. Furthermore, small angle X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrate that myosin can bind to actin in an ATP-dependent manner even after 9 - 14 days of exposure to CMV. Thus, quantitative changes in muscle fibre size and contractile proteins are not the dominating factors underlying the dramatic decline in diaphragm muscle function in response to CMV, in contrast to earlier observations in limb muscles. The observed early loss of subsarcolemmal neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity, onset of oxidative stress, intracellular lipid accumulation and post-translational protein modifications strongly argue for significant qualitative changes in contractile proteins causing the severely impaired residual function in diaphragm fibres after long-term mechanical ventilation. For the first time, the present study demonstrates novel changes in the diaphragm structure/function and underlying mechanisms at the gene, protein and cellular levels in response to CMV at a high temporal resolution ranging from 6 h to 14 days...|$|R
40|$|Critically ill {{patients}} {{admitted to the}} intensive care unit (ICU) commonly develop severe muscle wasting and weakness and consequently impaired muscle function. This not only delays <b>respirator</b> <b>weaning</b> and ICU discharge, but has deleterious effects on morbidity, mortality, financial costs, and quality of life of survivors. Acute Quadriplegic Myopathy (AQM) {{is one of the most}} common neuromuscular disorders underlying ICU muscle wasting and paralysis, and is a consequence of modern intensive care interventions, although the exact causes remain unclear. Muscle gene/protein expression, intracellular signalling, post-translational modifications, muscle membrane excitability, and contractile properties at the single muscle fibre level were explored in order to unravel the mechanisms underlying the muscle wasting and weakness associated with AQM and how this can be counteracted by specific intervention strategies. A unique experimental rat ICU model was used to address the mechanistic and therapeutic aspects of this condition, allowing time-resolved studies for a period of two weeks. Subsequently, the findings obtained from this model were translated into a clinical study. The obtained results showed that the mechanical silencing of skeletal muscle, i. e., absence of external strain (weight bearing) and internal strain (myosin-actin activation) due to the pharmacological paralysis or sedation associated with the ICU intervention, is likely to be the primary mechanism triggering the preferential myosin loss and muscle wasting, features specifically characteristic of AQM. Moreover, mechanical silencing induces a specific gene expression pattern as well as post-translational modifications in the motor domain of myosin that may be critical for both function and for triggering proteolysis. The higher nNOS expression found in the ICU patients and its cytoplasmic dislocation are indicated as a probable mechanism underlying these highly specific modifications. This work also demonstrated that passive mechanical loading is able to attenuate the oxidative stress associated with the mechanical silencing and induces positive effects on muscle function, i. e., alleviates the loss of force-generating capacity that underlie the ICU intervention, supporting the importance of early physical therapy in immobilized, sedated, and mechanically ventilated ICU patients...|$|R
40|$|Os autores trataram 18 crises miastênicas e colinérgicas desenvolvidas em 12 pacientes com forma generalizada e severa de miastenia grave, mediante o "repouso" da junção neuromuscular. Êste foi conseguido, em um grupo de 6 enfermos, pela suspensão das drogas anticolinesterásicas, emprego da respiração {{artificial}} e alimentação por sonda nasogástrica — "repouso relativo". Outro grupo de 6 pacientes foi submetido ao "repouso absoluto" da junção neuromuscular, mediante o uso da respiração artificial, alimentação por sonda nasogástrica e curarização prolongada pela galamina. Em mais de 50 % das crises observaram-se melhoras imediatas e acentuadas com o método de tratamento pelo "repouso" da junção neuromuscular, ao lado de redução significativa da taxa de mortalidade nas crises. A evolução mostrou que os pacientes que responderam melhor durante e logo após o tratamento da crise, tiveram, também, melhor evolução ulterior. Dos 12 enfermos somente um era portador de timoma e, mesmo nesse paciente, a evolução foi satisfatória. A sensibilidade inicial ao curare foi muito grande em todos os doentes submetidos à curarização prolongada, mas, em prazo relativamente curto (alguns dias), esta hipersensibilidade diminuiu sensivelmente. Apesar de todos os cuidados, as infecções respiratórias foram a regra, exigindo tratamento enérgico e bem orientado. The {{neuromuscular junction}} rest method was {{employed in the}} treatment of 18 myasthenic and cholinergic crisis occurring in 12 patients with severe forms of myasthenia gravis. Six of these patients received a "relative rest" and other six patients received an "absolute rest" treatment. In the first group of patients the method consisted essentially in withdrawal of anticholinesterase therapy and mechanical respiratory support with early performance of traqueostomy and use of the intermitente positive pressure breathing (I. P. P. B.) with cuffed traqueostomy tube. The patients of second group, in addition to this management, were submitted to prolonged curarization by galamine (Flaxedil by intramuscular injection); all of them presented an initial curare supersensitivity which always decreased shortly. In both methods the reinstitution of the drug therapy was progressive. The <b>respirator</b> <b>weanned</b> of progressively and the patients were kept under observation for adequate ventilation. The doses were variable but subsequent doses of antimyasthenic medications were determined by clinical findings and response to the tensilon or prostigmine tests. The doses were increased or decreased accordingly in each individual case, rapid changes of drug doses to perfect adjustment being undesirable in this transition period. Partial or temporary remission occurred in some patients. Others were able to sustain satisfactory ventilation for a long period or definitively. Most of the crisis improved and most of the patients benefited from the therapeutic method of the neuromuscular junction rest. There was a remarkable reduction in the mortality rate from the crisis. One patient had a thymoma which was malignant; in spite of this the evolution of this case has been good after the treatment. Those patients who had immediate good response to the treatment of the crisis had a favorable fellow up, even a complete remission. Respiratory infections were very common in spite of all cares. Culture of tracheal secretions and wound exsudates were made. Bactericidal and broad-spectrum antibiotics were used, depending of the laboratory report cf patient's sensitivity. Physiotherapy besides other prophylactic measures was used against bronchopneumonia. Atelectasis was a common complication in the crisis and all efforts to prevent it were made, including daily clinical examination of pulmonary conditions, Vt,, blood pressure and bed side chest films. The routine use of atropine sulfate promoved inspissation of bronchial secretions, plugging of the bronchi, and attendant atelectasis, infection and bronchopneumonia. Exceptionally, steroids or bronchoscopy had been used...|$|R
