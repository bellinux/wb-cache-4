As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos. Rowland elaborated a bit about {{her role in the}} video in an interview with NeonLimelight: [...] "I'm just doing a cameo. We just had a really good time [...] While filming the video, <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> that we were doing certain stuff that we used to do as kids.

2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because that is pretty much about the time when <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> that the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games or whatever, it seemed to switch over to more of what I call 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that when you speak about changing the oath, people {{think you want to}} change all the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy on the death of Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. <b>We</b> <b>noticed.</b> Consider this a holler." ...|$|E

2500|$|GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann {{was less}} impressed, scoring the PC version 6 out of 10, the PS2 version 6.4 out of 10 and the Xbox version 6.6 out of 10, and calling the game [...] "a foul-mouthed and bloody {{adventure}} that does {{next to nothing}} with the characters [...] The whole experience feels flat and often self-conscious." [...] Of the PC version, he wrote [...] "even on machines that go way beyond the game's recommended system requirements, <b>we</b> <b>noticed</b> plenty of frame rate trouble and slowdown. The textures aren't pretty, and overall, the game looks like a quick and dirty console port." [...] He concluded [...] "Overall, Scarface: The World Is Yours is more a victim of some poor design choices than any glaring technical issues. [...] by taking the focus off of the gameplay elements that you'd want in an open-city game and putting it more on the game's bland mission design and all the dull side tasks you'll {{have to do to}} earn a reputation, Scarface doesn't play to its potential strengths. The end result is a functional game that presents an interesting premise, but underneath you'll find a wholly uninteresting game." [...] He was even more critical of the Wii version, scoring it 5.8 out of 10, writing [...] "the gamepad-to-Wii Remote transition has made this lackluster game play even worse." [...] He was extremely critical of the controls; [...] "while it's somewhat impressive on some level that the developer managed to cram a standard gamepad-controlled game onto the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, it's never fun to play, and you'll feel like you're fighting the controls from start to finish." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} expedition {{had visited}} the Pyramids several years earlier (832), led by the Abbasid caliph al-Ma’mūn, and had explored {{the interior of the}} Pyramid of Khufu, finding (breaking into) a new passageway. [...] Accompanying him on this adventure was the Syrian archbishop of Antioch Dionysius of Tell Mahre, who left some important observations: [...] "In Egypt we also beheld those edifices mentioned by the Theologian [...] in one of his discourses. [...] They are not, as some believe, the granaries of Joseph. [...] Rather, they are marvelous shrines built over the tombs of ancient kings, and in any event oblique and solid, not hollow and empty. [...] They have no interior, and none has a door. [...] <b>We</b> <b>noticed</b> a fissure in one of them and ascertained that it is approximately 50 cubits deep. [...] Evidently the stones [...] had been solidly packed, before being broken by people who wanted to see whether the pyramids were solid." [...] However, despite this solid refutation of the notion, [...] "this knowledge fell on deaf ears." [...] The great French orientalist Silvestre de Sacy (1758-1838) cited the account of Dionysius as proof that the belief [...] "was common in the East in the 9th century." [...] Over a hundred years later, the Arab traveler Ibn Hawqal (d. 988) wrote an influential book on geography, wherein he spoke of the Pyramids at Giza: [...] "Some report that they are tombs; but this is false." [...] Rather, the builders [...] "had foreseen the flood and knew that this cataclysm would destroy everything {{on the surface of the}} earth, with the exception of what could be stored in the safety of such buildings; and they hid their treasures and their wealth therein; then came the flood. When the waters dried up, all that was in the two Pyramids passed to Bansar son of Mizraim, son of Ham, son of Noah. [...] Some kings, centuries later, made them their granaries." [...] Al-Muqaddasi (d. 991), a great contemporary geographer, confirms the identification: [...] "Varying accounts have been given me about both structures , some saying that they are both talismans, others that they were the granaries of Joseph; others say no, rather, they are their burial grounds." ...|$|E
