25|$|There is no {{official}} {{standard in the}} United States for the color of fire extinguishers, though they are typically red, except for class D extinguishers <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> yellow, water and Class K wet chemical extinguishers <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> silver, and water mist extinguishers <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> white. Extinguishers <b>are</b> marked with pictograms depicting the types of fires that the extinguisher is approved to fight. In the past, extinguishers were marked with colored geometric symbols, and some extinguishers still use both symbols. The types of fires and additional standards are described in NFPA 10: Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers, 2013 edition.|$|R

Current can consist of any moving charged particles; most commonly these are electrons, but any charge in motion constitutes a current. Electric current can flow through some things, electrical conductors, but will not flow through an electrical insulator.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Raja Yoga {{refers to}} Ashtanga Yoga, the eight limbs to be practiced to attain samadhi, {{as described in}} the Yoga Sutras of Pantajali. The term raja yoga originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> samadhi, but was popularised by Vivekananda as the common name for Ashtanga Yoga.|$|E
5|$|The usual form of {{locomotion}} is hopping, {{with both}} feet leaving the ground and landing simultaneously. However, birds may run when performing the rodent-run display.

5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} is possible, originally developed by Anatoliy Skorokhod and Andrei Kolmogorov, for a continuous-time stochastic process with any metric space as its state space. For {{the construction of}} such a stochastic process, {{it is assumed that}} the sample functions of the stochastic process belong to some suitable function space, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> the Skorokhod space consisting of all right-continuous functions with left limits. This {{approach is}} now more used than the separability assumption, but such a stochastic process based on this approach will be automatically separable.|$|E

Sometimes the fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E

5|$|Between {{these last}} two speeds, if they both exist, is a range of forward speeds at which the {{particular}} bike design is self-stable. In {{the case of the}} bike whose eigenvalues are shown here, the self-stable range is 5.3–8.0m/s (1218mph). The fourth eigenvalue, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> stable (very negative), represents the castoring behavior of the front wheel, as it tends to turn towards the direction in which the bike is traveling. Note that this idealized model does not exhibit the wobble or shimmy and rear wobble instabilities described above. They are seen in models that incorporate tire interaction with the ground or other degrees of freedom.|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.|$|E

The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>usually</b> an equivalent to corrector.|$|E
