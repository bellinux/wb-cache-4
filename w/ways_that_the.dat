5|$|Among the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} could assist in manufacturing, Hamilton mentioned levying protective duties on imported foreign goods that were also {{manufactured in the}} United States, to withdraw duties levied on raw materials needed for domestic manufacturing, pecuniary boundaries, and encouraging immigration for people to better themselves in similar employment opportunities. Congress shelved the report without much debate (except for Madison's objection to Hamilton's formulation of the General Welfare clause, which Hamilton construed liberally as a legal basis for his extensive programs).|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> propeller could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way the propeller could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case. United Airlines procedure calls for No. 4 engine to be shut down in a simulated engine failurethe same engine which was found at the crash site with its propellers reversed.|$|E

5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice Antonin Scalia. Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

25|$|Although the Roman Catholic propagandists did {{put forth}} some {{effective}} propaganda campaigns, primarily {{the campaign against}} Luther regarding the Peasants War, they neglected to get their message across to the general public. They failed to capitalize in the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Protestant propagandists were able to; they did not commonly produce works in the vernacular of the people, which had been an effective tactic for Protestants. Also Roman Catholic publications, either in German or Latin, produced during the reformation years were greatly outnumbered by the Protestants.

25|$|Language {{learning}} {{takes place}} in different contexts, with both the infant and the caregiver engaging in social interactions. Recent research have investigated how infants and adults use cross-situational statistics {{in order to learn}} about not only the meanings of words but also the constraints within a context. For example, Smith and his colleagues proposed that infants learn language by acquiring a bias to label objects to similar objects that come from categories that are well-defined. Important to this view is the idea that the constraints that assist learning of words are not independent of the input itself or the infant's experience. Rather, constraints come about as infants learn about the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> words are used and begin to pay attention to certain characteristics of objects that have been used in the past to represent the words.|$|E

25|$|Xochimilco Ecological Park and Plant Market is {{a natural}} reserve or park, with a thirteenhectare plant market, the largest in Latin America. The park and market {{are located in the}} {{southern}} Mexico City borough of Xochimilco, about 23km south of the historic center of the city. The park was inaugurated in 1993, on chinampas (artificial lake islands) which had been previously declared as part of a World Heritage site. However, the area’s ecology was badly degraded, and the park was established in order to revitalize and preserve the ecosystem. Success has been mixed. While much of the wetlands have been recharged, pollution and illegal settlements in the area remain as threats. As the park needs to be self-sustaining economically, {{there are a number of}} <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> park raises money. One of the best known of these is the Xochimilco or Cuemanco Plant Market, which rents stalls to ornamental plant producers/sellers near the main entrance of the park.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} USDA-approved field {{releases}} for testing grew from 4 in 1985 to 1,194 in 2002 and averaged around 800 per year thereafter. The number of sites per release {{and the number}} of gene constructs (<b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gene of interest is packaged together with other elements)—have rapidly increased since 2005. Releases with agronomic properties (such as drought resistance) jumped from 1,043 in 2005 to 5,190 in 2013. As of September 2013, about 7,800 releases had been approved for corn, more than 2,200 for soybeans, more than 1,100 for cotton, and about 900 for potatoes. Releases were approved for herbicide tolerance (6,772 releases), insect resistance (4,809), product quality such as flavor or nutrition (4,896), agronomic properties like drought resistance (5,190), and virus/fungal resistance (2,616). The institutions with the most authorized field releases include Monsanto with 6,782, Pioneer/DuPont with 1,405, Syngenta with 565, and USDA’s Agricultural Research Service with 370. As of September 2013 USDA had received proposals for releasing GM rice, squash, plum, rose, tobacco, flax, and chicory.|$|E
25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers {{over and over again}}, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again in}} such a way or <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> one who is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply {{the one who}} behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
