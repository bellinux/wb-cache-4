5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E

They took their traditional on-orbit crew portrait, and spoke with reporters from around the world in a news conference. The crew also had the opportunity to speak with the Expedition 19 crew on board the International Space Station, in a conference call routed through satellites. The station crew congratulated them on a very successful mission, and {{the crew of}} Atlantis expressed their gratitude to the station crew for all the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> during their long duration stays on the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{workplaces}} {{of engineers}} {{are just as}} varied as the types of <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> Electrical engineers may be found in the pristine lab environment of a fabrication plant, the offices of a consulting firm or on site at a mine. During their working life, electrical engineers may find themselves supervising a wide range of individuals including scientists, electricians, computer programmers, and other engineers.|$|E

25|$|For many engineers, {{technical}} work {{accounts for}} {{only a fraction of}} the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects involve some form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.|$|E
25|$|Specialised {{arbitration}} {{organizations have}} been formed in order to settle disputes {{in the matter of}} specialised issues, they work in only a very limited field but are highly specialised in the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> For this purpose they have made a special rules, procedures and regulations which they follow during the proceedings of arbitration. These institutions prove very useful in the cases where a very deep and specialised knowledge is needed in settlement, which in turn can be cost effective and time saving.|$|E
25|$|In general, Filipino {{women find}} {{pride in their}} <b>work.</b> <b>They</b> <b>do</b> not find {{themselves}} alienated from their chores because they work with, around, and for their families. This family-oriented mindset gives {{them a sense of}} dignity and responsibility. The family and the children are the primary priority some Filipino women's life. In addition to doing housework, the contemporary role of a Filipino wife today is to provide financial support in the household by seeking employment in higher-earning occupations which then expands the Filipino female work outside the household.|$|E

50|$|By October 17, 1901, 5,000 Puerto Rican men, {{women and}} {{children}} had made their new homes on the four islands. Records show that, in 1902, 34 plantations had 1,773 Puerto Ricans on their payrolls; 1,734 worked as field hands and another 39 were clerks or overseers (foremen). Wages and living accommodations depended upon their jobs and race. Europeans were paid more and were given better living quarters. Most of the workers moved from plantation to plantation to <b>work</b> because <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not like the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> {{and because of the}} racial discrimination.|$|R

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{electrical}} engineers will understand basic circuit theory (that is {{the interactions of}} elements such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and inductors in a circuit), the theories employed by engineers generally depend upon the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> For example, quantum mechanics and solid state physics might be relevant to an engineer working on VLSI (the design of integrated circuits), but are largely irrelevant to engineers working with macroscopic electrical systems. Even circuit theory may not be relevant to a person designing telecommunication systems that use off-the-shelf components. Perhaps the most important technical skills for {{electrical engineers}} are reflected in university programs, which emphasize strong numerical skills, computer literacy, {{and the ability to}} understand the technical language and concepts that relate to electrical engineering.|$|E

2500|$|If a {{container}} with an ideal gas is expanded instantaneously, {{the temperature of}} the gas doesn't change at all, because none of the molecules slow down.

2500|$|Horseshoes are {{available}} {{in a wide variety}} of materials and styles, developed for different types of horse and for the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> The most common materials are steel and aluminium, but specialized shoes may include use of rubber, plastic, magnesium, titanium, or copper. Steel tends to be preferred in sports in which a strong, long-wearing shoe is needed, such as polo, eventing, show jumping, and western riding events. Aluminium shoes are lighter, making them common in horse racing, where a lighter shoe is desired; and often facilitate certain types of movement, and so are favored in the discipline of dressage. Some horseshoes have [...] "caulkins", [...] "caulks", or [...] "calks": protrusions at the toe or heels of the shoe, or both, to provide additional traction.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a longstanding}} {{practice}} that students, {{particularly in the}} lower years of the college, write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of any piece of <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do.</b> This stands for Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam which means [...] "To the Greater Glory of God": a central theme of Jesuit spirituality. Traditionally, {{at the end of}} a piece of work they wrote L.D.S. in the centre of the page, a practice which is no longer widespread. This stands for Laus Deo Semper which means [...] "Praise to God Always", another traditional Jesuit motto.

2500|$|The type of <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{means that}} they require a [...] "slip-clutch" [...] which engages when the drill bit jams and {{sufficient}} torque is put onto the [...] "slip-clutch" [...] mechanism. [...] This stops the violent wrenching motion that a drill without a clutch would cause when stopped suddenly from full speed, protecting the drill from damage. [...] The slip-clutch also protects the operator, but does not always prevent injury. [...] Some manufacturers have introduced additional technology to protect the operator. [...] Hilti has a technology called [...] "ATC" [...] or [...] "Active Torque Control" [...] which works by disengaging the drive from the motor when the tool body begins to rotate excessively through the action of a secondary magnetic clutch {{in addition to the}} standard slip-clutch. [...] DeWALT has a related system called [...] "CTC" [...] or [...] "Complete Torque Control" [...] which utilizes a two-position slip-clutch so that the operator can select the lower torque setting for greater safety.|$|E

2500|$|For individuals, {{telecommuting}} provides {{alternatives to}} daily commuting and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies for telecommuting, such as videoconferencing, e-mail, and corporate wikis, continue to improve, {{in keeping with}} the overall improvement in information technologies ascribed to Moore's law. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. Matthew Simmons explicitly calls for [...] "liberating the workforce" [...] by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the <b>work</b> <b>they</b> <b>do,</b> from any location. This would allow many more information workers to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or Internet cafes near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of telecommuting by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%.|$|E

Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
