50|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{features}} of {{the facade of the}} Design Hub is that it has the capability of collecting solar energy throughout most of the day as the surface is covered in operable disks. Although, as of 2013, there are no solar panels installed, it has the capability to accommodate this technology in the near future with its facade system. To achieve harvesting energy at an optimum level, ganged disks are fitted with an actuator <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>allows</b> the disks to be exposed to the sun as much as possible. With the current material of sandblasted glass, the disks operate as a 'second skin' controlling solar gain and access. An internal computer controls this facade by adjusting each cell with rotational motors, according to Melbourne’s daily weather. Additional self-sustaining features include the underground water tank, which stores grey water for re-use including flushing toilets, mechanical cooling requirements, and irrigation.|$|E

Debugging {{is an essential part}} of programming language and what sets great programmers apart from average ones.

Inexperienced programmers have a tendency to shy away from error messages or be frightened by observable errors, whereas skilled programmers rely heavily on error messages and he is aware about fixing of bugs by using different debugging tool. And programmer can easily detect and remove it at run time. The traditional or classical debugger while debugging gives developer bunch of breakpoints in the source code.

40|$|In {{the process}} of Software Development and evolution, Developer has to answer {{multiple}} questions about how the code or software behaves at runtime. The traditional or classical debugger while debugging gives developer bunch of breakpoints in the source code. Object based debugging offer, interruption when a given or a particular object is accessed or modified. Programmers, who try to find violations in such source code, need new tool {{that allows them to}} explore objects in the system effectively. The implementation of the proposed debugging actually offers programmers an effective tool <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>allows</b> searching of objects even for programs that have huge number of objects. As stated from traditional tools that, the complexity of object oriented system increases, debugging becomes relatively difficult. Developer needs a dedicated user interface for these operations on objects; this need is fulfilled by facilitating a user interface for the programmer. Object based debugging tool looks forward to analyse the relationship in between the objects during the runtime. So the key behind this is to focus on a particular object instead of the execution stack. This allows functioning operations directly on objects rather than on the execution stack. The presented tool can allow user or a developer, different operations, which going to perform on a particular object. There exists therefore conceptual gap between the interface offered by the debugger and the need of the developer, hence to overcome or fill the gap; {{there is a need for}} object based debugger and useful interface for it...|$|E

40|$|American trypanosomiasis is a {{zoonosis}} {{of worldwide}} medical importance and currently {{there is no}} effective treatment in chronic patients, hence {{the importance of the}} study of protein function of the parasite with the objective of finding new drug targets and to know better the biology of the agent causal (Trypano-soma cruzi). T. cruzi is an RNAi-negative parasite, therefore the silencing genes strategies by RNAi is not possible; for that reason, antibodies may be taken as a tool for studying the parasite proteins function by blocking these molecules with specific antibodies. The aim of this work was to establish a methodology for antibody delivery (antibody transfection) into viable parasites. We used anti-cyclin-A antibody (human origin) in western blot assay with epimastigote of T. cruzi proteins and this recognized a ~ 55 kDa polypeptide. Several methods for antibody transfection (electroporation, saponin permeabilization and a lipid-based formulation) were tested. The first two methods were unsuccessful. In electroporation was impossible to visualize the antibody inside parasites and with saponin permeabilization, antibodies were successfully introduced, but with loss of parasites viability. The lipid-based formulation method forms noncovalent complexes with antibodies. These complexes are internalized by cells and antibodies are released into the cytoplasm. With this method, a successful antibody delivery was achieved. Anti-cyclin antibodies were visualized in the cytoplasm from fixed transfected parasites (immunofluorescence assays). At 24 h post-transfection, parasites maintained their viability (90 %) and were able to arrest the cell cycle in G 0 /G 1 -phase of cultured epimastigotes (cell population in creased in G 0 /G 1 -phase from 50. 5 % to 66. 2 % and decreased in S-phase from 47. 2 % to 26 %). It was also observed that anti-cyclin-A antibodies inhibit the parasite population doubling (p T. cruzi, with a simple and cheap technique, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>allows</b> carrying out further studies of this protozoan. </p...|$|E
