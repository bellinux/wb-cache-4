500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Diane Ruggiero and {{directed}} by Steve Gomer, marking Ruggiero's fifteenth writing credit, and Gomer's fourth and final directing credit for the series. The episode features a guest appearance by Patty Hearst, a wealthy heiress and famous kidnapping victim. Series creator Rob Thomas {{came up with the}} idea for Hearst's storyline in July 2006, stating, [...] "If we can get Patty Hearst to play a board of trustees member – <b>what</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> got kidnapped? That would be a pretty great story to tell. It's not an idea we've broken, but it's up on the wall as a possibility." [...] Hearst had recently appeared on single-episode parts on Boston Common and Son of the Beach. Due to a miscommunication between Thomas, Hearst, and her agent, Hearst was booked for Veronica Mars before she knew about the guest role, with Thomas telling TV Guide that she was playing a character that was similar to herself. Hearst described reacting to the casting news: [...] "I was on the computer one day and read that I was going to be on Veronica Mars. Rob Thomas was giving an interview and happily saying, 'Oh yes, and we’re very excited.' [...] " [...] After hearing this news, Hearst contacted her agent and jokingly asked her when the agent was planning on telling her that she would be appearing on the show.|$|E
