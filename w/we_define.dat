5|$|Trying {{to extend}} these {{functions}} {{to the general}} case of noninteger powers of complex numbers that are not positive reals leads to difficulties. Either <b>we</b> <b>define</b> discontinuous functions or multivalued functions. Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|If {{we choose}} a {{representative}} w of the normalizer N(T) representing w, then <b>we</b> <b>define</b> X(w) {{to be the}} elements of G/U with F(u)=uw.|$|E
25|$|If <b>we</b> <b>define</b> a {{homologue}} of an algebra to be a {{model of}} the equational theory of that algebra, then a Boolean algebra can be defined as any homologue of the prototype.|$|E
40|$|Summary. In {{this article}} <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the {{operation}} of a set and proved Bessel’s inequality. In the first section, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> {{the sum of all}} results of an operation, in which the results are given by taking each element of a set. In the second section, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> Orthogonal Family and Orthonormal Family. In the last section, we proved some properties of operation of set and Bessel’s inequality...|$|R

40|$|In earlier work, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> "multi-structural databases," a {{data model}} to support {{efficient}} analysis of large, complex data sets over multiple numerical and hierarchical dimensions. <b>We</b> <b>defined</b> {{three types of}} queries over this data model, each of which required solving an optimization problem...|$|R
25|$|<b>We</b> <b>define</b> a {{point by}} the {{succession}} of movements we require to make to reach it, starting from a certain initial position of the body. The axes are accordingly attached to this initial position of the body.|$|E
25|$|A presheaf on a {{topological space}} X is a {{contravariant}} functor from {{the category of}} open subsets to sets. By analogy <b>we</b> <b>define</b> an étale presheaf on a scheme X to be a contravariant functor from Et(X) to sets.|$|E
25|$|We can {{now give}} a {{complete}} description of w = z½. To do {{so we need}} two copies of the z-plane, each of them cut along the real axis. On one copy <b>we</b> <b>define</b> the square root of 1 to be e0 = 1, {{and on the other}} <b>we</b> <b>define</b> the square root of 1 to be e'iπ = 1. We call these two copies of the complete cut plane sheets. By making a continuity argument we see that the (now single-valued) function w = z½ maps the first sheet into the upper half of the w-plane, where 0 ≤ arg(w) < π, while mapping the second sheet into {{the lower half of the}} w-plane (where π ≤ arg(w) < 2π).|$|E
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>defined</b> global strain as {{the ratio}} between the total end-inspiratory volume (tidal volume + PEEP volume) and the FRC, {{measured}} with the lung CT scan. <b>We</b> <b>defined</b> dynamic strain as the strain due to tidal volume (tidal volume/FRC) and static strain as the strain due to PEEP (PEEP volume/FRC).|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>defined</b> {{tobacco use}} as current, past and never. <b>We</b> <b>defined</b> alcohol use {{according}} to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism classification: i.e., moderate (1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men) and heavy alcohol use (> 1 drink per day for women and > 2 drinks per day for men).|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>defined</b> {{patterns}} as {{the combination}} {{of two or more}} contractures that frequently coexisted.|$|R
25|$|If S is a set, {{then the}} power set of S becomes a ring if <b>we</b> <b>define</b> {{addition}} {{to be the}} symmetric difference of sets and multiplication to be intersection. This corresponds to a ring of sets and {{is an example of}} a Boolean ring.|$|E
25|$|Again we {{verify the}} {{universal}} property: For f: X → K with K compact Hausdorff and F an ultrafilter on X {{we have an}} ultrafilter f(F) on K. This has a unique limit because K is compact Hausdorff, say x, and <b>we</b> <b>define</b> βf(F) = x. This may be verified to be a continuous extension of f.|$|E
25|$|More generally, {{given any}} subset S of G (S not {{necessarily}} a subgroup), <b>we</b> <b>define</b> a subset T of G to be conjugate to S if there exists some g in G such that T = gSg−1. We can define Cl(S) as the set of all subsets T of G such that T is conjugate to S.|$|E

30|$|<b>We</b> <b>defined</b> “Preparation” as any steps {{prior to}} the breach in patient skin (i.e. {{administration}} of anesthetics or insertion of needle). Steps after the administration of anesthetics but before securing of the catheters were considered part of “Procedural competence.” Lastly, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> any steps including or after securing the catheter as “Post-procedure,” such as placement of dressing, obtaining chest x-rays, documentation of procedure, and equipment clean-up.|$|R
40|$|Summary. In this paper, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the {{congruence}} relation {{and proved}} its fundamental properties {{on the base}} of some useful theorems.

Finally, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the complete residue system and proved its fundamental properties...|$|R
25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is {{when one of the}} points is O. Here, <b>we</b> <b>define</b> P + O = P = O + P, making O the identity of the group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, <b>we</b> <b>define</b> P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as our line. In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R and we can take its opposite. However, if P happens to be an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E
25|$|Exponentiation of a non-zero {{real number}} can be {{extended}} to negative integers. We make the definition that x−1 = , meaning that <b>we</b> <b>define</b> raising a number to the power −1 {{to have the same}} effect as taking its reciprocal. This definition then extended to negative integers preserves the exponential law x'a'x'b = x(a + b) for real numbers a and b.|$|E
25|$|Given {{a finite}} set X (of {{elements}} called points) and integers k, r, λ ≥ 1, <b>we</b> <b>define</b> a 2-design (or BIBD, standing for {{balanced incomplete block}} design) B {{to be a family}} of k-element subsets of X, called blocks, such that any x in X is contained in r blocks, and any pair of distinct points x and y in X is contained in λ blocks.|$|E
30|$|Kwon et al. [17] {{introduced}} the degenerate Changhee-Genocchi polynomials and numbers. In this study, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the modified degenerate Changhee-Genocchi polynomials and numbers (see (1.22)) and obtained an interesting identity (1.26) of the modified degenerate Changhee-Genocchi numbers. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the partially degenerate Changhee-Genocchi polynomials and numbers (see (1.27)). We obtained a useful identity (1.29) of the partially degenerate Changhee-Genocchi numbers (1.29). Finally, <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> the Changhee-Genocchi polynomials {{of the second}} kind (see (2.1)). We provided useful identities related to the Changhee-Genocchi polynomials of the second kind and the degenerate Euler polynomials (see Theorem 2.1). Furthermore, we obtained some interesting identities of the Changhee-Genocchi polynomials of the second kind (see Theorem 2.2, Theorem 2.3, Theorem 2.4 and Theorem 2.5).|$|R

25|$|If M and N are two smooth manifolds, how do <b>we</b> <b>define</b> the jet of a {{function}} ? We could perhaps attempt to define such a jet by using local coordinates on M and N. The disadvantage {{of this is}} that jets cannot thus be defined in an equivariant fashion. Jets do not transform as tensors. Instead, jets of functions between two manifolds belong to a jet bundle.|$|E
25|$|The {{easiest way}} to see this is {{isomorphic}} to βN {{is to show that}} it satisfies the universal property. For f: N → K with K compact Hausdorff and F an ultrafilter on N we have an ultrafilter f(F) on K, the pushforward of F. This has a unique limit, say x, because K is compact Hausdorff, and <b>we</b> <b>define</b> βf(F) = x. This may readily be verified to be a continuous extension.|$|E
25|$|Let the {{non-empty}} set S be a counter-example to the axiom of regularity; that is, {{every element}} of S has a non-empty intersection with S. <b>We</b> <b>define</b> a binary relation R on S by , which is entire by assumption. Thus, by the axiom of dependent choice, {{there is some}} sequence (an) in S satisfying anRan+1 for all n in N. As this is an infinite descending chain, we arrive at a contradiction and so, no such S exists.|$|E
