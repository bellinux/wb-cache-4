5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lower class, I am in it, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> criminal element, I am of it, and <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E

The distribution of E85 began in 2005, and with 219 stations as of September 2008, Germany ranks second after Sweden with the most E85 fueling stations in the EU.|$|E
5|$|Folklore often {{identifies}} a green {{sky with}} tornadoes, {{and though the}} phenomenon {{may be associated with}} severe weather, there is no evidence linking it specifically with tornadoes. It is often thought that opening windows will lessen the damage caused by the tornado. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large drop in atmospheric pressure inside a strong tornado, {{it is unlikely that the}} pressure drop would be enough to cause the house to explode. Opening windows may actually increase the severity of the tornado's damage. A violent tornado can destroy a house whether its windows are open or closed.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} year is {{aligned with the}} calendar year, with classes usually starting in late February, and ending in early December, the beginning of summer in Brazil. The year {{is divided into two}} semester terms, and all courses are a semester long. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> suggested curriculum for each program, students are free to choose any classes to attend during a specific semester, and class attribution is done in the basis of grade average, with higher-graded students having priority when choosing classes.|$|E
5|$|The {{renewal of}} his license {{was due to}} the fact that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> central {{registry}} of crimes and of traffic misdemeanors, no such registry exists for other misdemeanors in the Czech Republic. In the case where a non-traffic misdemeanor is solved on the spot (e.g. fining by a policeman), no record of it is made. Only when the investigated person or the police refuse to deal with the misdemeanor on the spot, is an administrative proceeding before a municipal misdemeanor committee initiated and if convicted, then a record of it is made by the municipality.|$|E

The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E

Baburam Acharya contends that Bhimsen attempted suicide on 28 July in his house and died nine days later on 5 August by the banks of Bishnumati; while Henry Oldfield, K.L. Pradhan, and Gyanmani Nepali contend that the suicide was attempted on 20 July and the death occurred nine days later on 28 July in his house, only after which his dead body was disposed by the banks of Bishnumati.|$|E

5|$|M-212 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Second Street and the Tromble Trail {{north of the}} entrance to Aloha State Park {{in the community of}} Aloha. The community was originally a stop on the Detroit and Mackinac Railway that was named after a trip to Hawaii by the local sawmill owner. Progressing eastward, M-212 intersects with Third Street and Fourth Street, both of which are just separated by woodlands and residences. To the north of the highway, there is all woodlands and residences. To the south, there are just a few residences. After a <b>while,</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large clearing, which gives way to a farm to the north and more residences to the south. After the farm there is a large field and M-212 terminates at an intersection with M-33 in Aloha Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected {{are more likely to}} get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E
