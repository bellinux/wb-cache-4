It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>even</b> more so in the future." ...|$|E

He has criticized current location-based applications like Foursquare as lacking enough social element as well as being too complicated for users to remain engaged.|$|E
2500|$|His name {{appears in}} {{association}} with the controversial term musica reservata, a style of composition and performance beginning around the mid-16th century, which most likely involved intensely expressive setting of text, chromatic part-writing, and small audiences of connoisseurs. [...] The Bavarian ambassador to the court of Charles V wrote a letter to his employer, Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria, expressing what would happen when Payen would become maestro di capilla of the Flemish Chapel (capilla flamenca) for the Habsburg king: [...] "musica reservata <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>even</b> more fashionable now than before, , since Canis was not able to reconcile himself to it." [...] Thus Payen was a composer in a progressive style to Canis's more conservative bent.|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{meaning of}} the phrase musica reservata has been debated by musicologists for decades, since the {{contemporary}} mentions of the term are ambiguous and contradictory. [...] Current consensus among music scholars is that the term refers to an innovative practice which began around {{the middle of the}} 16th century, both in composition and in performance, involving 'affect' in text-setting and possibly chromaticism; {{that it was not a}} wide movement; and that it was principally a kind of music intended for connoisseurs. Cornelius Canis is one of the composers mentioned as not writing in the style of musica reservata. [...] Shortly before Canis's departure from the imperial chapel, the Bavarian ambassador to Charles V wrote a letter to his employer, Duke Albrecht V, in which he seems to use the term in a wide sense, meaning roughly [...] "a musical style which is new": [...] "musica reservata <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>even</b> more fashionable now than before, , since Canis was not able to reconcile himself to it." [...] He therefore considered Canis to be a composer in a conservative style. [...] The date of this letter, 28 April 1555, is shortly before Orlande de Lassus joined the musical establishment of Albrecht V in Munich; Lassus was then, and remains now, the most famous practitioner of musica reservata.|$|E

50|$|Historically (i.e., {{over the}} 20th century), {{subtropical}} land regions have been mostly semi-arid, while most subpolar regions {{have had an}} excess of precipitation over evaporation. Future global warming {{is expected to be}} accompanied by a reduction in rainfall in the subtropics and an increase in precipitation in subpolar latitudes and some equatorial regions. In other words, regions which are dry at present <b>will</b> generally <b>become</b> <b>even</b> drier, while regions that are currently wet <b>will</b> generally <b>become</b> <b>even</b> wetter. This projection does not apply to every locale, and in some cases can be modified by local conditions. Drying is projected to be strongest near the poleward margins of the subtropics (for example, South Africa, southern Australia, the Mediterranean, and the south-western U.S.), a pattern that can be described as a poleward expansion of these semi-arid zones.|$|R
