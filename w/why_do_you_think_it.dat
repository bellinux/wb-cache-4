[...] Du Qiong replied, [...] "Wei (魏) also refers to either of the two viewing towers at each gate of the {{imperial}} palace. It faces the road and stands out as a very tall structure from a distance away. (Because Wei was also the name of an ancient state,) the sages decided {{to use it as a}} double entendre." [...] When Qiao Zhou sought clarification, Du Qiong further explained, [...] "The term cao (曹) was never used to refer to the positions held by government officials in ancient times. This practice only started in the Han dynasty: clerks are called shu cao (屬曹) and guards are called shi cao (侍曹). This is probably Heaven's will." ...|$|E

So nobody cares. Marriage without a decent chance of relief is only a sort of slave-owning; people oughtn't to own each other. Everybody sees that now.

6000|$|SCENE I.--LORD FOPPINGTON's Lodgings. Enter LORD FOPPINGTON, and LA VAROLE. Lord Fop. Hey, fellow, let thy vis-a-vis {{come to the}} door. La Var. Will your lordship venture so soon {{to expose}} {{yourself}} to the weather? Lord Fop. Sir, I will venture as soon as I can expose myself to the ladies. La Var. I wish your lordship would please to keep house a little longer; I'm afraid your honour does not well consider your wound. Lord Fop. My wound!--I {{would not be in}} eclipse another day, though I had as many wounds in my body as I have had in my heart. So mind, Varole, let these cards be left as directed; for this evening I shall wait on my future father-in-law, Sir Tunbelly, and I mean to commence my devoirs to the lady, by giving an entertainment at her father's expense; and hark thee, tell Mr. Loveless I request he and his company will honour me with their presence, or I shall think we are not friends. La Var. I will be sure, milor. [Exit.] Enter TOM FASHION. Fash. Brother, your servant; how do you find yourself to-day? Lord Fop. So well that I have ardered my coach to the door--so there's no danger of death this baut, Tam. Fash. I'm very glad of it. Lord Fop. [Aside.] That I believe a lie.-- [Aloud.] Pr'ythee, Tam, tell me one thing--did not your heart cut a caper up to your mauth, when you heard I was run through the bady? Fash. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should? Lord Fop. Because I remember mine did so when I heard my uncle was shot through the head. Fash. It, then, did very ill. Lord Fop. Pr'ythee, why so? Fash. Because he used you very well. Lord Fop. Well!--Naw, strike me dumb! he starved me; he has let me want a thausand women for want of a thausand paund. Fash. Then he hindered you from making a great many ill bargains; for I think no woman worth money that will take money. Lord Fop. If I was a younger brother I should think so too. Fash. Then you are seldom much in love? Lord Fop. Never, stap my vitals! Fash. Why, then, did you make all this bustle about Amanda? Lord Fop. Because she's a woman of insolent virtue, and I thought myself piqued in honour to debauch her. Fash. Very well.--[Aside.] Here's a rare fellow for you, to have the spending of ten thousand pounds a year! But now for my business with him.--[Aloud.] Brother, though I know to talk of any business (especially of money) is a theme not quite so entertaining to you as that of the ladies, my necessities are such, I hope you'll have patience to hear me. Lord Fop. The greatness of your necessities, Tam, is the worst argument in the waurld for your being patiently heard. I do believe you are going to make a very good speech, but, strike me dumb! it has the worst beginning of any speech I have heard this twelvemonth. Fash. I'm sorry you think so. Lord Fop. I do believe thou art: but, come, let's know the affair quickly. Fash. Why, then, my case, in a word, is this: the necessary expenses of my travels have so much exceeded the wretched income of my annuity, that I have been forced to mortgage it for five hundred pounds, which is spent. So unless you are so kind as to assist me in redeeming it, I know no remedy but to take a purse. Lord Fop. Why, faith, Tam, to give you my sense of the thing, I do think taking a purse the best remedy in the waurld; for if you succeed, you are relieved that way, if you are taken [Drawing his hand round his neck], you are relieved t'other. Fash. I'm glad to see you are in so pleasant a humour; I hope I shall find the effects on't. Lord Fop. Why, do you then really think it a reasonable thing, that I should give you five hundred paunds? Fash. I do not ask it as a due, brother; I am willing to receive it as a favour. Lord Fop. Then thou art willing to receive it anyhow, strike me speechless! But these are damned times to give money in; taxes are so great, repairs so exorbitant, tenants such rogues, and bouquets so dear, that the devil take me I'm reduced to that extremity in my cash, I have been forced to retrench in that one article of sweet pawder, till I have brought it down to five guineas a maunth--now judge, Tam, whether I can spare you five paunds. Fash. If you can't I must starve, that's all.-- [Aside.] Damn him! Lord Fop. All I can say is, you should have been a better husband. Fash. Ouns! if you can't live upon ten thousand a year, how do you think I should do't upon two hundred? Lord Fop. Don't be in a passion, Tam, for passion is the most unbecoming thing in the waurld--to the face. Look you, I don't love to say anything to you to make you melancholy, but upon this occasion I must take leave to put you in mind that a running horse does require more attendance than a coach-horse. Nature has made some difference twixt you and me. Fash. Yes--she has made you older.--[Aside.] Plague take her. Lord Fop. That is not all, Tam. Fash. Why, what is there else? Lord Fop. [Looks first on himself and then on his brother.] Ask the ladies. Fash. Why, thou essence-bottle, thou musk-cat! dost thou then think thou hast any advantage over me but what Fortune has given thee? Lord Fop. I do, stap my vitals! Fash. Now, by all that's great and powerful, thou art the prince of coxcombs! Lord Fop. Sir, I am proud at being at the head of so prevailing a party. Fash. Will nothing provoke thee?--Draw, coward! Lord Fop. Look you, Tam, you know I have always taken you for a mighty dull fellow, and here is one of the foolishest plats broke out that I have seen a lang time. Your poverty makes life so burdensome to you, you would provoke me to a quarrel, in hopes either to slip through my lungs into my estate, or to get yourself run through the guts, {{to put an end to}} your pain. But I will disappoint you in both your designs; far, with the temper of a philasapher, and the discretion of a statesman--I shall leave the room with my sword in the scabbard. [Exit.] Fash. So! farewell, brother; and now, conscience, I defy thee. Lory! Enter LORY. Lory. Sir! Fash. Here's rare news, Lory; his lordship has given me a pill has purged off all my scruples. Lory. Then my heart's at ease again: for I have been in a lamentable fright, sir, ever since your conscience had the impudence to intrude into your company. Fash. Be at peace; it will come there no more: my brother has given it a wring by the nose, and I have kicked it downstairs. So run away to the inn, get the chaise ready quickly, and bring it to Dame Coupler's without a moment's delay. Lory. Then, sir, you are going straight about the fortune? Fash. I am.--Away--fly, Lory! Lory. The happiest day I ever saw. I'm upon the wing already. Now then I shall get my wages. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E

3000|$|Description {{of a life}} event The affect, intentionality, {{effort and}} {{adaptation}} to a life event measure (Garcia 2012 b; Garcia and Sikström 2013) was used to ask participants to recollect and then write down at random either the most positive or the most negative event in their life during the last 3  months (see Suh et al. 1996, who show that only writing about life events within the last 3  months influence happiness and well-being significantly). In the positive condition, participants are specifically asked to describe the most positive event during the last 3  months that to the greatest degree has enhanced their happiness. In contrast, in the negative condition, participants are asked for the most negative event in their life during the last 3  months that to the greatest degree had decreased their happiness. Both conditions instruct participants {{to answer the following}} questions when describing the event: What happened?

40|$|Background: We used a {{computational}} method to quantitatively investigate {{the relationship between}} personality and written narratives of life events. Agentic (i. e., self- directedness), communal (i. e., cooperativeness), and spiritual (self-transcendence) traits were of special interest because they represent individual differences in intentional val- ues and goals, in contrast to temperament traits, which describe individual differences in automatic responses to emotional stimuli. We also investigated which pronouns were most common in relation to personality constructs that {{were significantly related to}} the narratives. Methods: Personality was assessed among 79 adolescents at one point in time using the NEO Personality Inventory—Revised (NEO-PI-R) and the temperament and char- acter inventory (TCI). Six months later, adolescents were asked to write down the most positive or the most negative event that had happened to them in the last 3 months. Adolescents were explicitly instructed to answer the following questions within their narratives: What happened? Who were involved? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> happened? How did you feel when it happened? How do you think the involved persons felt? The descriptions were quantified using a {{computational method}} in which the latent semantic analysis algorithm generates a semantic representation of the narratives. Results: Only self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-transcendence were related to the semantic representation of the narratives. Moreover, cooperativeness and self- transcendence were associated with less frequent usage of singular pronouns (e. g., me respectively mine). Conclusions: Agentic, communal, and spiritual traits are involved when adolescents describe positive and negative life experiences. Moreover, high levels of communal and spiritual traits are related to less self-focused narratives.

The following Guidelines are to assist you in conducting this very important part of your MS-EAEE degree. M. S. Theses are published on the EAEE Research Centers web and can be a big plus on your CV. Many high quality theses are also published as technical papers, co-authored by the M. S. candidate and his/her advisor. 1. SUBJECT: What will be the subject? In consultation with your advisor select a subject of intense interest to you. Something you will work on not only because it is part of your M. S. degree but also as a favorite hobby. 2. TITLE: Write the title, no matter how crude it is at the beginning, it can be improved later. The same goes for everything else below. It is better to put something imperfect down in writing then have the perfect concept in your head and maybe forget it later. Make the title short but informative; it should express the specific thing you plan to work on. 3. PLAN STATEMENT: Write a very preliminary statement (less than one page) that explains in brief and clear sentences:. a) <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is useful to carry out such a project: Gap in knowledge? Environmental problem that needs more investigation? Problem in the future that we should prepare for?
