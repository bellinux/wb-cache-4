In an interview with MTV, producer LV from The Hitmen said [...] "Jay {{would have the}} beats...He'd do the record, and he'd send it back to us. We'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records. From having live horns, live strings, live drummers. This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles of shit. We went all out. <b>We</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> musicians to bring it out. Jay probably just heard a sample and some drums. Once we got the vocals back, <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> all the extra candy".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2010, Ahern {{has said}} he would have no {{difficulties}} giving evidence to the investigation into banking, nor having his testimony heard in public. Saying he would appear if asked, Ahern defended his record while in government, attributing the crisis in banking to international factors and the banks’ over-exposure to borrowing on international markets. [...] "By and large we all know what happened. The banks borrowed money on the open market in the short-term. And as soon as things went, they had to pay that money up but they hadn’t got it to pay," [...] he said. [...] "That's what happened. I don’t think it will take too long [...] to write up what the position is." [...] He continued saying, [...] "The greater issue was the protection and the regulation of the bank rather than consumers’ interests." [...] Mr Ahern also said that people were [...] "jumping over developers" [...] but also needed to remember they employed 200,000 people. He said that {{one of the first things}} that Brian Cowen had done when he became minister for finance was to abolish many of the property tax incentives. He also stood over many of the incentives that benefited property developers. [...] "When they were brought in, the place was in a disastrous way. Look at the quays in Dublin. There were reports around for 40 years that said the quays needed something done about them and nothing happened until <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> the urban renewal status and gave the tax incentives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rockenfield {{wrote the}} music for [...] "In This Light", [...] "A World Without", and [...] "Open Road". After {{finishing}} the framework, consisting of drums and guitars, he sent the demo to La Torre, who would write lyrics and melodies to the song. Rockenfield and La Torre {{turned out to have}} a great songwriting chemistry together, which became evident during their first collaboration on [...] "A World Without". When Rockenfield emailed the band the framework of [...] "A World Without" [...] he had just finished at home, it already had that name as a placeholder song title. La Torre was at his home in Florida and received the song around 2 or 3 a.m. La Torre said: [...] "I played it and started typing as I was feeling the melody", finishing the lyrics and melody to the song in less than an hour. He recorded the vocals, and within two hours sent it back to Rockenfield, telling him: [...] "It is done." [...] They called one another, with La Torre saying in happy tears: [...] "It was the most moving piece of music that brought me to a place, and I'm just so touched by it." [...] Wilton subsequently started writing the guitar solo, and Rockenfield worked on orchestration for the song to be put on top of the heavy guitars, explaining: [...] "I was really in a zone when I wrote it. We wanted to make that as epic as possible. We got an orchestra, [...] <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> Pamela Moore as the guest voice." [...] Wilton said it [...] "is certainly atmospheric and epic, and that Scott Rockenfield is doing all the orchestration and the implementation of the violins and cello certainly add to that." [...] Rockenfield and La Torre wrote [...] "Open Road" [...] a week after [...] "A World Without". According to La Torre, the process was similar: [...] "it just took me into a certain place". The lyrics and melody were finished in a few hours, after which Wilton wrote a solo for it.|$|E

And all these Christmas doin's was got up to give me the chance not only of speakin' to you, but of showin' my colors better than I could show them in any other way. Everything went on a-skimmin' till this mornin', when that {{stranger}} that <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> from the shoal piped up and asked fer you.

60|$|And {{with that}} he called a hand, gave him the code flags, and stepped himself to the main signal halliards, which vibrated {{under the weight of}} the ensign overhead.

6000|$|A {{day after}} this <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> a large green bough, {{and put it}} up over the looking-glass. Hum noticed it before it had been there five minutes, flew to it, and began a regular survey, {{perching}} now here, now there, till he seemed to find a twig that exactly suited him; and after that he roosted there every night. Who does not see in this change all the signs of reflection and reason that are shown by us in thinking over our circumstances, and trying to better them? It seemed to say in so many words: [...] "That towel-line is an unsafe place for a bird; I get frightened, and wake from bad dreams to find myself head downwards; so I will find a better roost on this twig." ...|$|E
60|$|It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: {{it was not}} {{the most}} {{plentiful}} increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world; that is to say, any part of America. When we had thus housed and secured our magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.|$|E
6000|$|We set to work, {{slowly at}} first, then faster and still faster, {{bringing}} in true bills; and after every one making a mark in our lists {{so that we}} might know where we were. <b>We</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> true bills for burglary, and false pretences, larceny, and fraud; we brought them in for manslaughter, rape, and arson. When we had ten or so, two of us would get up and bear them away down to the Court below and lay them before the Judge. [...] "Thank you, gentlemen!" [...] he would say, or words to that effect; and we would go up again, and go on bringing in true bills. I noticed that at the evidence of each fresh bill we looked with a little less excitement, and a little less solemnity, making every time a shorter tick and a shorter note in the margin of our lists. All the bills we had--fifty-seven--we brought in true. And {{the morning and the}} afternoon made that day, till we rested and went to our homes.|$|E
6000|$|We {{were not}} long about it, and <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> them <b>in.</b> [...] "Don't take me," [...] says Charker, holding me round the neck, and {{stumbling}} {{down at my}} feet when the gate was fast, [...] "don't take me near the ladies or the children, Gill.

60|$|It was now harvest, and our crop in good order; {{it was not}} {{the most}} {{plentiful}} increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough to answer our end; for from twenty two bushels of barley, <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> and threshed out above two hundred and twenty bushels, and the like in proportion of the rice, which was store enough for our food to the next harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or, if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have victualled our ship, to have carried us to any part of the world, that is to say, of America.

And now having a full supply of food for all the guests expected, I gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do with those he left behind him there: I gave him a strict charge in writing not to bring any man with him, who would not first swear, in the presence of himself and of the old savage, that he would no way injure, fight with, or attack the person he should find in the island, who was so kind to send for them in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by and defend him against all such attempts; and wherever they went, would be entirely under, and subjected to his command; and that this should be put in writing, and signed with their hands: how we were to have this done, when I knew they had neither pen or ink, that indeed was a question which we never asked.|$|E
60|$|That night, Captain B---- and {{the chief}} mate, came down upon me, like a gust, for having parted with the tar. They {{concluded}} their lecture, by threatening to work me up. Bill Swett was by, and he got {{his share of the}} dose. When we were left to ourselves, we held a council of war, about future proceedings. Our crew had run, to a man, the cook excepted, as usually happens, in Charleston; and <b>we</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> the cook, as a counsellor. This man told me, that he had overheard the captain and mate laying a plan to give me a threshing, as soon as I had turned in. Bill, now, frankly proposed that I should run, as well as himself; for he had already left his ship; and our plan was soon laid. Bill went ashore, and brought a boat down under the bows of the ship, and I passed my dunnage into her, by going through the forecastle; I then left the Sterling, for ever, never putting my foot on board of her again. I saw her, once or twice, afterwards, at a distance, and she always looked like a sort of home to me. She was subsequently lost, on the eastern coast, Captain Johnston still owning her, and being actually on board her, though only as a passenger. I had been out in her twelve times, from country to country, besides several short runs, from port to port. She always seemed natural to me; and I had got to know every timber and stick about her. I felt more, in quitting this ship, than I did in quitting Halifax. This desertion was the third great error of my life. The first was, quitting those with whom I had been left by my father; the second, abandoning my good friends, the Heizers; and the third, leaving the Sterling. Had Captain Johnston been in the ship, I never should have dreamed of running. He was always kind to me, and if he failed in justice, it was on the side of indulgence. Had I continued with him, I make no doubt, my career would have been very different from what it has since turned out to be; and, I fear, I must refer one of the very bad habits, that afterwards marred my fortunes, that of drinking too much, to this act. Still, it will be remembered, I was only nineteen, loved adventure, and detested Captain B----.|$|E
