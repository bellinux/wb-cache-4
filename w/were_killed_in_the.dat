5|$|Although {{its primary}} effects were felt in a {{localized}} area of India, the outer {{fringes of the}} super cyclone impacted Myanmar and Bangladesh. Ten people <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former, while two <b>were</b> <b>killed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter by the storm's rainbands. The storm was the most severe to strike Odisha in the 20th century, raking the state and adjacent areas with high storm surge, powerful winds, and torrential rainfall. The storm's impacts exacerbated {{the damage caused by}} a very severe cyclone that struck the same region less than two weeks earlier. The 5–6m (16–20ft) surge brought water up to 35km (20mi) inland, carrying along with it coastal debris and inundating towns and villages. The surge combined with heavy rains to produce widespread flooding, damaging around 1.6million homes and causing rivers to breach 20,005flood embankments. The storm's effects destroyed numerous crops, including sugar cane, rice, and other winter-time harvests. Although estimates of the death toll varied significantly—at times suggesting 30,000fatalities—the Government of India enumerated 9,887fatalities in the country, of which a majority were caused by storm surge; over 8,000deaths occurred in Jagatsinghpur. The total damage cost of the destruction wrought by the super cyclone amounted to US$4.44billion.|$|E
