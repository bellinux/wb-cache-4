5|$|Once the {{election}} date was set as September 10, national organizations {{on both sides}} of the gun-control debate started to <b>weigh</b> <b>in.</b> <b>On</b> the recall, pro-gun rights side was the National Rifle Association and Americans for Prosperity, while on the gun control side was the Mayors Against Illegal Guns and Mayor Bloomberg. Morse went door-to-door in an effort to gain voter support and both sides of the campaigns accused the other side of mud-slinging. Morse supporters were upset about an ad alleging ethical misconduct by Morse, noting that he had been cleared of those allegations. Giron supporters were accused of misrepresenting the issue as a choice on women's rights and abortion.|$|E

They turn to King Pelasgus of Argos for protection, but Pelasgus refuses until the people of Argos <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the decision, a distinctly democratic move {{on the part of the}} king.

25|$|Yemen is a {{developing}} country, and the poorest {{country in the}} Middle East. Under the rule of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemen was described by critics as a kleptocracy. According to the 2009 international corruption Perception Index by Transparency International, Yemen ranked 164 out of 182 countries surveyed. In the absence of strong state institutions, elite politics in Yemen constituted a de facto form of collaborative governance, where competing tribal, regional, religious, and political interests agreed to hold themselves in check through tacit acceptance of the balance it produced. The informal political settlement was held together by a power-sharing deal between three men: president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who controlled the state; Major General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, who controlled the largest share of the Republic of Yemen Armed Forces; and Abdullah ibn Husayn al-Ahmar, figurehead of the Islamist Islah party and Saudi Arabia's chosen broker of transnational patronage payments to various political players, including tribal sheikhs. The Saudi payments have been intended to facilitate the tribes' autonomy from the Yemeni government and to give the Saudi government a mechanism with which to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Yemen's political decision-making.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, Eric Gomez, {{president}} of Golden Boy Promotions told the LA Times that Álvarez had an immediate rematch clause {{in place on}} his contract, whereas Golovkin, if he loses, won't be guaranteed a rematch.

The AT Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Dodgers Stadium missed out on hosting the fight. Eric Gomez of Golden Boy Promotions {{said in a statement that}} Álvarez would fight for the IBF meaning he would participate in the second day weight in, which the IBF require that each boxer weighs no more than 10 pounds over the 160 pound limit. Although he said there was no word on whether Álvarez would fight for the WBC title, Álvarez claimed that he would not be. On July 7, 2017 Golden Boy and K2 Promotions individually announced the tickets had sold out.|$|E

500|$|Sherwood Boehlert, the Republican {{chair of}} the House Committee on Science during most of Marburger's tenure, said that [...] "the {{challenge}} he faced was serving a president who didn't really want much scientific advice, and who let politics dictate {{the direction of his}} science policy... and he was in the unenviable position of being someone who had earned the respect of his scientific colleagues while having to be identified with policies that were not science-based." [...] On the other hand, Robert P. Crease, a colleague of Marburger at Stony Brook University, characterized him as someone who [...] " [...] to the White House as a scientist, not an advocate. He refused to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> high-profile, politically controversial issues, but instead set about fixing broken connections in the unwieldy machinery by which the government approves and funds scientific projects.... Some bitterly criticized him for collaborating with the Bush administration. But he left the office running better than when he entered." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 8, Stoughton {{ordered a}} woman accused of {{witchcraft}} (Bridget Bishop) {{to be executed}} only two days later, though tradition had been to allow at least four days between order and execution. The following Monday the clergy were asked to officially <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the issue. This was likely Phips asking for the opinion of Increase Mather, and his son Cotton, and {{to put it in}} writing. The response is called The Return of the Ministers, simultaneously urging caution and speedy prosecution. Most importantly it cautioned against, but did not disallow, or discredit, the admission of spectral evidence (accusations of a crime committed by one's [...] "spector", against which there is no alibi possible). The Mathers, father and son, and the other area ministers continued to debate this issue throughout the summer and into the fall, as documented by the minutes of the Cambridge Association. At the end of June, five more women were condemned to die. Phips granted a reprieve to one of these, but was impressed upon [...] "by some Salem gentlemen" [...] to take it back. At this point, Phips seemed to wash his hands of the proceedings, not relishing the idea of gaining the enmity of his own lieutenant governor and the clergymen allied with him, including the fully committed Cotton Mather, and the waffling Increase Mather. There is no record of Phips ever having travelled north to meet any of the [...] "afflicted", or attend a single Oyer and Terminer trial, or execution. Instead, Phips continued to work on recruiting troops and gathering supplies to build a fort in Maine and he left the province at the end of July, and was gone the entire month of August and much of September, officially handing over all executive powers to Stoughton in his absence beginning August 1.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I should have seen coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

2500|$|The {{book is a}} {{response}} to various debates of Darwin's time far more wide-ranging than the questions he raised in Origin.

Coming out so late into that particular debate, while it was clearly Darwin's intent to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> this question, his goal was to approach it through a specific theoretical lens (sexual selection), which other commentators at the period had not discussed, and consider the evolution of morality and religion. The theory of sexual selection was also needed to counter the argument that beauty with no obvious utility, such as exotic birds' plumage, proved divine design, which had been put strongly by the Duke of Argyll in his book [...] (1868).|$|E

Kanemitsu criticized the government, saying, [...] "We should always be careful when start to entrust the government with discriminatory polices, be that against people, sexuality, or mediums of self-expression. How would you like it if someone told you homosexuality could be tolerated in only certain mediums, or that you may dance to waltz music but not to polka tunes?" [...] Kanemitsu concluded his interview, saying, [...] "If unchecked, the logic behind how Imouto Paradise 2 was designated harmful to minors can be employed by those in power to enforce their own brand of morality upon the public." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Kibbey entered office, {{the biggest}} issue facing Arizona Territory was a {{proposal}} to recombine Arizona with New Mexico Territory and admit the combined political unit as a single state. [...] Despite President Roosevelt's support of the proposal, Kibbey swiftly proclaimed his opposition, noting the widespread disapproval of the plan by the citizens of Arizona. [...] The newly sworn-in governor also threatened to resign over the joint-statehood proposal. [...] As the 23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature was in session {{when he came into}} office, Kibbey asked the legislature to authorize a special election asking the territory's voters to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the proposal, but no such election was authorized. [...] When Representative Edward L. Hamilton of Michigan introduced a bill to enact the proposal, the governor then joined with other territorial leaders in lobbying against the joint-statehood bill in the U.S. Congress. [...] The lobbying gained a number of supporters who were able to delay passage of the bill and then insert an amendment calling for a referendum by the voters of both Arizona and New Mexico asking, [...] "Shall Arizona and New Mexico be united to form one State?". [...] The proposal died in November 1906 when New Mexico voters approved the proposal by a vote of 26,195 to 14,735 but Arizona voters rejected it by a vote of 3,141 to 16,265.|$|E
2500|$|Abé Mark Nornes, in {{an essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Riddle of the Vase: Ozu Yasujirō's Late Spring (1949)," [...] observes: [...] "Nothing in all of Ozu's films has sparked such conflicting explanations; everyone seems compelled to <b>weigh</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> this scene, invoking it as a key example in their arguments." [...] Nornes speculates {{that the reason for}} this is the scene's [...] "emotional power and its unusual construction. The vase is clearly essential to the scene. The director not only shows it twice, but he lets both shots run for what would be an inordinate amount of time by the measure of most filmmakers." [...] To one commentator, the vase represents [...] "stasis," [...] and is thus [...] "an expression of something unified, permanent, transcendent." [...] Another critic describes the vase and other Ozu [...] "still lifes" [...] as [...] "containers for our emotions." [...] Yet another specifically disputes this interpretation, identifying the vase as [...] "a non-narrative element wedged into the action." [...] A fourth scholar sees it as an instance of the filmmaker's deliberate use of [...] "false POV" [...] (point of view), since Noriko is never shown actually looking at the vase the audience sees. A fifth asserts that the vase is [...] "a classic feminine symbol." [...] And yet another suggests several alternative interpretations, including the vase as [...] "a symbol of traditional Japanese culture," [...] and as an indicator of Noriko's [...] "sense that... relationship with her father has been changed." ...|$|E
