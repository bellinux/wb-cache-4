500|$|The {{first section}} of pipe was laid in 1975 after {{more than five years}} of legal and {{political}} arguments. Allegations of faulty <b>welds</b> <b>drew</b> intense scrutiny from local and national observers. A culture grew around the unique working conditions involved in constructing the pipeline, and each union that worked on the project had a different function and stereotype. Thirty-two Alyeska Pipeline Service Company employees and contract workers were killed during the project. The main construction effort lasted until 1977; the first barrel of oil was delivered on July 28 of that year. Several more pump stations, added as oil flow increased, were completed through 1980.|$|R

40|$|A {{multicentre}} {{cohort of}} 11, 092 male welders from 135 companies located in nine European countries has been assembled {{with the aim}} of investigating the relation of potential cancer risk, lung cancer in particular, with occupational exposure. The observation period and the criteria for inclusion of welders varied from country to country. Follow up was successful for 96. 9 % of the cohort and observed numbers of deaths (and for some countries incident cancer cases) were compared with expected numbers calculated from national reference rates. Mortality and cancer incidence ratios were analysed by cause category, time since first exposure, duration of employment, and estimated cumulative dose to total fumes, chromium (Cr), Cr VI, and nickel (Ni). Overall a statistically significant excess was reported for mortality from lung cancer (116 observed v 86. 81 expected deaths, SMR = 134). When analysed by type of welding an increasing pattern with time since first exposure was present for both mild steel and stainless steel welders, which was more noticeable for the subcohort of predominantly stainless steel welders. No clear relation was apparent between mortality from lung cancer and duration of exposure to or estimated cumulative dose of Ni or Cr. Whereas the patterns of lung cancer mortality in these results suggest that the risk of lung cancer is higher for stainless steel than mild steel welders the different level of risk for these two categories of welding exposure cannot be quantified with precision. The report of five deaths from pleural mesothelioma unrelated to the type of <b>welding</b> <b>draws</b> attention to the risk of exposure to asbestos in welding activities...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic yoke is a {{hand-held}} device that induces {{a magnetic field}} between two poles. Common applications are for outdoor use, remote locations, and <b>weld</b> inspection. The <b>draw</b> back of magnetic yokes is that they only induce a magnetic field between the poles, so large-scale inspections using the device can be time-consuming. For proper inspection the yoke needs to be rotated 90 degrees for every inspection area to detect horizontal and vertical discontinuities. Subsurface detection using a yoke is limited. These systems used dry magnetic powders, wet powders, or aerosols.|$|R
40|$|Superconducting radio {{frequency}} (SRF) cavities used in charged particle linear accelerators, are currently fabricated by deep drawing niobium sheets and <b>welding</b> the <b>drawn</b> dishes together. The Nb sheet has a non-uniform microstructure, {{which leads to}} unpredictable cavity shape and surface roughness, and inconsistent "spring-back" during forming. In addition, weld zones cause hot spots during cavity operation. These factors limit linear accelerator performance and increase cavity manufacturing cost. Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) {{can be used to}} refine and homogenize the microstructure of Nb tube for subsequent hydroforming into SRF cavities. Careful selection of deformation and heat treatment conditions during the processing steps can give a uniform and consistent microstructure in the tube, leading to improved deformability and lower manufacturing costs. Favorable microstructures were achieved in short test samples of RRR Nb tube, which may be particularly suitable for hydroforming into SRF cavity strings. The approach demonstrated could be applicable to microstructure engineering of other tube materials including tantalum, titanium, and zirconium...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The uses of Acoustic Emission (AE) {{in process}} monitoring, {{particularly}} in the automotive sector, are little known but very varied (<b>welding,</b> straightening, <b>drawing,</b> machining, etc.) The most common use {{is no doubt in}} the straightening of gear box and steering rack rods. Tears or cracks may occur when tubes are formed or deep drawn. AE can be used to detect the point in the process where the crack occurs (in the case of multiple step processes or multi-station presses). Once this crucial point has been identified, it is then possible to adapt the production process or the metallurgy in order to prevent this damage from occurring. A press has been instrumented {{in order to be able}} to continuously control the production process. The first step when defining the feasibility of a process is performed using a multi-purpose AE system such as those used in research laboratories. Once the process has been clearly identified and the process noise has been characterized, a simplified control system is then defined and put in place on the production lines. Today, the mill decided to first study the localization of the weld seam before implemented the AE process monitoring. Introduction: During fabrication in the automotive industry, deep <b>drawing</b> operation of <b>welded</b> tubes is susceptible to produce cracks formation in the most strained area.

40|$|A {{laser welded}} blank {{for use in}} {{applications}} calling for tailor welded blank (TWB) in vehicle panel assemblies. A promising approach to reduce manufacturing costs, decrease vehicle weight, and {{improve the quality of}} automotive body components is through the use of tailor-welded blanks. This term refers to blanks where multiple sheets of material are welded together to create a single blank prior to the forming process. The welding process creates formability concerns in a traditional forming process due to material property changes in the weld and in the heat-affected zone adjacent to the weld. Malaysian automotive manufacturers are still lack of this advancement. Hence, this project endeavors to build a platform for the industries by pioneering researches in this area. This paper presents to investigate the weld properties of high strength steel laser weld for joining the automotive panel. Laser weld and different types of steel are considered in this study. Experiment was carried out to determine the properties of materials after <b>welding,</b> forming and <b>drawing</b> process of TWB.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the technical {{development of the}} laser welding process and presents the results {{from a number of}} experimental investigations. The seven papers that make up the thesis investigate various aspects of the technical development of the laser welding process mechanism as well as industrial applications. The thesis provides an introduction to the subject of CO 2 laser welding. The mechanism and techniques of the process are analysed and the future commercial growth of the subject is discussed. An investigation of laser welding of construction steels used in the heavy mechanical industries is presented. The results include welding parameters for high power lasers up to 17 kW, weld metallurgy and static and dynamic weld strength of test specimens. Also components designed for laser welding were tested. An investigation of the effect of plasma control on porosity levels when welding zinc-coated steel is is presented including the reduction of plasma production by using a pulsed laser beam. Laser <b>welding</b> of deep <b>drawing</b> sheet steel has been performed with simultaneous feeding of iron powder into a butt joint. A new method using a magnetic field to feed the powder into the joint gap has been developed. A continuous wave Nd:YAG-laser was used to weld sheet metal parts with very high demands on the weld geometry and quality. Examples include applications from the aircraft and aerospace industry. To achieve improved weld geometry and to reduce the probability of porosity formation, a dual-focusing optic was designed and successfully tested. Fatigue tests were carried out on thin section stainless steel lap welds produced by Nd:YAG-laser. Analysis of the fatigue tests results and the fracture surfaces identified sheet thickness and inter sheet gaps as having considerable effect on fatigue life. Weld width has a more moderate influence on fatigue life and weld porosity has a negligible effect at low concentrations. Three metals with different thermal properties were welded under similar conditions by Nd:YAG and CO 2 lasers. The Nd:YAG laser was found to give superior welding performance. The welding process efficiency was found to be affected by four material properties: the specific heat, the density, the melting point and the keyhole absorption.
