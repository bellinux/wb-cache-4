[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{is one of}} {{the public}} {{foodborne}} bacterial pathogens and results in severe illness such as diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, and pneumonia. To ensure food safety and human health, it is critical to develop rapid methods for E. coli O 157 :H 7 detection. There were several outbreaks of E. coli O 157 :H 7 pathogen in past years which endangered food safety and human health. The traditional bacterial culture testing method that are considered the gold standard, are time consuming (2 - 5 days) to confirm a diagnosis, and laborious. The PCR is faster but still requires 24 hours and overnight shipping. Thus, it is important to develop a rapid and effective detection method for this pathogen. In this study, a MEMS based biosensor has been designed, fabricated, and tested to effectively detect the presence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in food products. Impedance spectroscopy biosensor principal is utilized to detect E. coli bacteria. The biosensor consists of three regions for focusing, trapping, and detection of E. coli inside a microfluidic channel. the focusing region consists of a ramp down vertical wall along with tilted thin film fingers. This region focus and concentrate the bacteria cells {{into the center of the}} microchannel when dielectrophoresis (DEP) is applied and direct them toward the detection channel, while the bulk media are exited from the two sides toward the <b>waste</b> <b>outlets.</b> The detection region consists of three sets of interdigitated electrode array, each with ten pairs of fingers. The microchannel is infused with anti-E. coli antibody to modify the surface of the interdigitated microelectrode. As the E. coli bacteria sample is injected, it comes in contact with the modified interdigitated microelectrodes. The dielectric property of the interdigitated microelectrode changes as the E. coli bacteria cells bind to the E. coli antibody. Therefore, the impedance of the device changes and it can be measured using the impedance analyzer for the frequency range of 100 Hz- 10 MHz.

40|$|This project {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a micro-organism concentrator. Pathogen detection, particularly MEMS based detection, is often limited by sample concentration. The proposed concentrator will interface with a pathogen detector. This type of pathogen concentrator can be useful for many kinds of applications including water purification systems, medical applications and biological warfare agent detection. Due to the nature of these applications, the concentrator must be able to operate under real-world conditions, and be robust to particulates and variations in solution conductivity. The concentrator is an active filter, which concentrate bacteria in solution using negative dielectrophoresis, which pushes objects away from the electrodes toward field minima. An electric field barrier is set up to guide cells toward a concentrated outlet flow path while the bulk of the fluid, which permeates the electric field barrier, is sent to a <b>waste</b> <b>outlet.</b> The cells are collected at the outlet and selectively released by turning off the applied voltage.

The objective of the present work is thus to combine a water quality simulation model and waste-load allocation model into a general methodology framework, and aims to address the water pollution issue in the TGR area. In this study, the Changshou-Fuling section is a typical mainstream section along the Yangtze River and was selected as the target study section for implementing the modeling runs and identifying the optimal waste-load allocation schemes. The EFDC model was used as the surface water quality model to simulate the flow hydrodynamics and chemical transport. It helps rank and screen the major <b>waste</b> discharge <b>outlets</b> within the study reservoir section. The pollutant mixing zone (PMZ) formed by one single outlet for different pollutants was calculated to establish the linkage between the pollution plume size with the strength of each discharge outlet, and a sensitivity index can then be calculated based on the calculated PMZ. The spatial and temporal distribution of PMZ was calculated by the EFDC model. The waste-load allocation patterns were obtained through optimizing the sensitivity index of each <b>waste</b> discharge <b>outlet.</b> According to the modeling results, the schemes for optimal waste-load allocations among 11 different discharge outlets were analyzed. The implications to formulate the strategies for improving the water quality for the entire region were also discussed.

40|$|Abstract: The Changjiang Estuary nearby Shanghai {{is one of}} {{the largest}} and the most {{complicated}} estuaries in China. The flow exhibits obvious 3 D structure in the Changjiang Estuary due to the complex topography, tide and runoff, and the pollutant transportation is also complicated in the region. The south branch of the Changjiang Estuary is the main outfall channel to the East China Sea, and the runoff of south branch is about 95 percent of total runoff of the Changjiang Estuary. Based on POM Model, the three-dimensional flow and mass transportation mathematical model with an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate in the horizontal direction and sigma coordinate in the vertical direction for the south branch of the Changjiang Estuary is established in this paper. The basic equations are discretized by the finite difference method and the process splitting skill (the numerical computational process is divided to external mode and internal mode) is applied in this model. The computed range in south branch of the Changjiang Estuary is 91. 70 kilometer in length and 1328. 81 km 2 in area.

30|$|We {{assessed}} the microparticle recovery {{as a function}} of three paramagnetic microparticle sizes 1, 5, and 22  µm in diameter. For the optimal flow rates determined the observed recovery (fraction of magnetic microparticles recovered in the final collection outlet compared to the combined waste channels) was most efficient (97.5 %) for the largest diameter microparticles (22  µm) (Fig.  3 b). This is due to the larger magnetic core and resulting higher velocity in the magnetic field. Smaller diameter (~[*] 1  µm) superparamagnetic particles were also tested, but due to higher net magnetic susceptibilities and resulting higher velocities, the injection channel required modifications to achieve efficient recovery (Additional file 2 : Video S 1). This represents a limitation of the current device design, which may need to be tailored to the properties of the magnetic particles used in the droplet based assay. Because high speed imaging and tracking of larger diameter particles is less challenging than for smaller particles, the 22  µm diameter magnetic microparticles were used for the remainder of proof-of-principle experiments in this study. In the absence of a magnetic field adjacent to the injection channels, collective recovery for all microparticles was approximately 40 % presumably due to the force imparted through injection (Fig.  3 b) which biases additional microparticles to the <b>waste</b> <b>outlet</b> channels during splitting. Using high-speed imaging the trajectories of individual 22  µm microparticles were tracked using the DMV software [24] and superimposed (Fig.  3 c). The injection induced Y-axis deflection is typically less than 70  µm and particles return to the top portion of the droplet within about 500  µm distance travelled in the X direction. The distance between the injection channel and the splitting junction is 1  mm for the proof-of-principle devices used in this study indicating that higher throughput is achievable. Using high speed imaging the velocity of the particles was tracked just after injection. Typically maximum velocities did not exceed 2500  µm/s in fair agreement with the expected value (Eq.  4). Slight deviations from the expected velocity may be due to microparticle and magnetic core size dispersity. In addition, the placement of the stationary magnet varies slightly from device to device causing small variations in the magnetic field gradient experienced by the microparticles. In order to verify preservation of droplet volume after splitting, high-speed video of the injection and splitting cycle was acquired. Droplet area was tracked prior-to and during injection and after the bifurcation channel. Droplet area is seen to increase linearly during injection followed by an abrupt decrease at the splitting junction as the two daughter droplets are tracked separately. The area was integrated along the channel height to obtain the volume change for the injection-splitting cycle. Injection and splitting cycle traces were superimposed and compiled into a histogram. The histogram was best fit by two Gaussian distributions indicating identical input droplet and output daughter droplet volumes of 2.2  nl upon injection of 2.1  nl and equal volume splitting (Fig.  3 d).|$|R
40|$|Natural Science Foundation of China [20777063, 40976070]Background {{and purpose}} More and more {{coal-fired}} power plants equipped with seawater flue gas desulfurization systems have been built in coastal areas. They release large amount of mercury (Hg) -containing waste seawater into the adjacent seas. However, very limited impact studies have been carried out. Our research targeted the distribution of Hg in the seawater, sediment, biota, and atmosphere, and its environmental transportation. Methods Seawater samples were collected from five sites: 1, sea areas adjacent to the power plant; 2, near discharge outlets; 3, the aeration pool of the power plant; and 4 and 5, two reference sites. The total gaseous Hg was determined in situ with a Tekran 2537 B. Analyses of total Hg (TM) followed the USEPA methods. Results In most {{part of the study}} area, TM concentrations were close to the reference values and Hg transfer from the seawater into the sediment and biota was not obvious. However, in the aeration pool and near the <b>waste</b> discharge <b>outlets,</b> atmospheric and surface seawater concentrations of TM were much higher, compared with those at a reference site. The concentration ranges of total gaseous Hg and TM in seawater were 3. 83 - 8. 60 ng/m(3) and 79. 0 - 198 ng/L near the discharge outlets, 7. 23 - 13. 5 ng/m(3) and 186 - 616 ng/L in the aeration pool, and 2. 98 - 4. 06 ng/m(3) and 0. 47 - 1. 87 ng/L at a reference point. Conclusions This study suggested that the Hg in the flue gas desulfurization waste seawater was not only transported and diluted with sea currents, but also could possibly be transferred into the atmosphere from the aeration pool and from the discharge outlets...|$|R

Most published papers about FMs {{are concerned with the}} polycyclic and nitro musks. Acetyl cedrene (AC) was used as a model compound in the present study because of its hydrophobic property and thus the high potential of AC to sorb to particles in the water column and subsequently accumulate in aquatic sediment to a high concentration. Sediment-associated AC may therefore pose a high risk to deposit feeding organisms. Capitella teleta (formerly Capitella sp.

Therefore, We used 3 worm densities (C. teleta of the same age at 0, 44, 000 and 88, 000 individuals per m 2), sediments with different organic matter content (4 % and 2. 7 %) and AC spiked sediment (0, 50, 100 µg AC/g dw sed), to examine the fate of sediment-associated AC. The presence of C. teleta significantly affected the fate of sediment-associated AC. After 14 days, more than 80 % of AC had disappeared from the exposure systems with worms. C. teleta concentrated sediment-associated AC in fecal pellets to a high concentration relative to that in surrounding sediment (more than 11 times). The presence of AC in fecal pellets but not in worm tissue suggests either that AC is not bioavailable to C teleta or that this worm is able to biotransform sediment-associated AC (e. g., use AC as carbon source...|$|R

That non-physical barriers such as sudden changes in water quality may also serve as barriers is often stated, but only very few studies address this issue. This study focusses on linking the behavioural response of silver eel and river lamprey when encountering a waste water plume (effluent) in field situations. Individual fish movements were tracked by means of acoustic telemetry in 2 D (in 2009) and in 3 D (in 2010) at a location surrounding a <b>waste</b> water <b>outlet</b> in the Eems-canal near Groningen. Plume dynamics were modelled and calibrated by Deltares and used to directly link to individual movement patterns of fish. In both years, 20 silver eels (downstream migration) were tagged and in 2009 also 13 rvier lamprey (upstram migration) were tagged. In total, 37 out of 40 silver eels entered the 2 D – 3 D study site. Of these, 57 % showed avoidance behaviour when encountering the plume, 43 % were indifferent to the plume and no attraction to the plume was observed. Avoidance behaviour varied from {{moving away from the}} plume but continuing the migration, to returning and not be detected again, thereby possibly ceasing their migration (3 out of 37). This indicates that waste water plumes may serve as non-physical barriers to migrating silver eel. Given the very dynamic nature of the plume in Groningen, even if waste water plumes serve as non-physical barriers for some of the migrating eels, numerous migratory windows are available in time and in water depths, when the plume is minimal or limited to one shore. Therefore it is estimated that the barrier effect of waste water plumes might be small, although delays in migration are likely to occur. Our findings may be used for management purposes. The occurrence of a behavioural avoidance response of approximately half of the eels opens up the possibility to manipulate plumes in order to ‘steer’ silver eels to a preferred direction, e. g. away from potential hazardous locations...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} model of the market for {{advertising}} on news media outlets when consumers have opportunities to switch between outlets. We hypothesize that the move to online news content has facilitated greater consumer switching, as well as heterogeneity in consumer switching patterns. The news outlets are modeled as competing two-sided platforms bringing together heterogeneous, partially multi-homing consumers with advertisers with heterogeneous valuations for reaching consumers, and the multi-homing behavior of the advertisers is determined endogenously. The presence of switching consumers means that, in the absence of certain consumer tracking technologies, scarce advertising capacity is taken up by advertisers purchasing <b>wasted</b> impressions on <b>outlets,</b> as a given advertiser may reach the same consumer too many times. This has subtle effects on the equilibrium price for ad impressions and the profits of outlets, and it may lead to heterogeneity in the multi-homing behavior of advertisers. We characterize the impact of greater consumer switching on outlet profits and the impact of technologies that track consumers both within and across outlets on those profits. Somewhat surprisingly, superior tracking technologies may not always increase outlet profits. In addition, we analyze the impact of blogs, aggregators and paywalls on outlet profits from advertising, which ultimately determine market structure and outlet quality investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a systematic overview of interventions for preventing chilled-food <b>waste</b> at retail <b>outlets,</b> and to assess the impact of these interventions for a particular case of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce at a Dutch retail outlet. The structure of the simulation model as presented in this paper is generic, hence suitable for other retailers and other chilled-food products as well. The generated systematic overview focusses on interventions that do not require a system change. A distinction is made into technical, logistical and marketing interventions. Model simulations show the effectiveness of these interventions. It is concluded that a number of ‘waste drivers’ exists, such as a low and varying consumer demand, high selection behaviour, the order lead time, a fixed order unit, and a short use-by date. The retailer can fine-tune the replenishment level of his order policy and the way of rounding to the given order unit, but by doing so he is at best able to exchange waste for out-of-stock or the other way around. The systematic overview of interventions is valuable input to future research on defining and estimating the effectiveness of combining interventions, and interventions that do require a system change. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThis report {{contains}} {{general information}} on Antimony and antimony compounds concerning the existing standards, emissions, exposure levels and effect levels. The document {{is to be}} considered as a start for the national discussion during an exploratory meeting on integrated criteria documents. Many antimony-emitting sources are known but the emission figures are often lacking. The most important known sources of emissions to air are light bulb production and pigment industry, and possibly the burning of fire retardants, whereas hunting, shooting and sport fishing contribute significantly to emissions to soil and water. Concentration levels of antimony in the environment are, relative to other heavy metals, scarcely available. With regard to the carcinogenic effect of antimony, it seems as yet justified to use at threshold extrapolation method for risk assessment. The risk of antimony in food and drinking water for humans is small, considering the difference between the tolerable daily intake of 0. 86 mug. kg- 1 bw and the actual estimated daily intake of 0. 17 to 0. 33 mg. kg. bw. The risk of current antimony concentrations in air for humans is also considered small. An average exposure concentration in urban areas of 23 ng Sb. m- 3 has been reported, which is below the tentative maximum tolerable concentration of 3200 ng Sb. m- 3. For aquatic organisms a tentative maximum tolerable concentration of 3 mug. l- 1 was derived (as "dissolved" Sb; < 0. 45 mum). The average concentrations (total Sb) in Dutch surface waters are usually below 1 mug. l- 1. The risk to aquatic organisms is within acceptable limits, possibly localities in the vicinity of <b>waste</b> water <b>outlets</b> excepted. Also in soil the current antimony levels are considered not to present a risk to soil organisms in general. A point that may need attention is the contamination of the environment as a result from shooting, hunting and sport fishing. It is recommended to determine antimony concentrations near some point sources in surfacewater and to evaluate the effects of shooting, hunting and sport fishing in combination with the effects of other contaminants such as lead...|$|R
40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. An {{estimated}} 748 {{million people}} around the globe still rely on unsafe drinking water to this day. Out of this population, an average 3. 4 million people perish due to waterborne illness. Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 {{is one of the}} most notorious pathogens that has caused serious outbreaks that has led to deaths. Another pathogen of interest in waterborne contamination is norovirus. It is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the United States and other developed countries. The multi-barrier approach being implemented in current water treatment facilities have dramatically reduced waterborne contamination. However, some waterborne pathogens continue to persist and cause outbreaks linked to contaminated water. Membrane filtration is an alternative method that is being explored in water treatment but the technology continues to be operated in a lab-scale because of cost implications. The challenges faced by the current water treatment procedure must be addressed by new technology that is capable of removing waterborne pathogens from water without the use of chemical additives while at the same time have the cost feasibility to be implemented. Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a technique that manipulates a particle’s movement in a suspended medium. When a particle is subjected to a non-uniform electric field, a dipole is induced within the particle and a DEP force is established. The DEP force causes the polarized particle to move in the electric field gradient thus creating an opportunity to manipulate the particle’s direction and separate the cells from its liquid medium without the use of chemical additives. This thesis hypothesizes that by applying DEP to contaminated water, waterborne pathogens can be manipulated to move towards a specific <b>waste</b> <b>outlet</b> stream and away from the clean stream, thus facilitating a filtration mechanism. The objectives of this thesis are to determine the feasibility of creating a bigger DEP device, examine the efficiency of the scaled-up DEP device in manipulating waterborne pathogens to facilitate separation, and optimize the working parameters by studying the factors involved in operating the DEP device. The first study focused on Escherichia coli K 12 while the second study focused on bacteriophage MS 2 as a norovirus surrogate. The effect of flow rate, frequency, and electric field strength on separation were also studied to determine the optimal conditions for maximum separation. A millimeter-sized DEP device with a Y-junction channel was constructed using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and titanium electrodes. A continuous flow of contaminated tap water into the device was achieved using a syringe pump. A voltage amplifier connected to a frequency generator was applied on the electrodes to produce different non-uniform electric field magnitudes in the main channel at varying frequencies. Samples were collected at the two outlet streams to determine the separation yield. The plate and plaque counting method were performed to compare the population of E. coli K 12 and MS 2, respectively. The highest separation efficiency obtained for E. coli K 12 was found to be 47 % and 42 % under the experimental parameters of 40 V, 100 μl/min, and 1 MHz; and 60 V, 1 ml/min, and 1 MHz, respectively. On the other hand, the highest separation yield for MS 2 was found to be 82 % at the conditions of 20 V, 100 μl/min, and 100 kHz. The voltage requirement to create a suitable electric field strength was different for the two microbes. Bacteria in general are bigger than viruses, which then implies that a stronger DEP force is needed to move bacteria than viruses in the same magnitude. To generate a stronger DEP force, the voltage must be increased to amplify the electric field strength. The separation for both E. coli K 12 and MS 2 obtained their highest separation with a slow flow rate (100 μl/min), thus indicating that the microbes must be given ample exposure time to the electric field to enable the DEP force to manipulate its movement in the channel. The difference in frequency is also reasonable given that particles, cells, and microorganisms react to different frequencies because they all have unique dielectric properties. The two studies showed that a DEP device can be scaled up from micrometer sized channels to millimeter sized channels. Furthermore, the DEP device demonstrated its capability to separate bacteria and virus from tap water as proven by the experiments conducted on E. coli K 12 and MS 2, respectively. Lastly, separation efficiency was found to improve by optimizing voltage, flow rate, and frequency...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} the concept, the {{materials}} and the exploitation potential of a photosynthetic microbial electrochemical cell {{for the production of}} hydrogen driven by solar power are investigated. In a photosynthetic microbial electrochemical cell, which is based on photosynthetic microorganisms confined to an anode and heterotrophic bacteria confined to a cathode, water is split by bacteria hosted in the anode bioactive film. The generated electrons are conveyed through external "bio-appendages" developed by the bacteria to transparent nano-pillars made of indium tin oxide (ITO), Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or other conducting materials, and then transferred to the cathode. On the other hand, the generated protons diffuse to the cathode via a polymer electrolyte membrane, where they are reduced by the electrons by heterotrophic bacteria growing attached to a similar pillared structure as that envisaged for the anode and supplemented with a specific low cost substrate (e. g., organic <b>waste,</b> anaerobic digestion <b>outlet).</b> The generated oxygen is released to the atmosphere or stored, while the produced pure hydrogen leaves the electrode through the porous layers. In addition, the integration of the photosynthetic microbial electrochemical cell system with dark fermentation as acidogenic step of anaerobic digester, which is able to produce additional H 2, and the use of microbial fuel cell, feed with the residues of dark fermentation (mainly volatile fatty acids), to produce the necessary extra-bias for the photosynthetic microbial electrochemical cell is here analyzed to reveal the potential benefits to this novel integrated technology.

40|$|In this study, a tank-connected {{food waste}} {{disposer}} system with the objective to optimise biogas production and nutrient recovery from food waste in Malmo was evaluated. The project investigated the source separation ratio of food waste through waste composition analyses, determined the potential biogas production in ground food waste, analysed the organic matter content and the limiting components in ground food <b>waste</b> and analysed <b>outlet</b> samples to calculate food waste losses from the separation tank. It can be concluded that the tank-connected {{food waste disposer}} system in Malmo {{can be used for}} energy recovery and optimisation of biogas production. The organic content of the collected waste is very high and contains a lot of energy rich fat and protein, and the methane potential is high. The results showed that approximately 38 % of the food waste dry matter is collected in the tank. The remaining food waste is either found in residual waste (34 % of the dry matter) or passes the tank and goes through the outlet to the sewer (28 %). The relatively high dry matter content in the collected fraction (3 - 5 % DM) indicates that the separation tank can thicken the waste substantially. The potential for nutrient recovery is rather limited considering the tank content. Only small fractions of the phosphorus (15 %) and nitrogen (21 %) are recyclable by the collected waste in the tank. The quality of the outlet indicates a satisfactory separation of particulate organic matter and fat. The organic content and nutrients, which are in dissolved form, cannot be retained in the tank and are rather led to the sewage via the outlet. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
