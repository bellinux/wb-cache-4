25|$|In 1995, a {{local court}} in Sibiu asked the Constitutional Court of Romania whether {{the article is}} constitutional. In order to {{formulate}} its answer, the Constitutional Court decided to ask the religious denominations, academy, parliament and civil society groups {{to discuss the issue}} of homosexuality.

25|$|Miralles, {{like many}} other postmodern architects, has a {{preference}} for piling on the motifs and ideas: upturned boats, keel shapes, deep window reveals like a castle, crow-steps, prow shapes, diagonal gutters, 'bamboo bundles' and above all the dark granite gun-shape that repeats as an ornamental motif at a huge scale. Everywhere broken silhouettes compete for attention, just like the alleyways next door. That's fine, and contextual, but it's quite a meal. As {{a result of the}} complexity, the parliament is really a kind of small city, with much too much to digest in one short three-hour sitting. The Scottish parliament <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> judge: maybe not 50 years but three or four visits, long enough to absorb all the richness and get used to those jumpy black granite guns, the most arbitrary of several questionable ornaments.|$|E

[...] In 1991, with Labour still in opposition and a general election due by June 1992, {{he proposed}} the Commonwealth of Britain Bill, abolishing the monarchy in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a [...] "democratic, federal and secular commonwealth", a republic with a written constitution.
