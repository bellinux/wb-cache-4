5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below its real market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children</b> to come to films without worry.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis began {{shipping}} {{large numbers}} of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz {{in the middle of}} 1942. Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower. They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber.|$|E
5|$|The SS Medical Corps were {{initially}} {{known as the}} Sanitätsstaffel (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office AmtV as the central office for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen-SS physicians. SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalized genocide. At Auschwitz, about three-quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival. In their role as Desinfektoren (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work, and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who decided {{whether or not they}} would be able to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.|$|E

25|$|Teachers, and {{especially}} those who work <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> should realize that students will interact more comfortably with a teacher {{when they are in}} same vertical plane. Used in this way, an understanding of vertical distance can become a tool for improved teacher-student communication. On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} riders who will share a vehicle {{is a key}} unknown. In the U.S., the average car carries 1.16 persons, and most industrialized {{countries}} commonly average below two people; not having to share a vehicle with strangers is a key advantage of private transport. Based on these figures, {{some have suggested that}} two passengers per vehicle (such as with UniModal), or even a single passenger per vehicle is optimum. Other designs use a car for a model, and choose larger vehicles, making it possible to accommodate families <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> riders with bicycles, disabled passengers with wheelchairs, or a pallet or two of freight.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the German {{attempts}} at eradicating the ghetto completely following the uprising, hundreds of Polish Jews remained in hiding when the Auschwitz deportations ended in August 1943. The survivors were smuggled out of the bunkers in small groups by ŻOB members: Fela Kac, Schmuel Ron and Kasia Szancer. Polish rescuers who picked {{them up on the}} 'Aryan' side of the city included Roman Kołodziej, killed for saving Jews on 2 January 1944, and Zofia Klemens arrested by Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp; Klemens survived. She was awarded the title of the Righteous in 1964. The Jews were taken over by the family of Piotr and Karolina Kobylec with their actively helping sons Mieczysław, Alojzy and Wiktor who used to secure food for them, and daughter Klara Banasik, living in nearby Dąbrówka Mała <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children.</b> In total, the Kobylec family rescued over seventy (70) Jews; and received Righteous medals twenty years later.|$|E
25|$|In this role, due {{to their}} working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in {{households}} that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that {{are not able to}} provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, {{as it was in the}} dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.|$|E

500|$|Metro's zero-tolerance {{policy on}} food, trash {{and other sources}} of {{disorder}} embodies the [...] "broken windows" [...] philosophy of crime reduction. This philosophy also extends {{to the use of}} station restroom facilities. A longstanding policy, intended to curb unlawful and unwanted activity, has been to only allow employees to use Metro restrooms. Station managers may make exceptions for passengers <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> the elderly, or the disabled. Metro now allows the use of restrooms by passengers who gain a station manager's permission, except during periods of heightened terror alerts.|$|E

500|$|For the 109 English captives, {{the raid}} {{was only the}} {{beginning}} of their troubles. The raiders intended to take them to Canada, a [...] journey, in the middle of winter. [...] Many of the captives were ill-prepared for this, and the raiders were short on provisions. The raiders consequently engaged in a common practice: they killed those captives when it was clear they were unable to keep up. Williams commented on the savage cruelty of the Indian raiders; although most killings were [...] "not random or wanton," [...] none of those killed would have [...] "needed to" [...] be killed had they not been taken in the first place. [...] Most (though not all) of the slain were the slow and vulnerable who could not keep up with the party and would likely have died less quickly en route. [...] Only 89 of the captives survived the ordeal. Survival chances correlated with age and gender: infants and young children fared the worst, and older children and teenagers (all 21 of whom survived the ordeal) fared the best. [...] Adult men fared better than adult women, especially pregnant women, and those <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children.</b>|$|E

500|$|By late 1941, Adolf Hitler {{decided that}} the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated, so Birkenau, {{originally}} intended to house slave laborers, was re-purposed as a combination labor camp / extermination camp. Prisoners were transported there by rail from all over German-occupied Europe, arriving in daily convoys. By July 1942, the SS were conducting [...] "selections". Incoming Jews were segregated; those deemed able to work were admitted into the camp, and those deemed unfit for labor were immediately killed in the gas chambers. The group selected to die, about three-quarters of the total, included almost all children, women <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children,</b> pregnant women, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit. Mengele, {{a member of the}} team of doctors assigned to do selections, undertook this work even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune.|$|E

50|$|Maltese are bred to be {{companion}} dogs. They {{are extremely}} lively and playful, {{and even as}} a Maltese ages, their energy level and playful demeanor remain fairly constant. Some Maltese may occasionally be snappish <b>with</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>children</b> and should be supervised when playing, although socializing them {{at a young age}} will reduce this habit. They also adore humans, and prefer to stay near them. The Maltese is very active within a house, and, preferring enclosed spaces, does very well <b>with</b> <b>small</b> yards. For this reason, the breed also fares well in apartments and townhouses, and is a prized pet of urban dwellers. Some Maltese may suffer from separation anxiety.|$|R

2500|$|Orthodox {{authorities}} have been careful {{to note that}} although some women <b>with</b> <b>small</b> <b>children</b> have been exempted from praying at specific fixed times, they are not exempted from the obligation of prayer itself. The 19th-century posek Yechiel Michel Epstein, author of the Arukh HaShulkhan, notes: [...] "Even though the rabbis set prayer at fixed times in fixed language, it was not their intention to issue a leniency and exempt women from this ritual act". Traditionally women were also reciting individual tkhine prayers in Yiddish.|$|E
