5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is <b>walking</b> <b>by,</b> Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E
5|$|Whisked {{away from}} her home and her beloved, Sue is in despair until Hal appears outside her window with a ladder. The {{attempted}} elopement fails when the mistress catches Hal in the act and dismisses him. She awaits Sue to descend and round the corner before halting her and forcing her back inside. The father pulls up {{to a place of}} business and Hal, who is <b>walking</b> <b>by,</b> attempts to greet the father. The angry father ignores him, but Hal turns and sees the wigmaker's store next to him. An idea strikes him and he pays a photographer to get a photo of the father on the way out, which further angers him. Hal then sends a message to Sue, that he will come and claim her the following day, disguised as her father.|$|E

25|$|Another {{feature of}} late 20th-century opera is the {{emergence}} of contemporary historical operas, in contrast to the tradition of basing operas on more distant history, the re-telling of contemporary fictional stories or plays, or on myth or legend. The Death of Klinghoffer, Nixon in China and Doctor Atomic by John Adams, Dead Man <b>Walking</b> <b>by</b> Jake Heggie, and Anna Nicole by Mark-Anthony Turnage exemplify the dramatisation on stage of events in recent living memory, where characters portrayed in the opera were alive {{at the time of the}} premiere performance.|$|E

Poirot sees an immediate {{link between the}} two Polish women and the Stymphalean Birds. Poirot promises to help {{and the next day}} he tells Harold that he has been successful and that the blackmailers have been dealt with. He found out by telegram that they were wanted by the police and that they have been arrested. Harold is relieved but suddenly spots the two Polish women and wonders what is going on. Poirot tells him that, although not particularly attractive, they are of good family and background. The true culprits are Mrs Rice and her daughter. 'Philip Clayton' has never existed and the man Harold saw 'killed' was Mrs Rice in disguise. No foreign police are open to bribery in the way that Harold was told. He provided all the money and was innocent of what Mrs Rice 'negotiated' as he didn't speak the language. Harold resolves to learn every European language from now onwards.|$|E

25|$|One pottery {{tradition}} {{unique to}} the community {{is a set of}} figurines called a “juego de aire” (literally “air set”). This is a set of clay figures, which are used in ritual healing, especially of diseases associated with “bad air.” The last craftsperson to preserve the art of making these is Felipa Hernandez Barragan. The set demonstrates a ritual healing scene with one figure, representing the sick person, and another representing the “curandero” or shaman-healer with a bird in his hand at the center. Around them are various animals: a lizard, a millipede, a snake, a bull, a donkey, a spider, a scorpion and a frog, each of which has a cigarette tied to its back. These animals represent the various aspects of nature. Tradition states that certain illnesses are due to “bad air” or to supernatural forces that become offended if certain courtesies are not observed. One of these courtesies is to greet and/or offer food to an ant hill when <b>walking</b> <b>by.</b> Another is to make offering in ravines and other places where water flows. Most of these beliefs have pre-Hispanic roots.|$|E
500|$|After Marge takes Bart on a fieldtrip to Fort Springfield, Bart {{discovers that}} {{the origins of}} Whacking Day, which {{supposedly}} involved Jebediah Springfield, is a lie because it conflicts with a major Revolutionary War battle he took part in, and suggests to Lisa that they lure the snakes to safety by playing music {{with a lot of}} bass and putting the stereo speakers to the ground.

500|$|In a {{scene in}} [...] "Apollo, Apollo", Jack wonders {{what it would be}} like to see the world through NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) eyes, {{revealing}} that Kenneth sees everyone as Muppets. To accommodate this, Sesame Street puppeteers Joey Mazzarino, Carmen Osbahr, and Matt Vogel were brought in to do the muppet versions of Jack, Liz, and Tracy Jordan. This angle would later be used again in the show's fourth season episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show" [...] in which Kenneth appears as a muppet while <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> a high-definition camera. In addition, the program was parodied by Sesame Street, in the show's 39th season, entitled [...] "30 Rocks".|$|E
500|$|Dylan {{begins this}} track with a spoken intro where he {{describes}} the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: [...] "most of the songs that are written uptown in Tin Pan Alley, that's {{where most of the}} folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E
500|$|The video shows Madonna and Višnjić playing chess and {{ultimately}} the singer destroying the chess board, symbolizing an end to their relationship. She then goes <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> the sea, passing a man walking his dog on the beach. Throughout the video, there are scenes of Madonna sitting, singing and slowly dancing {{in front of the}} curtain. The video is color graded to a blue-green tint and the chess scene was inspired by that in the 1968 heist film, The Thomas Crown Affair (with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway). Listing the clip at number 23 on their countdown of [...] "Madonna's 55 Best Videos", Louis Virtel from The Backlot said that the singer looked [...] "startlingly gorgeous, and her throes of agony at video's end occur in only the loveliest, bluest light." ...|$|E

500|$|Tracy's storyline of {{achieving}} EGOT status was first {{mentioned in this}} episode, and would continue throughout the season. In one scene from the episode, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) appears as a Muppet while <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> a high-definition camera, a reference to season three episode [...] "Apollo, Apollo" [...] in which Kenneth sees everyone as muppets. In addition, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) walks by the camera and {{is seen as a}} younger version of himself. The footage shown on the high-definition monitor was extracted from the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October starring Baldwin. This episode was the final time that the show referenced Liz's show Dealbreakers, a story arc that had begun in the third season episode [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] and continued with [...] "Kidney Now!", [...] "Into the Crevasse" [...] and [...] "The Problem Solvers".|$|E
500|$|Robert Patrick makes a cameo {{appearance}} in Wayne's World (1992) as the T-1000 {{character in a}} scene where he pulls Wayne's car over, holds up a photo of John Connor and asks, [...] "Have you seen this boy?", to which Wayne, being presumably a fan of The Terminator franchise and knowing T-1000 as a time-travelling assassin, screams in panic and drives away from him. Patrick also makes a cameo appearance as the T-1000 in Last Action Hero (1993), when he is seen <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> Schwarzenegger as he enters Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. In the same film, actor Sylvester Stallone is featured as the Terminator on a Terminator2 poster instead of Schwarzenegger. In Hot Shots! Part Deux (1993), a caricature of Saddam Hussein is frozen, shattered, and reformed in a direct parody of the T-1000 from the final scene of Terminator2.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{is nearly}} three months long. The number of cubs born can vary from one to eight, though the common number is three to five. Birth {{takes place in a}} {{sheltered}} place such as thick vegetation. Each cub weighs nearly [...] at birth; the eyes, shut at birth, open in 4to 11 days. Newborn cubs can crawl and spit; they can start <b>walking</b> <b>by</b> two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish grey hair. This downy underlying fur, called a [...] "mantle", gives them a Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. A study noted that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the honey badger; this could act as a camouflage in both animals. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable during the first few weeks of their life; mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first month.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of supplemental oxygen on exercise performance was assessed in 17 patients with severe airflow obstruction. Exercise capacity {{was measured by}} the six minute <b>walking</b> distance, <b>by</b> an endurance <b>walking</b> test, and <b>by</b> an endurance cycling test and comparison was made with performance when the patient was breathing air. In addition, the relation between the flow rate of supplemental oxygen and cycling endurance time was studied. Portable oxygen (41 min- 1) carried by the patient increased the mean endurance <b>walking</b> time <b>by</b> 59 % and the six minute <b>walking</b> distance <b>by</b> 17 %. The endurance time for cycling at a constant work load was increased by 51 % with oxygen at a flow rate of 21 min- 1, by 88 % at 41 min- 1, and by 80 % at 61 min- 1. Supplemental oxygen prolonged the length of time that the patients were able to walk at a fixed speed. It also increased the mean speed achieved during a six minute walk but this was variable and did not occur in all the subjects. The benefit from supplemental oxygen was not cancelled by the effort of carrying the portable cylinder...|$|R
