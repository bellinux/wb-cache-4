5|$|Off the Wall is {{the fifth}} album by American singer Michael Jackson, {{released}} on August 10, 1979 in the United States by Epic Records and internationally by CBS Records. It was his nineteenth album in total since Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5 (1969), {{as well as his}} first album released through Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death roughly 30 years later. It was released following Jackson's critically well-received film performance in The Wiz. While <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> project, Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next studio album.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Wever {{began the}} season {{remaining}} with Fort Lauderdale. He had a 73 {{record and a}} 2.00 ERA in 12 games before being promoted to the Nashville Sounds of the Southern League, the Yankees' AA affiliate. With Nashville, he had a 52 record and 2.05 ERA in nine appearances. Wever's pitching coach in Nashville was Hall of Famer Hoyt Wilhelm. Wilhelm felt he had the ability but not the confidence to pitch in the majors, and spent his time in Nashville <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> aspect of Wever's game. The following season, Weber was almost unanimously named to the Southern League All-Star team, thanks to 11 wins and 116 strikeouts {{through the end of}} June. He improved to a 16-6 record, a 2.78 ERA, and 191 strikeouts, won the Southern League Pitcher of the Year award, and accomplished the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. He led Nashville to the Southern League championship, and right after doing so, the Yankees called Wever up to the major leagues.|$|E

25|$|From 1993 to 2001, Rowell starred as Dr. Amanda Bentley in the CBS primetime series Diagnosis: Murder, {{opposite}} Dick Van Dyke, replacing Cynthia Gibb {{from the}} original made-for-television movie. For much of Rowell's stint on Diagnosis: Murder, she was <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> show and on The Young and the Restless simultaneously. One episode of Diagnosis Murder centered around murder {{on the set of}} The Young and the Restless; Rowell was featured as both Amanda and Drucilla in that episode. The series run from 1993 to 2001, producing 178 episodes and two television movies, aired after the series' cancellation. Diagnosis: Murder has also run in syndication as of 1997.|$|E
25|$|Bogan left Hamilton {{not long}} afterward, {{settling}} into working on ranches {{in and around}} the Texas Panhandle. In 1884, Bogan was a ring leader in a cowboy's strike for better wages, which ended in all who took part being blacklisted, finding themselves unable to work in the Panhandle. Bogan rode to Wilbarger County, Texas, and joined up for a cattle drive as a drover, working for the Worsham R-2 Ranch. Cowboy T. J Burkett, also <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> drive, would years later comment that Bogan was a valuable hand to have, and that one night during a fierce thunderstorm, Bogan alone was able to hold 600 head of cattle from breaking into stampede. When the drive reached Dodge City, Kansas, and the cowboys were paid, they commenced to drink and party. Believing they were getting out of hand, Town Marshal Jack Bridges and his deputies confronted them and ran them out of town. This resulted in a brief gunfight between the lawmen and the cowboys, during which cowboy John Briley was shot and killed. Bogan and Burkett were both involved in that escapade, and the cowboys took no action in retaliation.|$|E

500|$|One {{of their}} collaborations was [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{and like most}} songs on Music, it is bright and {{uplifting}} in its composition, and was described by Madonna as [...] "downright silly". She explained that they [...] "were <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> song and I thought, 'Oh, fuck it, let's just have fun', Life would be such a drag if we were deep and probing all the time." [...] The song {{was intended to be}} released as the fourth single off Music but Warner Bros., Madonna's recording company, wanted [...] "Amazing" [...] to be the next single. Madonna felt that [...] "Amazing" [...] was too similar to her previous single [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] (1999), and wanted the more eclectic and futuristic [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] so they were in a deadlock.|$|E
500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode about {{baseball}} for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if this guy was an alien? and I just started <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> idea." [...] Duchovny later said that [...] "these happy chronological coincidences" [...] facilitated the development of the story. Duchovny worked on his idea alone, later admitting that he was satisfied that he did not receive any help.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{evolved from}} Ultimate Play the Game, {{which was founded}} in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire by former arcade game {{developers}} Tim and Chris Stamper. After multiple critically and commercially successful releases including Jetpac, Atic Atac, Sabre Wulf, and Knight Lore, Ultimate Play The Game was among one of the biggest UK-based video game development companies. The ZX Spectrum home computer, the platform the company usually developed games for, was only popular in the UK, and they believed that <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> platform would not be beneficial to the company's growth as they considered it a [...] "dead end". Meanwhile, the company inspected an imported console from Japan, the Famicom, and believed that it would be an ideal future platform of choice for the company as it was more sophisticated than the Spectrum, had a worldwide market, and its cartridges had no load times. As a result, Rare was established in 1985. Its main goal was to reverse-engineer the console and investigate the codes for Famicom's games {{to learn more about the}} console's programming. With successful results, the company decided to sell the Ultimate brand to U.S. Gold, and ceased games development for the ZX Spectrum in the following year.|$|E

500|$|By January 5, 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, [...] "Hey Joe", {{backed with}} [...] "Stone Free", peaked at number six on the UK record chart. [...] "Hey Joe" [...] {{was not a}} Hendrix {{composition}} – {{it was written by}} Billy Roberts and recorded by several groups prior to the Experience. Hendrix commented, [...] "That record isn't us. The next one's gonna be different. [...] We're working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff." [...] The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including [...] "Can You See Me", [...] "Foxy Lady", [...] "Third Stone from the Sun", [...] "Red House", and [...] "Remember". [...] In the middle of December, producer Chas Chandler heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. [...] "I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out. I told him to keep <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> saying, 'That's the next single!'" [...] Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of [...] "Purple Haze" [...] in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig. In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers of the Macintosh Classic {{focused on}} the {{processor}} performance and lack of expansion slots. Liza Schafer of Home Office Computing praised the Classic's ease of use and price, but criticized the [...] display because a full US letter page ( [...] × 11inches) would not fit at full size, and warned those who required high-end graphics and desktop publishing capabilities against buying the Classic. Schafer concluded: [...] "The Classic's value is more impressive than its performance, but its performance will get you <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> novel, database, or spreadsheet." [...] PC Week criticized {{the lack of a}} faster processor, stating, [...] "The 7.8MHz speed is adequate for text applications and limited graphics work, but it is not suitable for power users. As such, the Classic is appropriate as a home computer or for limited computing on the road." [...] Similarly, PC Users review concluded, [...] "The slow processor and lack of expansion slots on the Macintosh Classic offset the low prices". MacWEEK described it as a [...] "fine, inexpensive replacement for the Macintosh Plus that best embodies the original Macintosh vision {{six and a half years}} later". Computer Gaming World was more skeptical, doubting that consumers would purchase a black-and-white computer with no hard drive that was only slightly faster than the Mac Plus.|$|E
500|$|After {{positive}} {{reviews from}} the heavy metal {{press and the}} release of the album Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992) on Earache Records, Sleep's label announced that they would release their follow-up record. Sleep had been touring in Europe with Cathedral and in the United States with Hawkwind in support of Sleep's Holy Mountain when the group felt they had to write new material. The new album {{was going to be an}} hour-long song. This song was written and practiced at sound checks, motel rooms and in friends' houses. Matt Pike said the songwriting process was long and that they were [...] "working on [...] for like four years. We also had two other songs that were <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> were really long, too—like 15 and 20 minutes. But we never recorded them." [...] Al Cisneros stated that smoking cannabis was important to the song's creative process: [...] "I was really dependent on the space I got into when I was using it, and some of the lyrics are about that...The line, 'Drop out of life ,' was kind of a creed at that point." [...] The song was originally known and performed live under the title [...] "Dopesmoker". After their tour, the group began to be interested in a Middle Eastern desert theme which led to Sleep referring to the song as [...] "Jerusalem" [...] during later practice sessions.|$|E

Ramón Rodríguez was {{initially}} planned {{to be in the}} film, in a role bigger than the one he had in Revenge of the Fallen, but he was dropped during early production. Shia LaBeouf stated that this would be his last film in the series, also concluding that director Michael Bay will not return for a fourth installment, though it was later confirmed that Bay would return as director in the fourth film. A few well-known actors such as John Malkovich and Frances McDormand also gained selected roles for the film. Malkovich explains: [...] "I play a guy called Bruce Brazos, who's just a loudmouth, kind of business man who's Shia's character's boss. Who's just a jerk, and a kind of a loud one. But a fun character. Nice. It was fun. Very, very enjoyable, just with Shia, Rosie a little bit, and with John Turturro. So, for me, it was a blast." [...] Another well-known actor, Ken Jeong, was cast as an eccentric co-worker and stalker. Jeong described the film, [...] "Yeah, it's a small role in Transformers but yeah. I had an out of body experience <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> one because I just couldn't believe I was there. Still, that was not a thing where oh, I'm {{going to be a part}} of a blockbuster franchise like Transformers 3 or even now Hangover 2 for that matter. So I can't believe I'm a part of these franchises in any way. It was amazing. Michael Bay is brilliant and it'll blow your mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the team's {{prominent}} appearances are on {{the television}} series, there have been additional media appearances based around marketing tie-ins. In early 2007, Oliver Queen received a personal treatment with a promotional tie-in with Sprint, titled Smallville Legends: The Oliver Queen Chronicles. The series looked at the origins of Oliver's alternate identity. On April 19, 2007, a tie-in with Toyota promoting their new Yaris featured an online comic strip as interstitial programs during new episodes of Smallville—titled Smallville Legends: Justice & Doom. The interactive comic {{was based on the}} episode [...] "Justice", and picks up after the events of that episode, following Oliver, Bart, Victor and Arthur, as they seek to destroy all of LuthorCorp's secret experimental labs. The team eventually uncovers a prototype soldier LuthorCorp is <b>working</b> <b>on,</b> <b>that</b> combines the superpowers of various kryptonite enhanced individuals and places them into a single soldier. The online comic then directly ties-into the television series when Oliver and his team, off-screen, contact Clark in the episode Prototype, and tell him how to defeat one of these soldiers. The online series allowed viewers to investigate alongside the fictional team in an effort to win prizes. Stephan Nilson wrote all five episodes, while working with a team of artists for the illustrations. The plot for each comic episode would be given to Nilson {{at the same time the}} production crew for Smallville was filming their current television episode. Artist Steve Scott would draw comic book panels, which would be sent to a group called Motherland. That group would review the drawings and tell Scott which images to draw on a separate overlay. This allowed for multiple objects to be moved in and out of the same frame. Before and after the first appearance of the League on Smallville, there were talks among studio heads about spinning off individual characters, or the entire team, into their own television shows, but nothing came to fruition. Smallville is the first series—television or film—to feature live-action portrayals of Aquaman, Green Arrow, and Cyborg.|$|E

I've learned a lot from them", and he explained that he was <b>working</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> day with Mandler, someone he respects and looks up to. On the video, Drake said, [...] "We talked colors, we talked epic, emotion-evoking visuals." [...] He called the story of the video interesting and the song tells [...] "sort of a love story". He explained that the video {{has a lot to do}} with his debut album, stating [...] "The album is about finding love, feeling 'Have I sold my soul' as far as 'Will I ever be able to gain the trust of a woman? Will I only be able to be around the dark, evil women? Will I ever find that pure love?' Those elements are in the video." [...] In a separate interview on his Away From Home Tour, with MTV News, Drake said the video takes the song to [...] "another place". He said it offers up a different look to the song. He explained, [...] "This video is what I was really thinking about. The song is like a bad dream — but it's not a bad dream, it's not a terrible dream. It's a little evil. The video really reflects that. It's a struggle between the purities of my past life and what this new life has to offer. Even in the video, you see me looking back and forth between the two and deciding. At the end of the video I don't necessarily make a decision, but when you get the album, you'll see what choice I make." ...|$|E
