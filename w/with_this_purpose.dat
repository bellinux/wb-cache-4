2500|$|In {{order for}} thought {{suppression}} and its effectiveness to be studied, researchers {{have had to}} find methods of recording the processes {{going on in the}} mind. One experiment designed <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>purpose</b> was performed by Wegner, Schneider, Carter & White. They asked participants to avoid thinking of a specific target (e.g. a white bear) for five minutes, but if they did, they were told then to ring a bell. After this, participants were told that for the next five minutes they were to think about the target. There was evidence that unwanted thoughts occurred more frequently in those who used thought suppression compared to those who were not. Furthermore, there was also evidence that during the second stage, those who had used thought suppression had a higher frequency of target thoughts than did those who hadn't used thought suppression; later coined the rebound effect. This effect has been replicated and can even be done with implausible targets, such as the thought of a [...] "green rabbit". From these implications, Wegner eventually developed the [...] "ironic process theory".|$|E

Webster's position differed from Madison's: Webster asserted that the people of the United States acted as one aggregate body, Madison held that the people of the several states had acted collectively. John Rowan spoke against Webster on that issue, and Madison wrote, congratulating Webster, but explaining his own position. The debate presented the fullest articulation of the differences over nullification, and 40,000 copies of Webster’s response, which concluded with [...] "liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable”, were distributed nationwide.|$|E
