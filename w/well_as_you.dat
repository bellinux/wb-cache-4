As <b>well</b> <b>as,</b> <b>you</b> will see… like, for example, Johnny, we could have maybe 10 Johnnys at the same time singing, or playing football. So, the decision have to be made at the time when we actually doing choreography, ‘cause I’ll be doing choreography, as well I’ll be in it only one time, that’s it, as Johnny." [...] He mentioned the plans again during a 2016 interview describing his idea for it to be a [...] "musical slash comedy." ...|$|E

B-10 wishes his counterpart <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>you</b> can see, B-10 is still alive. B-10 is hoping for a good result," [...] followed by laughter. In another sequence, one researcher is heard to say: [...] "You better hope the ... anti-vivisection people don't get a hold of this film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blade Runner sold well, {{but due to}} high {{development}} costs, {{the profit}} margin was low. According to Louis Castle, [...] "The mere fact it was four CDs made it a very expensive game. And the deal we had with the Blade Runner Partnership meant it was not terribly profitable. It didn't do as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> might think." [...] Although Virgin were interested in doing a sequel, if a sequel were approved, the Blade Runner Partnership intended to increase the licensing fee. Ultimately, Westwood and Virgin concluded the cost of producing a game to top the original, coupled with the increased cost for licensing, made {{the prospect of a}} sequel economically untenable, as such a sequel would have to sell several million units to generate what would be considered an acceptable profit. In 2009, the Blade Runner Partnership offered Gearbox Software the rights to the franchise, but production costs were estimated at $35 million and the project was scrapped.|$|E

2500|$|The {{presentation}} attracted wide acclaim. USGamer {{described the}} graphics as the [...] "pinnacle" [...] of the series' pixel-era career. COG Connected wrote that although pixelated 2D graphics are [...] "inherently nostalgic", the older Sonic games had never looked [...] "quite this good". GameSpot praised the animations and detail as {{superior to the}} original games, writing that they added an extra layer of personality. Cubed3 described the levels as stylish and vibrant. Critics also praised the Sonic Manias attention to detail to its source material. Game Informer wrote that its gameplay was [...] "nearly indistinguishable" [...] from its Genesis predecessors, but with [...] "extra polish". Easy Allies wrote that the game emulated the original games [...] "exceptionally", and that [...] "running, jumping, and spin dashing all work exactly as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> would hope". Twinfinite praised game's references to older Sonic games without [...] "beating fans {{over the head with}} it". Metro wrote that the game was filled with fanservice, and likened it to a school project [...] "gone wild, something enthusiastic kids have made while the teacher was away and which far surpasses anything they were actually supposed to be doing".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2009, Steel {{auditioned for}} the third series of Britain's Got Talent. In her first {{televised}} appearance, she began her number ballet dancing to [...] "I Could Have Danced All Night" [...] from the musical My Fair Lady, then, as judge Simon Cowell started {{to reach for the}} red rejection buzzer, she began singing the song with an unexpectedly powerful voice. She received a standing ovation from the audience and the approval of all four judges. Piers Morgan told Steel, [...] "We have seen a lot of children on our show over the past three series and I have never heard any of them sing as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do". [...] Kelly Brook was in tears and called her performance, [...] "beautiful and lovely". Media reports at the time claimed that Steel had referred to Cowell as a bully for critical comments he made after her first appearance on the show; however, a blog at a Lancashire newspaper's web site that was attributed to Steel and her mother denied that she had ever made such a comment. Commentators and mainstream media outlets speculated that she might defeat Susan Boyle, who had made an impression worldwide in the first show of the series. [...] Over thirteen million viewers watched Steel's performance and, within one day of a video of her performance being posted on YouTube, over a million viewers had seen her worldwide. She was interviewed on US television via satellite link during NBC's Today show.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{listeners}} associate Klemperer {{with slow}} tempos, but recorded evidence now available on compact disc {{shows that in}} earlier years his tempi could be quite a bit faster; the late recordings give a misleading impression. For example, one of Klemperer's most noted performances was of Beethoven's Symphony No. 3, Eroica. Eric Grunin's Eroica Project contains tempo data on 363 recordings of the work from 1924–2007, and includes 10 by Klemperer [...] some recorded in the studio, most from broadcasts of live concerts. The earliest Klemperer performance on tape was recorded in concert in Cologne in 1954 (when he was 69 years old); the last was in London with the New Philharmonia Orchestra in 1970 (when he was 85). The passing years show a clear trend with respect to tempo: as Klemperer aged, he took slower tempi. In 1954, his first movement lasts 15:18 from beginning to end; in 1970 it lasts 18:41. In 1954 the main tempo of the first movement was about 135 beats per minute, in 1970 it had slowed to about 110 beats per minute. In 1954, the Eroica second movement, [...] "Funeral March", had a timing of 14:35; in 1970, it had slowed to 18:51. Similar slowings {{took place in the}} other movements. Around 1954, Herbert von Karajan flew especially to hear Klemperer conduct a performance of the Eroica, and later he said to him: [...] "I have come only to thank you, and say that I hope I shall live to conduct the Funeral March as <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have done".|$|E
