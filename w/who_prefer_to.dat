25|$|The Albanian Urban Lyric Song is a {{tradition}} that started in Albania in the 18th century but culminated in the 1930s. These songs are {{a major part of}} Albania's music heritage, but have been little-studied by ethnomusicologists, <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> focus on the rural folk music that they see as being more authentically Albanian.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side {{there are some people}} <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> attend private {{institutions}} because they don't trust in the public educational infrastructure they have near their residential area. This could be related with overcrowded classes, bad reputation, criminality levels, incidence of ethnic minorities generally considered problematic, lack of quality teaching staff or bad infrastructures in that specific institution.|$|E
25|$|For those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> enjoy nature {{from the}} comfort of a chair, the city's public library is nestled in a serene and scenic {{location}} at the edge of Old Mill Park where visitors may relax indoors near the wood-burning fireplace and view the redwood forest through the library's multi-storied windows, or from the outside deck which overlooks the park and Cascade Creek.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary Tongans {{often have}} {{strong ties to}} {{overseas}} lands. They may have been migrant workers in New Zealand, or have lived and traveled in New Zealand, Australia, or the United States. Many Tongans now live overseas, in a Tongan diaspora, and send home remittances to family members (often aged) <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> remain in Tonga. Tongans themselves often have to operate in two different contexts, which they often call anga fakatonga, the traditional Tongan way, and anga fakapālangi, the Western way. A culturally adept Tongan learns both sets of rules and when to switch between them.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{the islanders}} are about evenly split between those favouring {{independence}} and those <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> continue {{as a part}} of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate unilateral declaration of independence. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the Danish nation. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.|$|E
25|$|Private {{entities}} {{also offer}} many transportation services. I-GO and Zipcar have several locations in Lakeview. Private companies offer trolley and bus services to certain destinations {{in the city}} from Lakeview. Taxi and limousine services are plentiful in the Lakeview area, as well as non-traditional modes of transportation. Bicycle rickshaws can be found especially near Wrigley Field. Bike paths are also available on some major streets.

25|$|Presolar grains are {{interstellar}} {{solid matter}} {{in the form of}} tiny solid grains that originated at a time before the Sun was formed (presolar: before the Sun). Meteoriticists often use the term to represent stardust, grains that originated within a single star and which they extract from meteorites for study. Because most interstellar grains are not stardust from a single star, however, being instead interstellar cloud matter accreted by smaller presolar grains, most presolar grains are also not stardust. Logically, all stardust are presolar grains; but not all presolar grains are stardust. This confusing terminology is heavily entrenched among 21st century meteoriticists <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> use the terms interchangeably, however, so it is best to live with both usages or to write presolar stardust grains for stardust.|$|E
500|$|Gardeners <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{pesticides}} {{may encourage}} mantises {{in the hope}} of controlling insect pests. However, mantises do not have key attributes of biological pest control agents; they do not specialize in a single pest insect, and do not multiply rapidly in response to an increase in such a prey species, but are general predators. They eat whatever they can catch, including both harmful and beneficial insects. They therefore have [...] "negligible value" [...] in biological control.|$|E
500|$|The {{defendants}} denied {{all charges}} and {{maintained that the}} accusations were politically motivated. In a joint statement, they held that [...] "our only crime was that during the unrest earlier this year, we were outspoken witnesses to the bloodshed and the brutal treatment by the security forces." [...] Bahraini MP Jamal Fakhro responded that Bahrain jails only [...] "people <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> play politics rather than be doctors", not [...] "doctors who treat people". A spokesman for Bahrain's Information Affairs Authority stated that the health workers were fabricating their stories {{and that they were}} [...] "collaborating with the hard liners" [...] in [...] "an attempted coup d'etat".|$|E

5000|$|Both {{classes are}} of equal size {{and would be}} {{considered}} [...] "regular". [...] "Goofy" [...] would describe riders whose trick preferences do not match their footedness: a rider <b>who</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> grind {{on the opposite side}} as do most is considered a [...] "goofy grinder"; one <b>who</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> turn the opposite direction in mid-air as do most is considered a [...] "goofy spinner". Few riders have either goofy trait, but some riders may have both.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{performers}} <b>who</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>to</b> be called [...] "gender illusionists" [...] who do blur {{the line between}} transgender and drag queen. Generally transgender performers do not consider themselves to be drag queens and drag queens don't consider themselves to be illusionists, but, as with everything, there are exceptions. Often these distinctions are more generational, as laws and acceptance of individuality change and grow.|$|E

Unless otherwise indicated, all album instrumentation, vocals and lyrics are written and performed by Nyte, who describes his goals of live performance as [...] "a ritual - type experience based on theatrical on-stage appearance and performance." [...] He further describes the [...] "elements of passion, beauty, poetry and theatrics" [...] as the cornerstones of live shows.|$|E
