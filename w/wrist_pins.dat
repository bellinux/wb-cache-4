5000|$|Oldsmobile {{used the}} popular LV2, a 307 CID L engine, {{commonly}} {{known by the}} VIN code [...] "Y", from 1980-1990. It was used by every domestic GM automobile marque. Roller lifters, floating piston <b>wrist</b> <b>pins,</b> and swirl port intake runners were added in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|When used {{to retain}} piston <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> /gudgeon pins the clips {{are known as}} wrist pin clips or wrist pin {{retainers}} or gudgeon pin clips [...] The most commonly used circlip for this application is a simple spring steel circlip , or plain wire ring.|$|E
5000|$|As <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> and pistons rely for {{lubrication}} {{and cooling}} respectively, {{on the oil}} being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.|$|E

50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is acted upon by {{the pressure of the}} expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This force then acts downwards through the connecting rod and onto the crankshaft. The connecting rod is attached to the piston by a swivelling gudgeon <b>pin</b> (US: <b>wrist</b> <b>pin).</b> This pin is mounted within the piston: unlike the steam engine, there is no piston rod or crosshead (except big two stroke engines).|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus {{engine was}} revised in 1917 with the barrels and pistons {{lengthened}} by {{a quarter of}} an inch and the piston <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> relocated below the piston center. This was done to reduce the occurrence of piston slap. The valve caps in the cylinder head were finned from 1917 until the end of production.|$|R

In its preferred embodiment, a one piece, tubular, closed-ended, knitted preform (a sock) of carbon fibers embedded within the matrix of the piston structure forms the crown, side wall, skirt and inner surface of the piston, and wrap-interlock preforms strengthen the piston crown and <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> bosses...|$|R
50|$|The AMB series {{engine was}} an inline 4-cylinder engine, {{manufactured}} from 2001 to 2003 by the Volkswagen Group in Ingolstadt, Germany {{as a replacement}} for the earlier 1.8T engines, such as the AEB-type engine. As opposed to the AEB, the AMB had thinner <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> (19 mm instead of 20 mm). The AMB engine was used in a variety of Volkswagens and Audis, as well as being used by companies owned by Volkswagen, such as the Spanish car manufacturer, SEAT. The engine was available {{in a wide variety of}} configurations and was mounted longitudinally in most Audi applications, and horizontally in most other applications. The engine came coupled with a variety of transmissions including a 5- or 6-speed manual, a 5-speed automatic, and a CVT (continuously variable transmission) for front-wheel drive vehicles only. The engine was also coupled with Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive. In 2003 it was replaced by slightly higher powered versions such as the AUM.|$|E
5000|$|Two Special Edition {{versions}} of the Z31 generation model were produced; a 50th Anniversary Edition celebrated the company's semi-centennial in 1984 and offered additional luxury features, and a [...] "Shiro Special", released four years later, with performance-oriented upgrades. Unlike its predecessors, the Z31 featured a V6 engine in the 200Z/ZS/ZG, 300ZX and 300ZR, and the only Z31 to come with an Inline 6 cylinder engine was the Fairlady 200ZR which was only available in Japan. The new V6 (2960 cc) Single overhead cam engine was available as a naturally aspirated VG30E or a turbocharged VG30ET producing [...] and [...] respectively. The engine was either a type A or type B sub-designation from 1984 to March 1987, while models from April 1987 to 1989 had a W sub-designation. The W-series engines featured redesigned water jackets for additional cooling, and fully floating piston <b>wrist</b> <b>pins.</b> The 1984 to 1987 turbo models featured a Garrett T3 turbocharger with a 7.8:1 compression ratio, whereas 1988 to 1989 models featured a low inertia T25 turbocharger with an increased 8.3:1 compression ratio and slightly more power—165 hp naturally aspirated and [...] turbocharged. Finally, these engines were equipped with self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters. The transmissions were a 5-speed manual or an optional 4-speed automatic (all Z31 automatics were the E4N71B equipped with torque-converter lockup including turbo models). All Z31s were equipped with a Nissan R200 rear differential, April 1987 and later turbo models received an R200 clutch limited-slip differential except 1988 Shiro Specials which had a Viscous-type limited slip. There were three trim models available: SF, GL and GLL. The SF model was only available in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E
50|$|The {{unique design}} of this bikes piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> and piston diameter measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|R
50|$|In 1912 Italian {{engineer}} Adalberto Garelli patented a split {{single engine}} which used a single connecting rod and long <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> which passed through both pistons. His company, Garelli Motorcycles, produced a 346 cc version {{for use in}} motorcycles for road use and for racing. Production continued until 1926, by which time Garelli was increasingly concentrating on the military market. Garelli motorcycles remained in business until the late 1990s, {{but they did not}} further develop or produce these engines.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes, {{especially}} with engines {{that have had}} a lot of use, the piston / conrod ball socket joint is very loose and will adversely affect performance. A Cox “reset” tool, available for the [...]010, 020, 049/051 and the 09 series engines, is used to tighten the ball joint back up again. The correct free play is [...]001 to [...]003 inches. The [...]15 engines use a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> so a socket reset tool is not required for these.|$|R
40|$|Compressors {{are being}} {{required}} to operate at increasingly severe conditions {{in order to increase}} efficiency, and with the transition from CFC to HFC and natural refrigerants, natural ferrous chloride layers on iron surfaces have been eliminated. To recover lost wear resistance with the transition to oil-less operation, greater protection is sought through the application of hard coatings with enhanced tribological properties. Controlled shoe-on-disk experiments simulating the interface in a swashplate compressor were performed using a High Pressure Tribometer under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included 52100 steel shoes and coated aluminum A 390 -T 6 disks. Coatings were provided by two leading manufacturers and consisted of two different single layer WC/C coatings (one from each manufacturer), multi-layer WC/C + DLC and multi-layer TiAlN + WC/C. To help increase load bearing ability on the relatively soft aluminum, a CrN underlayer was deposited on half of the disks. The performance of the coatings was evaluated using surface profilometry and scanning electron microscopy. In some cases, the CrN underlayer increased friction due to increased roughness, while it also significantly increased the load bearing capability in most applications. One of the CrN + WC/C multilayered coatings exhibited friction coefficients similar to lubricated experiments with scuffing loads roughly ten times larger than uncoated, unlubricated tests. Controlled, reciprocating pin-on-disk experiments imitating the wrist pin-connecting rod interface were also performed under unlubricated conditions. Specimens used for these experiments included coated, cylindrical 52100 steel <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> and uncoated cast iron disks. Coatings used were the same as those for the swashplate simulation tests but without the CrN underlayer. Analysis of experiments investigating temperature effects, frequency variation, and performance in various refrigerants including R 134 a, R 410 a, and R 600 a, was completed using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis, and surface profilometry. It was found that steady-state friction coefficients decreased with increasing temperature while friction coefficients increased during the running-in period. Also, wear decreased from testing in room temperature up to 80 ??C and beyond that, increased due to unstable running-in. Tests conducted in R 410 a produced the lowest wear, while those in R 600 a had the lowest friction coefficients. Tests in R 134 a performed the worst, but better than tests conducted in dry nitrogen. Based on the research presented in this work, hard coatings have the potential to replace oil in future compressors. Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Project 17...|$|E
5000|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, the gudgeon <b>pin</b> (UK, <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> US) connects the piston to the connecting rod {{and provides a}} bearing for the connecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves.

50|$|Under ideal {{engineering}} conditions, {{force is}} applied directly {{in the line of}} travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume combustion cycles. It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> and near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.|$|R

50|$|Finally, in 1993 Ford made {{available}} a turbocharged {{edition of the}} 7.3L. An internally wastegated, AR.82 Garrett T3 series turbo {{was used as the}} OEM for the factory turbocharger system. The system was tuned to minimize performance loss at high elevation, rather than to improve peak performance. A primary limiting factor to the performance potential of the engine is an incredibly restrictive stock down-pipe. It is commonly believed, but not officially verified, that this is deliberate and due to Ford's impending release of the T444E (Powerstroke) engine. Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements. Pistons had an enlarged primary compression ring, added intermediate ring, an enlarged ring land and <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> as well as an anodized piston face.

50|$|What {{distinguished}} the Clerget {{rotary engine}} from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rhône) {{was that the}} Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> to block heat transfer from the combustion area to {{the lower part of}} the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals.
