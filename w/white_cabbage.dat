Vegetable crops grown all year round include <b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> flowering cabbage, lettuce, Chinese kale, radish, leaf mustard, spring onion and chive. Spinach, watercress, and matrimony vine are produced in the cooler months. Yardlong beans, water spinach, amaranth, cucumber, and several species of Chinese gourd are produced in summer. A wide range of temperate vegetables including tomato, sweet pepper, cauliflower, carrot, and celery are grown in winter.|$|E
500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, <b>white</b> <b>cabbage,</b> carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Crops {{belonging}} to the Brassica genus are widely grown in Turkey. Cabbages {{are one of the}} most important Brassica vegetable crops in Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine similarities and differences regarding morphological variation of <b>white</b> head <b>cabbage</b> (Brassica oleracea var. capitata subvar. alba) genetic resources collected from different eco-geographical regions of Turkey. Data from field experiments conducted between 1999 and 2001 were analysed by multiple variance analysis. Cluster analysis based on 12 quantitative and 10 qualitative variables identified 10 groups. The dendogram was prepared to evaluate morphological similarity between the <b>white</b> head <b>cabbage</b> geno-types. Morphological variability is high among the <b>white</b> head <b>cabbage</b> genotypes of Turkey. As a con-clusion, the genotypes evaluated in this study dis-play a wide diversity of characters for selection and combination of interesting genotypes for important characters to obtain improved varieties.

50|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} not only an {{activator}} of male sexual behavior: Its absence may also stop an approaching male and his attempt to copulate. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies are not always receptive to male <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies and to communicate this message, they assume the mate refusal posture. This behavior consists of opening the wings and straightening the abdomen. Opening of the wings in this manner exposes the dorsal side of the female wings which are known to be unable to reflect ultraviolet light. In effect, females are removing the ultraviolet signal that initiates male sexual behavior, resulting in the abrupt halt of male sexual behavior. Female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies take advantage of the personal butterfly ultraviolet communication system to also reject males by removing an ultraviolet reflectance signal.|$|E

50|$|Pieris brassicae, {{the large}} white, also called cabbage {{butterfly}}, cabbage <b>white,</b> <b>cabbage</b> moth (erroneously), or in India the large cabbage white, is a butterfly {{in the family}} Pieridae. It is a close relative of the small white, Pieris rapae.|$|E
50|$|<b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies, Pieris rapae crucivora, {{use their}} private {{ultraviolet}} communication system to initiate mating behavior. In this species, ultraviolet reflection is sexually dimorphic with females exhibiting {{the ability to}} reflect ultraviolet light of 380 nm to 400 nm and males being less able to reflect UV. Males who perceive an ultraviolet reflection from a female initiate a courtship behavior that involves approaching the female and attempting to copulate. Females communicate their receptivity to males using their ultraviolet communication system. The ultraviolet reflection {{is thought to be}} concentrated to the ventral side of a female’s hind wing. Yoshiaki Obara determined this experimentally by comparing the number of approaches to different parts of butterfly wings. The results showed that the female’s ventral hind wing was the greatest releaser of male sexual behavior. Although ultraviolet reflectance releases the sexual behavior, the strongest reflection of UV light is not the strongest releaser for the behavior. As a result, male <b>white</b> <b>cabbage</b> butterflies must have a preference for a certain level of UV reflectance from females. Using a private ultraviolet communication system, female <b>White</b> <b>Cabbage</b> Butterflies signal their receptivity and initiate male mating behavior.|$|E
