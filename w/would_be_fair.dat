5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for throwing in 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for throwing in a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E
5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles {{for which it is}} expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair.</b> To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

25|$|In {{light of}} the {{government}} announcement, the patients of the Mutual Aid Society decided {{to ask for a}} new compensation agreement with Chisso and submitted the demand on 6 October. The company replied that it was unable to judge what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> compensation and asked the national government to set up a binding arbitration committee to decide. This proposal split the members of the patients' society, many of whom were extremely wary of entrusting their fate to a third party, as they had done in 1959 with unfortunate results. At a meeting on 5 April 1969, the opposing views within the society could not be reconciled and the organisation split into the arbitration group (who were willing to accept binding arbitration) and the litigation group (who decided to sue the company). That summer, Chisso sent gifts to the families who opted for arbitration rather than litigation.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Alex Borstein, under the pen name of [...] "a.bo", and {{directed}} by Zac Moncrief. The story {{is based on a}} one-woman show Borstein worked on, entitled Women and Jews: Why We'll Never Be President. The storyline came out when she felt that a woman [...] "will never be president," [...] stating, [...] "I had these fantasies about a woman president that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> and there'd be no corruption. That's a bunch of bullshit fantasy." [...] Borstein called the episode [...] "kind of my homage to Hillary Clinton." [...] The staff enjoyed the episode's storyline so much, that Borstein and fellow writer Cherry Chevapravatdumrong wrote a novelization of the episode. Borstein called the book a [...] "companion piece poking fun" [...] at Clinton's book It Takes a Village.|$|E
500|$|The American team {{consisted}} of semi-professional players, {{most of whom}} had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr {{was a high school}} teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as letter carrier or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The team had also been hastily assembled, and had only been able to train together once, and that was the day before they left for Brazil, which happened to be against the touring English team featuring Matthews (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom were U.S. citizens—had been added to the roster just before that game. [...] "We have no chance," [...] recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players [...] "sheep ready to be slaughtered".

500|$|Famously, when Commander Lord Cochrane {{captured}} the 32-gun Spanish frigate El Gamo in the 14-gun sloop [...] a promotion {{was the usual}} reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to argue {{that it would have}} been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. Unfortunately for Cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the French and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. A court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including Cochrane's, it was only a formality. It was only when Cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. Unfortunately the commander thought that the First Lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. Cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. These solicitations may have had a negative effect on Cochrane's career as it is possible that Jervis became irritated by them.|$|E
500|$|The final {{piece in}} what Bowie called his [...] "triptych", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient {{nature of the}} other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places {{incorporating}} Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: [...] "Boys Keep Swinging" [...] entailed band members swapping instruments, [...] "Move On" [...] used the chords from Bowie's early composition [...] "All the Young Dudes" [...] played backwards, and [...] "Red Money" [...] took backing tracks from [...] "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> to call it Bowie's Sergeant Pepper... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." [...] As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, [...] "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno." [...] Lodger reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles [...] "Boys Keep Swinging" [...] and [...] "DJ". Towards {{the end of the}} year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, you have just made your first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E
