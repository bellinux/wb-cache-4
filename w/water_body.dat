5|$|During {{their time}} in Africa, Krapf and Rebmann worked {{their way into the}} {{interior}} of the continent. They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa, including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes. The finding of one especially large lake (Uniamési) is depicted in a map known as the 'Slug' map. It was known by this name because the layout of the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to {{a week and a}} half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by <b>water</b> <b>body,</b> growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E

As explained by MA (2005) and Costanza et al. (1997), we considered the tangible and intangible benefits provided by an ecosystem as provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services that people derived from four ecosystems mainly forest, agro-ecosystem, seasonal and perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Because of the seasonal variation affecting the <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> we classified rain fed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> into seasonal and perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Seasonal rain influencing fresh <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> like inundation are considered as seasonal <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> excluding seasonal influences are considered as perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Survey questions mainly focused on (i) dependency on ES by communities for their livelihood, (ii) community’s perception on state of LULCC and ES and (iii) long term changes over the flow {{of goods and services}} derived from these four ecosystems.|$|R
5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The {{upper part of}} the watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, and part of Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major <b>water</b> <b>body</b> in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters spend around 10% {{of their}} day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning {{behaviour}} helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and then returning to a perch to preen.|$|E
5|$|Cotters Pond {{is a small}} {{landmark}} located {{beyond a}} few mountains and hills on the southern side of NY74 {{near the end of}} Paradox Lake. Cotters Pond, by state law, is a <b>water</b> <b>body</b> that cannot be used for baitfishing. This was designated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Shortly afterward, NY74 passes Bumbo Pond and enters the hamlet of Paradox. After leaving Paradox, NY74 turns to the southeast along the base of Skiff Mountain. The highway then approaches a creek that flows into Eagle Lake. NY74 crosses over Eagle Lake and runs along the base of Eagle Cliff and the shores of the lake. After leaving Eagle Lake, the highway intersects with County Route2 (CR2), the first numbered highway that NY74 encounters after US9.|$|E
40|$|Convexity is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} basic descriptors of shapes. In this study, the characterization of the convexity of simulated droughts and floods of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is performed. First, concepts of mathematical morphology employed to generate simulated droughts and floods of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The average convexity measures of the generated simulated droughts and floods are computed. It is observed that droughting reduces the convexity of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> while flooding increases the convexity of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> A power law relationship is observed between the average convexity measures of the simulated droughts/floods and the level of droughting/flooding and areas of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> The scaling exponent of this power law, which is named as a fractal dimension, indicates the rate of change of convexity of simulated droughts/floods of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> over varying levels of droughting/flooding...|$|R
40|$|We {{assessed}} water-body use by elephants through monitoring elephant signs around them. Elephant footprints and dung piles {{were recorded}} at 25 <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> fortnightly for one year. Elephants preferred perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and avoided those with temporary human dwellings. Human activities {{did not significantly}} affect elephant use of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> suggesting low incidence of activities and behavioral adaptation to them by elephants. Elephant signs at perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> increased in the dry season. The monitoring technique was able to detect differences in elephant densities in two areas and establish the presence of herds even at low densities. We conclude that outside protected areas, large perennial <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> represent a preferred resource for elephants, and that assessing elephant signs around <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> is a useful technique for monitoring elephant presence for management and research purposes...|$|R

5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The southern marbled newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable <b>water</b> <b>body</b> will be colonised.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five <b>water</b> <b>body</b> areas by the Environment Agency. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality. The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for ecological quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E

40|$|Having {{reliable}} {{estimates of}} the number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> on different geographical scales is of great importance to better understand biogeochemical cycles and to tackle the social issues related to the economic and cultural use of <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, limnological research suffers from a lack of reliable inventories; the available scientific references are predominately based on <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> of natural origin, large in size and preferentially located in previously glaciated areas. Artificial, small and randomly distributed <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> especially ponds, are usually not inventoried. Following Wetzel’s theory (1990), some authors included them in global inventories by using remote sensing or mathematical extrapolation, but fieldwork on the ground has been done on a very limited amount of territory. These studies have resulted in an explosive increase in the estimated number of <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> going from 8. 44 million lakes (Meybeck 1995) to 3. 5 billion <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> (Downing 2010). These numbers raise several questions, especially about the methodology used for counting small-sized <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> and the methodological treatment of spatial variables. In this study, we use inventories of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> for Sweden, Finland, Estonia and France to show incoherencies generated by the “global to local” approach. We demonstrate that one universal relationship does not suffice for generating the regional or global inventories of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> because local conditions vary greatly from one region to another and cannot be offset adequately by each other. The current paradigm for global estimates of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in limnology, which is based on one representative model applied to different territories, does not produce sufficiently exact global inventories. The step-wise progression from the local to the global scale requires the development of many regional equations based on fieldwork; a specific equation that adequately reflects the actual relationship between distribution and abundance of <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> in a given area must be produced for each geographical region...|$|R
40|$|Fish and {{zooplankton}} {{populations of}} nine Ethiopian freshwater lakes were quantitatively sampled along a North–South gradient. Differences in altitude and latitude {{resulted in a}} temperature gradient from North to South. We tested three hypotheses: (1) the degree of zooplanktivory decreases with water temperature, i. e. from North to South; (2) the degree of zooplanktivory increases with the abundance of large-bodied zooplankton; and (3) the pattern of zooplanktivory in eutrophic Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> differs from other tropical and temperate <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> Proportions of zooplanktivory in the fish communities did not show a geographical trend, but mainly depended on fish species, zooplankton density {{and the availability of}} large-bodied cladocerans. The degree of zooplanktivory in eutrophic Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> differs from other eutrophic <b>water</b> <b>bodies,</b> both temperate and tropical. In Ethiopia, the degree of zooplanktivory can be both low and high, in contrast with other tropical <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> where zooplanktivory is generally low and with temperate eutrophic <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> where it is generally high. As a result, predation pressure on zooplankton by fish varies dramatically amongst Ethiopian <b>water</b> <b>bodies.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one <b>water</b> <b>body</b> is rated good, while 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamics {{in shallow}} closed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> such as shallow lakes and reservoirs, which is {{primarily}} caused by wind shear {{acting on the}} water surface, {{is one of the}} key issues in the field of water environment. It is relevant to water quality and sustainable management of closed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> through influencing the distribution of dissolved substances, nutrients, microorganisms and plankton. However, the circulation can be influenced by the excessive growth of floating aquatic plants in summer, which may make water quality of closed <b>water</b> <b>bodies</b> become worse.

5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake <b>water</b> <b>body</b> and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E
