Blank brags about how respectable and well-connected he is, and he guarantees that he will get away with his crime. He confidently goes to the phone to report Delaney for breaking and entering. Delaney shoots Blank in the head with the Luger pistol as Blank is speaking with the police operator on the telephone. Delaney goes to his office at the police precinct station house and retires from the police department.

Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I {{had one of the}} four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like — not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, {{but there has to be}} specificity to that experience that I wasn't able to speak to. I really wrote the show from a gut-level place, and each character was a piece of me or based on someone close to me. And only later did I realize that it was four white girls. As much as I can say it was an accident, it was only later as the criticism came out, I thought, 'I hear this and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> it.' And this is a hard issue to speak to because all I want to do is sound sensitive and not say anything that will horrify anyone or make them feel more isolated, but I did write something that was super-specific to my experience, and I always want to avoid rendering an experience I can't speak to accurately.Donald Glover guest starred as Sandy, a black Republican and Hannah's love interest, in the first two episodes of season two, which was criticized as tokenism in response to the initial backlash from the first season.|$|E

50|$|The {{game has}} a heavy focus on narrative. It {{features}} a dialogue wheel which allows players to choose how they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> non-player characters. In the story, Geralt {{has to make}} consequential decisions that change {{the state of the}} world and lead to 36 ending outcomes, affecting the lives of in-game characters. Geralt can also engage in a romantic relationship with some of the game's female characters through completing certain quests. Beyond the main quests, there are also books that offer more information on the game's world. Players can initiate side quests after visiting a town's notice board. These side missions include Witcher Contracts, which are elaborated missions that task players to track and hunt monsters, and Treasure Hunt quests, which reward players with top-tier weapons or armour parts upon completion. Completing missions is the only way for players to earn experience points. When the player earns enough experience, Geralt's level increases and players will be given ability points. These points can be spent on 4 skill trees: Combat, Signs, Alchemy, and General. Combat upgrades enhance Geralt's physical attacks and unlock new fighting techniques, Signs upgrades enable Geralt to use magic more efficiently, Alchemy upgrades improve crafting abilities, while General upgrades have a range of functions, from raising Geralt's vitality to increasing crossbow damages. The game features an open world which is broken up into several major regions. Geralt can freely explore each region on foot or using transportation like a boat. Roach is Geralt's horse and can be summoned at will. Players can kill enemies with their sword while riding on Roach, but enemy presence may cause Roach to panic and throw Geralt off. Points of interest {{can be found on the}} map. Players will be rewarded with experience points after completing the mini-missions in these regions. Through exploration, players can also discover Places of Power, which grant players additional ability points. Other activities in which players can participate include horse racing, boxing and card playing. The card playing mechanic was later fully expanded into a standalone game.|$|E

Coordination must originate from a common approach upstream of a particular situation and is rooted in a collaboration process.|$|E

Such strategic activities include analysing, prioritising and deciding upon {{the best course of}} action. Planning for climate adaptation (usually seen to include the setting of visions and objectives, the determination of key strategies and the monitoring of broad outcomes) encompasses the strategic activities involved in the system of governance for climate adaptation. Planning occurs at all scales from global to the business, property, family and even individual scales. Applying a rapid appraisal technique, this chapter analyses the system of planning for climate adaptation {{as it relates to the}} achievement of adaptation outcomes within the Wet Tropics Cluster. It finds that some aspects of the system are healthier than others, and identifies several actions that regional NRM bodies may consider (either collectively or individually) to enhance adaptation outcomes by improving the planning system within the cluster...|$|E

This document explains how. To realizing e-government, we believe three aspects are at stake. 1. If the government wants to safeguard the availability of, access to and use of land information for society, it should facilitate a (spatial) data infrastructure. 2. If the government wants people to use the facilities, it should facilitate electronic legal and economic transactions and participation. 3.
