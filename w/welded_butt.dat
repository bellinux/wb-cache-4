50|$|There {{are many}} types of butt welds, but all fall within one of these categories: single <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joints, double <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint, and open or closed butt joints. A single <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is the name for a joint that has only been welded from one side. A double <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is created when the weld has been welded from both sides. With double welding, the depths of each weld can vary slightly. A closed weld {{is a type of}} joint in which the two pieces that will be joined are {{touching}} during the welding process. An open weld is the joint type where the two pieces have a small gap in between them during the welding process.|$|E

40|$|The fatigue {{properties}} of <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint and base metal of MB 8 magnesium alloy were investigated. The comparative fatigue tests {{were carried out}} using EHF-EM 200 K 2 - 070 - 1 A fatigue testing machine for both <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint and base metal specimens with {{the same size and}} shape. The fatigue fractures were observed and analyzed by a scanning electron microscope of 6360 LA type. The experimental results show that the fatigue performance of the <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint of MB 8 magnesium alloy is sharply decreased. The conditional fatigue limit (1 × 10 7) of base metal and <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is about 69. 41 and 32. 76  MPa, respectively. The conditional fatigue limit (1 × 10 7) of the <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joint is 47. 2  % of that of base metal. The main reasons are that the welding can lead to stress concentration in the weld toe area, tensile welding residual stress in the welded joint, as well as grain coarsening in the welding seam.

50|$|Heat fusion (sometimes called heat <b>welding,</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{or simply}} fusion) is a welding process used to join two {{different}} {{pieces of a}} thermoplastic.

5000|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of <b>welding</b> material possible. <b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation. [...] When metals are welded without human guidance, there is no operator to make adjustments for non-ideal joint preparation.

40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stress in steel members can significantly compromise the stiffness and fatigue life of steel structural components. This influence becomes more serious for the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{in the construction}} of large-sized steel members due to the different residual stress distribution from the normal size <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> This paper experimentally studied the residual stress in the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> through an 8 -experiment test program. High residual stress was produced during the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and this stress was observed to be even higher than the yield strength of the steel. Moreover, this residual stress in the steel plate was firstly compressive and then transferred into tensile stress with the increase in the distance away from the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> line. The magnitude of the residual stress increased with the increase in the width of the welding seams. This paper also developed a finite element model by SYSWELD to simulate the residual stress produced by the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> The accuracy of the FE simulation was checked by the reported test results. In order to reduce the residual stress, the ultrasonic peening method was adopted.

The calculation results indicate that reducing weld toe inclination angle or increasing transition arc radius can effectively decrease the stress concentration coefficient of <b>welded</b> <b>butt</b> joints, so as to improve the fatigue property of welded structures. For the safe use of welded structures, the true weld edge transition arc radius r should be greater than 3 mm, and weld toe inclination angle θ should be smaller than 30 °...|$|E

In the weld seam exists a dentritic grain structure. The weld seam was 2. 5 mm large.
