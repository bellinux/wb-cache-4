500|$|Co-creators and {{executive}} producers Damon Lindelof and J.J. Abrams wrote the premiere's teleplay {{based upon a}} story by Lindelof. The episode was Abrams' first Lost writing credit since the pilot. They laid out the third season {{with the idea of}} [...] "us versus them"; Carlton Cuse, a showrunner, explained, [...] "And who is us? And who is them? I mean I think we all tend to objectify people who we don't know much about and I think that's the audience's view of The Others right now -- they are bad, they are the malevolent force on the island. But {{over the course of the}} stories we're going to be telling this season on the show <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> audience's view of The Others to change a lot." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Type Ia supernovae {{can be used}} as [...] "standard candles" [...] {{to measure}} extragalactic distances, which can in turn be used to measure how fast the {{universe}} has expanded in the past.

Since observations indicate the universe is almost flat, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> total energy density of everything in the universe to sum to 1 (Ωtot ~ 1). The measured dark energy density is ΩΛ = ~0.690; the observed ordinary matter energy density is Ωm = ~0.0482 and the energy density of radiation is negligible. This leaves a missing Ωdm = ~0.258 that nonetheless behaves like matter (see technical definition section above) – dark matter.|$|E

2500|$|The loss of Adado {{meant that}} it became the third to fall to the {{advancing}} Ethiopian forces, after Bandiradley and Beledweyne. This has left the ICU vulnerable, with Jowhar their furthermost stronghold ( [...] north-east of Mogadishu) after losing vast amounts of territory {{as quickly as they}} had gained several months ago. [...] Unconfirmed reports now say that this is due to a change in strategy by the ICU so as to employ guerilla warfare against the more technologically advanced Ethiopian military. [...] The leader of the Council of Islamic Courts executive body appeared to confirm this: [...] "The war is entering a new phase… we will fight Ethiopia for a long, long time and <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> war to go everyplace." [...] Other Islamic leaders did explicitly threaten guerilla war within Ethiopia, by placing Addis Ababa as a target for suicide bombings. In response to this, the Ethiopian-backed TFG announced an amnesty to any ICU fighter who renounced violence by giving up arms. [...] "The government will not take revenge," [...] a government spokesman was reported to have said.|$|E
2500|$|On September 23, 2010, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told Japanese [...] Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara that Senkaku {{and nearby}} waters {{are covered by}} the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, which obligates the United States to defend Japanese {{territory}} from attacks by third-party countries, and maintained that USA {{does not have a}} position regarding the sovereignty of the islands. At a press conference held on the same day, United States Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that in the event of military conflict over the Senkaku islands, [...] "Washington would honor its military commitment to intervene". A reporter posed the same question to clarify an earlier Kyodo report that [...] "US changed its position", similar statements were made at a US State Department Press Conference a month previously on August 16, 2010: [...] "The U.S. position on this issue is longstanding and has not changed. The United States does not take a position {{on the question of the}} ultimate sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> claimants to resolve this issue through peaceful means among themselves. But Article 5 of the 1960 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security states that the treaty applies to the territories under the administration of Japan. There's no change. That (Kyodo) report is incorrect." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{area has}} also been {{utilized}} during times when security concerns {{make it difficult to}} allow the use of the outdoor prayer plaza, such as the March 19, 2009 visit of Pope Benedict XVI to the Wall and Temple Mount. Despite the fact that the Pope's visit coincided with the Jewish festival of Lag B'Omer, the decision had been made to close the Wall and not allow services, but {{at the request of the}} Wall's rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz, the government allowed worship to be conducted in the area within the Arch. The original decision to close the entire prayer area to Jewish worship had begun to elicit negative reaction as soon as the decision was announced, between one and two months before the visit. Rabbi Rabinowitz, protesting the decision, was quoted as saying that [...] "It's inconceivable that the pope's visit would hurt worshippers at the Western Wall, some of whom have been praying there daily." [...] Part of the reaction was a threat to assemble and protest on the part of some Israelis, saying the police would have to [...] "drag" [...] them out of the area. News articles quoted one comment that, [...] "Just like the visit of a chief rabbi at the Vatican doesn't cause the Vatican to shut down, <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>the</b> same approach when the pope visits a place holy to the Jewish people." [...] The decision to utilize the prayer area within Wilson's Arch, allowing worship during the Pope's visit, was eventually announced by the Israel Police and the Israel Security Agency (ISA/Shin Bet). Worshippers were allowed into the main plaza during the hours prior to the Pope's scheduled arrival, but moved into the enclosed Wilson's Arch prayer before his actual arrival.|$|E
