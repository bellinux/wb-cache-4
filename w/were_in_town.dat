5|$|On Thursday, 21 October 1948, Boeing {{engineers}} George S. Schairer, Art Carlsen and Vaughn Blumenthal {{presented the}} design of a four-engine turboprop bomber to the chief of bomber development, Colonel Pete Warden. Warden was disappointed by the projected aircraft and asked if the Boeing team could come up with a proposal for a four-engine turbojet bomber. Joined by Ed Wells, Boeing vice president of engineering, the engineers worked that night in the Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio, redesigning Boeing's proposal as a four-engine turbojet bomber. On Friday, Colonel Warden looked over the information and asked for a better design. Returning to the hotel, the Boeing team was joined by Bob Withington and Maynard Pennell, two top Boeing engineers who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> on other business.|$|E

5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a house full of women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E
5|$|The Rage were {{operated}} by a Dawson Creek-based non-profit group, the DC Rage Society. They obtained over $200,000 each year in financial support from the City of Dawson Creek who wanted the team to help fill the schedule of their new 6,500-seat arena. Compared to other NAHL teams, the Rage received above average fan support with over 1,000 people attending each game. With few of the players were native to the Peace Region, billet families housed team players while they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> The team participated in visits to local elementary schools, hosted meet-and-greets with community members, and fund-raised for the local branch of the Canadian Cancer Society and other charities. Likewise, the community supported the team by fund-raising for pay for general team activities and for a scholarship fund for players going onto university. In August 2011, the team took over hosting duties (from the city's minor hockey association) of Dawson Creek's annual week-long hockey camp in which 95 players attended, as well, in the same month, they hosted an open house for Dawson Creek community members meet the team.|$|E

25|$|While the Toronto-Montreal rivalry {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous in sport, the rivalry with the Red Wings is no less intense. This rivalry dates to the 1920s. As of 2017, they have had twenty-three playoff meetings, five in the finals. So fierce was the rivalry that when the New York Rangers reached the finals against Detroit in 1950, but could not play in their home rink, Madison Square Garden, because the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> they {{arranged}} to play home games in Toronto, whose fans hated the Wings.|$|E
25|$|Mystery guests {{would usually}} {{attempt to conceal}} their identities with {{disguised}} voices, much to the amusement of the studio audience. According to Cerf, the panel could often determine {{the identities of the}} mystery guests early, as they knew which celebrities <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town,</b> or which major movies or plays were about to open. On those occasions, to provide the audience an opportunity to see the guest play the game, the cast would typically allow questioning to pass around at least once before coming up with the correct guess.|$|E

The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at the barn and went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Letterkenny {{represented}} Ireland in the Entente Florale, having scooped Gold in the Large Urban Centre {{category of}} the 2007 National Tidy Town Awards. Locally there was a minor furore as all flags of competing nations were displayed in prominent areas of the town, with some difficulty encountered when locals discovered the controversial Union Jack flag hanging from a pole adjacent {{to the library and}} Paddy Delap's newsagent. The flag is still upsetting to many people angered by continuing British rule in Northern Ireland and as such led to an intensely heated debate on local radio station Highland Radio on the day the judges <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> The flag was first mounted the previous day (7 August) and had to be taken down when some concerns were raised about its safety on a busy Thursday night. It was remounted the following day. Nevertheless the town won gold in the competition.|$|E
25|$|In April 1764, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, then aged eight, {{arrived in}} Britain {{with his family}} {{as part of their}} grand tour of Europe and {{remained}} until July 1765. The Mozarts were summoned to court on 19 May and played before a limited circle from six to ten o'clock. Johann Christian Bach, eleventh son of the great Johann Sebastian Bach, was then music-master to the Queen. He put difficult works of Handel, J. S. Bach, and Carl Friedrich Abel before the boy: he played them all at sight, and those present were quite amazed. Afterwards, the young Mozart accompanied the Queen in an aria which she sang, and played a solo work on the flute. On 29 October, the Mozarts <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> again, and were invited to court to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the King's accession. As a memento of the royal favour, Leopold Mozart published six sonatas composed by Wolfgang, known as Mozart's Opus 3, that were dedicated to the Queen on 18 January 1765, a dedication she rewarded with a present of 50 guineas.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the games}} were often {{difficult}} for the USF squad. Russell and his African American teammates became targets of racist jeers, particularly on the road. In one notable incident, hotels in Oklahoma City refused to admit Russell and his black teammates while they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town</b> for the 1954 All-College Tournament. In protest, the whole team decided to camp out in a closed college dorm, which was later called an important bonding experience for the group.

500|$|In {{the early}} days of the space program, astronauts and reporters would often socialize {{together}} in Cocoa Beach, and had a very different relationship than they do today. Barbree described his relationship with the astronauts as a friend and confidant, often going out to dinner with them, or socializing together when the astronauts <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>town.</b> In his book, Barbree writes that in 1961 Alan Shepard told him an [...] "off the record" [...] fact: He was going to be the first American astronaut in space. Barbree noted that if he were to report this, it would not only jeopardize the friendships, but possibly his career as well, so he said nothing. Barbree also recounts a conversation with Gus Grissom about the astronaut’s concerns regarding Apollo not long before the fatal Apollo 1 fire. Barbree's association with the astronauts had some unexpected bonuses as well, Neil Armstrong carried a gold coin to the moon on Apollo 11 for Barbree, and Pete Conrad flew several flags and patches on Apollo 12, which Barbree later handed out to friends.|$|E
