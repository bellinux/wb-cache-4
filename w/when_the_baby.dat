5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

25|$|Active {{management}} of the third stage is a method of shortening the stage between <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is born and when the placenta is delivered. This stage is when the mother is {{at risk of having}} a PPH. Active management involves giving a drug which helps the uterus contract before delivering the placenta by a gentle but sustained pull on the umbilical cord whilst exerting upward pressure on the lower abdomen to support the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Latching on {{refers to}} how the baby fastens onto the breast while breastfeeding. A good latch means that {{the bottom of the}} areola (the area around the nipple) is in the baby's mouth and the nipple is back inside his or her mouth. A poor latch happens <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> does not have enough of the breast in his/her mouth or is too close to the tip. This can cause cracked nipples and a {{reluctance}} to continue to breastfeed.|$|E

25|$|Babies {{born with}} severe CP often have an {{irregular}} posture; their bodies may be either very floppy or very stiff. Birth defects, such as spinal curvature, a small jawbone, {{or a small}} head sometimes occur along with CP. Symptoms may appear or change as a child gets older. Some babies born with CP do not show obvious signs right away. Classically, CP becomes evident <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> reaches the developmental stage at 6 to 9 months and is starting to mobilise, where preferential use of limbs, asymmetry, or gross motor developmental delay is seen.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Good Humor was {{acquired}} by Thomas J. Lipton, the U.S. subsidiary of the international Unilever conglomerate. Profits declined <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> boomers aged and costs increased because of labor issues, gasoline, and insurance. The company sold its fleet in 1978 but continued to distribute its products through grocery stores and independent street vendors. By 1984, Good Humor returned to profitability. Starting in 1989, Unilever expanded Good Humor through its acquisition of Gold Bond Ice Cream that included the Popsicle brand. Four years later, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike and the Breyers Ice Cream Company. As a result, Good Humor-Breyers is now a large producer of branded ice cream and frozen novelties, {{as part of the}} Unilever Heartbrand.|$|E
25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E

50|$|When {{a baby is}} born bottom {{first there}} is more risk that the birth will not be {{straight}} forward and that <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> could be harmed. For example, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby's</b> head passes through the mother’s pelvis the umbilical cord can be compressed which prevents delivery of oxygenated blood to <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Due to this and other risks, babies in breech position are usually born by a planned caesarean section in developed countries.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{techniques}} used to examine how infants perceive speech, besides the head-turn procedure mentioned above, is measuring their sucking rate. In such an experiment, a baby is sucking a special nipple while presented with sounds. First, the baby's normal sucking rate is established. Then a stimulus is played repeatedly. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> hears the stimulus {{for the first time}} the sucking rate increases but as the baby becomes habituated to the stimulation the sucking rate decreases and levels off. Then, a new stimulus is played to the baby. If the baby perceives the newly introduced stimulus as different from the background stimulus the sucking rate will show an increase. The sucking-rate and the head-turn method are some of the more traditional, behavioral methods for studying speech perception. Among the new methods (see Research methods below) that help us to study speech perception, near-infrared spectroscopy is widely used in infants.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1990, a woman {{threw her}} four-month-old {{daughter}} onto {{the tracks of}} the park's monorail. The baby supposedly fell at least eight feet. The event occurred {{at one of the}} monorail's loading stations located at the Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center. A monorail operator spotted the baby and immediately shut off the power. Although the baby did have extensive injuries to her head, she ultimately recovered. The mother was in an altercation with the baby's father <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> was reportedly tossed over a fence and into the path of the monorail. Although the mother stated that the baby slipped out of her arms, that claim was dismissed due to the height of the fence. A source stated that the mother confessed to throwing her baby girl onto the tracks in order to prove to the baby's father that it was her baby and she could have done whatever she wanted to her. Both the father and mother were charged with child endangerment.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the beaches}} of the Costa Grande are {{considered}} to be “semi-virgin,” meaning there is no or relatively little development. Many do not have hotels but rather offer camping or simple bungalows, with restaurants in the open air under ramadas. While the hunting of sea turtles and the consumption of their eggs was legal in Mexico until recently, they are now not only banned, but many beaches along the Costa Grande have “campamentos tortugeros,” or turtle breeding stations. These are areas where turtle eggs are collected after a female deposits them, then taken to a place where they are incubated safe from predators and humans, as there is still a black market for turtle eggs. Some of these stations are located in the Isla de los Pájaros and Playa Michigan, and Piedra de Tlacoyunque. Most are locally run either voluntarily or with government support. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> turtles hatch, volunteers release them into the nearby ocean and in many places, local schoolchildren and tourists are encouraged in participate in the release of turtles and sometimes in the collection of turtle eggs. In Tenexpa area alone, 150,000 baby turtles were released into the ocean in one year.|$|E

In 1986, Vonnegut was seen by a younger generation when he played himself in Rodney Dangerfield's film Back to School. The last of Vonnegut's fourteen novels, Timequake (1997), was, as University of Detroit history professor and Vonnegut biographer Gregory Sumner said, [...] "a reflection of an aging man facing mortality and testimony to an embattled faith in the resilience of human awareness and agency." [...] Vonnegut's final book, a collection of essays entitled A Man Without a Country (2005), became a bestseller.|$|E
