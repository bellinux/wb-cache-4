Strez agreed to a union with his former enemy, though only after Boril reconfirmed his complete autonomy.

5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E

5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal of morality, {{and in particular the}} use of a villain <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E

Any person <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was {{based on the number of}} years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> part of a series. Richard Johnson has {{claimed to have been}} the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on the strength of his portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E

50|$|After {{many schools}} {{tried and failed}} to insist on only admitting {{students}} <b>who</b> <b>could</b> already read, a different approach to education came about. Schools focused on sponsoring literacy at all levels of student knowledge. Students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> read <b>were</b> taught more difficult materials, while students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not <b>were</b> given elementary reading instruction. The bulk of literacy centered on reading, but, while many early schools focused on reading skills alone, increased literacy ability was soon desirable.|$|R
5|$|Alfred also {{assisted}} {{his own son}} {{by promoting}} men <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> relied on to support him, and by giving him opportunities for command in battle once he was old enough. In the view of Barbara Yorke, the compilation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which magnified Alfred's achievements, may have been partly intended to strengthen {{the case for the}} succession of his own descendants. However, Yorke also argues that Æthelwold's position was not fatally undermined by Alfred's will. His mother had witnessed a charter as regina, whereas Alfred followed West Saxon tradition in refusing to have his wife consecrated as queen, and Æthelwold's status as the son of a queen may have given him an advantage over Edward. Æthelwold was still the senior ætheling, and the only surviving charter he witnessed shows both him and Edward as filius regis (son of a king), but lists Æthelwold above Edward, implying that he ranked above him.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the operation, Bismarcks crew had {{increased}} to 2,221 officers and enlisted men. This included an admiral's staff of nearly 65 and a prize crew of 80 sailors, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to crew transports captured during the mission. At 02:00 on 19 May, Bismarck departed Gotenhafen and made for the Danish straits. She was joined at 11:25 by Prinz Eugen, which had departed the previous night at 21:18, off Cape Arkona. The two ships were escorted by three destroyers—, , and —and a flotilla of minesweepers. The Luftwaffe provided air cover during the voyage out of German waters. At around noon on 20 May, Lindemann informed the ship's crew via loudspeaker of the ship's mission. At approximately the same time, a group of ten or twelve Swedish aircraft flying reconnaissance encountered the German force and reported its composition and heading, though the Germans did not see the Swedes.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s the Australian Army's organisation, {{equipment}} and doctrine {{were similar to}} those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports. While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan, little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia's eastern seaboard, along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia. The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s, but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations {{due to a lack of}} resources as a result of limited defence expenditures. Nevertheless, the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to expand the Army in the event of war, and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated at the competition's outcome, Leech on June 11, 1891 {{instructed}} Barber {{to prepare}} {{designs for the}} half dollar, quarter, and dime. As the Morgan dollar was then being heavily struck, the Mint director decided to leave that design unaltered for the time being. For the obverse of the new coins, Leech suggested a depiction of Liberty similar to that on the French coins of the period; he was content that the current reverses be continued. Leech had previously suggested to Barber that he engage outside help if the work was {{to be done at}} the Mint; the chief engraver replied that he was aware of no one <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> of help in the preparation of new designs. Leech had spoken with Saint-Gaudens on the same subject; the sculptor stated that only four men in the world were capable of executing high-quality coin designs; three lived in France and he was the fourth.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
50|$|Social {{services}} {{in some form}} have existed in New York City since shortly after the first settlers came to {{what was then the}} Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in the 1600s. Early programs were usually run by churches and private charities. As an English colony, New York’s social services were based on the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1598-1601, in which the poor <b>who</b> <b>could</b> not work <b>were</b> cared for in a Poorhouse. Those <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>were</b> employed in a Workhouse. The first Poorhouse in New York was created in the 1740s, and was a combined Poorhouse, Workhouse, and House of Corrections.|$|R
