500|$|The Japan Times gave Snow Prince a {{score of}} 2 out of 5. In the {{critical}} review entitled [...] "Weep over this princely pile of slush", Mark Schilling criticized the film as [...] "a <b>weeper</b> that ... left me surprisingly dry eyed" [...] and added that [...] "There's hardly a spark of originality in the entire enterprise, unless you count the casting of Tadanobu Asano – the coolest Japanese actor of his generation – as a sad-but-wise circus clown." [...] Reviewer Matiko Wataru of the [...] "Eiga-Judge" [...] website said that [...] "this innocent and sad tale tragedy of the boy is too simplistic and the screenplay did not do much.". However, the review praised the [...] "beautiful scenery {{of the city of}} Shonai" [...] and said the film was a [...] "sad and beautiful combination of children and animals".|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN {{said the}} song [...] "continues to mine the Zone turf and unleashes what is ostensibly Britney's first mature ballad, {{at least in}} terms of being musically staid and {{stripped}} of any danceteria sweat and gloss." [...] Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie said that along with In the Zones [...] "Brave New Girl", they were [...] "individually impressive", but disrupted the direction of the album. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "With its dainty piano, 'Everytime' plays like a forlorn postmortem on her Justin Timberlake era." [...] Sterling Clover of The Village Voice called it [...] "a <b>weeper</b> in the best 'Time After Time' (1984) tradition." [...] William Shaw of Blender said that while [...] "Everytime" [...] was not her greatest ballad, the lyrics were [...] "certainly heartfelt". A reviewer from the Huddersfield Daily Examiner stated, [...] " [...] breathy ballad [...] got a stage musical feel to it, but Britney's no Elaine Paige". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine named it along with [...] "Shadow" [...] "two sappy ballads".|$|E
500|$|Murphy's two-decade {{acting career}} spanned radio, television, and over 40 films. [...] He was a {{collaborator}} on [...] several songs between 1962 and 1970. [...] His listening music of choice was country, {{and he had}} a natural talent for writing poetry. One of his better-known poems is [...] "The Crosses Grow on Anzio" [...] which appears in To Hell and Back attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Combined, his taste in music and [...] his poetic skill with rhyming and pentameter surfaced in the songs he wrote. All of his songs but the last one were written in partnership with Scott Turner. [...] As a musician in the pop and country music genres, Turner had become acquainted with Murphy through mutual friend Guy Mitchell. Their biggest hit was [...] "Shutters and Boards", written at Murphy's ranch in 1962. The song is a man's lament over a failed relationship and the boarding up of the home they shared. The Billboard review of Jerry Wallace's recording of the tune noted, [...] "War hero, movie star Audie Murphy is co-writer on this western-style <b>weeper,</b> which has a solid story lyric." [...] In the early 1970s, Turner said that the song had been recorded by [...] approximately sixty vocalists in multiple languages.|$|E

2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? Sure you have. It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime <b>weeper,</b> is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
