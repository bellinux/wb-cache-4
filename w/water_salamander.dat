50|$|The Aztec diet {{included}} {{a variety of}} fish and wild game: various fowl, pocket gophers, green iguanas, axolotls (a type of <b>water</b> <b>salamander),</b> a type of crayfish called an acocil, and {{a great variety of}} insects, larvae and insect eggs. They also domesticated turkeys, duck and dogs as food and at times ate meat from larger wild animals such as deer, but none of these were a major part of their diet. They ate various mushrooms and fungi, including the parasitic corn smut, which grows on ears of corn. Squash was very popular and came in many different varieties. Squash seeds, fresh, dried or roasted, were especially popular. Tomatoes, though different from the varieties common today, were often mixed with chili in sauces or as filling for tamales.|$|E
5000|$|In art, Xolotl was {{typically}} {{depicted as a}} dog-headed man, a skeleton, or a deformed monster with reversed feet. An incense burner {{in the form of}} a skeletal canine depicts Xolotl. As a psychopomp, Xolotl would guide the dead on their journey to Mictlan, the afterlife in myths. His two spirit animal forms are the Xoloitzcuintli dog and the <b>water</b> <b>salamander</b> species known as the Axolotl. Xolos served as companions to the Aztecs in this life and also in the after-life, as many dog remains and dog sculptures have been found in Aztec burials, including some at the main temple in Tenochtitlan. Dogs were often victims of ritual sacrifice, so that they could accompany their master on his voyage through Mictlan, or the underworld. Their main duty was to help their owners cross a deep river, and it is possible that dog sculptures also found in burials were also intended to help people on this journey. Xoloitzcuintli is the official name of the Mexican Hairless Dog (also known as perro pel√≥n mexicano in Mexican Spanish), a pre-Columbian canine breed from Mesoamerica dating back to over 3500 years ago. This is one of many native dog breeds in the Americas and it is often confused with the Peruvian Hairless Dog. The name [...] "Xoloitzcuintli" [...] references Xolotl because this dog's mission was to accompany the souls of the dead in their journey into eternity. The name [...] "Axolotl" [...] comes from [...] "Nahuatl", the Aztec language. One translation of the name connects the Axolotl to Xolotl. The most common translation is [...] "water-dog" [...] [...] "Atl" [...] for water and [...] "Xolotl" [...] for dog.|$|E
50|$|The Texas blind {{salamander}} (Eurycea rathbuni) {{is a rare}} cave-dwelling troglobite amphibian {{native to}} San Marcos, Hays County, Texas, specifically the San Marcos Pool of the Edwards Aquifer. The salamander has blood-red external gills for absorbing oxygen from the <b>water.</b> The <b>salamander's</b> mature length is 13 cm. Its diet varies by what flows into its cave, including blind shrimp (Palaemonetes antrorum), snails, and amphipods.|$|R
50|$|Fire {{salamanders}} live {{in central}} European forests {{and are more}} common in hilly areas. They prefer deciduous forests, since they like to hide in fallen leaves and around mossy tree trunks. They need small brooks or ponds with clean water in their habitat {{for the development of}} the larvae. Whether on land or in <b>water,</b> fire <b>salamanders</b> are inconspicuous. They spend much of their time hidden under wood or other objects. They are active in the evening and the night, but on rainy days they are active in daytime as well.|$|R
50|$|Wildlife include, common otter, mink, bobcats, coyotes, red fox, ducks, raccoons, skunks, opossum, gray squirrels, mice, {{rats and}} eastern cottontails. Where {{the banks are}} muddy, {{crayfish}} make their volcano-shaped homes. Many birds including great blue herons, great egrets and belted kingfishers make their homes among and eat from the creek, and double-crested cormorants, American white pelicans and American coots often visit the lake. Herpetofauna include lizards, <b>water</b> moccasins, <b>salamanders,</b> red-eared sliders and common snapping turtles. The most common fish are sunfish, largemouth bass, white crappie and channel catfish.|$|R

These artifacts were used for hunting and gathering. Wisconsin industries are also incorporated into the design. Other elements represented in bronze are the state bird (robin), flower (violet), and tree (maple).|$|R
5000|$|Adults only stay in {{the water}} for a few days, then the eggs hatch in one to two months. Eggs of A. maculatum can have a {{symbiotic}} relationship with a green alga, Oophila amblystomatis. Jelly coating prevents the eggs from drying out, but it inhibits oxygen diffusion (required for embryo development). The Oophila alga photosynthesizes and produces oxygen in the jelly. The developing salamander thus metabolizes the oxygen, producing carbon dioxide (which then the alga consumes). Photosynthetic algae are present within the somatic and possibly the germ cells of the salamander. [...] When the eggs hatch depends on the water temperatures. [...] As larvae, they are usually light brown or greenish-yellow. They have small dark spots and are born with external gills. In two to four months, the larvae lose their gills, and become juvenile salamanders that leave the <b>water.</b> Spotted <b>salamanders</b> {{have been known to}} live up to 32 years, and normally return to the same vernal pool every year. These pools are seasonal and will usually dry up during the late spring and stay dry until winter.|$|R
5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted three species of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted <b>salamander,</b> <b>water</b> snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and three species of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|R
50|$|Adults {{are rarely}} {{seen in the}} open, and often live in burrows that are usually two feet from the surface. Tiger {{salamanders}} are almost entirely terrestrial as adults, and usually only return to the water to breed, but also they partly live in both land and <b>water.</b> Although tiger <b>salamanders</b> are terrestrial, they are good swimmers. Like all ambystomatids, they are extremely loyal to their birthplaces, and will travel long distances to reach them. However, a single tiger salamander has only a 50% chance of breeding {{more than once in}} its lifetime. Males nudge a willing female to initiate mating, and then deposit a spermatophore on the lake bottom. The female picks up the packet and deposits the now-fertilized eggs on vegetation. Large-scale captive breeding of tiger salamanders has not been accomplished, for unknown reasons.|$|R
50|$|The alpine {{salamander}} (Salamandra atra) is a shiny black salamander {{found in the}} central, eastern and Dinaric Alps, at altitudes above 700 m. The western Alps are inhabited by a similar species, Lanza's {{alpine salamander}} (Salamandra lanzai), in only one small area. No differences in length are seen between the sexes (9 - 14 cm) and the sex ratio is 1:1. Their life expectancy is at least 10 years. Unlike other salamanders, whose larvae are developed in <b>water,</b> the alpine <b>salamander</b> is a fully terrestrial species. Capture-recapture methods suggest that the species is very stationary; 12 m was the maximum observed distance travelled by one individual during the summer season. About 120 individuals per hectare were counted in most suitable areas with >2000 individuals/ha also observed, suggesting that this rather cryptic species is quite abundant.|$|R
40|$|The Jollyville Plateau salamander, Eurycea tonkawae Chippindale, Price, Wiens, and Hillis, inhabits {{springs and}} wet caves of the Jollyville {{segment of the}} Edwards Plateau, Texas. The known range of this species is limited to six stream drainages, and most known localities {{are at risk of}} {{impairment}} from urban devel-opment. Our purpose was to gather needed autecological information on E. tonkawae and evaluate factors that may affect the distribution and abundance of the species. We conducted visual salamander surveys at nine stream sites across the Jollyville Plateau between December 1996 and December 1998. The survey sites were classified as undeveloped or developed based on watershed impervious cover estimates. We charac-terized the habitat for each site, including substrate type, discharge, and <b>water</b> quality. <b>Salamander</b> counts varied seasonally, but generally were higher during spring and summer. Salamander densities across sites were positively correlated with rubble and cobble substrate density as preferred cover, and negatively correlated with the standard deviation of water temperature, as expected for a spring-adapted species. In addition, we found that mean salamander densities at sites occurring in undeveloped watersheds were significantly higher than at developed sites, where specific conductance of the water was higher. The {{results of this study suggest}} that while habitat and seasonal factors influence surface salamander densities, E. tonkawae populations may be most vulnerable to effects associated with urbanization...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal forest {{pools in}} the northeastern USA are unique {{ecosystems}} whose functions are intimately associated with adjacent upland habitats. This connection, coupled with their small size and ephemeral surface water, has made conservation of pool resources challenging. Seasonal pools provide optimal breeding habitat for animals adapted to temporary <b>waters</b> including ambystomatid <b>salamanders</b> (Ambystoma spp.), wood frogs (Rana sylvatica LeConte), and some invertebrates and plants. To date, wetland conservation efforts have been primarily limited to 2 pathways: land use regulation and pres-ervation. Although both of these pathways {{have the potential to}} conserve some pool resources, they are often insufficient to maintain an array of pools in the landscape that support local population dynamics of amphibians. We propose a third pathway ‚Äì local land-use planning ‚Äì that can complement regulatory and preservation efforts. This suite of strategies, embodied in our Best Development Practices (BDPs), recognizes that not all pools will be conserved; local governances will need to develop priorities for conservation. The BDPs encourage local governances to (1) proactively identify their pool resources, (2) rank those pools according to their relative ecological value, and (3) establish management procedures and apply recommended guidelines in accordance with the relative rankings. We recommend that pool...|$|R
60|$|It is {{somewhat}} different {{with the next}} great vertebrate group, the amphibians, represented in our own world only by the frogs, the toads, the newts, and the axolotls. Here we must certainly with shame confess that the amphibians of old greatly surpassed their degenerate descendants in our modern <b>waters.</b> The Japanese <b>salamander,</b> {{by far the biggest}} among our existing newts, never exceeds a yard in length from snout to tail; whereas some of the labyrinthodonts (forgive me once more) of the Carboniferous Epoch must have reached at least seven or eight feet from stem to stern. But the reason of this falling off is not far to seek. When the adventurous newts and frogs of that remote period first dropped their gills and hopped about inquiringly on the dry land, under the shadow of the ancient tree-ferns and club-mosses, they were the only terrestrial vertebrates then existing, and they had the field (or, rather, the forest) all to themselves. For a while, therefore, like all dominant races for the time being, they blossomed forth at their ease into relatively gigantic forms. Frogs as big as donkeys, and efts as long as crocodiles, luxuriated to their hearts' content in the marshy lowlands, and lorded it freely over the small creatures which they found in undisturbed possession of the Carboniferous isles. But as ages passed away, and new improvements were slowly invented and patented by survival of the fittest in the offices of nature, their own more advanced and developed descendants, the reptiles and mammals, got the upper hand with them, and soon lived them down in the struggle for life, so that this essentially intermediate form is now almost entirely restricted to its one adapted seat, the pools and ditches that dry up in summer.|$|R
40|$|Amphibian {{reproductive}} modes are {{diverse and}} are characterised by complex adaptations, including vast variability in life history traits and different parental investment strategies. For instance, viviparity {{is rare in}} urodeles despite the potential ecological advantages gained in such populations by having semi-independency from <b>water.</b> The fire <b>salamander,</b> Salamandra salamandra, shows remarkable intraspecific variation in reproductive modes, with two strategies co-occurring: a common reproductive mode, larviparity (parturition of aquatic larvae), and a phylogenetically derived reproductive mode, pueriparity (parturition of terrestrial juveniles). Pueriparous populations of S. salamandra {{have at least two}} independent origins, the first originating from its northern distribution in the Iberian Peninsula, and the second at two insular populations on the northwestern Iberian coast. Here, we analyse the patterns of variability of some life-history traits in larviparous and pueriparous populations of S. salamandra, including pueriparous populations from the two independent origins, to understand how these traits relate to the evolutionary transitions in reproductive modes in S. salamandra. Our study shows differences in female body size and clutch and brood size between larviparous and pueriparous fire salamanders. We did not find differences in female investment between reproductive modes, and thus, the evolution to pueriparity in S. salamandra is likely characterised by the re-allocation of eggs to matrotrophy. Our study also confirms pueriparity and larviparity as the characteristic reproductive modes for insular and coastal/mainland S. s. gallaica populations, respectively, revealing the potential presence of pueriparity in one coastal population. This comparative analysis sheds light on the maternal factors that might have driven, or are related to, the evolution of pueriparity in this unique biological system and sets up the basis for testing different hypotheses that include climatic, ecological, physiological, and genetic factors as drivers of this evolutionary transition.

50|$|The mud {{salamander}} inhabits swamps in low elevations, bogs, seeps, springs, {{and streams}} {{that not only}} provide a muddy bottom, but also clean and clear <b>water.</b> The mud <b>salamander,</b> a burrowing species, seeks shelter in burrows beneath leaf litter, logs, stones, or bark. The mud salamander may also build tunnels in creek banks, as well. These amphibians {{spend most of their}} lives in close proximity to water, but also burrow into the soil of the surrounding area. Larvae are usually underground in muddy springs; they are often found in leaf litter, debris, and muck of muddy springs, seeps, and streams. After they lose their gills and become adults, they make burrows in muddy areas. They often use burrows of crayfish and will sit with their heads sticking out of these burrows waiting for prey to pass by. They come out of these burrows at night and forage in the surrounding area. Generally, mud salamanders do not wander as far from their main habitat as their close relatives, the red salamanders. Mud salamanders seem to favor small, muddy seeps and springs that dry up in the summer. Both larval and adult mud salamanders go deep underground during the hottest months of the summer, especially in the small springs and seeps that dry up. The gilled larvae go deep in the mud where the water is underground and the adults remain deep in burrows. During the hottest times of the year, they are usually only found at night or during rains foraging for a short time before they return to their burrows in the mud. Dusky salamanders are often found in the same habitat as mud salamanders and are much easier to find than the mud salamanders. When this is the case, the more abundant dusky salamanders often serve as a food source for the mud salamanders. There are many scenarios where small muddy springs where mud salamanders live feed into larger streams that have more common species such as dusky and two-lined salamanders. In this case, the muds venture into the main stream and can often be found in it because they are looking for more food outside of their smaller, more primary habitat. One reason for this is less competition outside of a smaller habitat full of mud salamanders, another reason is the abundant two lined and dusky salamanders that are food for the larger muds. They can often be found in creeks that do not seem like ideal habitat for them because they have ventured out of their primary habitat for food. Chances are an ideal muddy habitat is within walking distance from where the mud salamander was found in the stream.|$|R
