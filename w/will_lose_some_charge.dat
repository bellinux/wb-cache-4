The key attribute of the pricing equations is that consumers are incentivised to submit truthfully – a detailed discussion of this can be found in [13].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Most {{hydrocarbon}} absorption attenuation {{studies are}} based on poststack seismic data processing but, because of multiple stacks at full angle, poststack data <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> lithology and hydrocarbon-bearing capacity information. To overcome this disadvantage, a prestack angle-domain absorption attenuation analysis technique can be performed for seismic data stacked at various angles to obtain angle-domain-dependent absorption profiles. The absorption anomaly reflects the gas-bearing reservoir and also decreases as the angle increases. Actual data from the Sulige gas field, Ordos Basin, have been processed, and the hydrocarbon predictions match very well with actual drilling results, validating the method's effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{bidirectional}} recurrent {{neural network}} (BRNN) {{has been widely}} used for question answering (QA) tasks with promising performance.

Hence, these existing models don't put supervision (loss or similarity calculation) at every time step, which <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision at every time step.

For example, investments in company stock shares put capital at risk. Unlike capital invested in a savings account, the share price, which is the market value of a stock share at a certain point in time, depends on what someone is willing to pay for it, and the price of a stock share tends to change constantly when the market for that share is open. If the price is relatively stable, the stock is said to have “low volatility.” If the price often changes a great deal, the stock has “high volatility.” ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{reveal a}} general {{relationship}} between model simplification and irreversibility {{based on the}} model of continuous-time Markov chains with time-scale separation. According to the topological structure of the fast process, we divide the states of the chain into the transient states and the recurrent states. We show that a two-time-scale chain can be simplified to a reduced chain in two different ways: removal of the transient states and aggregation of the recurrent states. Both the two operations will lead to a decrease in the entropy production rate and its adiabatic part and will keep its non-adiabatic part the same. This suggests that although model simplification can retain almost all the dynamic information of the chain, it <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> thermodynamic information as a trade-off...|$|R

40|$|A lossy {{compression}} tolerant data hiding method is proposed in this paper. The image which hides data is named a stego-image.

This effect appears {{to dominate the}} effciency cost of increasing the share of energy provided by renewable energy sources in the countries that adopt such targets. While an increase in prices for energy commodities, which is entailed by the policies in question, affects households in low income quintiles the most, recycling revenues from climate policy allows governments to compensate them for the losses. If renewable targets reduce the revenues from ets permit auctions, member states with large allocations of auctionable permits <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> {{of the ability to}} do so...|$|R

When merging two (or more) datasets into one common target dataset, we need to ensure that data from heterogeneous sources {{can be used in}} combination to view, query and analyse, or in short: we need to harmonize the datasets. Therefore, we need to set up a data harmonization process. The data harmonization mechanism is often compared to searching for the lowest common denominator in mathematics.

40|$|Growth of real GDP is {{expected}} to moderate from 3. 4 percent in 2007 to 2. 2 percent in 2008. A first outlook into 2009 suggests a {{rate of growth of}} 2 percent. The deceleration is the consequence of a less favourable international growth environment, with the imminent cyclical downturn in the USA, the persistent crisis on financial markets and the marked appreciation of the euro. In Austria, exports and manufacturing output will therefore advance at a slower pace, following the boom in the last two years. Further ahead, also investment in machinery and equipment as well as construction <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> of its previous momentum. In spite of the benign business conditions, the upswing of the last few years has not led to a revival of consumer spendings. The main reason has been the sluggish growth of earnings. Meanwhile, also the acceleration of inflation (with a projected rate of 2. 6 percent in 2008) is squeezing households' real disposable income. The business cycle slowdown will prevent a further decline of unemployment or a reduction of the budget deficit. ...|$|R
40|$|For linear {{regression}} models with non normally distributed errors, the least squares estimate (LSE) <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> <b>some</b> efficiency {{compared to the}} maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). In this article, we propose a kernel density-based regression estimate (KDRE) that is adaptive to the unknown error distribution. The key idea is to approximate the likelihood function by using a nonparametric kernel density estimate of the error density based on some initial parameter estimate. The proposed estimate is shown to be asymptotically as efficient as the oracle MLE which assumes the error density were known. In addition, we propose an EM type algorithm to maximize the estimated likelihood function and show that the KDRE {{can be considered as}} an iterated weighted least squares estimate, which provides us some insights on the adaptiveness of KDRE to the unknown error distribution. Our Monte Carlo simulation studies show that, while comparable to the traditional LSE for normal errors, the proposed estimation procedure can have substantial efficiency gain for non normal errors. Moreover, the efficiency gain can be achieved even for a small sample size...|$|R
