5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E

Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of {{being sent to the}} gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|A {{week later}} with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, {{signalling}} a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> found oysters and berries in plentiful supply {{and were able to}} eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain, but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Union right, Lew Wallace {{formed an}} attacking column with three brigades—one {{from his own}} division, one from McClernand's, and one from Smith's—to try {{to regain control of}} ground lost in the battle that morning. Wallace's old brigade (11th Indiana and 8th Missouri), now {{commanded}} by Col. Morgan. Wall L. Smith, and others from McClernand's and Wallace's divisions were chosen to lead the attack. The brigades of Cruft (Wallace's Division) and Leonard F. Ross (McClernand's Division) were placed in support on the flanks. Wallace ordered the attack forward. Smith, the 8th Missouri, and the 11th Indiana advanced a short distance up the hill using Zouave tactics, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> repeatedly rushed and then fell to the ground in a prone position. By 5:30p.m. Wallace's troops had succeeded in retaking the ground lost that morning, and by nightfall, the Confederate troops had been driven back to their original positions. Grant began plans to resume his assault in the morning, although neglecting to close the escape route that Pillow had opened.|$|E

5|$|On 12 July, an {{armistice}} {{came into}} effect, ending the fighting. Following this, the 2/14th Battalion was initially used to conduct battlefield clearance tasks {{before moving to}} Beirut <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were used as garrison troops overseeing the repatriation of captured Vichy soldiers to France. Later, in September, the battalion {{was transferred to the}} north to construct defensive positions near Tripoli in Lebanon. In December 1941, following the Japanese attacks on Pearl Harbor and in Malaya, {{the decision was made to}} bring the 6th and 7th Divisions back to Australia. In early January 1942, the 7th Division left Syria, where it had been undertaking garrison duties, and returned to Palestine. The 2/14th were moved to a camp near Jerusalem, and during this time command of the battalion passed to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key, who had previously commanded the 2/8th Battalion. On 30 January 1942 the 2/14th Battalion embarked on the transport Ile de France from Port Tewfik in Egypt, bound for Australia. The 2/14th's casualties during its deployment to the Middle East were 21 killed, 94 wounded and 11 captured.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E

He built the quarters where the crew took their meals (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby Ebensee {{concentration}} camp. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips {{to and from the}} camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned {{what had happened to the}} first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.|$|E

Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states. Many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century to support their families.
