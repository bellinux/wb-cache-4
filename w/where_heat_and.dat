500|$|As {{with the}} rest of Madagascar, the rocks of Marojejy National Park were once part of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which began to break up 160million years ago to form the {{southern}} continents. [...] However, the bedrock of Marojejy formed over 500million years ago during the Precambrian beneath an ancient mountain range that has since eroded away completely. [...] The bedrock is composed mostly of granitic rocks, although it also contains a significant amount of gneiss, a high-grade metamorphic rock that formed under high pressure and temperature deep beneath the ancient mountain range. [...] In places <b>where</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> pressure were highest, the rock melted completely and eventually recrystallized at depth as granite, an igneous rock. [...] Later, veins of quartz formed in cracks in the bedrock; these are the source of the quartz and amethyst crystals mined in the region today. [...] In more recent geological times, the area's abundant quartzite formed when quartz-rich sands were deposited on the bedrock, and were then buried and recrystallized (metamorphosed). [...] The soil pH is expected to be acidic to neutral.|$|E

50|$|Convection in fluids {{is driven}} by density {{variations}} within them {{under the influence of}} gravity. These density variations may be caused by gradients in the composition of the fluid, or by differences in temperature (through thermal expansion). Thermal and compositional gradients can often diffuse with time, reducing their ability to drive the convection, and requiring that gradients in other regions of the flow exist in order for convection to continue. A common example of double diffusive convection is in oceanography, <b>where</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> salt concentrations exist with different gradients and diffuse at differing rates. An effect that affects both of these variables is the input of cold freshwater from an iceberg.|$|E

The island was held by 11,000 Japanese troops under the command of Colonel Kuzume Naoyuki. Disdainful of the doctrine of defence at the water's edge, he decided instead to allow the Americans to come ashore unopposed so that they would stroll unwarily into the trap he had prepared for them. This would turn the area around the vital airfield there into a martial honeycomb of caves and pillboxes filled with riflemen, automatic weapons, artillery, batteries of mortars, and a single company of nine Type 95 Ha-Go light tanks. Kuzume also stockpiled these positions with enough ammunition, food and water to sustain his defense for months.

50|$|It {{is similar}} to the roof mounted solar fan, except that its {{installation}} is a little different.

These types of fans are generally installed behind intake grills to provide ventilation. Gable Solar Fans are usually installed high on the gable close to the ridge and are also coupled with soffit or roof vents for well-balanced intake and exhaust air avenues. The airflow depends upon the level of sunlight when there is more sunlight, the airflow will be more resulting in enhanced cooling. It is also capable of lowering the air conditioning costs by cooling the attic.|$|E
50|$|In a {{discussion}} with Richard Dawkins on BBC Radio Ulster and in an article, McIntosh argued that the principles of thermodynamics are not consistent with Darwinian evolution. McIntosh said {{that the issue is}} that the second law of thermodynamics concerns entropy increasing in an isolated system. The current understanding is that because the earth is in an open system (<b>where</b> <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> mass transfer are allowed through the boundary) that entropy could readily decrease in such a system since outside there will be a compensatory overall increase. McIntosh argues against this, maintaining that even in an open system, random energy input will not produce complex and mutually dependent systems required for life without there being an existing or embryonic system there to begin with. Styer and Bunn have argued that the compensation principle of low entropy islands can be used to lower the entropy locally and generate free energy. McIntosh argues that it is information systems in living systems which are controlling the non equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E
