25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happy or how to achieve the things that <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> happy. Therefore, Kant argues, we can at best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
500|$|For Satisfied, DecembeRadio made {{a concerted}} effort to write lyrics that were more {{uplifting}} than those featured on their previous album. [...] Said Bunn, [...] "Our first record had a lot of darker songs such as 'Razor' and 'Greed'. [...] Even though we liked some of that, we truly realized we're a bunch of happy guys! [...] We like to have fun onstage and in our lives, so we didn't want this album to be as dark as the last one." [...] To that end, the band wrote and included on Satisfied songs like [...] "Better Man", which Reedy says imparts that [...] "if we learn from our mistakes and follow Jesus Christ it <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> a better man", and the [...] "vertical worship song" [...] "For Your Glory". [...] The band was inspired to write [...] "Find You Waiting" [...] following the death of a friend of producer Scotty Wilbanks. [...] At the funeral, the man's widow stood over the casket praising God with arms raised amidst her sorrow. [...] "It struck a chord in our hearts to write a song about how, no matter what current problem we might be facing, God's love and mercy is always waiting there for us", said Reedy.|$|E

500|$|Those {{who opposed}} this {{resolution}} argued that its presence {{would cause the}} other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, [...] "Why Lizzie, thee <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> ridiculous." [...] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would {{then be able to}} affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the world would be a better place if women were involved in the political sphere. [...] "In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world." [...] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.|$|E
2500|$|Now {{the army}} {{wants to know}} how we (the Foreign Ministry) are going to explain the issue. In a joint meeting of army and foreign {{ministry}} officials Shmuel Bendor suggested that we say that the army had no part in the operation, but that the inhabitants of the border villages, infuriated by previous incidents and seeking revenge, operated on their own. Such a version <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> appear ridiculous: any child would say that this was a military operation. (16 October 1953) ...|$|E
2500|$|The show {{underwent}} further tightening, namely {{with improved}} sewer lighting and {{the incorporation of}} the Javert suicide scene effect. Boublil explained: [...] "The transfer from London to the United States has prompted further modifications. 'We are taking this opportunity to rethink and perfect, to rewrite some details which probably {{no one else will}} see, but which for us are still long nights of work,' Mr. Boublil says. 'There are things that nobody had time to do in London, and here we have a wonderful opportunity to fix a few things. No one will notice, perhaps, but for us, it <b>will</b> <b>make</b> <b>us</b> so happy if we can better this show. We would like this to be the final version.'" [...] Two songs were deleted—the complete version of Gavroche's song [...] "Little People" [...] and the adult Cosette's [...] "I Saw Him Once". A short section at the beginning of [...] "In My Life" [...] replaced [...] "I Saw Him Once". The lyrics in Javert's [...] "Stars" [...] were changed. It now ended with the line, [...] "This I swear by the stars!", while the London production and cast recording ended with the repeated line, [...] "Keeping watch in the night".|$|E
