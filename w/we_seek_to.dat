25|$|Dilthey {{strongly}} rejected using a model formed {{exclusively from}} the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> understand {{in terms of the}} relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist Max Weber. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (Verstehen) could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of aesthetics in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.|$|E

And we do that in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E

In his annual State of the Union address to Congress of January 6, 1941, which was delivered {{at a time when}} Nazi Germany occupied much of Western Europe, he asked the American citizens to support war efforts in various ways. He stated his vision of a better future, founded upon four freedoms: [...] "In the future days which <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms," [...] some traditional and some new ones: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.|$|E

500|$|Newly {{elected to}} a mining seat, Benn was a {{supporter}} of the 1984–85 UK miners' strike, which was beginning {{when he returned to the}} Commons, and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a [...] "regional matter" [...] in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: [...] "The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, nor do <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. We are working for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference." [...] This guest appearance was considered one reason why Benn did not become a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet.|$|E

[...] Lambie stated it was done to explore [...] "how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen", and concluded, [...] "whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty". Atad asserted it ultimately lead viewers to choose between their [...] "so-called justice and the competing value of empathy". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> discipline?" [...] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a [...] "morally complex idea" [...] without taking a side on the discussion.

2500|$|In The Methods of Ethics, Henry Sidgwick asked, [...] "Is it total or average {{happiness}} that <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> make a maximum?" [...] He {{noted that}} {{aspects of the}} question had been overlooked and answered the question himself by saying that {{what had to be}} maximized was the average multiplied by the number of people living. He also argued that, if the [...] "average happiness enjoyed remains undiminished, Utilitarianism directs us to make the number enjoying it as great as possible." [...] This was also the view taken earlier by Paley. He notes that, although he speaks of the happiness of communities, [...] "the happiness of a people is made up of the happiness of single persons; and the quantity of happiness can only be augmented by increasing the number of the percipients, or the pleasure of their perceptions" [...] and that if extreme cases, such as people held as slaves, are excluded the amount of happiness will usually be in proportion to the number of people. Consequently, [...] "the decay of population is the greatest evil that a state can suffer; and the improvement of it the object which ought, in all countries, to be aimed at in preference to every other political purpose whatsoever." [...] A similar view was expressed by Smart, who argued that all other things being equal a universe with two million happy people is better than a universe with only one million happy people.|$|E
