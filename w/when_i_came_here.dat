It has made an indelible mark on me." [...] His foreman was Sammy Boyd, but the two biggest influences on him were Jimmy Lucas and Bobby Dalgleish.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2016, Farage made {{a speech}} in the European Parliament in which he claimed that a {{hypothetical}} failure for the EU to forge a trade deal with an exiting UK would [...] "be far worse for you {{than it would be}} for us", to heckling and laughing by Parliament members. He insulted his fellow MEPs, claiming that [...] "virtually none" [...] of them had ever had done [...] "a proper job" [...] in their lives. Media around the world covered Farage's speech, including his comment: [...] "... <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> 17 years ago, and I said that I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me.

6000|$|Rosier {{was silent}} a little. [...] "There's one thing I'm sure he knows!" [...] he broke out presently.

6000|$|... "I don't know; but if Captain Jim keeps apparitions {{like that}} down at this Point I'm {{going to carry}} cold iron in my pocket <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here.</b> He wasn't a sailor, or one might pardon his {{eccentricity}} of appearance; he must belong to the over-harbor clans.

6000|$|He {{took the}} candle from her hand, {{held it to}} the ground, and removed a tile which lay in the garden-path. [...] "'Tis the track of her shoe that she made when she ran down here the day before she went away all those months ago.

6000|$|... "Haven't I?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "I wondered, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up <b>here</b> to Hampton, whether I mightn't meet you--and {{here you}} are! Doesn't that prove it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{see how a}} {{wise man}} is lost by fortune. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here,</b> whom should <b>I</b> find but Dolfin himself? The dog had scent of my plan, {{all the way from}} Dolfinston there, by Peebles.

There's another thing; to be frank, you don't help much. We need a boss to superintend, which you can't do, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want advice I can go to Norton. As a matter of fact, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>here</b> in the evenings you find fault with what I've done. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{undertake}} a job I like to feel I'm carrying it out." ...|$|R
