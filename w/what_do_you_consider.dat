40|$|International audienceFew {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the link between episodic memory and presence: the feeling of " being there " and reacting to a stimulus {{as if it were}} real. We collected data from 244 participants after they had watched the movie Avengers: Age of Ultron. They answered questions about factual (details of the movie) and temporal memory (order of the scenes) about the movie, as well as their emotion experience and their sense of presence during the projection. Both higher emotion experience and sense of presence were related to better factual memory, but not to temporal order memory. Crucially, the link between emotion and factual memory was mediated by the sense of presence. We interpreted the role of presence as an external absorption of the attentional focus toward the stimulus, thus enhancing memory encoding. Our findings could shed light on the cognitive processes underlying memory impairments in psychiatric conditions characterized by an altered sense of reality. " Virtual Reality is the representation of possible worlds and possible selves, with the aim of making them appear as real as possible—i-deally, by creating a subjective sense of " presence " in the user.

Science and scientists from the children point of view” organized by the Laboratorio di Didattica e Divulgazione Scientifica of Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia in Rome, Italy. The best drawings were awarded and published in the 2011 school calendar. Children were asked to realize a drawing, choosing among three suggestions: 1) How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> imagine a scientist and how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> imagine the daily activities of a researcher? 2) <b>What</b> invention <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> the most important among all those you know? 3) What would you invent? The topic “invention” (# 3) was the most successful. In fact, among the collected 1, 000 drawings, 400 drawings depict scientists, nearly 150 depict scientists with their inventions, and other 350 depict inventions alone. A classification scheme was designed in order to synthetically describe this set of images and analyze it. The Draw-A-Scientist scheme, known from literature, was mantained but modified in order to characterize both inventors and inventions. As regard scientists, a preliminary analysis reveals a persistent gender stereotype, since most of depicted persons were male and nearly half of girls draw men scientists. The image of “mad scientist” is still present but it is mainly related to men. Women scientists are drawn by girls; they are represented as young, not crazy, usually good-looking. There are no particular differences {{between boys and girls}} in assigning research fields to scientists. Women scientists are often depicted as assistants, but when alone they are self-confident enough to give their name to an invention or to aspire for Nobel Prize. In this work we present the preliminary analysis performed on drawings containing inventions. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> girls and boys 6 to 11 years old invent? Robots, helping in housekeeping or in doing homework; rockets, space vehicles and time machines, but also fictional machines and hybridized animals, devices helping in human caring or having impact on the environment for a better quality of life. In general, the preferred subjects refer to something useful with respect to things we do in everyday life but also fancy devices, for which imagination runs wild. Inventions can include something useful to individuals or to a community, being something totally new, or already existing, but improved, combined or transformed; being a device or part of the natural environment or of the human body; they can involve several dimensions of living, like eating, transporting, entertainment, work.

40|$|Abstract Plagiarism is {{perceived}} as a serious problem for the higher education sector, indicated by the fact that all 39 Australian universities have a policy on plagiarism. It is therefore timely to ask: What are the characteristics of these policies? As an example of policy characteristics, this presentation discusses the types of attitudes inherent in the language of policy in the institutional definitions of Australian universities. It is argued that policies are not neutral, but rather contain judgments that show underlying attitudes, a situation neither surprising nor necessarily undesirable for plagiarism. These judgments contribute towards creating the university stance on important topics such as plagiarism and may clarify this stance for those new to the institution. University definitions of plagiarism have been analysed via Appraisal (Martin and White, 2005). The results indicate that the definitions contain a significant amount of judgment appraising plagiarism and plagiarising students negatively in terms of truthfulness and ethics. Students are predominantly appraised negatively in terms of their diligence, capability or adherence to accepted norms. Variation in the mix and emphasis of judgements in institutional definitions was found across the university sector. Key Ideas • Policies include underlying attitudes towards the policy topic and to the institution’s students. • These attitudes can be illuminated via linguistic analysis of the judgments in text. • These judgments can be helpful in declaring the university’s stance towards, and framing of, plagiarism. • There is a range of attitudes expressed via judgments in institutional definitions of plagiarism across Australian universities. Discussion Question 1 What do you think the crucial functions of an institutional definition of plagiarism are, and how could analysing judgments contribute to understanding and honing these functions? Discussion Question 2 <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>consider</b> important elements in an institution’s stance on plagiarism – and might the emphasis of these differ between universities...|$|E
60|$|Of course I {{know that}} the properest way to {{demolish}} the Russian throne would be by revolution. But {{it is not possible}} to get up a revolution there; so the only thing left to do, apparently, is to keep the throne vacant by dynamite until a day when candidates shall decline with thanks. Then organize the Republic. And on the whole this method has some large advantages; for whereas a revolution destroys some lives which cannot well be spared, the dynamite way doesn't. Consider this: the conspirators against the Czar's life are caught in every rank of life, from the low to the high. And consider: if so many take an active part, where the peril is so dire, is this not evidence that the sympathizers who keep still and do not show their hands, are countless for multitudes?
