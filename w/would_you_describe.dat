6000|$|As mastiff dogs, {{in modern}} phrase, are Call'd Pompey, Scipio, and Caesar; As pies and daws are often styl'd With Christian nicknames, like a child; As we say Monsieur to an ape, Without offence to human shape; So men have got, from bird and brute, Names that would best their nature suit. The Lion, Eagle, Fox, and Boar, Were heroes' titles heretofore, Bestow'd as hi'roglyphics fit To show their valour, strength, or wit: For what is {{understood}} by fame, Besides the getting of a name? But, e'er since men invented guns, A diff'rent way their fancy runs: To paint a hero, we inquire For {{something that will}} conquer fire. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> Turenne[1] or Trump?[2] Think of a bucket or a pump.

First, then, our author has defined This reptile of the serpent kind, With gaudy coat, and shining train; But loathsome spots his body stain: Out from some hole obscure he flies, When rains descend, and tempests rise, Till the sun clears the air; and then Crawls back neglected to his den.[4] [...] So, when the war has raised a storm, I've seen a snake in human form, All stain'd with infamy and vice, Leap from the dunghill in a trice, Burnish and make a gaudy show, Become a general, peer, and beau, Till peace has made the sky serene, Then shrink into its hole again.

50|$|The metrics {{are used}} in {{conjunction}} with performance attributes. The Performance Attributes are characteristics of the supply chain that permit it to be analyzed and evaluated against other supply chains with competing strategies. Just as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>describe</b> a physical object like a piece of lumber using standard characteristics (e.g., height, width, depth), a supply chain requires standard characteristics to be described. Without these characteristics it is extremely difficult to compare an organization that chooses to be the low-cost provider against an organization that chooses to compete on reliability and performance.|$|R
