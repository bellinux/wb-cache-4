5|$|Emil Pagliarulo, {{a former}} writer at Looking Glass Studios, was {{commissioned}} by Bethesda to write the main script of Fallout 3; although he worked in part to 's script. Pagliarulo took charge of writing the incipit of Fallout 3, then played by Ron Perlman, {{and he tried to}} be inspired by first Fallout's incipit, in 1997, which he considered vitally important to describe the story that Fallout 3 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E
25|$|People {{believed}} {{that women who}} were not faithful to their husbands would experience prolonged labor, and male traditional healers would remark that a promiscuous woman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{every person in the}} room the number of men she has slept with apart from her husband before {{she would be able to}} give birth. Other traditional beliefs and practices related to laboring women included special herbs being used when the umbilical cord was wrapped around the neck of the fetus and for breech presentations, hot water poured on the abdomen and okra smeared on the vagina to expedite delivery, women who could not birth the placenta were given a bottle to blow into in order to force the placenta out, and a calabash of hot water was placed on the abdomen to stop postpartum hemorrhage and bleeding. Although many people have extensive knowledge of these traditional beliefs and practices, many indicate that most people no longer use them.|$|E
25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

2500|$|Bowes asked Gowrie {{again later}} in November, and wrote to Walsingham {{saying he had}} told Gowrie that Queen Mary was now {{claiming}} they were forgeries, and was hoping to obtain them herself to deface and destroy them (perhaps to further the [...] "Association".) Bowes argued that Mary had the means to steal them from Scotland {{and they would be}} safer in England. Gowrie said he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the King about the request and Bowes preferred not. In their next interview, Gowrie told Bowes that James VI already knew where the letters were.|$|E
2500|$|In Avengers: Children's Crusade, Cassie {{is killed}} by Doctor Doom, and Iron Lad decides {{to take her}} body into the future to be revived. [...] "Jonas" [...] protests, {{reasoning}} that such an action is {{more in line with}} Kang's manipulation of time than what Cassie would want, and Iron Lad murders him in a fit of jealous anger. Although his teammates contemplate rebuilding him, they decide against it, both because they lack the 30th-century technology to do so and because, even with their access to his back-ups, the lack of a back-up immediately prior to his death would mean that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him about Cassie's death all over again. Kate, Cassie's best friend, prefers to believe that he and Cassie are somehow together wherever they are now.|$|E
2500|$|Reeves and Nass {{designed}} {{an experiment}} in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At {{the end of the}} session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Reeves and Nass how they felt about that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.|$|E

2500|$|This {{game was}} played each week between one of the Bungalow Heads and DCI Harry Batt, portrayed by Ian Kirkby. In the game, the Bungalow Head was led into DCI Harry Batt's Interrogation Room (one of the rooms in the Bungalow), {{accompanied}} by either Dick or Dom. The Bungalow Head was then given a [...] "secret word" [...] by Dick or Dom, such as [...] "windows". DCI Harry Batt would then enter. A 90-second clock would start and the Bungalow Head <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> an elaborate story about why they had supposedly been arrested by DCI Harry Batt, saying their secret word {{as many times as}} possible in the story. Each mention of the secret word during the story was worth 20 Bungalow Points, and a running count of how many points the Bungalow Head had scored was shown on screen. However, {{at the end of the}} 90 seconds, DCI Harry Batt would then be given the opportunity to guess the Bungalow Head's secret word from the story they had told. If DCI Harry Batt correctly guessed the secret word, as happened on the majority of times the {{game was played}}, the Bungalow Head would score no points at all. If DCI Harry Batt was incorrect however, the Bungalow Head would keep all the points they had scored in the game.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if she was sure she wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E

60|$|The old {{man said}} nothing more. Had he spoken at all then it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her that he, too, was {{thinking}} of Luke {{and that there was}} perhaps not a single person in the magnificent house at that moment who was not--in some way or another--thinking of Luke.|$|R

6000|$|They met one day {{at their}} little seat upon the flying stage. The precise site of this meeting was where in Victorian times the road from Wimbledon came out upon the common. They were, however, five hundred feet above that point. Their seat looked far over London. To convey the {{appearance}} of it all to a nineteenth-century reader <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been difficult. One <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him <b>to</b> think of the Crystal Palace, of the newly built [...] "mammoth" [...] hotels--as those little affairs were called--of the larger railway stations of his time, and to imagine such buildings enlarged to vast proportions and run together and continuous over the whole metropolitan area. If then {{he was told that}} this continuous roof-space bore a huge forest of rotating wind-wheels, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> begun very dimly to appreciate what to these young people was the commonest sight in their lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} judge, who looked a trifle embarrassed, [...] "I guess you are right, and Larry <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you; but it's not a {{pleasant}} task to me. It is just this--we can't keep {{you and your husband}} any longer in this town." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty trembled a little. [...] "It {{is going}} to be the hardest thing I ever did. He is just dreadful in his {{quietness}} when he is angry--and I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him I had been meeting Larry and sending him dollars. You know what he would fancy." ...|$|E
6000|$|Descended to the ground, James Williams faced {{his captors}} with a smile. He was {{thinking}} {{what a good}} story he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> in Cloverdale about having been mistaken for a burglar. The Rubberneck coach lingered, {{out of respect for}} its patrons. What could be a more interesting sight than this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it, {{sooner or}} later, Mrs. Westangle would; and she only {{told it to}} Miss Macroyd this {{afternoon}} on compulsion, after Miss Macroyd and I had seen you in the wood-road, and Mrs. Westangle <b>had</b> <b>to</b> account for the young lady's presence there in your company. Then Miss Macroyd <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me; but I assure you, my dear fellow, the matter hasn't gone any further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Charmian!" [...] said Mrs. Maybough. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been hard}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{whether she was}} reproving the action or the urgence. [...] "Then we shall hope to see you?" ...|$|R
60|$|Arabel <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{all this}} a {{fortnight}} since, {{but one of}} my brothers has been ill with fever which was not exactly typhus, but of the typhoid character, {{and we knew that}} you would rather not see her under the circumstances. He is very much better (it is Octavius), and has been out of bed to-day and yesterday.|$|R
6000|$|Draper did {{not like}} his looks. [...] "Heaven forbid that I should say {{anything}} as between gentleman and gentleman,--but {{between me and my}} client, it's my duty to say, 'Sir, you are in a very unpleasant scrape,' just as a doctor <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his patient, 'Sir, you are very ill.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|But he {{knew that}} before very long he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> his wife {{of the changes that}} hung over their lives; it would be shabby to let the {{avalanche}} fall without giving the longest possible warning; and before they parted that night he took her hands in his and said: [...] "There is much I have to tell you, dear. Things change, the whole world changes. The church must not live in a dream....|$|E
6000|$|Aline shrugged her shoulders. [...] "You {{had better}} ask Sir Ralph {{and my mother}} for their views about me, Albert. It is not for a maid {{to make her own}} marriage, but a valiant knight like {{yourself}} can manage your own affairs, Methought perhaps that you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us that the Fleming's fair daughter was to assist you in the management of the castle that her father has given you." ...|$|E
60|$|Tommy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{her about}} Reddy, but forbore, because he still {{believed}} that he had acted criminally in that affair, and so {{for the time being}} the inquisition ended. But though he had already discovered all that Grizel knew about her mother and nearly all that curious Thrums ever ferreted out, he returned to the subject at the next meeting in the Den.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I suspect, for I {{found an}} {{invitation}} when I came home, I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> run down <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you, but I {{had been kept}} late, and one takes some getting up for polite society.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mama was {{speaking}} of a servant {{who had been}} pretty unveracious, but [...] was now [...] "trying <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth."

60|$|Gudrun {{went away}} in fury and loathing. The phrase, 'I pinched his little bottom for him,' sent {{her into a}} white, stony fury. She could not bear it, {{she wanted to have}} the woman taken out at once and strangled. And yet there the phrase was lodged in her mind for ever, beyond escape. She felt, one day, she <b>would</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him, to see how he took it. And she loathed herself for the thought.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you couldn't, Cornelia," [...] said Charmian solemnly. [...] "Some girls might; most girls would. They {{would just}} {{consider}} it a flirtation, and not say anything about it, or not till after they were engaged, and then just laugh. But you are different from other girls--you are so true! Yes, you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it if it killed you; I can see that; and you couldn't tell it, {{and you had to}} break his heart. Yes, you had to!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I have {{supposed}} that ladies occasionally shed tears of pity. If she accepted him conditionally she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her father about it."

60|$|That {{morning we}} again {{attended}} in the Throne Hall, and I {{could not help}} smiling to myself when I compared the visit to our last, and reflecting that, if walls could speak, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> strange tales <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here we are!' exclaimed that gentleman, {{emerging}} {{with his}} pretty companion from the corner; {{as he did}} so, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been hard <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> which was the redder in the face, he or the young lady with the black eyes.|$|R
