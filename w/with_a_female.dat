50|$|It was {{observed}} that when males mated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-sibling <b>female,</b> {{the duration of}} their copulation was prolonged, and consequently the males were cannibalized more frequently. When males mated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sibling <b>female,</b> they copulated briefly, and thus {{were more likely to}} escape cannibalism. By escaping, their chance of mating again <b>with</b> <b>a</b> non-kin <b>female</b> likely would be increased. These observations suggest that males can adaptively adjust their investment based on the degree of genetic relatedness of the female in order to avoid inbreeding depression.|$|R

5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Among {{domestic}} cats, {{males are}} more likely to fight than females. Among feral cats, the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female.</b> In such cases, most fights are won by the heavier male. Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home. Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens. Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases, suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 Wolf {{founded the}} airline company Cape Air, {{which at the}} time flew solely between Boston and Provincetown, Massachusetts. Since flying one route with eight {{employees}} and one plane, it has expanded to become the largest independent regionally based airline. Cape Air now serves parts of the East Coast, Midwestern United States, the Caribbean, and Micronesia with around 1,000 employees. In 1994, Nantucket Airlines was purchased by and became a subsidiary of Cape Air. Cape Air is an employee-owned company, and the only airline in the United States <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> President. Since being elected to the Massachusetts Senate, Wolf continues to pilot during the summer on weekends.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs of northeastern Oregon.|$|E
30|$|When not {{distinguishing}} plants {{depending on}} worker codetermination, intensified competition lowers the gender pay gap by 0.5 log points in plants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> below-average <b>female</b> share, {{which is not}} statistically significant. This levelling effect of product market competition is somewhat smaller (0.3 log points) in plants with some worker codetermination and much larger (2.0 log points) and statistically significant at the 5 per cent level in codetermination-free plants. Remarkably, competition {{has no effect on}} the gender pay gap in plants <b>with</b> <b>an</b> above-average <b>female</b> share. Since, according to theory, plants <b>with</b> <b>a</b> below-average <b>female</b> share are more discriminatory employers, these findings are suggestive that intensified product market competition indeed reduces gender discrimination stemming from employer prejudices against women.|$|R

5|$|Individual quaggas {{were also}} {{captured}} {{and shipped to}} Europe, where they were displayed in zoos. Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E

Although she struggled to find financiers for the film's $1 million (U.S.) budget, the production was eventually funded by John Sayles, Maggie Renzi and the Independent Film Channel.

5|$|Norbert Jacques {{wrote the}} {{original}} Dr. Mabuse {{books in the}} style of other popular thrillers in Europe at the time, such as Nick Carter, Fantomas, and Fu Manchu. Jacques expanded the traits of these books to include critiques on Weimar Germany. In 1930, Jacques was approached by a film producer to develop a story for a new Dr. Mabuse film <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> villain. This caused Jacques to start writing a new novel called Mabuse's Colony. In the novel, a character named Frau Kristine obtains a copy of Mabuse's testament which outlines plans for a future world of terrorism and crime that she uses.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{cannibalism}} {{is common}} among most predatory species of mantises in captivity. It {{has sometimes been}} observed in natural populations, where {{about a quarter of}} male-female encounters result in the male being eaten by the female. Around 90% of the predatory species of mantises participate in sexual cannibalism. Adult males typically outnumber females at first, but their numbers may be fairly equivalent later in the adult stage, possibly because females selectively eat the smaller males. In Tenodera sinensis, 83% of males escape cannibalism after an encounter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female,</b> but since multiple matings occur, the probability of a male's being eaten increases cumulatively.|$|E
5|$|The close {{relationship}} between the katipo and redback is shown when mating, The male redback is able to successfully mate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo can not mate with the female redback as the male katipo is heavier than the male redback and when it approaches the web it triggers a predatory response in the female leading to the katipo being eaten before mating occurs. There is evidence of interbreeding between katipo and redbacks in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose lineage includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus). This lineage probably diverged from other falcons {{towards the end of}} the Late Miocene or in the Early Pliocene, about 5–8million years ago (mya). As the peregrine-hierofalcon group includes both Old World and North American species, it is likely that the lineage originated in western Eurasia or Africa. Its relationship to other falcons is not clear, as the issue is complicated by widespread hybridization confounding mtDNA sequence analyses. For example, a genetic lineage of the saker falcon (F.cherrug) is known which originated from a male saker producing fertile young <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>female</b> peregrine ancestor, and the descendants further breeding with sakers.|$|E
