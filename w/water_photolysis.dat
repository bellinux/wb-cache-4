In this work the photodegradation mechanism and pathways of sunscreen agent 2 -phenylbenzimidazole- 5 -sulfonic acid (PBSA) were investigated under artificial solar irradiation {{with the goal of}} assessing the potential of photolysis as a transformation mechanism in aquatic environments. The quantum yield of PBSA direct photolysis in pH 6. 8 buffer solution under filtered mercury lamp irradiation was determined as 2. 70 x 10 (- 4). Laser flash photolysis (LFP) experiments confirmed the involvement of PBSA radical cation (PBSA(center dot+)) during direct photolysis. Acidic or basic condition facilitated PBSA direct photolysis in aqueous solution. Indirect photolysis out-competes direct photolysis as a major process for PBSA attenuation only at higher level of photosensitizers (e. g., NO 3 - > 2 mM). Thus, direct photolysis {{is likely to be the}} major loss pathway responsible for the elimination of PBSA in natural sunlit surface <b>waters,</b> while indirect <b>photolysis</b> (e. g., mediated by HO center dot.) appeared to be less important due to a general low level of steady-state concentration of HO center dot ([HO center dot](ss)) in natural surface <b>waters.</b> Direct <b>photolysis</b> pathways of PBSA includes desulfonation and benzimidazole ring cleavage, which are probably initiated by the excited triplet state ((3) PBSA*) and radical cation (PBSA(center dot+)). Conversely, hydroxylation products of PBSA and 2 -phenyl- 1 H-benzimidazole as well as their ring opening intermediates were found in nitrate-induced PBSA photolysis, suggesting the indirect photodegradation was primarily mediated by HO center dot and followed a different mechanism.
