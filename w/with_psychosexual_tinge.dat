[...] However, a clinically grounded qualitative distinction between psychosexual maturity and immaturity was only introduced with Reich's concept orgastic potency vs. orgastic impotence (instead of vaginal vs. clitoral).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{gain insight}} into patients' {{experiences}} of follow-up care after treatment for prostate cancer and identify unmet psychosexual needs. METHODS: Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a purposive sample of 35 patients aged 59 - 82 from three UK regions. Partners were included in 18 interviews. Data were analyzed using constant comparison. RESULTS: (1) Psychosexual problems gained importance over time, (2) men felt they were rarely invited to discuss psychosexual side effects within follow-up appointments and lack of rapport with health care professionals made it difficult to raise problems themselves, (3) problems were sometimes concealed or accepted and professionals' attempts to explore potential difficulties were resisted by some, and (4) older patients were too embarrassed to raise psychosexual concerns as they felt they would be considered 'too old' to be worried about the loss of sexual function. CONCLUSION: Men with prostate cancer, even the very elderly, have psychosexual issues for variable times after diagnosis. These are not currently always addressed at the appropriate time for the patient.

40|$|Introduction: Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) comprises of various procedures that damage female genitalia for non-therapeutic intentions, and it offers multidimensional and interdependent effects. Objectives: The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether FGM versus non-FGM couples in Kermanshah in Iran vary in relationship characteristics, such as relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, and mental health. Methods: To achieve this goal of research, a sample of 414 couples (206 FGM couples and 208 normal couples) of Uramanat area in Kermanshah Province, were selected by non-randomized sampling. Enrich Marital Inventory, 25 -SCL Mental Health Inventory and the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale were used for data collection. Data were analyzed between the two groups by utilizing independent t-test. The significance level was P < 0. 05. Results: The findings indicated that there was a significant difference between FGM couples and normal couples. Besides, the results revealed that the two groups of participants had significant differences in mental health, marital satisfaction, and sexual function. Overall, FGM couples compared with normal couples had lower levels of mental health, marital satisfaction, and sexual function. Conclusion: FGM is associated <b>with</b> frequent <b>psychosexual</b> difficulties in Uramanat couples; notably orgasm difficulties, sense of incomplete sexual-needs fulfillment, and neurotic symptoms.

40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} (ED) is {{a common}} condition, which although not life threatening does have a signifi-cant effect on a patient’s quality of life. 1, 2 More than 20 million men in the United States suffer from ED. 1 Sildenafil, the initial phosphodiesterase- 5 (PDE- 5) in-hibitor available since 1998, is a relatively effective and acceptable treatment for men with ED. 3 Several factors may affect the identification of ED and the prescription of sildenafil by health care providers. Direct-to-con-sumer advertising may have affected prescribing by increasing public awareness of ED and its treatments, making patients more likely to discuss ED with their health care provider. 4 The use of sildenafil as a recreational drug by in-dividuals without ED is also of concern. 5 The contro-versial role of lifestyle drugs, concerns about demand, prescribing pressure, and appropriate prescribing of sildenafil led in 1999 to a rationing debate in the British National Health Service, and an observational study by Ashworth et al found modest levels of demand with few inappropriate prescriptions by general practitioners. 6 Of further concern is a recent article that describes an increase in sildenafil use by younger male and female patients without an indication for appropriate use. 7 However, {{this study did not}} use physician-reported diagnoses to establish an indication for use. Instead, it used administrative claims data to infer drug- or disease-induced ED. It is unknown how sildenafil has been incorporated into clinical practice in the United States. 8 This study’s objectives are to describe the patient, provider, and visit characteristics where a sildenafil prescription was provided and to identify the characteristics associated with having a documented reason for visit or diagnosis consistent <b>with</b> <b>psychosexual</b> dysfunction or ED.

40|$|AbstractPremature {{ejaculation}} (PE) is {{the most}} common male sexual disorder, and it may have a profound negative impact on a man and his partner's lives. Different organizations and societies have no consensus on the definition and classifications of PE. However, most organizations and societies include in their definitions the intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT), the control of ejaculation, and the distress or impact of interpersonal difficulties. Evaluation procedures have been standardized in clinical studies by the development of an objective measurement of IELT (using a stopwatch) and by the introduction of patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires on ejaculation control and sexual satisfaction. The identification of four different patterns of PE—lifelong, acquired, normal variant, and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction—is critical because of different underlying pathogeneses and consequently different management approaches. The optimal treatment for PE should be individualized, based on a patient's symptoms, expectations, and underlying variant causes. Most lifelong PE patients need pharmacotherapy (possibly in combination <b>with</b> <b>psychosexual</b> counseling) as a first-line treatment because of the underlying neurobiological etiology and the impact of PE on the couple's relationship. The management of acquired PE is etiologically specific and may include pharmacotherapy for erectile function management in men with comorbid erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with natural variable PE complain of early ejaculation in situational or coincidental conditions; the ejaculation is inconsistent and occurs irregularly. Psychoeducation and reassurance are indicated for men with this type of PE. Psychotherapy or sex counseling is the first choice of treatment for men with premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction. All pharmacotherapies such as long-term selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or on-demand topical anesthetics are off-label indications, The benefits of pharmacotherapy toward improving ejaculation times should be weighed against their safety profiles. The development of the short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) dapoxetine hydrochloride (30  mg and 60  mg) for oral on-demand use opened a new era of PE treatment. Other potential pharmacotherapies such as tramadol, lidocaine/prilocaine spray, and phosphodiesterase inhibitors are still under development. Their safety and efficacy profiles should be further evaluated and supported by additional clinical studies...|$|R

Discussion The initial evaluation of male urinary incontinence usually occurs in general practice, and the basic work-up aims to identify reversible causes. First-line treatment is conservative management, such as lifestyle interventions, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, and bladder retraining.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to ascertain whether Early Memories could be scored along scales of Narcissism and Psychosexual Stages, and further whether these scores would correspond with scores on Narcissism and Psychosexual Stages obtained from the Thematic Apperception Test, thus lending support to the theoretical conceptualization that Early Memories are screen memories which can be examined as projective devices expressive of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s enduring character traits and prototypical dilemmas. In addition, this study examined whether specific kinds of narcissistic styles in individuals correspond <b>with</b> specific <b>psychosexual</b> stages; and <b>with</b> the number of psychosexual stages expressed; and with another measure of narcissism, the discrepancy between self and self-ideal on a self report inventory. These latter questions are an outgrowth of the recent developmental theories of narcissism that regard it as accompanying all stages of development and having the potential of being either healthy or pathological, rather than the earlier views that posited narcissism to be inherently pathological and indicative of early fixations. High interjudge reliability was established on a pilot study of 20 subjects, and on the subsequent main sample of 60 subjects where Early Memories and TATs were scored for Narcissism and Psychosexual Stage. Significant correlations were obtained between EM and TAT results for Narcissism by both judges, for Psychosexual Stages by one judge. Those who had Healthy Narcissism scores did have lower self, self-ideal discrepancy than those who had injured Narcissism scores. No specific narcissistic designation correlated <b>with</b> any one <b>psychosexual</b> stage, and neither did any one narcissistic designation correlate with the number of psychosexual stages expressed.

Topical chemotherapeutic agents, laser ablation, radiotherapy, Mohs micrographic surgery, glansectomy and partial penectomy have been frequently used to interfere as little as possible with functional anatomy without compromising local cancer control. The difficulty with these phallus-preserving techniques is the potential risk of disease recurrence both locally and distally.

40|$|A {{large number}} of morphological, {{physiological}} and behavioural traits are differentially expressed by males and females in all vertebrates including humans. These sex differences, sometimes, reflect the different hormonal environment of the adults, but they often remain present after subjects of both sexes are placed in the same endocrine conditions following gonadectomy associated or not with hormonal replacement therapy. They are then the result of combined influences of organizational actions of sex steroids acting early during development, or genetic differences between the sexes, or epigenetic mechanisms differentially affecting males and females. Sexual partner preference is a sexually differentiated behavioural trait that is clearly controlled in animals by {{the same type of}} mechanisms. This is also probably true in humans, even if critical experiments that would be needed to obtain scientific proof of this assertion are often impossible for pragmatic or ethical reasons.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Anorectal malformations (ARMs) and Hirschsprung's disease (HD) are {{congenital}} malformations requiring pelvic floor surgery in early childhood, with possible sequelae for psychosexual development. AIMS: To assess psychosexual well-being in adult ARM and HD patients related to health-related quality of life. METHODS: Eligible for this cross-sectional two-center study were all patients aged >/= 18 years {{who had been}} operated for ARM or HD. Exclusion criteria were intellectual disability, comorbidity affecting sexual functioning, and cloacal malformation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed the International Index of Erectile Functioning, Female Sexual Functioning Index, Female Sexual Distress Scale, Hirschsprung and Anorectal Malformation Quality of Life Questionnaire, and sexual education questionnaire. RESULTS: Response rates were 32 % and 37 % for ARM and HD patients, respectively. We studied 70 participating ARM and 36 HD patients (median age 26 years). We excluded 10 patients with sexual inactivity in the past 4 weeks. Six of 37 men with ARM (16 %) reported moderate to severe erectile dysfunction, vs. two of 18 men with HD (11 %). Thirteen and 10 of 26 women with ARM (50 % and 38 %) reported sexual dysfunction or sexual distress, respectively, vs. eight and three of 15 women with HD (53 % and 20 %). Quality of life and type of malformation or operation were not associated <b>with</b> self-reported <b>psychosexual</b> problems.

40|$|This paper {{details the}} process of art therapy with a latency-aged boy {{experiencing}} mild to moderate adjustment difficulties and negotiating conflicts associated with the Oedipal complex. A discussion of Freud's Oedipus complex (as cited in Ellenberger, 1970) and associated theories is provided. The case study format, which includes descriptions of the client's sessions and artworks, is used to elucidate the use of art therapy in addressing developmental issues. The literature review explores potential links between Oedipal conflicts, object relations, and a related application of psychodynamic art therapy. While current literature emphasizes the use of art therapy with children facing more severe, pathological difficulties, it is contended that art therapy can provide an excellent means of addressing and supporting challenges and transitions associated <b>with</b> children's normative <b>psychosexual</b> development. It is proposed that three theoretical constructs, a Neo-Freudian approach, attachment theory, and object relations theory, may be used complimentarily to inform and enhance psychodynamic art therapy practice. Discussion of the client's therapeutic process focuses on his movement towards self-definition as he redefines his object world through creative expression and increased agency, facilitated by art therapy. His process points to the efficacy of a psychodynamic, developmentally oriented art therapy approach...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDRisk {{factors for}} {{impairment}} in psychosexual development and satisfaction among adult survivors of childhood cancer are poorly understood. The authors compared psychosexual outcomes between survivors and healthy controls, and tested whether at-risk survivors {{can be identified}} by 1) treatment neurotoxicity or 2) diagnosis. METHODSA total of 144 young adult survivors of childhood cancer and 144 matched controls completed questionnaires regarding psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with relationship status. Survivors were aged 20 to 40 years and were 5 to 34 years after diagnosis. Using medical chart data, survivors were divided into non-neurotoxic (48 survivors), low-dose (36 survivors), and high-dose (58 survivors) neurotoxic treatment groups. RESULTSApart from having fewer lifetime sex partners, survivors {{did not appear to}} differ from controls. However, survivors of brain tumors and any survivor who received high-dose neurotoxic treatment reported the lowest rates of achieving milestones of psychosexual development, whereas sexual and relationship status satisfaction were found to be related to relationship status. Neurotoxic treatment intensity further distinguished between survivors of brain tumors <b>with</b> and without <b>psychosexual</b> impairment. CONCLUSIONSThe intensity of neurotoxic treatment may be a valuable indicator of risk for psychosexual impairment relative to diagnosis alone. Health care providers should assess romantic/sexual problems among survivors at risk and make referrals if needed. Cancer 2017; 123 : 1869 - 1876. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society. The results of the current study indicate that adult survivors of childhood cancer do not differ from healthy controls with regard to their psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and relationship status satisfaction. However, more intense neurotoxic treatment appears to be associated with a higher risk of psychosexual impairment, and may be a more meaningful risk indicator than diagnostic category alone...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the pathway to care among patients with Dhat syndrome and to study the factors leading to delay in seeking professional psychiatric help. Materials and Methods: Forty-seven patients diagnosed with Dhat syndrome as per the International Classification of Diseases- 10 criteria were assessed for sociodemographic and clinical details and information regarding previous treatment taken to determine the pathways to care at their first contact <b>with</b> the outpatient <b>psychosexual</b> clinic. Results: Majority of the patients were single (70. 2 %), received formal education for at least more than 10 years (66. 0 %), were employed (59. 6 %), followers of Hinduism (68. 1) and from middle socio-economic class (59. 6 %), nuclear family setup (53. 2 %), and rural locality (63. 8 %). Comorbidity in the form of any psychiatric illness or sexual dysfunction was present on 61. 7 % of the patients. The mean age at onset of symptoms of Dhat syndrome was 20. 38 years (standard deviation [SD] - 6. 91). The mean duration of symptoms of Dhat before the patients presented to our psychosexual clinic was 6. 78 years (SD - 6. 94) while the mean number of agencies/help contacted before was 2. 85 (SD - 1. 40; range: 1 – 5). The favorite choice for the first contact was indigenous practitioners, followed by asking for help from friends or relatives, allopathic doctors, and traditional faith healers or pharmacists. The preference to visit indigenous practitioners gradually declined at each stage. Ayurvedic doctors remained the most preferred among all indigenous practitioners. The absence of any comorbid sexual dysfunction in patients with Dhat syndrome predicted an earlier visit to our center as compared to the patients with any comorbid sexual dysfunction. Conclusions: Majority of the patients with Dhat syndrome present very late to specialized psychosexual clinics. There is a need for improving the sexual knowledge and attitude at the community level which will facilitate the early help seeking in patients with Dhat syndrome...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} age - related {{decline in the}} various {{available}} measures and estimates of serum testosterone levels in men. Testosterone circulates predominantly bound with high affinity to sex - hormone binging globulin (SHBG) in plasma (~ 60 %) and with lower affinity to albumin (< 40 %); approximately 1 - 2 % circulates unbound in plasma. It is the albumin - bound and free fractions (termed " bioavailable testosterone ") that {{are most likely to}} have biological effects on target tissues. This thesis reports the establishment, validation and derivation of normal ranges for an ammonium sulphate precipitation method for the measurement of bioavailable testosterone in serum. This method is in use by a number of laboratories at present including the laboratory of Professor John Morley at St Louis University with whom we collaborated. Testosterone has been shown, both cross - sectionally and longitudinally, to decline progressively beginning around the age of thirty. Total testosterone declines at approximately 0. 4 % per year while bioavailable and free testosterone decline at approximately 1. 2 % per year. The mechanisms that may be responsible for this include age - related changes to the hypothalamic - pituitary - testicular axis, increased SHBG levels, environmental factors, medication and chronic illness. This decline may contribute to a multitude of physiological, psychosexual and cognitive changes associated with ageing in men. This thesis crosssectionally examines the possible determinants of the various fractions of serum testosterone and the associations <b>with</b> various physical, <b>psychosexual</b> and lifestyle variables and with chronic disease and medication use. These cross - sectional data were generated from the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing study, which randomly recruited 568 men from the north and west suburbs of Adelaide, between August 2001 and August 2002. Moreover, this thesis includes a randomised controlled trial of testosterone replacement therapy in men aged 60 years and over with low - normal testosterone levels at baseline, recruited by newspaper advertisement. The goals of testosterone replacement therapy might be to prevent osteoporosis, age related frailty and falls, and to maintain optimal physical, sexual, emotional and cognitive health during the ageing process. This intervention study focused on the effect of treatment on body composition and muscle strength, symptoms of testosterone deficiency, visuospatial cognition, mood, wellbeing and quality of life. Finally, preliminary work was initiated to develop an in vitro bioassay for the measurement of serum testosterone bio - action. This was done using a transient transfection protocol in cultured cells, where androgen receptor and androgen response elements were introduced into the cells, subsequently treated with testosterone containing media and the amplitude of response quantified using a dual - luciferasereporter assay. In summary, this thesis discusses the issues with the measurement of testosterone in plasma and the factors that determine the concentration of the various fractions of testosterone in plasma. A cross - sectional study, using random recruitment procedures was used to investigate associations between testosterone levels and health - related - factors and finally a randomised - controlled - trial of testosterone replacement in ageing men with low - normal testosterone levels is reported. Throughout the thesis, the following themes are common; body composition, physical function and strength, sexual function, lower urinary tract symptoms and the prostate, visuospatial cognition, mood, quality - of - life and wellbeing.
