25|$|Example: <b>We</b> <b>visit</b> every {{household}} {{in a given}} street, and interview {{the first person to}} answer the door. In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} answer the door (e.g. an unemployed person who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E
25|$|Example: We want to {{estimate}} the total income of adults living in a given street. <b>We</b> <b>visit</b> each household in that street, identify all adults living there, and randomly select one adult from each household. (For example, we can allocate each person a random number, generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1, and select {{the person with the}} highest number in each household). We then interview the selected person and find their income.|$|E
500|$|Michaels accused Al Davis {{of getting}} the {{officials}} to inspect Turner's kicking shoes before a field goal attempt {{to see if they}} contained illegal metal plates, and called the Oakland team official [...] "a man who has never contributed anything to football", to which Davis responded, [...] "It's utterly ridiculous, unbelievable. It seems the Jets always lose to us because of penalties. But I like them and don't want any feud in case <b>we</b> <b>visit</b> New York December 29 [...] ". The Jets left their white road uniforms in Oakland to be laundered and sent to them in San Diego, where they were to play their next game. The uniforms were not seen again once the team removed them in the Oakland locker room, and Jets management hastily ordered the green home uniforms, as well as the white uniforms the team had worn in the preseason, to be shipped from New York.|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} of {{additional}} filming, involving the film's main cast and crew, occurred in March 2014 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. In April 2014, Gunn described Thanos as the [...] "head of the snake" [...] in the film, and confirmed he would appear via performance capture. In May 2014, Gunn stated that the film features an [...] "enormous" [...] amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe, adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date. Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying, [...] "We really, really get {{the feeling of the}} scale and scope of the galaxy. <b>We</b> <b>visit</b> five planets, we see a hundred different races." [...] The film introduces the alien race Sakaaran, who act as Ronan's mercenaries, as a replacement to the Badoon, as the Badoon film rights belonged to 20th Century Fox.|$|E

[...] These problems span the hermeneutical spectrum, from the most basic units of linguistic meaning to such technical intellectual disciplines as law and philosophy and all points in between. [...] A major underlying difficulty encountered at all levels is the Qur'an's lack of structure.

40|$|This {{report will}} focus on the {{problems}} of material costs, in particular as they are affected by relations with suppliers. The Shipbuilding Supply Chain Integration Project was designed to improve understanding of best practices in supply chain management in the marine industry. The project focused on US shipyards and suppliers, foreign shipyards and suppliers, and a US construction firm. The intent was to obtain a baseline to show how the US marine industry acts as compared to the foreign marine industry and a somewhat comparable non-marine industry in the US. This report documents results from the Shipbuilding Supply Chains study. Results are presented in two ways. First, we describe specific findings from the firms <b>we</b> <b>visited.</b> This is done by characterizing best practices at specific companies and by making comparisons between different types of companies. Second, we present a case study for each firm <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> in the project. The report ends with conclusions and recommendations to the shipbuilding industry for how they can improve supply chain management. As part of the project <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> ten shipyards: Alabama Shipbuilding, Avondale Industries, Halter Marine, Newport News Shipbuilding, and NASSCO, in the US; Astilleros Espanoles, Fincantieri and Odense Steel Shipyard in Europe, and Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding and Sumitomo Heavy Industries in Japan. <b>We</b> <b>visited</b> ten suppliers: Hopeman Brothers Marine Interiors and Jamestown Metal Manufacturing in the US, MacGregor (Gothenburg), MAN B&W (Copenhagen and Augsburg), Cegelec (US and Britain), Tsuji in Japan, and three small suppliers in Spain. In addition, <b>we</b> <b>visited</b> one non-marine firm, Black and Veatch, one of the largest construction firms in the world...|$|R
