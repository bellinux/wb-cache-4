5|$|As a child, Carey {{lived with}} her mother Patricia in a small {{apartment}} on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs. As a result, Carey frequently transferred into different schools, and {{at the age of}} seventeen, she moved into a small Manhattan studio with other young women to pursue a career in music. She had already begun working on her demo tape <b>with</b> <b>Ben</b> Margulies, a classmate at her school in Huntington, Long Island. During this period, she lived a lifestyle of poverty, often sharing a box of spaghetti with her five roommates and wearing torn shoes. She held several jobs, while juggling school, writing, and recording music.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives.

He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents.

5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon {{in the months}} before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate arsenic poisoning. Arsenic was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book <b>with</b> <b>Ben</b> Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. Arsenic is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E

5|$|Mariah Carey is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey, {{released}} on June 12, 1990 by Columbia Records.
