Araya's younger brother, Johnny Araya, who was thirteen or fourteen at the time, was a roadie who set up the back line and sound. The band hardly made enough money to sustain themselves, only buying the [...] "essentials" [...] such as food, gas, and beer. Araya asserts, [...] "We basically used whatever money we got to get from point A to point B. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> Brian was like, 'So, where's the money?' And we were like, 'What money?' At that time, we didn't realize that you had to ask for money up front. I think he got a lot of money sent directly to him, and we were supposed to pick up the rest." ...|$|E

Once the tour took flight, King worked tirelessly to promote it {{even though many of}} the other top players were not supportive. [...] "For three years we had two tours and because of their governments Martina Navratilova and Olga Morozova had to play the other tour. Chris Evert, Margaret Court, Virginia Wade, they let us do the pioneering work and they weren't very nice to us.

2500|$|When he was 16, {{and still}} in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish {{children}} in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then {{became aware of the}} possibility of writing his own songs. [...] "And the next thing, I got a guitar <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs," [...] he said.

2500|$|During {{production}} on Kingdom of the Sun, Andreas Deja was the initial supervising animator of Yzma, and incorporated supermodeling poses published in magazines {{in order to}} capture Yzma's sultry, seductive persona. Nik Ranieri was originally slated as the supervising animator for Yzma's rocky sidekick, Hucua. During the research trip to Peru in 1996, Ranieri acknowledged that [...] "I was researching for a character {{that looked like a}} rock so I was stuck drawing rocks for the whole trip. Then <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> they piled it into this story about ancient Incas." [...] Mark Pudleiner was to be the supervising animator of Kuzco's proposed maiden, Nina. In early 1997, David Pruiksma came on board to animate the llama, Snowball. According to Pruiksma, Snowball was [...] "a silly, vain and egotistical character, rather the dumb blond of the llama set. I really enjoyed developing the character and doing some early test animation on her as well. Before I left the film (and it was ultimately shelved), I created model sheets for not only Snowball, {{but for the rest of}} the herd of seven other llamas and for Kuzco as a Llama." [...] When the film was placed on production shutdown, Pruiksma transferred to work on [...] being developed concurrently and ultimately the llama characters were dropped from the storyline.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{recording}} Book Burner, Pig Destroyer {{built their}} own studio, Visceral Sound. As Blake Harrison, who plays electronic instruments for the band, explained, the band [...] "all {{had a hand}} in building it" [...] after getting kicked out of their practice space (a basement in former drummer Brian Harvey's parents' house) several years earlier. Scott Hull explained that the time spent building and moving into a new studio, which also served as the band's new practice space, attracted [...] "a big liability of falling into a kind of a slump. So <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>back</b> to where <b>we</b> were practicing in the new place, we were out of practice, trying to get back into fighting shape for new material, let alone the old setlist material.

[...] "We went down there, took off our shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our picture taken.

5000|$|Walter Hill {{admitted}} {{there were}} [...] "some difficult moments" [...] {{arising out of}} changing the story from a film to a mini series.I think the arguments came about because nobody {{wanted to make it}} something other than what it was. We all understood that if this thing was going to be any good, you needed to stick with what had made it good up to that point and try to develop that further rather than to introduce some entirely new format and style. But {{at the same time you}} are going to have to change it because if you were going to go from the 125 page script to the 160 pages or whatever I certainly felt that a few more narrative events might not be a bad idea. I thought we had plenty of sitting around the fire and talking things over. Duvall requested that they restore some of the previous focus: [...] "And I said, 'You'd better get it back to the way it was,' and they began to rewrite and we rewrote. We had to because it was going off in the wrong direction," [...] said Duvall, explaining that the altered script had a new and, to him, unwarranted emphasis on [...] "gunfights" [...] and other [...] "very obvious, melodramatic" [...] plot devices.

He played in 32 of Arsenal's 38 unbeaten Premier League games during the season. His next season started equally impressively, as he scored the first goal in Arsenal's 3-1 Community Shield win over Manchester United at the Millennium Stadium. During the opening games of the season, he started to experience severe pain in his back, and after a match at Bolton Wanderers on 27 September 2004, a scan revealed he had fractured his back. At first {{it was reported that}} he would be out of action for a month. Later reports suggested the injury could be season-threatening.

500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop where you could see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the video <b>back</b> and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'"
