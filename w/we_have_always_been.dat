500|$|On August 20, 2009, Lamoriello {{announced}} that the Devils would wear their classic red, white and green jerseys on their Saint Patrick's Day 2010 game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. Lamoriello stated, [...] "The original red, green and white jerseys {{are a part of}} our history here in New Jersey. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> an organization that takes great pride in its tradition. This is something we believe our fans will enjoy for that one special night." [...] Martin Brodeur wore a special replica helmet of the one from his first NHL game, as the Devils defeated the Penguins, 5–2. The throwback jerseys were used seven more times, three of which took place on St. Patrick's Day. In 2014, they were used twice: January 26 against the Rangers in the 2014 NHL Stadium Series, and March 18 against the Bruins.|$|E
2500|$|Greenpeace {{responded with}} apologies, {{claiming}} that demonstrators {{took care to}} avoid damage, but this is contradicted by video and photographs showing the activists wearing conventional shoes (not special protective shoes) while walking on the site. The organization stated they were surprised that this resulted [...] "in some kind of moral offense." [...] Conversely, they stood by [...] "...history of more than 40 years of peaceful activism [...] clearly shows that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> most respectful with {{people around the world}} and their diverse cultural legacies." [...] Greenpeace members were allowed to leave Peru without being charged.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, {{the band}} Inhabited {{mentioned}} BarlowGirl in an [...] "uncensored" [...] remix of its [...] "Hush" [...] single. Inhabited released the album The Revolution in 2005 with then-fellow record label Fervent Records, but left the label in 2007 and signed with 7Spin Music for its album Love in 2008. The remix, {{which was a}} free download, included lyrics such as [...] "We're gonna beat that system in a round about way / Won't make sucky music so my records will play" [...] and [...] "Something more like BarlowGirl, do something right / Ain’t got nothing against ‘em but it just ain’t me", causing controversy in the Christian music community. Inhabited responded by saying: [...] "it wasn't to bash or put them down, it just says our art is a different style. They have achieved great success, and we would wish them no less! [...] Lastly, [...] we thought [...] a fun, cool remix. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> straightforward with our lyrics and always will be." ...|$|E

6000|$|She held herself {{apart from}} him at her arm's length, and said, [...] "Wait!

Did you despise me for letting you kiss me before we were engaged?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was indeed}} my aim to save {{all those people}} whose {{suffering}} was indescribable: [...] some had lost their spouses, others had no news of missing children, others had seen their loved ones succumb to the German bombings which occurred every day and did not spare the terrified refugees.... There was another aspect {{that should not be}} overlooked: [...] the fate of many people if they fell {{into the hands of the}} enemy.... eminent people of many countries with whom <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> on excellent terms: statesmen, ambassadors and ministers, generals and other high officers, professors, men of letters, ... officers from armies of countries that had been occupied, Austrians, Czechs and Poles, who would be shot as rebels; there were also many Belgians, Dutch, French, Luxembourgers and even English... Many were Jews who were already persecuted and sought to escape the horror of further persecution. Finally an endless number of women attempting to avoid being at the mercy of Teutonic sensuality. [...] I could not differentiate between nationalities as I was obeying the dictates of humanity that distinguish between neither race nor nationality; as for the charge of dishonorable conduct, when I left Bayonne I was applauded by hundreds of people, and through me it was Portugal that was being honored...." ...|$|E
2500|$|During season {{three of}} Dancing with the Stars {{in the fall}} of 2006, DeLay, a big fan of the show {{according}} to his wife, made his then-biggest foray back into the public spotlight after his resignation from Congress when he launched a public campaign urging people to vote for one of the show's contestants, his [...] "good friend, country music singer and GOP supporter" [...] Sara Evans, in order to promote [...] "good American values in the media" [...] and combat [...] "smut on television", about a month before a very ugly public break-up, complete with dueling and graphic accusations of adultery and pornography, of Evans' marriage to Republican politico Craig Schelske, which caused Evans to withdraw from the competition on October 12, 2006, midway through the show's season. In early September 2006, ahead of the season three premiere episode, DeLay wrote, [...] "Sara Evans has been a strong supporter of the Republican Party and represents good American values in the media. From singing at the 2004 Republican Convention to appearing with candidates in the last several election cycles, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> able to count on Sara for her support of the things we all believe in.... One of her opponents on the show is controversial talk show host Jerry Springer. We need {{to send a message to}} Hollywood and the media that smut has no place on television by supporting good people like Sara Evans. Sara will be a great representative of the values that we want to see in the media, and we should all support her to keep her on the show as long as possible." ...|$|E

50|$|Wes buys {{a number}} of old books at the auction {{including}} {{one of the most}} famous books of magick, The Red Compendium, which is infamous for absorbing those who read it. <b>Wes</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a sucker for literature and soon finds he can't put it down even if he wants to.|$|R
60|$|It <b>is</b> true that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{prepared}} for winter, wherever <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lived; {{but this was}} a different case. In other days it did not matter much whether we were ready or not; but now our house, our cow, our poultry, and indeed ourselves, might have suffered,--there is no way of finding out exactly how much,--if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not made all possible preparations for the coming of cold weather.|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{a letter}} from Elsa Doland, too. Bubbling over with affection. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{tremendous}} friends. Of course, she never knew anything about my being engaged to Gerald. I lent Fillmore {{the money to buy}} that piece, which gave Elsa her first big chance, and so she's very grateful. She says, if ever she gets the opportunity of doing me a good turn... Aren't things muddled? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> good friends, haven't we? Now, child, {{you always}} used {{to give me a}} kiss before I left you then. Mayn't I have one now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so, uncle? Why, {{it seems to}} me that I know all about you, just the same as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> together, and I <b>am</b> sure I <b>always</b> told you all about myself, even when I was bad at school and got into scrapes, because you said {{particularly}} that you liked me to tell you everything, and did not want to know only the good side of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Billy," [...] {{said the}} artist, delicately {{fingering}} a cigarette. [...] "You remember, {{when we were}} on our way to the East how we talked about this great, wonderful city, and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us? We were going to be just the same fellows <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been,</b> and never let it master us. It has downed you, old man. You have changed from a maverick into a butterick." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; I think I may say I {{have been}} {{intimate}} with them. I {{had been at}} Eton and at Christ Church with Silverbridge, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> much together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, mamma? Wherever we have been, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> together. Mrs. Bluestone {{was quite}} unhappy {{because you would}} not come. They are so good-natured! I wish you would go there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{do you say}} I don't think {{anything}} of you, Mary? Of course, it isn't true. Besides, you are my cousin, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> good friends since {{you were a little}} thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goodman, however, {{points out}} that the {{predicate}} [...] "grue" [...] only appears more complex than the predicate [...] "green" [...] because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> defined grue in terms of blue and green. If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> brought up {{to think in terms of}} [...] "grue" [...] and [...] "bleen" [...] (where bleen is blue before time t, or green thereafter), we would intuitively consider [...] "green" [...] to be a crazy and complicated predicate. Goodman believed that which scientific hypotheses we favour depend on which predicates are [...] "entrenched" [...] in our language.|$|R
5000|$|Gee was {{appointed}} assistant manager at recently relegated League Two club Notts County on 10 May 2004 {{to be reunited}} Mills, thus fulfilling the promise Mills made to Gee when the pair started working together that they {{would go on to}} manage the Nottinghamshire club. Mills was dismissed on 4 November 2004, with Gee's departure coming a week later after his contract with the club was terminated. He commented in retrospect that [...] "What happened at Notts County devastated us both. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> successful until then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] {{another officer}} said.

6000|$|... "Your Majesty, {{we should}} esteem some further {{particulars}} as to this {{action on the}} part of the Duke of Reist. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> accustomed to consider him one of the born leaders of this country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it would," [...] said Mrs. Bulstrode, {{with some}} return of energy. [...] "Poor Walter is so cast down; I would try {{anything}} {{in my power to}} do him some good before I go away. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> brother and sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is just as}} I suspected," [...] Malcolm said in Ronald's ear. [...] "There is a {{peephole}} somewhere, otherwise {{there could}} be no occasion for him to have dropped the lamp. It is well that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> on our guard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I was {{at school}} at Marysville until {{he took me}} away. I saw little of him {{for the past two}} years, for he had {{business}} in the mountains--very rough business, where he couldn't take me, for it kept him away from the settlements for weeks. I think {{it had something to do}} with cattle, for he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>having</b> a new horse. I was all alone before that, too; I had no other relations; I <b>had</b> no friends. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> moving about so much, my brother and I.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said I, [...] "I will. In {{the first}} place, we've got {{to act as}} if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> waited on and had never been {{satisfied}} with the way it was done; we've got to let people think that we think we are a good deal better than they are, and what they think about it doesn't make the least difference; and then again we've got to live in better quarters than these, and whatever they may be we must make people think that we don't think they are quite good enough for us. If we do all that, agents may be willing to let us vicarages." ...|$|R

6000|$|Without a moment's {{hesitation}} she prostrated herself thrice on {{the ground}} before the figure of Buddha, knocking her head ostentatiously in the dust as she did so.

We repeated the sacred formula after her, as if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> brought up to it. I noticed that Hilda walked the way of the sun.

Hanson then moved around the state, living in Miami, Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale, and Hollywood. In 1960, Hanson moved from Hollywood to Boca Raton due to her husband, Hank's, job transfer by his employer, Southern Bell. Hanson, who was a young mother of 2 children at the time, has described herself as initially very unhappy about the family's relocation to Boca Raton, [...] "I was in tears because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> lived in Fort Lauderdale. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> lived in Hollywood. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> lived in Jacksonville. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in big cities...I mean, I just stayed in tears." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was terrible}} {{for what it}} was, and terrible for what it suggested, if ever that poor dull beast of labor took the bit {{permanently}} into its teeth, or, worse yet, hung back in the breeching and inexorably balked. What would then become of us others, us ladies and gentlemen who had never done a stroke of work and never wished to do one? Should we be forced to the hard necessity of beginning? Could we remain in the comfortable belief that we gave work, or must we be made to own distastefully that it <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> given to us?
