5|$|Sasuke is {{introduced}} in Part I as a young, spiky black-haired teenager {{who wears a}} blue shirt, with a fan representing his clan on his back. He also wears short white pants and the customary Konohagakure head band. Early in the series, a man named Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a cursed seal that causes black marks to cover his body, and later grants him new Cursed Seal powers, which give him gray skin, <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> claw-like wings. In Part II, he usually appears wearing a white kimono with black pants. While skilled {{in the use of}} shurikens, in Part II Sasuke wields a chokutō sword which he calls Kusanagi. Besides using Kusanagi for Kenjutsu, Sasuke can additionally combine it with lightning-based techniques to increase the range of his attacks.|$|E
5|$|In the Main Story, Nero is a {{young man}} who lives in the castle-town of Fortuna on a mysterious island, {{isolated}} {{from the rest of the}} world. Fortuna is home to The Order of the Sword, a sect of holy knights who worship the demon Sparda as their God. Their leader, is the High Priest Sanctus, who leads the congregation as a benevolent spiritual leader, despite Nero's clear lack of faith. With the <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> attitude not unlike a descendant of Sparda, his true parentage remains a mystery. Discovered on the island as a baby, Nero was sent to live with Credo, The Captain of the Holy Knights, who raised Nero to fight demons alongside his peaceful younger sister Kyrie, whom Nero eventually develops feelings for. Though Nero does not believe in The Order’s worship of Sparda, and openly subverts convention by using firearms, and customizing his own sword with a motorcycle handle that shoots flames, he truly believes in protecting the innocent.|$|E

5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so happens that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord.

25|$|Heritability {{means the}} {{information}} in a given gene is not always exactly the same in every individual in that species, so the same gene in different individuals does not give exactly the same instructions. Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele; different forms are collectively called polymorphisms. As an example, one allele for the gene for hair color and skin cell pigmentation could instruct the body to produce black pigment, producing black hair and pigmented skin; while a different allele of the same gene in a different individual could give garbled instructions {{that would result in}} a failure to produce any pigment, giving <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> no pigmented skin: albinism. Mutations are random changes in genes creating new alleles, which in turn produce new traits, which could help, harm, or have no new effect on the individual's likelihood of survival; thus, mutations are the basis for evolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Vice President Bush {{announced}} his candidacy for President to succeed Reagan. By this time Barbara had experienced two presidential campaigns, but broke new ground by becoming the second candidate's spouse {{to speak at}} the national party convention that nominated her husband (after Eleanor Roosevelt in 1940). She promised voters that she would be a traditional first lady and campaigned actively for her husband. The campaign at times focused on the large Bush family, and contrasted her with the First Lady, Nancy Reagan, by highlighting her interest in domestic staples such as church, gardening, and time spent with family while placing less emphasis on style sense and fashion; she drew attention to both her famous <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> disinterest in wearing designer clothes. She generally avoided discussion of political issues during the campaign, particularly those on which she and her husband differed, and those closely involved with the campaign have reported that she was actively involved in campaign strategy. Bush was elected in November 1988 and sworn in on January 20, 1989– and the nation had a new first lady.|$|E
25|$|In the field, Hook {{says that}} he doesn't {{want to become a}} Dark One, that he's weak, unlike Merlin and Emma, and that he'll succumb to the {{darkness}} again if she does that. Emma {{says that he}} won't, that she'll help him fight it together, and that she still wants a future with him. But Hook tells her not to, that their future is now, and that he’s happy just to know that she has one, before going limp. Emma says that it's not enough for her. She holds him and cries, and then takes Excalibur and floods it with magic. In the diner, Merlin tells them it’s too late, and tendrils of darkness emerge from him as he is released from Excalibur (the darkness was what bound Merlin to the fragment of Excalibur). The dark tendrils re-emerge from Excalibur and flow into Killian's heart, bathing him in a golden light. Then, Hook vanishes and his name appears on the blade of Excalibur. Then, a burst of dark magic erupts from the blade of Excalibur, turning Emma into her present-day appearance, with <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> a dark appearance, signifying the completion of her journey into darkness. At the same time, a flood of dark energy pours into the entrance of the Vault of the Dark One, and reforms into a cloaked Killian.|$|E

500|$|A clear {{definition}} {{appears to}} be – [...] "Congenital absence of any pigmentation or coloration in a person, animal, or plant, resulting in <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> pink eyes in mammals." [...] Whilst this does not state specifically that non-mammalian [...] albino animals (or plants) are white, this can be inferred from [...] "...absence of any pigmentation or coloration..." [...] Due to the varied use and interpretation of the term [...] "albino", written reports of albinistic organisms can often not be verified.|$|E
500|$|Albinism {{in biology}} is the [...] "Congenital {{absence of any}} {{pigmentation}} or coloration in a person, animal or plant, resulting in <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> pink eyes in mammals." [...] Varied use and interpretation of the terms mean that written reports of albinistic animals {{can be difficult to}} verify. [...] Albinism can reduce the survivability of an animal, for example, {{it has been suggested that}} albino alligators have an average survival span of only 24 hours due to the lack of protection from UV and their lack of camouflage to avoid predators. [...] Albino animals have characteristic pink or red eyes because the lack of pigment in the iris allows the blood vessels of the retina to be visible. Familiar albino animals include in-bred strains of laboratory animals (rats, mice, guinea-pigs and rabbits), but populations of naturally occurring albino animals exist in the wild, e.g. Mexican cave tetra. [...] Albinism is a well-recognized phenomenon in molluscs, both in the shell and in the soft parts. [...] It has been claimed by some, e.g. that [...] "albinism" [...] can occur for a number of reasons aside from inheritance including genetic mutations, diet, living conditions, age, disease, or injury, however, this is contrary to definitions where the condition is inherited.|$|E
500|$|In Portland, Meeker {{lost his}} {{remaining}} helpers (one {{refused to take}} a pay cut, the others for personal reasons). One stayed on for the boat voyage up the Columbia before leaving at The Dalles, [...] where Meeker hired a driver/cook, William Mardon, at $30 per month. [...] He remained with Meeker {{for the next three}} years. Meeker also installed an odometer on his wagon, calling The Dalles [...] "Mile Zero" [...] of his expedition. In The Dalles, Meeker engaged in activities which would set the pattern for his progress along the Trail: He showed off himself, his wagon and animals, to the public, and sold tickets for a lecture (fifty cents for adults, half that for children) he would give about the Oregon Trail, including images shown with a stereopticon. [...] He also met with members of civic committees to raise money for a local monument. [...] Often these monuments were erected after Meeker passed: he would position a post to designate its location. [...] According to reporter James Aldredge in his 1975 article on Meeker's trip, [...] "for a septuagenarian he must have been blessed with remarkable health and endurance... When the curious procession got underway, not the least impressive part of it was Meeker himself, with his face framed by his flowing <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> his patriarchal beard." [...] According to reporter Bart Ripp in his 1993 article on Meeker, [...] "the first expedition east in 1906 {{was supposed to be a}} speaking tour, but people were more interested in seeing the old coot in a covered wagon.

2500|$|A {{number of}} movies, books and other works {{have been criticized}} for albino bias, as they {{associate}} the uncommon features of albinistic people (pale skin, <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> unpigmented eyes) with danger, terror, or criminality.
