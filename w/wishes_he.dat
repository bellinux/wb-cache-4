5|$|Bertie's Brainstorm is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Bertie Fawcett, a dim-witted fop, who erroneously believes to have won the heart of May Vernon.

Bertie chances upon the letter and sets off {{to make a living}} proceeds through a number of jobs with hope to claim May as his bride. The film ends with Bertie returning and finding out that May has married Jack.

The foppish character of Bertie may have been inspired by Edwin Thanhouser's role as Bertie Nizril in Thoroughbred. Originally conceived as a series, this ultimately singular work received praise from critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves.

Shortly {{after the trial}} and conviction, his wife Debra filed for divorce and their marriage was formally dissolved a year later.

In July 2008, Chandler was on Florida's short list of executions. Profiling experts speculated that Chandler may have killed previously, {{based on the belief that}} a first-time killer would not be experienced, or bold enough, to abduct and kill three women at once. Chandler remained a suspect in the 1982 murder of a woman found floating off Anna Maria Island until 2011, when the body was identified as 29-year-old Amy Hurst and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder. Chandler was never charged with another murder. All of his appeals of his 1994 conviction were denied; his last was in May 2007.|$|E

5|$|While {{in exile}} in London between 1940 and 1944, Pierlot served as both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and played an {{important}} role in wartime negotiations between the Allied powers, laying the foundation for Belgian post-war reconstruction. After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Pierlot returned to Brussels where, against his <b>wishes,</b> <b>he</b> headed a fresh government of national unity until February 1945. Criticism from the political left and the failure of the new government to deal with the serious issues facing the country following the liberation led to the fall of the government in February 1945 and he was replaced by the socialist Achille Van Acker. Pierlot's stance against Leopold III during the war made him a controversial figure during his lifetime and he was widely disliked in the same royalist and conservative circles from which his own Catholic Party (later the Christian Social Party) drew most of its support. He retired from politics in 1946 amid the crisis of the Royal Question, surrounding whether Leopold could return to the Belgian throne, and died peacefully in 1963. After his death, Pierlot's reputation improved as the decisions he took during the war were reconsidered by historians.|$|E
