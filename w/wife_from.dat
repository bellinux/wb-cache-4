Kurosawa saw potential in the script, and with Hashimoto's help, polished and expanded it and then pitched it to Daiei, who were happy to accept the project due to its low budget.|$|E
5|$|Despite Blom-Cooper's {{recommendations}} that Bird never {{be allowed to}} hold public office again and strong opposition disapproval, he was made Minister of Science, Technology and Communications in a cabinet reshuffle on 15 May 1996. He soon found himself {{at odds with the}} Prime Minister; after the government announced plans to evict Thomas Bufton and his <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> Guiana Island, where they had lived for 32 years, in order to build a tourist resort, Bird began serving as the Buftons' lawyer. A dispute between Bufton and Bird led to a fight at Bird's law offices, during which he was shot in the mouth and taken to intensive care on 16 December 1997; this followed Bird speaking up for the Buftons' cause before voting in support of a motion to allow the police to evict them, using force if necessary. Bufton was later acquitted of attempted murder, but still evicted.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your <b>Wife.</b> <b>From</b> the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E

The relationship was not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial outpost of Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Wiesenthal and {{his wife}} were {{transferred}} to Janowska concentration camp and forced to work at the Eastern Railway Repair Works. He painted swastikas and other inscriptions on captured Soviet railway engines, and Cyla was put to work polishing the brass and nickel. In exchange for providing details about the railways, Wiesenthal obtained false identity papers for his <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> a member of the Armia Krajowa, a Polish underground organisation. She travelled to Warsaw, where she was put to work in a German radio factory. She spent time in two different labour camps as well. Conditions were harsh and her health was permanently damaged, but she survived the war. The couple was reunited in 1945, and their daughter Paulinka was born the following year.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina again {{consulted}} Day on {{the prospective}} engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age difference was too great, although Bicknell {{was only two}} years older than Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sabrina the truth about the experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sabrina wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.|$|E

5|$|The King {{sought a}} divorce, but his advisors {{suggested}} that any divorce proceedings might involve {{the publication of}} details relating to the King's own adulterous relationships. Therefore, he requested and ensured {{the introduction of the}} Pains and Penalties Bill, under which Parliament could have imposed legal penalties without a trial in a court of law. The bill would have annulled the marriage and stripped Caroline of the title of Queen. The bill proved extremely unpopular with the public, and was withdrawn from Parliament. George IV decided, nonetheless, to exclude his <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> his coronation at Westminster Abbey, on 19 July 1821. Caroline fell ill that day and died on 7 August; during her final illness she often stated that she thought she had been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a <b>wife</b> <b>from</b> his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E
5|$|Willis was {{involved}} in the 1850 divorce suit between the actor Edwin Forrest and his wife Catherine Norton Sinclair Forrest.

He moved to Philadelphia and filed for divorce in February 1850 though the Pennsylvania legislature denied his application. Catharine went to live with the family of Parke Godwin and the separation became a public affair, with newspapers throughout New York reporting on supposed infidelities and other gossip.|$|E
