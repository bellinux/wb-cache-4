40|$|Consistent word {{selection}} {{in machine translation}} is currently realized by resolving word sense ambiguity through {{the context of a}} single sentence or neighboring sentences. However, consistent word selection over the <b>whole</b> <b>article</b> has yet to be achieved. Consistency over the <b>whole</b> <b>article</b> is extremely important when applying machine translation to collectively developed documents like Wikipedia. In this paper, we propose to consider constraints between words in the <b>whole</b> <b>article</b> based on their semantic relatedness and contextual distance. The proposed method is successfully implemented in both statistical and rule-based translators. We evaluate those systems by translating 100 articles in the English Wikipedia into Japanese. The results show that the ratio of appropriate word selection for common nouns increased to around 75 % with our method, while it was around 55 % without our method. ...|$|R

A journalist musn’t harm the reader they have to realize that they shape the readers’ views and influence the public opinion.
