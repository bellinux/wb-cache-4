40|$|Forested land in {{the world}} is about 28 % of the global land area, {{accounting}} for 80 % of the terrestrial carbon stored as biomass and soil organic carbon. Human activities, namely fossil fuel combustion and deforestation resulted in anthropogenic emissions into the atmosphere.

Several studies revealed that carbon is mostly sequestered in the aboveground part of biomass. As Southeast Asia has the highest level of deforestation, this study focused on observing carbon stocks in Malaysian forests. The conducted estimation of forest carbon stocks reveals carbon stock increment owing to the increment in the forested land.
