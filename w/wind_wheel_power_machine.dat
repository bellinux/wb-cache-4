Additional air flows are also conducted onto the bladed wheel; all of the air flows positively effecting rotation of the wheel in a cumulative manner. The auxiliary ducts are disposed at an acute angle {{with respect to the}} longitudinal axis of the housing, and this feature, together with the rotatability of the housing and the ducts, permits capture of wind currents within a variable directional range...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{comparison}} of three different power plants employing renewable energy sources available in the Piedmont Region (North-West of Italy), {{by means of the}} following technologies: a mini-hydro with Archimedes' screw, a wind-turbines and a photovoltaic system with solar cells. According to the project requirements, for each of three solutions, the most suitable site was found in the Piedmont region of Italy. The mini-hydro, endless screw with asynchronous reversible generator, has been installed in a small irrigation channel near the city of Novara, where the cultivation of rice needs considerable quantities of water throughout the year. With the nominal power of the mini-hydro of 150 kW the total electric energy produced in an year results from the calculation of about 750, 000 kWh. As far as the wind turbines are concerned, thanks the anemometric investigation performed by ARPA (Environmental Protection Agency in Piedmont), the most useful place resulted the Colle S. Bernardo, located between Piedmont and Ligurian Riviera at 980 m of altitude. Using the PGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System), for solar cells, the best site in Piedmont, resulted instead a place in south-west of Piedmont, near the city of Cuneo. As previously said, because the total amount of electric energy has been assumed for the comparison of about 750, 000 kWh, as consequence these two last solutions present different nominal power. In particular: power of 100 kW for three <b>wind</b> <b>wheels</b> and of 60 kW for one <b>wind</b> <b>wheel</b> (total <b>power</b> 360 kW); power of 550 kW (of peak) for solar cells. After estimating the investment costs, the operating costs and the renewable energy production incentives of the three power plants, the payback has been also evaluated for each solution. From the economical assessment that was carried out through the Net Present Value, the hydroelectric plant resulted the most profitable solutio...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{describes}} a simple, cost-effective, and scalable approach to fabricate a triboelectric nanogenerator (NG) with ultrahigh electric output. Triggered by commonly available ambient mechanical energy such as human footfalls, a NG with size {{smaller than a}} human palm can generate maximum short-circuit current of 2 mA, delivering instantaneous power output of 1. 2 W to external load. The power output corresponds to an area power density of 313 W/m 2 and a volume power density of 54 268 W/m 3 at an open-circuit voltage of ∼ 1200 V. An energy conversion efficiency of 14. 9 % has been achieved. The power was capable of instantaneously lighting up as many as 600 multicolor commercial LED bulbs. The record high power output for the NG is attributed to optimized structure, proper materials selection and nanoscale surface modification. This work demonstrated the practicability of using NG to harvest large-scale mechanical energy, such as footsteps, rolling <b>wheels,</b> <b>wind</b> <b>power,</b> and ocean waves...|$|R
