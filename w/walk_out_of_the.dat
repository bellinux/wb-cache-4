On 23 July 1932, Papen had Germany <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World Disarmament Conference following objections from the French delegation that allowing Germany Gleichberechtigung would cause another world war, and Papen announced that the Reich would {{not return to the}} conference until the other powers agreed to consider his demand for Gleichberechtigung.|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of China, dances are held for {{young men and women}} to find partners.

Protected by a large durable sign, the gang then storms the {{building}} and rush the survivors.

25|$|Still {{in south}} London, 1980–81 saw Wimbledon regain Third Division status {{at the first}} attempt, {{at the end of}} an eventful season which saw {{chairman}} Ron Noades <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club to take over Crystal Palace, taking manager Dario Gradi to Selhurst Park with him.

25|$|The student-teacher {{relationship}} gradually {{changed to}} one of jealous rivals. Cobb was unpopular with his teammates, and as he became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given Cobb. Cobb was allowed to report late for spring training and given private quarters on the road – privileges not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four {{on a day when}} Cobb went hitless, Cobb would turn red and sometimes <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park with the game still on. When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, at age 19, Wallace {{contributed to}} his grandfather's {{successful}} campaign for probate judge. Late in 1945, he was appointed {{as one of the}} assistant attorneys general of Alabama, and in May 1946, he won his first election as a member to the Alabama House of Representatives. At the time, he was considered a moderate on racial issues. As a delegate to the 1948 Democratic National Convention, he did not join the Dixiecrat walkout at the convention, despite his opposition to U.S. President Harry S. Truman's proposed civil rights program. Wallace considered it an infringement on states' rights. The Dixiecrats carried Alabama in the 1948 general election, having rallied behind Governor Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. In his 1963 inaugural speech as governor, Wallace excused his failure to <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1948 convention on political grounds.|$|E
