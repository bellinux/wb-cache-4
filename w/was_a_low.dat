5|$|Ascension was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable reception. Critics recommended it as a party game favorable to Super Smash Bros. and praised its balance. However, some felt that its single-player mode <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> point, and lamented {{the lack of an}} online multiplayer mode.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the 1896 Games, the Olympics entered a period of {{stagnation}} that threatened their survival. The Olympic Games held at the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Louisiana Purchase Exposition at St. Louis in 1904 were side shows. The Games in Paris did not have a stadium, but were notable for being the first time women took part in the Games. When the St. Louis Games were celebrated roughly 650 athletes participated, but 580 were from the United States. The homogeneous nature of these celebrations <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> point for the Olympic Movement. The Games rebounded when the 1906 Intercalated Games (so-called because they were the second Games held within the third Olympiad) were held in Athens. These Games were, but are not now, officially recognised by the IOC and no Intercalated Games have been held since. The Games attracted a broad international field of participants and generated great public interest. This marked the beginning of a rise in both the popularity {{and the size of the}} Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> budget {{production}} as Lombardo {{did not care}} for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked on the special effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E
5|$|Situated in the Burnden area of Bolton, {{approximately}} one {{mile from the}} centre of the town, the ground served as the home of the town's football team for 102 years. In its heyday, Burnden Park could hold up to 70,000 supporters but this figure was dramatically reduced during the final 20 years of its life. A section of The Embankment was sold off in 1986 {{to make way for a}} new Normid superstore. At this time, Bolton were in a dire position financially and were struggling in the Football League Third Division, so there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> demand for tickets and the loss of part of the ground gave the Bolton directors good value for money.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, Texas {{would again}} be {{selected}} {{to play in}} the Cotton Bowl after winning another SWC Crown. This time the Longhorns faced a highly talented Mississippi Rebels team.

25|$|It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> wing, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{of conventional}} design and mixed construction. The main {{units of the}} tailwheel undercarriage were retractable, and the cabin was fully enclosed, offering side-by-side seating. The Italian press of the day nicknamed it Topolino dell'Aria ("Little mouse of the air").|$|E
25|$|By 1981, Hollywood studios {{were once}} again sending films to Thailand. Also, {{television}} (see also Media in Thailand) was a growing part of Thai culture. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> period for the Thai film industry, and by the mid-1990s, studio output was averaging about 10 films per year.|$|E

25|$|For {{fiscal year}} 2010, train revenue was {{approximately}} $10.3million. Total operating expenses {{for fiscal year}} 2010, including depreciation expense, were approximately $86.9million. Expenses increased by approximately $14.9million or 20.7% when compared to fiscal year 2009. 2010 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> year for ridership after the economy crashed and there were service cuts. By 2015, ridership was about 25% higher.|$|E
25|$|The Parnall Pixie <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> powered British single-seat {{monoplane}} {{light aircraft}} {{originally designed to}} compete in the Lympne, UK trials for motor-gliders in 1923, where it was flown successfully by Norman Macmillan. It had two sets of wings, one for cross-country flights and the other for speed; it later appeared as a biplane which could be converted into a monoplane.|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal passage}} {{was large and}} placed close to the beak. The {{nostrils}} were in a high position. On {{each side of the}} top of the skull there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> bump between the nasal opening and the eye socket; the significance of both protuberances is unknown, but they may have been used for socialisation or mating displays. A secondary palpebral bone was lacking.|$|E

25|$|Even so, Spain's economy (especially in Castile) {{declined}} and {{its population}} decreased by nearly {{two million people}} during the 17th century. This was partially due to plague outbreaks, and partially due to the huge casualties caused by almost continuous warfare. The period 1677-1686 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> point, with famine, plague, natural disasters, and economic upheaval. Emigration to the New World increased.|$|E
25|$|On the {{independence}} of the Irish Free State in 1922, the new state's trade was overwhelmingly with the United Kingdom (98% of Irish exports and 80% of imports in 1924), so the introduction of an independent currency <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> priority. British banknotes (British Treasury notes, Bank of England notes), and notes issued by Irish banks circulated (but only the first were legal tender) and coins remained in circulation.|$|E
25|$|Anil Kumble {{announced}} his retirement from International test cricket, First class cricket, and list A cricket appearances on 2 November 2008 in the 3rd Test match against Australia at Feroz Shah Kotla cricket stadium at New Delhi, India.

25|$|In {{those not}} so emotionally {{affected}} by reminders of their loss, studies of fMRI scans {{have been used}} to conclude that there is a high functional connectivity between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting that the former regulates activity in the latter. In those people who had greater intensity of sadness, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> functional connection between the rostal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdala activity, suggesting a lack of regulation of the former part of the brain upon the latter.|$|E
25|$|Space {{agencies}} {{have already had}} experience with returning samples {{thought to be a}} back contamination risk during the Apollo era, when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> probability of life on the Moon. The precautions taken then were inadequate by modern standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations would be needed. A different approach would be needed for a modern sample return.|$|E
25|$|The C.430 Rafale was a two-seat {{development}} of the single seat Caudron C.362, {{the winner of the}} 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe. Slightly larger and heavier, though with a lower wing loading, the Rafale <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> wing cantilever monoplane, wood framed and covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its one piece, single spar wing was strongly straight tapered to elliptical tips and was plywood covered with an outer layer of fabric. There were flaps inboard of the ailerons.|$|E
