500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1961, while {{brainstorming}} ideas for a program for the PDP-1, Russell had just finished reading the Lensman series by E. E. [...] "Doc" [...] Smith and thought the stories {{would make a good}} basis for the program. [...] "His heroes had a strong tendency to get pursued by the villain across the galaxy and have to invent their way out of their problem while they were being pursued. That sort of action <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> suggested Spacewar. He had some very glowing descriptions of spaceship encounters and space fleet maneuvers." [...] Other influences cited by fellow programmer Martin Graetz include E.E. Smith's Skylark novels and Japanese pulp fiction tokusatsu movies.|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time is what made the show work." ...|$|E
500|$|Les Jackson {{took over}} command of No.75 Squadron {{the day after}} his brother was killed. Although the {{squadron}} was no longer an effective fighting unit, it had checked Japan's attempts to overpower Port Moresby by air attack, and the town continued to function as an important Allied base. John Jackson was survived by his wife and children, and interred in Moresby's Bomana War Cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at a value of £29,780 ($1,870,800 in 2011). [...] His name appears on panel 104 of the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial (AWM), Canberra. [...] Jackson was a keen amateur film maker, and a four-minute reel of 16mm footage that he shot in Port Moresby is held by the AWM. Moresby's Seven Mile Aerodrome was renamed Jackson's Strip in his honour; it later became Jacksons International Airport. In a 1989 interview, fellow No.75 Squadron member Flight Lieutenant Albert Tucker commented, [...] "I would say that had JohnF. Jackson not existed, the squadron would not have been effective in that defence role {{for as long as it}} was... So the whole spirit of JohnF's leadership, and I suppose his final sacrifice, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> made 75 Squadron." [...] In March 2003, the St George township erected a monument to Jackson and another local RAAF identity, Aboriginal fighter pilot Len Waters.|$|E

[...] "Jazz <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> was most intriguing because of the challenge that was involved", says Blackman.

2500|$|Enduring {{questions}} remained after [...] "La Noche Triste" [...] (the Sad Night) {{that have}} taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> provoked the massacre.|$|E

In his BBC News blog, technology editor Darren Waters wrote, [...] "LittleBigPlanet is {{perhaps one of}} the most dazzling demos I've seen in the last 10 years". IGN described the game as [...] "beautiful" [...] and reported that [...] "even in the presence of Home, Sony's impressive new community software, LittleBigPlanet stole the show at Phil Harrison's Game 3.0 practice conference, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> everyone was talking about." [...] 1UP wrote that [...] "There are plenty of questions remaining about LittleBigPlanet… but it's clear from the reaction to the game so far that it has already won over many fans and that this could be something very special." [...] Slashdot Games editor Michael Zenke suggested the game could be the PlayStation 3's killer application. Even Reggie Fils-Aime, the president of Nintendo of America, praised the product, but was unsure how the game would fare on Sony's platform.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, Charles Thomson wrote a {{piece for}} The Huffington Post, [...] "One of the Most Shameful Episodes in Journalistic History", in which he {{detailed}} the story, as he saw it, of why [...] "the trial that was relayed to us didn't even resemble the trial {{that was going on}} inside the courtroom." [...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria were some of the features. After all, that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think if you did a pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage." [...] Court TV hired tabloid journalist Diane Dimond to cover the trial even though Dimond had previously been sued by Jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor Sneddon.|$|E
2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. This really is make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
