5000|$|The {{materials}} {{used to make}} the lamp are box-moulded, wax-moulded, or loam-moulded. These are made in an open space where fire hazards are of the least concern. To facilitate proper moulding, the key component {{materials used}} are: the brown vandal sand exclusively drawn from the Cauvery river bed about 1 km from the Nachiarkoil town used in all types of moulding; [...] "Karuman sand" [...] (used for <b>wax</b> <b>moulding)</b> of pale red colour, available in the town itself; [...] "Savuttu sand", available in light grey colour, used in <b>wax</b> <b>moulding</b> and available in the tank beds {{in the vicinity of the}} town. The admixture used in box-moulding is clay powder in certain proportion depending on the type of moulding used. Other materials used are white dammar, a type of resin drawn from coniferous trees, and castor oil. Cow-dung cakes are the common type of fuel employed to melt the metal before it is poured into the moulds. Parting sand is used to facilitate easy removal of the moulded product. Box-moulding is used extensively as it is a quicker and cheaper mode of manufacture. Nowadays modern machinery is {{used to make the}} lamps.|$|E

There is potential for timesaving in the mould design stage. This paper presents {{the basic structure of}} an interactive knowledge based <b>wax</b> injection <b>mould</b> design system. The basic of this system arises from an analysis of the <b>wax</b> injection <b>mould</b> design process for mould design companies. This <b>wax</b> injection <b>mould</b> design system covers both the mould design process and mould base standardization. In this system, the graphic module and the knowledge based module for generating mould features are integrated within an interactive Mold Wizard platform, Unigraphics system. This ensures that both speeds up the <b>wax</b> injection <b>mould</b> design process, without the need to redesign the mould base layout. With this capability, metal casting product could be designed quickly, cheaply with quality and competitively...|$|R

40|$|Background: Iconography plays {{a crucial}} role in the field of {{dermatology}} unlike other specialties. The collection composed of portraits, pictures, cartoons, <b>wax</b> <b>moulds</b> and miniatures represents the social and historical aspects of Turkish dermatology. The theme is mostly the definition of diseases and interventions. The artworks, unlike the counterparts in western countries are only created by physicians. Currently this collection is exhibited in 3 different museums in Istanbul University and Mu-nicipal Medical Center of Istanbul and draws the attention of paramedical visitors interested in medical culture and history as well as dermatologists. Iconography plays {{a crucial role}} in the field of dermatology unlike other specialties. The representation of a skin disease is re-hearsed by 3 major characters: the patient, the physician and the artist who has de-voted his skills to reality rather than beauty. The collection composed of por-traits, pictures, cartoons, <b>wax</b> <b>moulds</b> and miniatures represents the social and his-torical aspects of Turkish dermatology. The theme is mostly the definition of diseases and interventions. Numerous masterpieces have gained life during a fruitful period from the beginning of 19 th century until re-cent years. Among these one can find art-work created through occidental tech-niques, such as <b>wax</b> <b>moulds</b> and also tech-niques that belong exclusively to the artists of Ottoman Empire, namely the miniatures.

5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to Australia in 1927 and rejoined the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He worked {{there for two}} years, collaborating with the new director, Charles Kellaway in studies of snake venoms and with Harold Dew {{on the development of}} diagnostic tests for echinococcosis. Fairley dedicated most of 1928 to the snake venom programme, co-ordinating an enormous body of epidemiological data – including a questionnaire to Australian clinicians – on the frequency and outcome of bites by Australian elapid snakes. This work involved numerous milkings to establish typical and maximal venom yields, innovative studies of snake dentition using <b>wax</b> <b>moulds,</b> and detailed dissections to describe each species' biting apparatus. Fairley furthermore undertook in vivo studies of envenomation in a range of large animal species, to determine the efficacy of prevailing first-aid measures. He concluded that at best, ligature and local venesection might slow time to death after a significant envenomation. This reinforced the need for effective antivenenes (antivenoms) for the more dangerous local species of snakes, notably the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), death adder (Acanthophis antarcticus) and copperhead (Austrelaps superbus), although only the former was suitable for manufacture by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (now CSL Limited).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{cytotoxicity}} of accelerated-set white MTA (AWMTA) and accelerated-set Malaysian white PC (AMWPC) on stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED). The test materials were introduced into paraffin <b>wax</b> <b>moulds</b> after mixing with calcium chloride dihydrate and sterile distilled water. Subsequently, the set cement specimens were sterilized, incubated in a prepared Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) for seven days. The biomarker CD 166 was used for characterization of SHED using flow cytometry. The material extracts were diluted at five different concentrations and incubated for 72 h with SHED. The cell viability was evaluated using Dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and the data was analysed using Mann–Whitney test (P< 0. 05). The results showed that AWMTA revealed significantly greater cell viability at 25 and 12. 5 mg/ml concentrations (P< 0. 05). Concomitantly, AMWPC exhibited greater cell viability at concentrations < 12. 5 mg/ml and the results were significant at 1. 563 mg/ml (P< 0. 05). Both materials demonstrated moderate cytotoxicity at 25 mg/ml and slight cytotoxicity at 6. 25 and 3. 125 mg/ml. At 1. 563 mg/ml, no cytotoxic activity was merely observed with AMWPC. In conclusion, AMWPC exhibited favourable and comparable cell viability to that of AWMTA, and has the potential to be used as an alternative and less costly material in dental applications...|$|R

5000|$|In May 2006, when Pejić was terminally ill, {{he invented}} a {{completely}} new method of sculpture. In collaboration with the expert in metallurgy and the casting master Jakob Mostar, he outlined the basic shape of the final casting in wax and planned in advance the self-formation of the sculpture according to the physical and chemical characteristics of the materials used and their expected behavior in the planned environmental conditions. For this purpose, he used fresh clay mould, into which the melted mass was poured directly, allowing in this way also to mix metal, glass or other basic materials on the spot. This leads to certain anticipated temperature- and gas-expansions that form the sculpture as outlined. Pejić termed the method the Big Bang Method, and the sculptures born in this way as [...] "self-born sculptures". He finished three such sculptures before his death, and another four he had prepared in <b>wax</b> and <b>mould</b> for casting, were finished posthumously in collaboration with Mostar.|$|R

500|$|As a {{gemstone}} used in jewelry, {{silicon carbide}} is called [...] "synthetic moissanite" [...] or just [...] "moissanite" [...] after the mineral name. Moissanite {{is similar to}} diamond in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the Mohs scale, compared to 10 for diamond), with a refractive index between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common cubic zirconia. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly birefringent. For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the optic axis of the crystal to minimize birefringent effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm3 vs. 3.53 g/cm3), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher luster, sharper facets and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into <b>wax</b> ring <b>moulds</b> for lost-wax casting, as can diamond, as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to 1800°C. Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its birefringence and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.|$|R
