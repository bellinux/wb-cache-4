40|$|Introduction: Risk {{assessment}} of Toxic or hazardous chemicals enables the Industrial Hygienists {{to make the}} appropriate decision in providing healthy work place. This project was conducted in an assembling plant,(4 workshop) of an Automobile Industry in IRAN with 2 types of <b>welding</b> <b>operations,</b> including GMAW (CO 2 welding) and Spot resistance <b>welding</b> <b>operations..</b> Method and Materials: Welders` exposures were assessed via collecting 143 breathing zone air samples based on NIOSH 0500 method. Risk assessment was carried out using Singapore recommended method.. Results: Finding showed that the mean of welders exposure in GMAW and Spot resistance <b>welding</b> <b>operations</b> 5. 61 ± 5. 78 and 2. 38 ± 2. 15 mg/m 3, respectively(p< 0. 05). The results showed that in GMAW welders had the highe exposure in comparison with Spot resistance welders (p< 0. 05). The findings also demonstrated that the risk rate of GMAW welders were high, while this rate for Spot resistance was low.. Conclusion: more hygienic attention is needed for GTAW welders. Control approaches are required including effective engineering control, conduct air monitoring, biological monitoring training, adopt respiratory protection program, develop and implement safe and correct work procedures and finally reassess the risk after all the controls have been done...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{production}} of a good quality weld can not only depend on the welding methods, but also weldability of base materials. Therefore, the evaluation of weldability is of critical importance before <b>welding</b> <b>operation</b> (see Rheological Weldability) for plastics.|$|E

Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a <b>welding</b> <b>operation,</b> prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, undersize engine bearings are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.|$|E

5000|$|If {{the metal}} {{has not yet}} started to crack, {{embrittlement}} can be reversed by removing the hydrogen source and causing the hydrogen within the metal to diffuse out through heat treatment. This de-embrittlement process, known as [...] "baking", is used to overcome the weaknesses of methods such as electroplating which introduce hydrogen to the metal, but is not always entirely effective. In the case of welding, often pre- and post-heating the metal is applied to allow the hydrogen to diffuse out before it can cause any damage. This is specifically done with high-strength steels and low alloy steels such as the chrome/molybdenum/vanadium alloys. Due to {{the time needed to}} re-combine hydrogen atoms into the hydrogen molecules, hydrogen cracking due to welding can occur over 24 hours after the <b>welding</b> <b>operation</b> is completed.|$|E
50|$|Packaging Equipment or pallet {{wrappers}} have {{a moving}} load and an arm that stretches plastic wrap around the load. Typically a three sided wire partition guard is placed around the wrapper, {{and a light}} curtain controls access to the open side where the wrapper is accessed by a lift truck.Robotic Welding Cells incorporate wire mesh fixed barriers outfitted with vinyl welding curtains and light curtains or pressure sensitive mats. The welding curtains mounted inside of the fixed barrier control exposure to welding flash, sparks and spatter from the <b>welding</b> <b>operation.</b> While the light curtain or pressure sensitive mats prevent welding operations while the operator is loading/unloading the weld fixtures. Robotic Material Handling for pallet pack or de-palletizing could use any of the aforementioned guarding systems. Light curtains or pressure sensitive mats {{around the perimeter of}} the work area that stop the robot when an operator enters. Wire partition could be used around the work area with an interlocked gate which stops the robot when opened.|$|E
