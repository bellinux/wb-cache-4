5|$|Industrialist Mark C. Honeywell was a Cocolobo Club {{member who}} bought Boca Chita Key in 1937, {{expanding}} the facilities {{to include a}} small lighthouse. Boca Chita Key was developed with several structures including an imitation lighthouse, built using coral rock and topped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> cage resembling a lighthouse lantern, {{and the end of}} a jetty {{on the north side of}} the key. The key was owned by Honeywell until 1945. Mark and Olive Honeywell also built a chapel, a guesthouse, seawalls and utility buildings on the island.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{regeneration}} company Clydebank Re-Built started a £3.75m restoration project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting. A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final Comic Relief (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> coat hanger.|$|E
5|$|The Oakwood City Council {{wanted the}} Playhouse as a {{community}} center. Thomas appeared before the council and assured them {{that it would not}} be damaged, although he could not disclose what he was intending to use it for. When Talbott Realty proved reluctant to sell, the United States Army Corps of Engineers condemned the property, which became Unit IV on 15 February 1944. Remodeling began on 17 March and the Production Group began moving in on 1 June. Three guard houses were added, along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> fence. Changes to the site were minimized in order to make it easier to restore later. Because it was located in a residential area, efforts were also made to minimize noise and other disruptions.|$|E

It has a dense undercoat, while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming too soft.|$|E

40|$|Introduction and Related Work Computing {{architectures}} {{based on}} portable computers and wireless networking {{are becoming a}} reality. Users may be equipped with hand-held computing devices and roam around freely while maintaining connectivity <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> computing infrastructure {{through a number of}} wireless cells. In this paper we present a protocol for totally ordered multicast within a group of mobile hosts that communicate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wired</b> infrastructure by means of wireless technology. Key feature of the protocol is its resilience to (a certain number of) crashes of stationary computers and partitions of wired links. Totally ordered multicast is a powerful building block for enabling a set of remote processes to maintain a replicated state. We are interested in making this building block available on mobile wireless systems. The fault-tolerance properties of our protocol may greatly extend the scope of potential applications of mobile computing, i...|$|R

5|$|Two of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} quality problems in GMAW are dross and porosity. If not controlled, they can lead to weaker, less ductile welds. Dross is an especially common problem in aluminium GMAW welds, normally coming from particles of aluminium oxide or aluminum nitride present in the electrode or base materials. Electrodes and workpieces must be brushed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> brush or chemically treated to remove oxides on the surface. Any oxygen {{in contact with the}} weld pool, whether from the atmosphere or the shielding gas, causes dross as well. As a result, sufficient flow of inert shielding gases is necessary, and welding in volatile air should be avoided.|$|E
25|$|In fusors, the {{potential}} well is made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> cage. Because {{most of the}} ions and electrons fall into the cage, fusors suffer from high conduction losses. Hence, no fusor has come close to energy break-even.|$|E

25|$|The Sahih al-Bukhari, a {{collection}} of prophetic traditions, or hadith by Muhammad al-Bukhari refers to {{a collection}} of Muhammad's opinions on medicine, by his younger contemporary Anas bin-Malik. Anas writes about two physicians who had treated him by cauterization and mentions that the prophet wanted to avoid this treatment and had asked for alternative treatments. Later on, {{there are reports of}} the caliph ʿUthmān ibn ʿAffān fixing his teeth <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> made of gold. He also mentions that the habit of cleaning one's teeth with a small wooden toothpick dates back to pre-islamic times.|$|E
25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or {{incandescent light}} globe is an electric light <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> filament heated {{to such a}} high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|E

25|$|Inside the van, {{the girls}} would {{typically}} be overpowered, bound hand and foot, gagged, and driven to locations deep within the San Gabriel Mountains, {{where they would be}} sexually assaulted by both men, then usually killed by strangulation <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> coat hanger, although two of the victims had had ice picks driven into their ears before being strangled. Norris admitted to bludgeoning their youngest victim, Jacqueline Leah Lamp, about the head with a sledgehammer as Bittaker strangled her, and admitted to repeatedly striking Shirley Ledford upon the elbow with a sledgehammer before strangling her to death. The bottles of acid found at Bittaker's motel, Norris stated, were intended for use upon the next victim they abducted.|$|E
25|$|A Russian scientist, Valentin Smirnov, {{then had}} the idea of {{replacing}} the tube (called “liner”) <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> array, to fight the azimuthal flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V facility of the Kurchatov Institute had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design {{the second stage of}} hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux. Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using water lines had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at Gramat). In the UK, the Magpie machine was situated at the Imperial College under control of Malcolm Haines.|$|E
25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

25|$|Flight day 4 saw Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken get all {{the tools}} they need ready for their spacewalk on flight day 5. While Patrick and Behnken were getting the tools ready, {{commander}} George Zamka and ISS flight engineer Soichi Noguchi swapped out the Hard Upper Torso (HUT) on Bob Behnken's suit, since the original HUT had developed a problem <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> harness and was not powering the Wireless Video System (WVS) or the heaters in his gloves and boots. Once the swap was complete, Zamka and Noguchi tested the suit successfully. The crew also performed a number of transfer related activities during the morning of their work day. After a joint meal together, the crew of STS-130 and ISS commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer T.J. Creamer conducted a PAO event with T.V. stations in Sacramento, California, Mobile, Alabama and a radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. Once the PAO event was finished, the joint crews had some off duty time {{for the rest of}} the day. Before the two crews went to bed they conducted a spacewalk procedures review, then got Nick Patrick and Bob Behnken into the Quest Airlock. Behnken and Patrick spent the night there at 10.2 psi instead of at the station's 14.6 psi, breathing pure oxygen for an hour before and after their sleep period in order to prevent decompression sickness.|$|E
500|$|The {{legend of}} the [...] is another {{folklore}} story associated with the castle. According to the legend, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble. She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade. It was said that people who heard the story were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi, speeding up construction of the castle. To this day, the supposed stone can be seen covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> net {{in the middle of}} one of the stone walls in the castle complex.|$|E

The initiation of the explosives was initially performed by a multipoint Primacord system. The results were erratic, as the detonations weren't sufficiently synchronized. Much better results were obtained after February 1945, when exploding-bridgewire detonators, developed by Luis Alvarez's G-7 group, became available.|$|E
