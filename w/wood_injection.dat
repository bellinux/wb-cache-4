40|$|Study of the {{pore space}} in mudstones by mercury {{intrusion}} porosimetry is a common but indirect technique {{and it is not}} clear which part {{of the pore}} space is actually filled with mercury. We studied samples from the Opalinus Clay, Boom Clay, Haynesville Shale, and Bossier Shale Formations using <b>Wood's</b> metal <b>injection</b> at 316 MPa, followed by novel ion beam polishing and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. This method allowed us to analyze at high resolution which parts of a rock are intruded by the liquid alloy at mm to cm scale. Results from the Opalinus Clay and Haynesville Shale show Wood's Metal in cracks, but the majority of the pore space is not filled although mercury intrusion data suggests that this is the case. In the silt-rich Boom Clay sample, the majority of the pore space was filled Wood's metal, with unfilled islands of smaller pores. Bossier Shale shows heterogeneous impregnation with local filling of pores as small as 10 nm. We infer that mercury intrusion data from these samples is partly due to crack filling and compression of the sample. This compaction is caused by effective stress developed by mercury pressure and capillary resistance; it can close small pore throats, prevent injection of the liquid metal, and indicate an apparent porosity. Our results suggest that many published MIP data on mudstones could contain serious artifacts and reliable metal intrusion porosimetry requires a demonstration that the metal has entered the pores, for example by <b>Wood's</b> metal <b>injection,</b> broad ion beam polishing, and scanning electron microscopy...|$|R

40|$|Characterization of the {{microstructure}} and pores in fine-grained geo-materials like mudstones is challenging {{because of their}} heterogeneity and small pore sizes. Combining Broad Ion Beam (BIB) polishing and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) enables the visualization of microstructure and pores from millimetres down to a few nanometres in size. In the SEM, the BIB-polished section is mapped at high magnification with various detectors and the different features are segmented and quantified using image processing algorithms. This technology is applied on undeformed and naturally or experimentally deformed rock samples to analyse the strain behaviour of potential host rock formations of nuclear waste such as the Boom Clay and Callovian-Oxfordian Clay.

40|$|Analysis {{methods for}} X-ray microtomographic images of short fibre {{composite}} materials were developed. The methods enable estimation of microstructural {{properties of the}} material, e. g., aspect ratio and orientation of fibres. Being based on X-ray microtomography and image analysis, the methods are nondestructive and do not require user intervention. In particular, a method for determination of the aspect ratio of fibres was first developed. The method contains an assumption about similarity of {{the shape of the}} fibres. The assumption was relaxed in an improved method that can estimate cross-sectional properties of fibres, too, e. g., cross-sectional area. Additionally, the effect of finite image volume on the results of the measurements was discussed. It was concluded that fibre length is the quantity that is most biased by it. A method for correcting the bias was proposed. The developed algorithms were tested and applied in estimation of parameters for a micromechanical model and in quantification of morphological degradation of <b>wood</b> fibres in <b>injection</b> moulding process. It was demonstrated that the methods can be used to measure the parameters of a specific micromechanical model for Young’s modulus of flax fibre composites. The modelling results were compared to those calculated with parameters determined manually, and to results of tensile tests. Morphological degradation of <b>wood</b> fibres in <b>injection</b> moulding process was studied. It was observed that both the length and the aspect ratio of the fibres decrease considerably during processing. Finally, a special sample holder was fabricated for studying the hygroexpansion of fibres in a wood fibre composite material. Tomographic images acquired with the sample holder were used to estimate expansion parameters of the fibres. The parameters were applied in validating a finite element model. In all cases discussed above, results obtained using the developed methods are in agreement with those from independent reference measurements...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{challenge of}} upscaling techniques for multi-phase fluid dynamics in porous media {{is to determine}} which properties on the micro-scale {{can be used to}} predict macroscopic flow and spatial distribution of phases at core- and field-scales. The most notable outcome of recent theories is the identification of interfacial areas per volume for multiple phases as a fundamental parameter that determines much of the multi-phase properties of the porous medium. A formal program of experimental research was begun to directly test upscaling theories in fluid flow through porous media by comparing measurements of relative permeability and capillary-saturation with measurements of interfacial area per volume. This project on the experimental investigation of relative permeability upscaling has produced a unique combination of three quite different technical approaches to the upscaling problem of obtaining pore-related microscopic properties and using them to predict macroscopic behavior. Several important ''firsts'' have been achieved {{during the course of the}} project. (1) Optical coherence imaging, a laser-based ranging and imaging technique, has produced the first images of grain and pore structure up to 1 mm beneath the surface of the sandstone and in a laboratory borehole. (2) <b>Woods</b> metal <b>injection</b> has connected for the first time microscopic pore-scale geometric measurements with macroscopic saturation in real sandstone cores. (3) The micro-model technique has produced the first invertible relationship between saturation and capillary pressure [...] showing that interfacial area per volume (IAV) provides the linking parameter.

40|$|Wood {{has been}} used for {{building}} facades to enhance the aesthetic design of buildings since the revision to the evaluation method associated with the amendment of the Building Standard Law of Japan in 2000. In response, wood that has been pressure-impregnated with fire retardants (fire-retardant treated wood) is often used to ensure it is safe {{in the event of a}} fire. Currently, when fire-retardant-treated wood is tested for certification of reaction to fire performance, a cone calorimeter test is conducted in Japan. This test applies radiant heat to the surface of a square specimen, 100 [*]mm each side, immediately after it has undergone fire-retardant treatment. However, when applying fire-retardant treatment to <b>wood,</b> aqueous chemical <b>injection</b> is the standard procedure. When wood is actually used to construct a building, there is a concern about environmental forces such as wind and rain that could cause the wood to deteriorate, and concerns about performance degradation associated with aging. One of the past studies in Japan [1] conducted a cone calorimeter test after an outdoor exposure test and accelerated weathering test, compared the post-test performance with the initial performance and confirmed the amount of remaining fire retardant in the treated wood had been reduced. However, no comparison of the fireproof performance of fire-retardant wood in actual use in a building facade had been conducted in Japan. There have been already valuable researches [e. g. 2, 3] on this issue internationally, but this paper is the first step in Japan and authors hope to focus on the wooden façade construction technique and the standard façade test in Japan...|$|R
40|$|The {{intradermal}} {{injection of}} a suspension of heat-killed mycobacteria in oil (Freund's adjuvant) produces in the rat a generalized disease, adjuvant arthritis or adjuvant disease (Pearson and Wood, 1959). This {{can be transferred}} to syngeneic recipients with lymphoid cells from adjuvant-injected donors but not with serum (Waksman and Wennersten, 1963; Pearson and Wood, 1964 a; Quagliata and Phillips-Quagliata, 1972) and is therefore {{considered to be a}} manifestation of delayed-type or cellular hypersensitivity to disseminated component(s) of the mycobacterium (Quagliata and Phillips-Quagliata, 1972). In addition, the inflammatory reaction at the site of adjuvant injection provides a useful experi-mental model for the study of inflammation (Perper, Alvarez, Schroder, and Colombo, 1971). Antilymphocyte serum (ALS), among its many immunosuppressive properties, has been shown to suppress adjuvant disease (Currey and Ziff, 1968). Another property of ALS is that it stimulates the transformation of lymphocytes into large blast-like cells capable of mitosis (Woodruff, Reid, and James, 1967). Streptococcal culture filtrates have recently been shown to have a similar effect on lymphocytes (Taranta, Cuppari, and Quagliata, 1969; Taranta and Cuppari, 1970); we therefore thought it might be of interest to investigate the effect of such filtrates on adjuvant disease. Cellular components of Gram-negative bacteria have previously been shown to prevent adjuvant disease if injected in incomplete adjuvant, but not in saline, before the eliciting adjuvant <b>injection</b> (<b>Wood</b> and Pearson, 1962).

40|$|Clays {{and clay}} stones {{comprise}} about 50 % of all sediments and sedimentary rocks on earth. However, {{due to their}} very small grain-sizes (usually less than 2 μm in diameter) {{as well as the}} sensitivity of many clay minerals towards water, their direct microstructural characterization is still challenging. The Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays are the two reference materials for research on the long-term disposal of high- and medium-level, long-lived radioactive waste in a deep geological formation in Belgium (Van Marcke et al., 2005; ONDRAF/NIRAS, 2013 a; Verhoef and Schroeder, 2011; Verhoef et al., 2011). Therefore, the detailed characterization of their pore space is indispensable to gain a full understanding of the relevant processes, governing the transport of radionuclides in these materials (i. e. diffusion, adsorption and migration of radionuclides as well as fluid flow). In the present study, research was carried out on representative samples of the Boom Clay at Mol- 1 (Mol-Dessel research site, Belgium; Zeelmaekers, 2011 sample series, chapters 4, 5 and 7) and the Ypresian clays at Kallo- 1 (Belgium, chapters 6 and 7), covering end members with regard to mineralogical compositions and grain-size distributions. Recent progress in ion-beam milling tools has revolutionized the microstructural analysis of fine-grained geomaterials. To characterize the microstructure and pore space in Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays, down to the nm-scale resolution in 2 D and in 3 D, in the present study, focused- (FIB) and broad-ion-beam (BIB) milling were combined with high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray μ-CT and Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). Direct insights to pore space morphologies in 2 D were obtained by BIB-milling in combination with high resolution SEM (chapters 4, 6 and 7), whereas a combination of FIB serial cross-sectioning with simultaneous SEM-imaging, X-ray μ-CT and pore network extraction modeling (PNE; Dong and Blunt, 2009) delivered insight to pore space morphologies and the connectivity of the pore space in 3 D (chapter 5). MIP was used to relate direct microstructural observations within limited areas or volumes of investigation to bulk sample porosity measurements (chapter 4). Moreover, <b>Wood’s</b> metal <b>injection</b> in combination with cooled BIB-milling and high resolution SEM-imaging was used to analyze the connectivity of the pore space and visualize the impact of high pressure liquid metal injection on the porosity and microstructures of fine-grained, argillaceous geomaterials (chapter 7). Results show characteristic pore morphologies and total observed 2 D porosities within different mineral phases of the Boom Clay (chapter 4). These are similar for samples of different mineralogical composition and grain-size distribution and irrespective of the depth of origin of the samples. Largest pores were found to occur preferentially at the boundaries between clay-matrix and non-clay mineral (NCM) – mostly quartz – grains and their sizes seem to depend {{on the size of the}} adjacent NCM-grains. Therefore, total BIB-SEM observed porosities are suggested to depend significantly on a sample’s mineralogical composition and grain-size distribution. The overall distribution of porosity within a sample can be modeled based on the distribution of different mineral phases within the sample and the grain-size distribution of the material. In fine-grained, clay-rich (> 50 dry wt. -% clay minerals) Boom Clay the intra-clay matrix porosity contributes to the major fraction of the total porosity and moreover, controls the overall connectivity of the pore space. In more coarse-grained, non-clay mineral-rich (> 50 dry wt. -% non-clay minerals) samples on the contrary, larger inter-aggregate pores account for the major fraction of the total resolved porosity and also significantly contribute to the overall pore space connectivity. Once these larger inter-aggregate pores are directly connected to each other, this might increase the permeability of the material to a large extent. In general it was distinguished between two different porosity and pore space connectivity regimes: (1) a highly connected pore space within the clay-matrix with pore throats mostly below 100 nm in diameter and (2) larger inter-aggregate pores at the boundaries between clay-matrix and non-clay mineral grains with pore throats > 1 μm in diameter, but with a significantly lower interconnectivity at the scales of observation of FIB-SEM, BIB-SEM and X-ray μ-CT. Pore-size distribution analyses in 2 D and 3 D reveal power-law distributions of pore-sizes in Boom Clay over about 6 orders of magnitude, hinting towards scale invariance and self-similarity of the pore space characteristics and towards the possibility of up-scaling of our nm- to μm-scale observations to much larger scale characteristics of the formation (chapters 4 and 5). 2 D BIB-SEM is essential to bridge the gap in observational scales between 3 D X-ray μ-CT and FIB-SEM tomography and moreover, to select suitable spots for FIB-SEM porosity analyses (chapter 5). Comparing the results of porosity analyses on the Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays shows similar microstructures and pore space morphologies within the clay-matrix of the fine-grained, clay-rich samples, whereas in more coarse-grained, NCM-rich Ypresian clay samples, significantly different pore space morphologies were observed (chapters 4 and 6). Porosity distributions in the Ypresian clays seem to be bi-modal, whereas in the Boom Clay unimodal porosity distributions were observed. Results of <b>Wood’s</b> metal <b>injection</b> substantiate the high connectivity of the pore space in Boom Clay and the Ypresian clays (chapter 7). In the future, BIB-SEM observed porosities, pore morphologies, pore-size distributions and information on the pore space connectivity should be used to model bulk sample physical properties, such as permeability, diffusivity and electrical resistivity as well as single and multi-phase fluid flow and the migration of radionuclides in the analyzed materials...|$|R
40|$|Clay rich {{formations}} are investigated thoroughly as candidate host rocks for {{the deep}} geological storage of radioactive waste. In the Mont Terri Rock Laboratory (Switzerland) Opalinus Clay is investigated {{with the aim}} to analyse its hydrological, geochemical and rock mechanical properties. Detailed investigation of the pore morphology and pore space contributes {{to the understanding of}} the sealing capacity, coupled flow, and associated deformation in clay. The Opalinus Clay formation is a fine-grained sedimentary rock deposited 180 Ma ago in a shallow sea compacted to a low porosity of 9 – 25 % (depending on the measuring method used) and low permeability. On the regional scale the lateral variability of facies and lithology is low. Opalinus Clay is subdivided in six subfacies where the two end-members are the Shaly and the Sandy facies. To minimize damage of the clays microstructure the samples investigated, in this study, were carefully dried, as described in Chapter 2. After drying samples were imaged using a combination of Broad-Ion-Beam (BIB) milling and Scanning-Electron-Microscope (SEM) imaging. The method allows direct imaging of the clay fabric and porosity down to the nm scale. Visible porosity in the SE-micrographs was than segmented either manually or automatically (Chapter 3). A combination of BIB-milling and SEM imaging allows large representative area investigation of claystones, and a summary on porosity, pore morphology and pore size distribution of undamaged Opalinus Clay Shaly facies microstructures can be found in Chapter 4. This approach is able to provide a qualitative study of porosity as well as quantification of the pores directly from the micrographs at the nm - µm scale. Although the overall micro fabric differs per layer and per facies (Chapter 5), a low variability of the microstructure and porosity has been observed within each mineral phase. For example microstructurally the BIB polished cross-sections, produced in samples that have a high content of clay matrix (> 60 %), display comparable microstructures for Sandy and Shaly facies samples of Opalinus Clay. The same is true for the pore size distribution and prominent pore shape per mineral phase, independent of the facies or polished cross-sections investigated; the pores within the clay matrix follow a similar pore size distribution and possess similar pore shapes. The large mineral grains, fossil shells and mineral aggregates are completely surrounded by the clay matrix, where the kind and amount of minerals depend on the facies of Opalinus Clay. The microstructure and porosity of the Shaly facies has also been investigated in 3 D using a combination of µ-CT, BIB-SEM and FIB-SEM techniques (Chapter 6). The µ-CT measurements are used to get a 3 D microstructural overview down to the µm scale. Afterwards a 2 D BIB-polished cross-section was made through the µ-CT sample to examine the 2 D microstructure down to the nm scale. FIB-SEM was used to study the 3 D pore connectivity on two selected areas (Clay matrix and fossil shell) down to the nm scale. Next to the samples from the undisturbed Shaly and Sandy facies of Opalinus Clay, samples from the ‘Main fault’ (Mont Terri rock laboratory, Switzerland) were investigated, for the details see Chapter 7. Differences in microstructure with the undisturbed samples are the numerous micrometer wide calcite, celestine and pyrite filled veins present in the disturbed samples. Furthermore, damage zones of about 15 µm wide featuring less porosity are present. In order to investigate the pore connectivity <b>Wood’s</b> metal <b>injection</b> experiments were performed (Chapter 8). Preliminary results show that Wood’s metal although present in the bigger cracks and a few pores did not intruded a greater part of the pores present in the sample. This can indicate that that the connecting pore throats are smaller than 9 nm wide...|$|R
40|$|Shales are {{the most}} {{abundant}} sedimentary rocks and as such they are important constituents of sedimentary basins. The characterization of the pore space and mi-crostructure of shales is crucial for many applications in geosciences. For example in the reservoir characterization of gas shales, in basin modeling studies, in understanding of sealing behavior and in hydrocarbon generation in organic-rich shales. Because these fine-grained rocks have relatively low porosity and permeability, under-standing of their petrophysical properties is difficult and requires new methods and techniques. One such newly developed method is the combination of Broad-Ion-Beam (BIB) milling and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This method allows imaging pores with resolution down to 5 nm in equivalent diameter, and quantitative measurement of porosity in representative elementary area {{on the scale of}} a few mm 2. The aim of the dissertation (Chapter 1) is to investigate the porosity and microstruc-ture in organic-rich shales of the Posidonia Shale, Haynesville Shale and Bossier Shale formations with different maturities, using BIB-SEM. In more detail, the effect of grain size, mineralogy and maturity on pore space is investigated and the connectivity of the pore space is assessed. Chapter 2 describes complementary techniques like Focused Ion Beam (FIB) -SEM, Micro Computed Tomography (MicroCT), Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP) and <b>Wood’s</b> Metal <b>Injection</b> (WMI). The BIB-SEM method and workflow is explained in detail in Chapter 3. The first BIB-SEM study (Chapter 4) reports on two early mature (VRr = 0. 59 and 0. 61) samples of Posidonia Shale from the Hils Syncline in Germany. Pore morphologies and pore sizes are clearly related to the mineral phases. The porosity resolvable by BIB-SEM is 2. 75 and 2. 74 %. Pore size distribution can be described by a power law function. The pores in the carbonate fossils show a dual-power law distribution. By extrap-olating the power-law distribution for a sample, total porosity is estimated and can be compared with values gained by MIP. Comparison between the imaged porosity and the MIP porosity suggest a very high pore body to pore throat ratio. This results in a pore model where large pores, represented mainly by pores in fossils and calcite grains, are connected via a low-porous clay-rich matrix with pore throats below 10 nm. In the following chapter (Chapter 5) four Haynesville Shale and four Bossier Shale samples of different maturity, fabric and mineralogy are described using BIB-SEM. This variability within the samples enabled to study the controls on the porosity distribution in these shales. Pores exist as intraparticle pores mainly in carbonate grains and py-rite framboids and as interparticle pores, mainly in the clay-rich matrix. Pore sizes are power law distributed and a positive trend of organic-matter porosity with maturity was found. Porosities measured by BIB-SEM are significantly lower than porosities obtained by MIP. In Chapter 6 an alternative method of MIP is presented. WMI in combination with BIB-SEM allows imaging of the solid Wood’s Metal (WM) -filled pores. WMI was conducted at 316 MPa. The samples were BIB polished followed by high resolution SEM imaging. SEM investigations showed WM-filled pores down to at least 10 nm and almost full impregnation of the WM in the Boom Clay sample and heterogeneous impregnation in the Bossier Shale sample. The Opalinus Clay and Haynesville Shale samples showed WM mainly in cracks and in larger pores directly adjacent to those cracks. These first results suggest that many published MIP data on mudstones could contain serious methodological artifacts and reliable metal intrusion porosimetry requires a demon-stration that the metal has entered the pores. Moreover, results show that, in particu-lar for the Opalinus Clay, the pore throats are actually smaller than suggested by Mercury data, resulting in higher capillary resistance and thus a higher sealing capacity. Chapter 7 reports on the microstructural characterization of porosity, mineralogy and organic matter in 2 and 3 dimensions of an organic-rich Haynesville Shale sample. Sample size varies from several centimeters down to 10 micrometers in size using op-tical microscopy, BIB/FIB-SEM, MicroCT and WMI. The sample consists of a heterogeneous mineralogy and fabric, uniformly distributed on the centimeter scale except for one millimeter-size carbonate-rich layer. Organic matter shows the largest pore networks, up to 8 μm in length. The organic matter is connected throughout the sample and is therefore the most probable controlling factor for gas transport. In Chapter 8 presents the microstructural characterization of porosity of two organic-rich Posidonia Shale samples with different maturates (VRr = 0. 91 and 1. 52), using BIB-SEM. Results show that both samples have a similar pore size distribution, but the ma-ture sample contains a lower visible porosity (0. 82 % vs. 2. 47 %). The postmature sample contains intra-organic-matter pores, which are notably different from the mature sample that contains crack-type porosity at the organic-matter – mineral interface. The latter are interpreted either to be due to shrinkage because of devolatization or hydraulic fracturing because of hydrocarbon generation. The transition from these crack-type porosity into intra-organic-matter pores is interpreted because of thermal maturation. Final concluding remarks are given in the last chapter (Chapter 9) ...|$|R
