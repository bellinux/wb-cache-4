500|$|In a 1994 interview, Joel {{dismissed}} {{criticism of}} unclear elements in their films: [...] "People {{have a problem}} dealing {{with the fact that}} our movies are not straight-ahead. They would prefer that the last half of Barton Fink just be about a screenwriter's writing-block problems and how they get resolved in the real world...." [...] Talk show host Larry King expressed approval of the movie, despite its uncertain conclusion. He wrote in USA Today: [...] "The ending is something I'm still thinking about and if they accomplished that, I guess it worked." [...] In a 2016 interview, screenwriter Charlie Kaufman said after being asked which film he would want with him on a deserted island, [...] "A movie I really love is Barton Fink. I don’t know if that’s the movie I’d take to a desert island, but I feel like there’s so much in there, you could watch it again and again. That’s important to me, especially if that was the only movie I’d have <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Before the launch, Blair {{announced}} that he would give the £4.6m advance and all royalties from his memoirs to a sports centre for injured soldiers. In an interview with Jonathon Gatehouse, he conceded, [...] "You wouldn't be human if you didn't feel both a sense of responsibility and a deep sadness for those who have lost their lives. That responsibility stays with me now, and will stay <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rest of my life. You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
