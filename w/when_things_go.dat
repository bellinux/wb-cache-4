500|$|To {{cover up}} the {{symptoms}} of his disorder, Joseph resorts to stealing pharmacy drug Fentanyl and self-administering it before operations. [...] In the episode [...] "Before A Fall" [...] he overdoses on the drug, but is saved by his colleague Jac Naylor. Shortly thereafter, they become a couple, although Joseph is unaware that Jac is only interested in {{him because of his}} father's influence. Jac manipulates Joseph into having his father add her to a surgical team flying out to Dubai to perform pioneering surgery. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> awry there, she convinces Joseph to lie about their qualifications so that they can perform the operation themselves, which endangers both their careers, and results in their lives being threatened by the patient's influential father. [...] In the episode [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] Jac begins cheating on Joseph with his own father, for a period of several months, until Lord Byrne calls an end to the deception and confesses their infidelity to his son.|$|E

500|$|Little Mix co-wrote [...] "DNA" [...] with TMS and Iain James. TMS {{developed}} the song's guitar riff, drum beats and synths. It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel Aslet and Ben Collier. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, USA, and Tom Coyne {{was responsible for}} the song's mastering. [...] "DNA" [...] was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy. In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen, Perrie Edwards explained: [...] "When a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy. That's what 'DNA' is about." [...] The group wrote [...] "DNA" [...] as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love. It was also written as a song about obsession. Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, Leigh-Anne Pinnock mentioned: [...] "It's not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> bad you do go like that, you stalk them on Facebook..." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{his senior}} year, Jeff Barker of The Baltimore Sun noted that Turner's {{strengths}} were [...] "poise, smarts, [...] toughness," [...] {{while he had}} room for improvement in arm strength and mobility. Barker said, [...] "He's a bit streaky—he calls himself a 'rhythm' passer … But he doesn't quit <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> poorly. His coolness can be mistaken for apathy." [...] Turner typically confines himself to the pocket, as his ability to run the ball himself is limited by his speed. He has made light of his own lack of quickness by saying that he runs a [...] "flat 5.0"-second 40-yard dash. The CBS Sports-affiliated NFL Draft Scout records his actual time as ranging {{from a low of}} 4.89to a high of 5.16seconds, while Scout.com reports his 40-yard time as 4.8seconds. Turner's supposedly one-dimensional nature, however, has occasionally allowed him to make unexpected plays with his feet. The most noteworthy of these were the momentum-changing 41-yard option run against NC State in 2007, and the fourth-down nine-yard scramble into field goal range against North Carolina in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Set {{some time}} before {{the events of the}} first game, the main character, whose name is later {{revealed}} to be Jeremy Fitzgerald, has started working as a night watch security guard at the [...] "new and improved" [...] Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The [...] "upgraded" [...] versions of the animatronic characters, which have special facial recognition software to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise to find people to entertain, which happens to be in the player's office. The player must again listen to the instructions of a [...] "phone guy", and attempt to defend themselves from the animatronics using several mechanics. Like the previous game, the player must survive from midnight to 6 AM. Jeremy is apparently moved to day shift after Night 6 as the animatronics' hostility becomes too dangerous, with the restaurant closing down shortly after.|$|E

500|$|According to Rowson, White's first {{advantage}} is that, [...] "The {{advantage of the}} first move has some similarities with the serve in tennis in that White can score an 'ace' (for instance with a powerful opening novelty), he has {{more control over the}} pace and direction of the game, and he has a 'second serve' in that <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong his position is not usually losing." [...] Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, [...] "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." [...] Third, some players are able to use the initiative to [...] "play a kind of powerful 'serve and volley' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep preparation and attacking prowess." [...] Fourth, [...] "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This {{advantage is}} particularly acute in cases where there is a possible threefold repetition, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing." ...|$|E
500|$|The comic {{efficacy}} of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He {{has a low}} intelligence level and is described by director David Silverman as [...] "creatively brilliant in his stupidity". Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and [...] "is devoted to his stomach". His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to [...] "change ... his mind <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> badly". Homer often spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern, and was shown in the episode [...] "Duffless" [...] (season four, 1993) as a full-blown alcoholic. He is very envious of his neighbors, Ned Flanders and his family, and is easily enraged by Bart. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short [...] "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation, because doing so [...] "seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily." [...] Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would [...] "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped. Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.|$|E

2500|$|Windhorse {{has several}} {{meanings}} in the Tibetan context. As Karmay notes, [...] "the word [...] is still and often mistakenly taken to mean only the actual flag {{planted on the}} roof of a house or on a high place near a village. In fact, it is a symbol of the idea of well-being or good fortune. This idea is clear in such expressions as rlung rta dar ba, the 'increase of the windhorse,' <b>when</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> well with someone; rlung rta rgud pa, the 'decline of windhorse,' when the opposite happens. The colloquial equivalent for this is lam ’gro, which also means luck." ...|$|E

Matsunashi has said that all her films [...] "are based on my own previous experiences with my ex-boyfriends" [...] and The Way of the Director is centered around two characters Saito and Kitagawa who both aspire to be directors. Saito makes a name for herself in independent films but Kitagawa is persuaded by a friend to become a porn director though he still dreams of going legitimate. Meeting Saito again after ten years, Kitagawa gets the idea of filming a trek to northern Hokkaido in winter with Saito. <b>When</b> <b>things</b> <b>go</b> wrong and Saito dies, Kitagawa eats her flesh to survive but eventually succumbs as well. A friend rescues his film footage and Kitagawa finally becomes a mainstream director.|$|E

Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm {{not going to get the}} chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series?
