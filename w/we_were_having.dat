25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, you know? So I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed {{for a few months}} and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that and said we should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E

At this point the group got very motivated, and incorporated the word [...] "zigazig-ha" [...] into the lyrics. Chisholm told Billboard magazine: [...] "You know when you're in a gang and you're having a laugh and you make up silly words? Well <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a giggle and we made up this silly word, zigazig-ha. We were in the studio and it all came together in this song." ...|$|E

500|$|Ray Charles was 28years old in 1958, {{with ten}} years of {{experience}} recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style {{similar to that of}} Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know shit about making records, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

[...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress.

Goode interpreted Veidt's back-story to portray him with a German accent in private and an American one in public; Goode explained Veidt gave up his family's wealth and traveled the world, becoming a self-made man because he was ashamed of his parents' Nazi past, which in turn highlighted the themes of the American Dream and the character's duality.

500|$|Berkman {{encouraged}} Diener and Boxenbaum {{to fly out}} to Los Angeles {{to watch}} a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, {{so he could be}} the star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> sort of an affair and I eventually quit my other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV upon the album's release, Big Boi explained that most of its material had been finished while at Jive, stating [...] "It's basically the same album.

The last two songs, 'You Ain't No DJ' and 'Be Still,' were the last two records, but everything else was already on there". Despite his individual release, OutKast as a group remained signed to Jive. After leaving Jive, Big Boi contacted record executive and Island Def Jam CEO/chairman L.A. Reid, who had originally signed OutKast to LaFace in 1992. He played Reid a track from the album, [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", which persuaded him to actualize a contract for Big Boi. Following two months of negotiations, Big Boi signed a three-album deal with Def Jam Recordings in March 2010.|$|E

500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, knowing you can go out there and impose your will each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>having</b> a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, you want to run the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E

Patrick retaliated by cursing at Earnhardt on the radio and ramming him on pit road. Earnhardt was perplexed with Patrick's reaction, saying [...] "I mean, what am I supposed to say other than the truth? We didn't have any brakes going into the corner.
