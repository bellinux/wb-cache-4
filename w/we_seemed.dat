25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. <b>We</b> <b>seemed</b> to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains for me the metaphor of his career.|$|E
500|$|Record {{producer}} Greg Fidelman {{said that}} [...] "the {{fact that the}} songs were still new and fresh to them, and they hadn't been playing them for six months in rehearsal, kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high." [...] Vocalist Tom Araya said that there [...] "are two principal music writers in this band, so you're {{going to get a}} combination of speed and heaviness," [...] and later said that the [...] "writing is really aggressive and fast, while Jeff likes things to be fast, but with melodies and grooves. In making this album, <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> to share the same vision from song ideas to titles; when we get together as Slayer, it just happens, nothing is contrived, it's not thought out, we just do it, and we did that with this new album." [...] Lombardo said that Hanneman's writing and performance had [...] "gone back to this great punk energy, especially with 'Psychopathy Red'." ...|$|E

They worked on it again during the joint sessions for Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). During this time, guitarist Ed O'Brien kept an online diary of the band's progress, and wrote in January 2000: [...] " [...] has been kicking around for about four years now and each time we approached it <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> to be going down the same old paths. It actually sounds like the start of something exciting now." [...] One month later, he wrote: [...] "This is something like approach number 561 {{but it is a}} great song. It's simply {{trying to find a way}} of doing it which excites us. And we may have found a way, at the very least we've found a new approach … It may of course be utter crap and we have so lost the plot on this song. Please don't let that be the case." [...] The band failed to find an arrangement that satisfied them, and the song remained unreleased.|$|E

He refers to his achievements, such as The West Wing and The Social Network, but when Liz Lemon mentions Studio 60, he quickly replies, [...] "Shut up!" [...] During the March 2012 promotion of Bent, an NBC romantic comedy series starring Amanda Peet, Peet commented on what the issue was with Studio 60, saying it was [...] "too expensive and {{there was too much}} anticipation. I guess all together <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> like this arrogant monolith, but individually, none of us felt very arrogant." ...|$|E
2500|$|Between 2005 and 2006, Queen + Paul Rodgers {{embarked}} on a world tour, {{which was the first}} time Queen toured since their last tour with Freddie Mercury in 1986. The band's drummer Roger Taylor commented; [...] "We never thought we would tour again, Paul [...] came along by chance and <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a chemistry. Paul is just such a great singer. He's not trying to be Freddie." [...] The first leg was in Europe, the second in Japan, and the third in the US in 2006. Queen received the inaugural VH1 Rock Honors at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 25 May 2006. The Foo Fighters paid homage to the band in performing [...] "Tie Your Mother Down" [...] to open the ceremony before being joined on stage by May, Taylor, and Paul Rodgers, who played a selection of Queen hits.|$|E
2500|$|In 1917, he {{attended}} the University of Madrid, first studying agronomy then industrial engineering and finally switching to philosophy. [...] He developed a very close relationship with painter Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming {{the nucleus of the}} Spanish Surrealist avant-garde, [...] and becoming known as members of [...] "La Generación del 27". Buñuel was especially taken with Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: [...] "We liked each other instantly. [...] Although <b>we</b> <b>seemed</b> to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of our time together... We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world." [...] Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.|$|E
