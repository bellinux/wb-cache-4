5000|$|Screenwriting is a {{freelance}} profession. No education is required to become a professional screenwriter, just good storytelling abilities and imagination. Screenwriters are not hired employees but contracted freelancers. Most, if not all, screenwriters start their careers writing on speculation (spec) and so write without being hired or paid for it. If such a script is sold, it is called a spec script. What separates a professional screenwriter from an amateur screenwriter is that professional screenwriters are usually represented by a talent agency. Also, professional screenwriters do not often <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>free,</b> but amateur screenwriters will often <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>free</b> and are considered [...] "writers in training." [...] Spec scripts are usually penned by unknown professional screenwriters and amateur screenwriters.|$|R
