40|$|In this study, two {{varieties}} (Green and red) of <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> (Trapa sp.) {{have been}} selected for their biochemical analysis as well as nutrient composition using standard methods. The proximate composition of green <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> revealed moisture 62. 5, ash 1. 04, crude fiber 2. 13 %, total soluble sugar 0. 92 %, reducing sugar 0. 33 %, non-reducing sugar 0. 59 %, starch 8. 7 %, lipid 0. 84 %. One hundred gram of green variety contained water soluble protein 0. 275 mg, β-Carotene 60 μg, vitamin-C 1. 1 mg and total phenol 0. 5 mg. The minerals contents of green variety were potassium 5. 22 %, sodium 0. 64 %, calcium 0. 25 %, phosphorus 6. 77 %, sulpher 0. 38 %, and iron, copper, manganese and zinc 200, 430, 90 and 600 ppm, respectively. The red variety contained moisture 62. 7 %, ash 1. 30 %, crude fiber 2. 27 %, total soluble sugar 0. 90 %, reducing sugar 0. 30 %, non-reducing sugar 0. 60 %, starch 8. 2 %, lipid 0. 83 %. The red variety contained water soluble protein 0. 251 mg, β-Carotene 92 μg, vitamin-C 0. 9 mg and total phenol 0. 60 mg per 100 g. The red variety contained potassium 5. 32 %, sodium 0. 59 %, calcium 0. 26 % phosphorus 6. 77 %, sulpher 0. 32 %, Iron 200 ppm, copper 450 ppm, manganese 110 ppm and zinc 650 ppm. The free amino acids, glutamic acid, tryptophan, tyrosine, alanine, lysine and leucine were commonly found in both varieties. In addition, green and red variety contained cysteine, arginine and proline and glutamine and asparagines, respectively. Thus, the present study sheds light on the nutrient contents of the two varieties of <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> and suggests that <b>water</b> <b>chestnuts</b> may {{play a crucial role}} in human nutrition...|$|R

50|$|Chinese <b>water</b> <b>chestnut</b> {{is usually}} not very prone to pests, {{nevertheless}} some animals and fungi may attack the plant: Water fowl may damage the stems and corms, especially when plants are young. Similarly, rodents and grazing animals {{pose a threat to}} the Chinese <b>water</b> <b>chestnut,</b> which may be discouraged by keeping the paddy inundated. Fly larvae (Trichoptera sp.) and other leaf-eating caterpillars also feed on the stems. However, unless complete defoliation below the waterline occurs, the plants can normally tolerate this damage. Plant hoppers (Fulgoridae) and scale insects feed on plant sap and may cause subsequent death. Other pests represent nematodes Ditylenchus spp. and Dolichodorus heterocephalus. Fungal species can also attack the Chinese <b>water</b> <b>chestnut.</b> In warmer climates, a rust is caused by uromyces and Cylindrosporium eleocharidis is causing stem blight.|$|E
