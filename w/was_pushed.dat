5|$|In the early-to-mid- Mesozoic {{the western}} edge of the North American {{continent}} <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> against the oceanic plate under the Pacific Ocean, creating a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a type of contact between different crustal plates where heavier crust slides below lighter crust. Erupting volcanoes and uplifting mountains were created as a result, and the coastline <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> to the west. The Sierran Arc started to form to the northwest from heat and pressure generated from subduction, and compressive forces caused thrust faults to develop.|$|E

5|$|Leith {{spent seven}} months of {{recording}} and writing and worked with Bryon Jones, James Roche and Ross Fraser.

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R

5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships <b>was</b> <b>pushed</b> back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

50|$|Many {{people believe}} that {{spacecraft}} using solar sails <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> by the Solar winds just as sailboats and sailing ships <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> by the winds across the waters on Earth.

50|$|Movable objects {{can only}} <b>be</b> <b>pushed,</b> not pulled, {{and two or}} more objects in a row cannot <b>be</b> <b>pushed,</b> {{even if they are}} all movable.

Attempting to push an immovable object or row of objects will result in a wasted move, though attempting to walk into an obstacle will not waste a move.|$|R

5|$|Community {{opposition}} did exist, {{mainly from}} residents of Ahwatukee.

After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E
5|$|In 1917 Harry Wimperis {{introduced}} the Course Setting Bomb Sight (CSBS), which replaced {{the tables and}} timings used in earlier sights with a simple mechanical calculator capable of solving the sideways drift due to the wind.
