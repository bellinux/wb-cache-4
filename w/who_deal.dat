5|$|Hawks's first all {{sound film}} was The Dawn Patrol, {{based on an}} {{original}} story by John Monk Saunders and (unofficially) Hawks. Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written Wings. He {{was considered one of}} the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it. Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an Academy Award for Best Story in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred Richard Barthelmess and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that Howard Hughes was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic Hell's Angels, which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including Elmer Dyer, Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage The Dawn Patrol. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930—he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two Royal Flying Corps pilots during World War I <b>who</b> <b>deal</b> with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.|$|E

25|$|Three {{statements}} {{referred to}} the case of Vignes Mourthi, who had been convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to death. Shadrake had drawn {{attention to the fact that}} one Sergeant Rajkumar from the Central Narcotics Bureau was under investigation for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act at around the time he was giving evidence in Mourthi's case. Shadrake then stated that the high echelons of the judiciary knew about Rajkumar's misdeeds but deliberately suppressed knowledge of them until after Mourthi had been executed. There was no rational basis for these statements. Shadrake claimed that the judiciary would have known of the proceedings against Rajkumar because members of the subordinate judiciary, <b>who</b> <b>deal</b> with 95% of the cases in Singapore, and prosecutors, are both drawn from the Singapore Legal Service. Furthermore, some judges of the Supreme Court were elevated from the Subordinate Courts and had served stints in the Attorney-General's Chambers. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court's findings that this was too incredible and attenuated to form a rational basis for the claim.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{medical and}} {{psychological}} investigations into consciousness {{are based on}} psychological experiments (including, for example, the investigation of priming effects using subliminal stimuli), and on case studies of alterations in consciousness produced by trauma, illness, or drugs. [...] Broadly viewed, scientific approaches are based on two core concepts. [...] The first identifies the content of consciousness with the experiences that are reported by human subjects; the second makes use {{of the concept of}} consciousness that has been developed by neurologists and other medical professionals <b>who</b> <b>deal</b> with patients whose behavior is impaired. [...] In either case, the ultimate goals are to develop techniques for assessing consciousness objectively in humans as well as other animals, and to understand the neural and psychological mechanisms that underlie it.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{discussed}} {{the theme of}} death found in Departures. Scott highlighted {{the contrast between the}} taboo of death and the value of jobs related to it. He also noted the role of the encoffiner in showing [...] "one last act of compassion" [...] by presenting the dead in a way which preserved proud memories of their life. Initially, Daigo and his family are unable to overcome the taboos and their squeamishness when faced with death. Daigo is alienated from his wife and friends owing to traditional values. Ultimately it is through his work with the dead that Daigo finds fulfilment, and, as Peter Howell of the Toronto Star concluded, viewers realize that [...] "death may be the termination of a life, but it's not the end of humanity". Okuyama writes that, in the end, the film (and the book on which it was based) serves as a [...] "quiet yet persistent protest" [...] against the discrimination which people <b>who</b> <b>deal</b> with death continue to face in modern Japan: death is a normal part of life, not something repulsive.|$|E
500|$|Like other ABC shows, Quantico has a racially-diverse cast (allowing {{viewers to}} relate {{to at least one}} character) as FBI {{recruits}} <b>who</b> <b>deal</b> with their individual problems. Safran had wanted the show to be diverse from the beginning, saying: [...] "You’re not just watching people who have struggled to achieve places of power and they’re there. This show is about the struggle to achieve that. Their politics and their racial makeup and their religious backgrounds are very important to their characterizations and who they are. I really am interested in looking at how every culture handles stress — and in particular, how people from all these different backgrounds find their place in the FBI, an agency that has historically fraught relationships with gay people and people of color." [...] The first actor cast in the series was Tate Ellington, as FBI trainee Simon Asher. Graham Rogers was then cast as another FBI trainee, Caleb Hass. It was announced that Aunjanue Ellis had signed to play Miranda Shaw, assistant director and training supervisor of the academy. Dougray Scott was then cast as Liam O'Connor, Miranda's former partner and current subordinate.|$|E
