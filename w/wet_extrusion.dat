50|$|Moisture is {{the most}} {{important}} of these factors, and affects the mix viscosity, acting to plasticize the extrudate. Increasing moisture will decrease viscosity, torque, and product temperature, and increase bulk density. This will also reduce the pressure at the die. Most extrusion processes for food processing maintain a moisture level below 40%, that is low to intermediate moisture. High-moisture extrusion is known as <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> but it was not used much before the introduction of twin screw extruders (TSE), which have a more efficient conveying capability. The most important rheological factor in the <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> of high-starch extrudate is temperature.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to improve {{dissolution}} behavior of poorly water-soluble drugs by application of cyclodextrin in extrusion processes, which were melt extrusion process and <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. Indomethacin (IM) was employed as a model drug. Extrudates containing IM and 2 -hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CyD) in 1 : 1 w/w ratio were manufactured by both melt extrusion process and <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> process. In vitro drug release properties of IM from extrudates and physiochemical properties of extrudates were investigated. The dissolution rates of IM from extrudates manufactured by melt extrusion and <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> with HP-β-CyD were significantly higher than that of the physical mixture of IM and HP-β-CyD. In extrudate manufactured by melt extrusion, γ-form of IM changed to amorphous completely during melt extrusion due to heating above melting point of IM. On the other hand, in extrudate manufactured by <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> γ-form of IM changed to amorphous partially due to interaction between IM and HP-β-CyD and mechanical agitating force during process. Application of HP-β-CyD in extrusion process is useful for the enhancement of dissolution rate for poorly water-soluble drugs...|$|E
30|$|Electrospinning {{has been}} {{established}} as a notable technique in the fabrication of biomimetic nanofibrous scaffolds using biologically significant polymers. Numerous biodegradable synthetic (e.g., polycaprolactone) and natural polymers (e.g., collagen) have been electrospun into non-woven nanofibrous scaffolds that demonstrate high surface area-to-volume ratios and porosity characteristics, which are important for drug delivery and wound dressing applications. Naturally occurring polymers (e.g., collagen, elastin, and fibrinogen) are particularly attractive wound dressing materials due to their bioactivity, biocompatibility, and unique ability to bind specific growth factors, such as PDGF. Fibrinogen (Fb), a 340 -kDa globular plasma protein, {{plays a major role}} in clot formation through its activated form, fibrin, which functions as a temporary matrix for tissue repair and regeneration. The absence of Fb and fibrin has been correlated with wound healing defects [7]. Fb-based products demonstrate biodegradability, non-immunogenicity, and cellular migration promotion and have been previously developed as hydrogels [8 – 10] and <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> cables [11, 12]; however, the physical and structural properties of these materials have limited their clinical adoption. Hydrogels lack structural and mechanical integrity for long-term use, and <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> fibers exhibit exponentially larger diameter sizes (200 – 250  μm) than the native ECM (200 – 500  nm). Wnek et al. demonstrated that electrospinning, however, offers the capability to fabricate Fb scaffolds that closely resemble natural ECM structures [13]. Although the resulting nanofibers exhibited improved mechanical properties over hydrogels, the structure still lacked optimum mechanical properties for wound dressing applications [14].|$|E

40|$|In the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, pellets {{can be defined}} as small, free-flowing, spherical particulates manufactured by the agglomeration of fine powders or granules of drug substances and excipients using appropriate processing equipment. Pelletization has gained a great interest in recent years due to its various advantages over other similar techniques; such as uniformity of dose and flexibility in dosage form design. There are a number of pelletization techniques currently used by pharmaceutical industry. Among them Extrusion-spheronization and solution/suspension layering are most commonly used in pharmaceutical industries. Other novel techniques include balling, compression, cryopelletization, dry powder layering, hot melt extrusion etc. In this review, a brief account of all the important techniques with special reference to extrusion-spheronization and solution layering is included. Extrusion–spheronization is a multistep process involving dry mixing, <b>wet</b> granulation, <b>extrusion,</b> spheronization, drying, and screening; whereas solution or suspension layering involves deposition of successive layers of drug and binder solution/ suspension on started seeds, which can be either an inert material or granules of same drug. Every technique has their own advantages and limitations, therefore a thorough understanding of the process variables is important before choosing a pelletization method...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a Quality by Design (QbD) {{approach}} {{was used to}} identify the effect of formulation parameters in a twin screw <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> granulation process for the manufacturing of ibuprofen (IBU) granules with increased dissolution rates. A fractional factorial Design of Experiment (DoE) was used to investigate {{the effect of the}} excipient composition, binder amount and liquid to solid (L/S) ratio (independent variables) on drug dissolution rates, median particle size diameter and specific surface area (dependent variables). The intra-granular addition of the binder in inorganic/polymer blends processed with ethanol as granulating liquids facilitated the formation of granules at various particle sizes. DoE regression analysis showed that all formulation parameters affect the dependent variables significantly. The enhanced dissolution rates were attributed not only to the IBU particle size reduction and adsorption in the porous inorganic network but also to the high specific surface area of the produced granules. Dynamic vapour sorption showed increased water absorption for granules with small particle size distribution and high specific surface area...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study to}} detoxify Jatropha curcas seed four {{potential}} detoxification methods were tested for their effectiveness. The first method entailed oil expulsion from unshelled Jatropha curcas seed using a Sunhdra industrial oil expeller. The second method involved laboratory-based petroleum-ether solvent extraction of shelled and minced kernels. Thirdly, shelled kernels were subjected to industrial detoxification that involved double solvent extraction with the hexane-ethanol system accompanied by moist-heat treatment at 90 °C for 30 min. The fourth method was {{an extension of the}} third whereby the meal generated was wet extruded (126 °C, 2 atmospheres, 10 min contact time) followed by re-extraction with hexane and moist heat treatment (121 °C for 30 min). The detoxification methods had significant (P< 0. 0001) effect on both the anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) and the proximate composition of the meals. Oil expulsion left the phorbol esters (PEs) of the unshelled seed at 0. 70 mg g 1, laboratory petroleum-ether extraction reduced the PEs content by 67. 69 % from 6. 5 mg g 1 in the raw shelled kernels to 2. 10 mg g 1, double solvent extraction followed by moist-heat treatment reduced PEs by 70. 77 % to 1. 90 mg g 1. Double solvent extraction accompanied with <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> re-extraction with hexane and moist-heat treatment reduced PEs content to 0. 80 mg g 1, an 87. 69 % decrease. All the methods except laboratory petroleum-ether solvent extraction managed to completely inactivate trypsin inhibitors in the meals. Total phenolics (TPs) content was lowest (P< 0. 0001) in the oil-expulsion produced meal (8. 50 g Kg 1) while the laboratory petroleum-ether produced meal contained 64. 57 g Kg 1 TPs. Oil-expulsion and double solvent extraction accompanied with <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion,</b> re-extraction and moist-heat treatment completely inactivated lectins in the meals. The high chemical nutrient potential of Jatropha curcas seed (crude protein, calcium and phosphorus) is only realised with shelling and extraction of most of the oil. None of the tried methods managed to completely detoxify the Jatropha curcas seed. The two most ‘effective methods’ reduced the PEs to 0. 70 and 0. 80 mg g 1, respectively compared to the non-toxic variety with 0. 11 mg g 1 PEs...|$|E
40|$|Drying is {{a common}} {{pharmaceutical}} process, whose potential to modify the final drug and/or dosage form properties is often underestimated. In the present study, pellets consisting of the matrix former calcium stearate (CaSt) incorporating the active pharmaceutical ingredient ibuprofen were prepared via <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> and spheronization. Subsequent drying was performed by either desiccation, fluid-bed drying, or lyophilization, and the final pellets were compared {{with respect to their}} microstructure. To minimize the effect of solute ibuprofen molecules on the shrinking behavior of the CaSt, low ibuprofen loadings were used, as ibuprofen is soluble in the granulation liquid. Pellet porosity and specific surface area increased during desiccation, fluid-bed drying, and lyophilization. The inlet-air temperature during fluid-bed drying affected the specific surface area, which increased at lower inlet-air temperatures rather than the pellet porosity. The in vitro dissolution profiles were found to be a nonlinear function of the specific surface area. Overall, the microstructure, including porosity, pore size, and specific surface area, of CaSt pellets was a strong function of the drying conditions...|$|E
40|$|Rapeseed meal (RSM) {{contains}} {{a high level}} of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP) that are not well degraded in poultry and interfere with digestion of other nutrients as protein, starch, and fat. By altering physicochemical properties of NSP from RSM, processing and enzyme technologies might improve digestive utilization of RSM, enhancing its potential as a source of nutrients in poultry diets. The effects of <b>wet</b> milling and <b>extrusion</b> in combination with pectolytic enzymes on the degradability of RSM in broilers were investigated in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement. <b>Wet</b> milling and <b>extrusion</b> did not affect total tract apparent digestibility of DM, CP, crude fat, and nonglucose polysaccharides (NGP). Addition of pectolytic enzymes did not affect total tract apparent digestibility of CP and crude fat, but improved degradability of NGP by 9 to 20 % units (P < 0. 001), independent of prior technological processing of RSM. This coincided with an increased NGP concentration in the ceca (4 to 7 g/g of cobalt, P < 0. 001), indicating that more NGP were solubilized such that they could enter the ceca and become available for fermentation. Particle size reduction facilitated solubilization of polysaccharides from RSM, increasing the concentration of NGP found in the ceca (4 g/g of cobalt, P = 0. 008). Without help of additional pectolytic enzymes, those solubilized structures could, however, still not be degraded by the cecal microbiota. Feed intake, BW gain, and feed conversion ratio were not affected. No interaction between processing technologies and enzyme addition was found. Apparently, the processing technologies studied were not facilitating accessibility of NSP to pectolytic enzymes added to the feed in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an {{investigation}} into a potential use of unfired body scrap from a local sanitaryware manufacturer in commercial terracotta production was presented.

Some important physical properties of the resultant products including linear drying shrinkage, linear firing shrinkage and water absorption were determined {{as a function of}} the increasing scrap content. The phase content of the fired compositions was determined by XRD. The relevant polished surfaces were also examined using SEM. The results showed that the physical properties improved on increasing the scrap content.

40|$|Functional {{properties}} {{of corn and}} corn-lentil extrudates were investigated {{as a result of}} extrusion conditions, including feed rate (2. 5 - 6. 8 kg/h), feed moisture (13 - 19 % <b>wet</b> basis) and <b>extrusion</b> temperature (170 - 230 degrees C). Lentil was used in mixtures with corn flour at a ratio of 10 - 50 % (legume/corn). The water absorption index of extrudates increased with extrusion temperature and feed moisture content and decreased with feed rate and lentil/corn ratio. The water Solubility index of extrudates increased with temperature, but decreased with feed moisture content and feed rate. The oil absorption index of extrudates increased with extrusion temperature and decreased with feed rate, feed moisture content and lentil/corn ratio. Generally, the use of lentil flour led to products with lower values for functional properties. Principal component analysis of functional properties discriminated samples with appropriate functionality based on industrial use. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study investigated preparation of partially defatted peanut flours by extrusion, screw pressing, and use of the flours in breakfast cereal flakes. Release of oil by wet and dry extrusion was evaluated. <b>Wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> (using an Anderson International Company expander) was tried initially and abandoned in favor of dry extrusion (using an InstaPro International Company extruder). Thus, fewer samples of earlier product were observed. Dry extrusion, followed by screw pressing removed oil for a total recovery of 90. 6 % of the oil in peanut kernels. Press cakes prepared by dry extrusion had higher protein dispersibility index (PDI) than those made using <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion.</b> Trypsin inhibitor was quite stable to heat treatment, only 23 % was inactivated by dry extrusion and 26 % after screw pressing. Press cakes were roasted (166 'C for 8 min) to develop flavor. Press cakes were ground and evaluated as protein supplement in flakes. Corn cones, ground corn of particle size intermediate between meal and flour, were replaced with unroasted partially defatted peanut flour (PDPF) and roasted flour (R-PDPF) at 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % levels. The mixtures were extruded using a Wenger Manufacturing Company twin-screw extruder to produce collets. The collets were flaked, then roasted at 171 'C for 3 min. Flakes containing 30 % PDPF had 16 % protein. Increasing the peanut flour level decreased the product bulk density and hardness. Lightness and yellowness decreased as the peanut flour content increased. Water absorption (WAI) and water solubility (WSI) indices increased for flakes with addition of peanut flour. Bowl fife, the time for crispiness to disappear after soaking in milk, decreased with addition of peanut flour. Sensory evaluation was conducted for crispiness, color, flavor and overall acceptance using the 9 -point hedonic scale (I = dislike extremely, 9 like extremely). Peanut flavor was also evaluated (I = none, 9 = strong). Untrained sensory panelists (n = 48) evaluated 5 samples of flakes (O%, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % R-PDPF and 30 % PDPF) I min after addition of milk. All flakes were rated acceptable (score > 5. 0). Surprisingly, peanut flavor intensity was the highest for flakes containing 30 % PDPF, rather than the R-PDPF...|$|E
40|$|Hydrate {{formation}} is a phase transition which can occur during manufacturing processes involving water. This work considers {{the prevention of}} hydration of anhydrous olanzapine and hydrate conversions {{in the presence of}} water and polymers (polyethyleneglycol; hydroxypropylcellulose; polyvinylpyrrolidone) in forming pellets by <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> and spheronisation. Anhydrous olanzapine was added to water with or without those polymers prior to extrusion with microcrystalline cellulose. Assessment of olanzapine conversion was made by XRP-Diffraction; FTIR spectroscopy; calorimetry (DSC) and microscopy (SEM for crystal size and shape). The addition of water converted the anhydrous form into dihydrate B and higher hydrate; whereas polyethyleneglycol promoted a selective hydrate conversion into the higher hydrate olanzapine form. Both polyvinylpyrrolidone and hydroxypropylcellulose prevented the hydrate transformations of the anhydrous drug; the latter even in the presence of hydrate seeds. This may be explained by the higher H-bond ability; higher network association and higher hydrophobicity of hydroxypropylcellulose by comparison with polyethyleneglycol and polyvinylpyrrolidone; which could contribute to its higher affinity to the crystal surfaces of the hydrate nuclei/initial crystals and promoting steric hindrance to the incorporation of other drug molecules into the crystal lattice; thus, preventing the crystal growth. The addition of microcrystalline cellulose needed for the pellets production (final product) did not eliminate the protector effect of both hydroxypropylcellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone during pellets’ processing and dissolution evaluation...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} an extruder-based {{continuous}} tablet forming process {{of a sample}} active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and ethyl acetate requires a device to form and compress the tablets. The flow of the <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> {{is driven by the}} pressure head generated by the torque of the screws; the minimum pressure head is dictated by the head loss across the exit die. Since the API powder blend and ethyl acetate solvent form a highly filled suspension paste, the liquid phase tends to flow at a different speed than the solid when the driving pressure changes. As such, the three die geometries, straight, curve, and elbow, resulted in average steady state liquid mass fraction of 0. 179 ± 0. 005, 0. 249 + 0. 01, and 0. 200 ± 0. 009 respectively, although the increases in mass fraction do not correspond to increases in pressure drop across the die. This experiment tests a particular tablet forming process, which involves using the pressure of the extruder to squeeze out the liquid content of the tablets during forming. The occurrence of liquid phase migration after this tabletting process is confirmed in each die tested. The extent of variation in liquid content shows a 30 % increase for the straight die, a 50 - 200 % increase for the curve die, and 50 - 150 % increase for the elbow die. These results suggest that a tablet forming device should not use the pressure of the extruder, due to the complications of paste flow. by Aditi Nagaraj. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|This {{research}} compared {{a traditional}} drug development approach with an enhanced “Quality by Design” (QbD) approach to foster greater process and formulation understanding. Propranolol HCl extended release capsules and Metoprolol Succinate extended release tablets served as targets for development. The formulation and process parameters utilized well-established techniques, such as <b>wet</b> granulation, <b>extrusion,</b> spheronization, and fluid bed processing with commercially available aqueous or organic polymeric systems. ^ Propranolol HCl extended release capsules were a benchmark for current generic pharmaceutical process development to identify basic parameters for a suitable product. Metoprolol Succinate extended release tablets utilized the ICH Q 8 annex guidelines approach to identify target profiles, and then; define, test, and link Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs). Preliminary data supported factor and level selections for the 23 full factorial and Box-Behnken experimental designs for {{elements of a}} conceptual design space. ^ Physical and chemical characterization of commercially available competitors established product target profiles. Particle size distribution, sphericity, moisture content, and dissolution profiles were studied as CQA 2 ̆ 7 s. Preliminary studies for the immediate release beads identified the water quantity during granulation, kneading time during granulation, and the duration of spheronization as significant factors for particle size generation, and sphericity. The traditional approach determined an organic system was necessary for Propranolol HCl to yield a stable extended release product. The aqueous sustained release coating studies for Metoprolol Succinate found the polymer coating level, humidified curing condition, and curing duration were important factors. Altering the excipient blend formulation during initial tabletting trials minimized segregation and bead damage. ^ The full factorial design {{for the development of}} immediate release beads identified spheronization time as a statistically significant factor in determining the standard deviation and relative standard deviation for sphericity. The Box-Behnken design for sustained release beads found the polymer coating levels to be a statistically significant main effect for the dissolution profile. Significant surface damage was apparent throughout the full factorial tabletting design, with a “best case” approach yielding an improved dissolution profile. Traditional approaches incorporated into the QbD approach facilitate variable and level selection throughout the development process. Data generated via these statistical methods supports process understanding and future decision-making. ...|$|R

Samples of J. curcas Meal (JCM) were derived from double solvent extraction of shelled J. curcas kernels in a hexane-ethanol extraction system followed <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> (126 °C, 2 atmospheres, 10 min contact time) and then re-extraction with hexane. The re-extracted JCM was then heated with pressurized steam at 121 °C for 30 min before dried samples {{were used in the}} laboratory analyses. Significant differences (p< 0. 05) in both the nutrient and ANFs existed between the seed meals. The JCM had a significantly higher (p< 0. 05) Crude Protein (CP) with 577. 00 g kg - 1 DM versus 470. 80 g kg - 1 DM in SBM.

40|$|The {{development}} of micro-tubular solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) {{has received more}} and more attention recently due {{to a number of}} advantages of this configuration, such as high volumetric power output and rapid start-up/shut-down. Previously, the fabrication of micro-tubular SOFC was achieved through multiple-step processes, which involves at least one sintering in each step, making the cell fabrication time consuming and costly. For a more economical fabrication of micro-tubular SOFC with more reliability and flexibility in quality control, an advanced dry-jet <b>wet</b> <b>extrusion</b> technique, i. e. a phase inversion-based co-extrusion process, followed by co-sintering and reduction processes has been developed and systematically investigated in this thesis. At the beginning of the study, a dual-layer hollow fibre which consists of a ceriumgadolinium oxide (CGO) electrolyte outer layer of approximately 80 μm supported by an asymmetric nickel (Ni) -CGO anode inner layer, is successfully fabricated using this technique. The resultant cell of the corresponding dual-layer hollow fibre produces the maximum power density of 0. 34 - 0. 68 W cm- 2 at 550 - 600 oC. Improvement on the structure of the dual-layer hollow fibres is performed by reducing the electrolyte layer thickness to as thin as 10 μm and the maximum power density of the corresponding cell increases to about 1. 11 W cm- 2 at 600 oC. However, the value of power density is still slightly lower than what have been previously reported in the literature. One of the major reasons for such lower power output is the less effective porosity in the anode layer of hollow fibres. Therefore, the optimisation on anode porosity of the dual-layer HF is carried out and resulting in the outstanding power output of about 2. 32 W cm- 2 at 600 oC. This result indeed highlights the advantage of co-extrusion/co-sintering as a fabrication technique in developing high quality micro-tubular SOFC.
