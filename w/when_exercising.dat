5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling legal matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing legal advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, legal and policy drafting and reform and international legal co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of the}} government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time of assessment.|$|E

25|$|The {{balance of}} federal powers and those powers {{held by the}} states as defined in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution was first {{addressed}} {{in the case of}} McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). The Court's decision by Chief Justice John Marshall asserted that the laws adopted by the federal government, <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> its constitutional powers, are generally paramount over any conflicting laws adopted by state governments. After McCulloch, the primary legal issues in this area concerned the scope of Congress' constitutional powers, and whether the states possess certain powers to the exclusion of the federal government, even if the Constitution does not explicitly limit them to the states.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>exercising</b> appellate {{jurisdiction}} in civil cases, the High Court hears appeals from District Courts, Magistrates' Courts and other tribunals. The {{permission of the}} High Court, a District Court or Magistrate's Court is needed for an appeal from a District Court or Magistrate's Court case where the amount in dispute or {{the value of the}} subject-matter does not exceed $50,000. Such appeals are usually heard by a single judge, although if he or she thinks fit the appeal may be fixed before a court of three judges. In such cases, the appeal is decided according to the opinion {{of the majority of the}} judges. If the Court is of the view that the trial judge's decision was correct, it will dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision below. Otherwise, the appeal is allowed and the trial judge's decision is overturned.|$|E
25|$|When {{the body}} is {{expending}} more energy than it is consuming (e.g. <b>when</b> <b>exercising),</b> the body's cells rely on internally stored energy sources, such as complex carbohydrates and fats, for energy. The first source to which the body turns is glycogen (by glycogenolysis). Glycogen is a complex carbohydrate, 65% of which is stored in skeletal muscles and the remainder in the liver (totaling about 2,000 kcal in the whole body). It is created from the excess of ingested macronutrients, mainly carbohydrates. When glycogen is nearly depleted, the body begins lipolysis, the mobilization and catabolism of fat stores for energy. In this process, fats, obtained from adipose tissue, or fat cells, are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids, {{which can be used}} to generate energy. The primary by-products of metabolism are carbon dioxide and water; carbon dioxide is expelled through the respiratory system.|$|E

The kinetics of phosphofructokinase suggest that in resting muscle, the enzyme is inhibited by ATP plus citrate and that the increase in fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate is part of the mechanism to activate phosphofructokinase <b>when</b> <b>exercise</b> begins. <b>When</b> <b>exercise</b> was sustained, fructose 2, 6 -bisphosphate in muscle was decreased as was the rate of lactate accumulation.

25|$|Judicial {{review is}} {{available}} {{as a means of}} challenging the legality of decisions of all governmental authorities, though it is regarded as a procedure of last resort that should be used only where the individual has no alternative remedy such as a right of appeal. If a right of appeal exists, it is more favourable for a person {{to take advantage of it}} as the appellate court may substitute its decision for that of the original authority and grant a remedy. An appeal may also involve a reconsideration of the merits of the case and not merely its legality, although this depends on the wording of the statute in question. On the other hand, <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> judicial review, the High Court is almost always limited to examining whether public authorities have acted lawfully, and do not evaluate the substantive merits of decisions taken.|$|E
25|$|In general, the Court hears civil appeals {{from any}} High Court {{judgment}} or order. These can be {{decisions made by}} the High Court <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> its original jurisdiction (in other words, cases beginning in the High Court itself) or its appellate jurisdiction (cases appealed to the High Court from the State Courts). However, this general rule is subject {{to a number of}} restrictions. No appeal may be brought from certain interlocutory orders made by the High Court, when a judgment or order is made with the parties' consent, and where a statute declares that a judgment or order of the High Court is final. In some other cases, an appeal may only be brought with the leave of a High Court judge. These include cases where the amount or value of the subject-matter at the trial was S$250,000 or less, and High Court appeals concerning the adoption of children, the making of protection orders to prevent family violence, and maintenance for wives and children.|$|E
25|$|The High Court has general {{supervisory}} and revisionary {{jurisdiction over}} all subordinate courts.

It may then order that the matter be transferred to the High Court or give the subordinate court directions regarding how the matter should be conducted, as justice may require. <b>When</b> <b>exercising</b> supervisory or revisionary jurisdiction, it is for the Court {{to decide whether or not}} to hear submissions from any party to the proceedings; no party has a right to be heard before the Court.

25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion <b>when</b> <b>exercising</b> the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, the legislative history of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E

40|$|Many {{variable}} annuities provide money-back guarantees {{and market}} guarantees on invested principal. Embedded {{in some of}} these guarantees are stochastic maturity put options with adjustable strike prices. These variable annuities can be surrendered or lapsed at any time.

The death benefits we consider are only exercised involuntary, that is, upon the death of the policyholder. Critical to the valuation analysis is that the embedded put options have stochastic maturity and that the policyholder can exercise the lapse, or early-exercise, option feature to increase the value of the contract and thereby exposing the insurance company to loss of fees. We analyze specific variable annuity products by focusing on the lapse option <b>when</b> <b>exercised</b> either rationally or irrationally, taking into account the mortality risk and surrender charges...|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>exercise</b> {{is being}} performed, if the exhale-hold {{technique}} is properly applied, {{a decrease in}} O2 concentrations {{and an increase in}} CO2 concentrations occur in the lungs, the blood and the muscles.

Thus, during exercise with hypoventilation, the blood and muscle acid-base homeostasis is highly disturbed. The studies have also reported an increase in all heart activity when hypoventilation is carried out in terrestrial sports. Cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume and sympathetic modulation to the heart are greater <b>when</b> <b>exercise</b> with hypoventilation is performed in running or cycling.
