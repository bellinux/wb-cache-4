5|$|After the Khmer Republic {{fell to the}} Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975, a {{new regime}} under its charge, Democratic Kampuchea, was formed. Sihanouk was {{appointed}} as its Head of State, a ceremonial position. In September 1975, Sihanouk briefly returned to Cambodia to inter the ashes of his mother, before going abroad again to lobby for diplomatic recognition of Democratic Kampuchea. He returned on 31December 1975 and presided over a meeting to endorse the constitution of Democratic Kampuchea. In February 1976 Khieu Samphan took him on a tour across the Cambodian countryside. Sihanouk <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the use of forced labour and population displacement {{carried out by the}} Khmer Rouge government, known as the Angkar. Following the tour, Sihanouk decided to resign as the Head of State. The Angkar initially rejected his resignation request, though they subsequently accepted it in mid-April 1976, retroactively backdating it to 2April 1976.|$|E
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling into the mud in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Brooke commanded II Corps in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF)—which included in its subordinate formations the 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by the then Major General Bernard Montgomery. As corps commander, Brooke had a pessimistic view of the Allies' chances of countering a German offensive. He was sceptical of the quality and determination of the French Army, and of the Belgian Army. This scepticism appeared to be justified when he was on a visit to some French front-line units; and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> unshaven men, ungroomed horses and dirty vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The other {{version was}} told to Taeko and Laura by Charles Laird in 1984. [...] Laird, a former US Army {{sergeant}} who served on Attu, stated that he was sleeping in a tent the morning of May 30 when Yamasaki's troops broke through the American front lines. [...] A man ran into Laird's tent and Laird shot and killed him, {{only to discover that}} the man was American. [...] Then he saw eight Japanese soldiers approaching through the fog, so he shot and killed them too. [...] One of them was Tatsuguchi. [...] Laird said that he found Tatsuguchi's diary and an address book in which he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> American names and addresses.|$|E
500|$|In First Test at Brisbane Tallon {{took two}} catches but scored only 14 in a victory. Tallon {{was worried that}} his poor batting might lead to him being replaced, but he was {{retained}} as Australia secured an innings victory in Sydney. He put in a polished performance with the gloves, with four catches and two stumpings, in addition to 30runs. The only negative aspect of the match for Tallon was that he dislocated his finger. Beyond the raw statistics, two of the catches that Tallon made in the first innings were regarded as among his finest ever and turned the tide of the match. Len Hutton and Bill Edrichtwo of England's leading batsmenhad seen their team to lunch with only the loss of one wicket. Tallon declared to Bradman {{that he intended to}} dismiss Hutton down the leg side, so Bradman brought off spinner Ian Johnson into the attack immediately after lunch. Johnson was instructed to bowl at Hutton's legs to give him an opportunity to glance the ball. Hutton obliged and struck the ball from the middle of his bat, expecting a boundary. He turned around and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Tallon had intercepted the ball from a blind position at a range of just one metre. The score was 2/88 as Hutton, who held the Test world record score was dismissed and replaced at the batting crease by Denis Compton. Bradman introduced McCool and Compton misjudged a cut shot which went wide of Tallon and struck Johnson, fielding at slip, in the chest. The ball rebounded past Tallon's shoulder and was heading for the ground when he spun and dived backwards to catch it just before it landed. According to Roland Perry, it was [...] "an acrobatic feat that would put any trapeze artist in the shade, taking one of the most brilliant catches in Test history". Tallon took another difficult catch from McCool to dismiss Hammond as England fell to 4/99, with three specialist batsmen to improbable catches. This restricted England and allowed Australia to set up a match-winning lead.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 1989, Jackson barehanded a line-drive off {{the left}} field wall on a {{hit-and-run}} play against the Seattle Mariners. With speedy Harold Reynolds running from first {{base on the}} play, Scott Bradley's hit would have been deep enough to score him against most outfielders. But Jackson, from the warning track, turned flat footed and fired a strike on the fly to catcher Bob Boone, who tagged out the sliding Reynolds. Jackson's throw reached Boone on the fly. Interviewed for the [...] "Bo Jackson" [...] episode of ESPN Classic's SportsCentury, Reynolds admitted that he thought {{there was no way}} anyone would throw him out on such a deep drive into the gap in left-center, and <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his teammate telling him to slide as he rounded third base.|$|E

Deng Dang <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded Lü Meng and warned him to stop. Lü Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told Lü Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, Lü Meng said, [...] "It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can we catch the tiger cub if we don't enter the tiger's den?" [...] Lü Meng's mother sighed and let him have his way.|$|E

Her eyes were still fine, {{and there was still}} beauty in the bone structure of her face beneath the wrinkles and ravages of hard living. Her hands shook, and when she wished to go to the loo she had to ask Monica Chapman to accompany her to help her with her clothing." ...|$|E

During the season, Campbell was partnered at the back by either Tony Adams (who would retire {{at the end of the}} season) or Martin Keown. He made a return to White Hart Lane during a 1–1 draw on 17 November, and though he played well, he <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his older brother Tony in the crowd {{supporting}} Spurs as the fans shouted insults out to Campbell on the pitch. Campbell enjoyed immediate success with Arsenal, as he won both Premier League and FA Cup winners' medals as Arsenal won the Double in his first season at Highbury. In the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium on 4 May, he played alongside Adams as the team kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Chelsea.
