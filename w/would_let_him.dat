Her husband had worked at Hotelito Desconocido, which was managed by Gerardo's wife Wendy Dalaithy Amaral Arévalo. Tobares first worked at Hotelito Desconocido, but Gerardo invited him to join Nudoki Sushi Bar, arguing {{he did not know}} about cuisine and that he <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> run the business. Gerardo {{reportedly}} offered to make Tobares his business partner. By that time, Tobares had separated from his wife and was open to new work opportunities.

He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

He attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where he played third base or left field because of an upperclassman at the catcher position. During the summer in 2001, Hanigan played in the New England Collegiate Baseball League, where he hit [...]282 in 38 games. In his junior year, he hit [...]384 with 48 RBIs over 57 games for Rollins, as the team finished 41–16 and clinched a berth to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship. Hanigan would have served as team captain his senior year; when he left Rollins, Hanigan's [...]359 career batting average was seventh best in school history.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} aspect of Todd's appearance for St. John was his character's hair. His preference was that Todd's hair was a little shorter; he told Soap Opera Weekly (SOW) that he thought that Todd's hair was too [...] "shaggy", which was not his personal style, and that he hoped the writers and producers <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> trim off a bit. When he first got the role, St. John's hair resembled Howarth's shorter chin-length haircut, which was initially worn from 2000 to 2003, and St. John was told by the writers and producers not to change his hair until further notice. St. John [...] "made the creative choice [...] go because [...] not really right in the old noggin, and gained weight for the role.|$|E

In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him,</b> Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he can do as an actor, and this is a character that <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 13 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Fenrir {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in a stanza quoted from Völuspá. Fenrir is first mentioned in prose in chapter 25, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about the god Týr. High says that {{one example of}} Týr's bravery {{is that when the}} Æsir were luring Fenrir (referred to here as Fenrisúlfr) to place the fetter Gleipnir on the wolf, Týr placed his hand within the wolf's mouth as a pledge. This was done at Fenrir's own request because he did not trust that the Æsir <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go. As a result, when the Æsir refused to release him, he bit off Týr's hand at a location [...] "now called the wolf-joint" [...] (the wrist), causing Týr to be one-handed and [...] "not considered to be a promoter of settlements between people." ...|$|E

He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge. She could have warned her husband, but decided that a [...] "clean death in the rain {{was the best thing that}} could happen to Robert Forrest". O'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest's scheme.|$|E

500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about sitting {{in the front of the}} theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in line to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go in front of them without saying anything. The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E
500|$|Viewership did drop {{significantly}} in Season 2, and Carnivàle was cancelled in 2005 after {{two of six}} planned seasons. In a post-cancellation interview, Daniel Knauf was positive that someone <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> finish his story someday, if not as a television series, then possibly {{as a series of}} features or graphic novels. Knauf approached Marvel Comics to continue the future Carnivàle storyline that he had kept to himself. They seemed interested, but HBO, who own the show and the characters, would not confer their rights. During the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, Knauf stated that [...] "an idiosyncratic show like Carnivàle would never be greenlit today," [...] and claimed that present-day television included a high percentage of [...] "talking heads" [...] with [...] "the vast majority of television writers [...] visual storytellers." [...] Enjoying his creative freedom as graphic storyteller, he has considered directing his efforts away from television series creation. Meanwhile, the mythology of Carnivàle remains in the public conscience. In 2008, Alessandra Stanley of the Australian newspaper The Age remembered Carnivàle as a [...] "smart, ambitious series that move unusual characters around an unfamiliar setting imaginatively," [...] while A.V. Club called the show [...] "a fantastically rich series with a frustratingly dense mythology".|$|E
500|$|With {{no party}} {{organisation}} and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature {{was a single}} sheet with the message [...] "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, {{it was clear that}} he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as [...] "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an unofficial strike at the local Hoover factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation. Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he had never thought for a moment <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> down. Two weeks later Davies and his principal campaign workers were expelled from the Labour Party for opposing its official candidate. The national leadership refused his request for an official inquiry into the actions of the Merthyr party, in the selection process and during the election itself.|$|E

500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen <b>would</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E
