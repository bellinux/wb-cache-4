5|$|Paintings from a cave at Hindagala {{date back}} to the late Anuradhapura period, and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya {{paintings}}. The paintings of Sigiriya and Hindagala are the only surviving specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, remnants of paintings indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of stupas and vahalkadas were also painted. Saddhatissa had employed painters to decorate the Ruwanweli Seya when his brother Dutthagamani <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> on his death bed.|$|E
25|$|In the 1930s, Gandhi and Ambedkar {{disagreed}} regarding {{retention of}} the caste system. Whilst Ambedkar <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> destroyed, Gandhi {{thought that it}} could be modified by reinterpreting Hindu texts so that the untouchables were absorbed into the Shudra varna. It was this disagreement that led to the Poona Pact. Despite the disagreement, Gandhi began the Harijan Yatra to help the Dalits.|$|E
25|$|CBC's funding {{differs from}} that of the public {{broadcasters}} of many European nations, which collect a licence fee, or those in the United States, such as PBS and NPR, which receive some public funding but rely to a large extent on voluntary contributions from individual viewers and listeners. A Nanos Research poll from August 2014 conducted for Asper Media (National Post, Financial Post) showed 41% of Canadians wanted funding increased, 46% wanted it maintained at current levels, and only 10% <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> cut.|$|E

25|$|Hassan El-Shazli, the {{well-known}} famous Egyptian player, discovered Aboutrika's talent and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> developed. Hassan El-Shazli related that Aboutrika and a defender were being sought {{out by the}} chairman of Tersana but the salary offered them was disparate in favor of Aboutrika. Hassan El-Shazli could not convince Aboutrika he was more valuable to the team than his potential teammate so he would not sign unless the salary was the same, the lower amount if need be. The salaries were set at the lower level and he signed.|$|E
500|$|The new {{constitution}} remained a showpiece for Saint-Just but little more. However much {{he may have}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> implemented, emergency measures for wartime were in effect. The war had called for (or provided cover for) a moratorium on constitutional democracy. It gave supreme power to the sitting Convention, with the Committee of Public Safety {{at the top of}} its administrative pyramid. Robespierre, with Saint-Just's assistance, fought vigorously to ensure that the government would remain under emergency measures – [...] "revolutionary" [...] – until victory.|$|E
500|$|Liddell {{claimed that}} the Pickingill family had many links to the {{travelling}} Romani population, and that Pickingill spent many of his early years in a Romani caravan. Liddell claimed that Pickingill faced persecution as a result, and that he [...] "set out to terrify" [...] the locals of Canewdon in retaliation. According to Liddell, Pickingill was trained in Romani magic, and thus in later life became [...] "the most famous [...] in England". Liddell also claimed that Pickingill despised Christianity and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> overthrown; to this end he collaborated with Satanists and included Satanic elements within his ritual practices, something which horrified {{other members of the}} East Anglian witch-cult. Thus, according to Liddell, Pickingill was [...] "England's most feared and vilified 'Satanist'". Elsewhere, he stressed that Pickingill was not a Satanist, but rather that he had been considered such by other witches because he practised sex magic.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the failure}} of the Hughes brothers' exhibition, a Hughes {{daughter}} continued showing the head to anyone who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> An offer was made to Sir Joseph Banks, but “he desired to be excused from seeing the remains of the old Villanous Republican, the mention of whose very name made his blood boil with indignation”. William Bullock, considering a purchase, wrote to Lord Liverpool, who stated “the strong objection which would naturally arise to the exhibition of human remains at a Public Museum frequented by Persons of both Sexes and of all ages”. Failure to sell to public museums forced the daughter to sell it privately, and in 1815 it was sold to Josiah Henry Wilkinson, in whose family it would remain until its burial. Maria Edgeworth, attending breakfast with Wilkinson in 1822, was shown the head, and she wrote with great surprise that she had seen “Oliver Cromwell's head—not his picture—not his bust—nothing of stone or marble or plaister of Paris, but his real head”.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Steph was {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer and underwent a hysterectomy. The plot was said to echo {{the true story of}} former Big Brother contestant Jade Goody, who died of cervical cancer in 2009. It was devised prior to the appointment of Paul Marquess as executive producer. He chose to continue with it, deciding that {{it would be interesting to}} give Steph another serious storyline, and have a character that viewers [...] "know and love [...] going through a really hard time." [...] In preparation for the storyline, Stenson studied the illness to give her a time-line of the experiences Steph would undergo. She chose not to speak with any cancer patients about coping with cancer, believing that everyone handles it in their own personal way. Additionally, she aimed to make Steph's realisation of her cancer as believable as possible, explaining that: [...] "Steph wouldn't have any prior knowledge about what to expect, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> fresh through her eyes". She was flattered to be trusted with the storyline, and found it particularly important to get her portrayal right as, during the previous year, she had fronted the Arm Against Cervical Cancer campaign.|$|E
500|$|UFA {{members also}} {{objected to the}} concept of a caucus, in which MLAs from one party debate policy behind closed doors. [...] They {{believed}} that the role of an MLA was to represent the views of his or her constituents directly {{on the floor of the}} Legislature. [...] This belief too proved problematic to the government. [...] The Dairyman's Act had been adopted by the Liberal government to provide low-interest loans to dairy farmers. [...] It was unpopular among farmers, and Greenfield's government aimed to amend it. [...] Many UFA backbenchers, however, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> repealed all together, but because of their objection to caucus discussions Greenfield was not aware of this by the time his amendments came to the floor of the legislature. [...] They passed through the house with little debate, until just after third reading, when one of the backbenchers rose to ask if the time had come to speak against the bill. [...] Brownlee suggested that, in view of the legislators' inexperience with parliamentary procedure, the legislature consider the motion to adopt the bill on third reading as not yet having passed, that debate might ensue. [...] This suggestion adopted, several UFA members attacked the Act. [...] They were joined in this by the Liberals, despite the fact that it was a Liberal act that had been co-authored by Boyle. [...] In the end, the bill passed only by virtue of the support of the four Labour members.|$|E

2500|$|Below, in the Duke locker room, the Blue Devils were {{preparing}} for a rematch of the 1990 title game with UNLV in their semifinal. UNLV had won that game by 30 points and had come in undefeated in 1991, with many wondering {{if they were the}} best college basketball team ever. When the Carolina-Kansas result news got through, Mike Krzyzewski asked the team if they felt it was okay to lose since that meant they would do no worse than the Tar Heels, and some nodded. Krzyzewski understood but then added, [...] "Flush it. Let's go kick their ass." [...] Duke then stunned the sports world by defeating UNLV 79–77 and then went one better by beating Kansas 72–65 in the championship game to win its first national title. Chansky writes that one UNC athletic department staffer in Indianapolis was so distraught that he did not leave his hotel room the day after the national championship game, while when Duke arrived back in Durham, Krzyzewski is said to have asked the team at a turnoff to Chapel Hill if the team wanted to cruise down Franklin Street. In the wake of the Final Four, when talking about how close the two rivals came to meeting for the national championship, Krzyzewski said that he never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> happen because regardless of who won, the pain of losing that game would be unbearable for the defeated school and its fans.|$|E
