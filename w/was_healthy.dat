Beilhart developed peritonitis and died on November 24, 1908.|$|E

In January 2013, he withdrew from the 2013 U.S. Championships, saying he <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> but needed an additional three weeks to return to competition form. Carroll {{said it would be}} a long recovery.|$|E

5|$|In Week 3, Vick {{was brought}} into action against the St. Louis Rams when Ben Roethlisberger {{sustained}} a knee injury that sidelined him for 4–6 weeks. Vick played decently in that stretch, going 40–66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT, while also rushing for 104 yards on 15 carries (his other five carries were kneel downs). Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals, being replaced by Landry Jones, which led to him missing six games, and by then Roethlisberger <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to play. Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season, Vick would be inactive {{the remainder of the}} season, leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick's playing career may be over.|$|E

She appeared in goal in the championship game against Notre Dame, which UNC won 2–1.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} the animal control team deaths, Charlie is {{attacked by the}} creature, but it fails to kill him after Olivia arrives on the scene. Walter explains he believes the creature is a man-made chimera, which has the best genetic traits of many different creatures, including a lizard, bat, and wasp. He had tried to create the creature years before, but his experiments failed, and concludes that someone else must have taken up his research. Though initially thinking Charlie <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> after the attack, they realize the chimera's stinger injected him with its larvae, {{and that he has}} less than 24 hours to live.|$|E

5|$|After {{appearing}} consistently {{with the}} team, on 24 March 2004, Evra suffered an ankle {{injury in the}} club's 4–2 first leg defeat to Spanish club Real Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Evra subsequently missed {{two weeks in the}} league, but <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> enough to return for the team's second leg quarter-final tie against Madrid, which Monaco won 3–1. The win allowed the club advancement to the Champions League semi-finals on the away goals rule. In the semi-finals, Monaco faced English club Chelsea. Evra appeared in both matches as Monaco advanced to the final, beating the London club 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final, Monaco were pitted against Porto at the Arena AufSchalke in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. The club was defeated 3–0 by Porto. Evra played the full 90minutes. After the season, Evra was given the UNFP Young Player of the Year award, becoming only the second defender and the first since 1997 (Philippe Christanval) to win the award. He was also named to the organisation's Ligue 1 Team of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Ballard {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a third-pairing defenseman in his second season with Vancouver. He missed five contests in November and December 2011 due to a back injury, before sustaining a season-ending concussion on February 5, 2012. Initially undetected, the injury was caused by two separate hits during a game against the Colorado Avalanche. He remained in the lineup for the following contest before being diagnosed with the injury. His season ended with 1 goal and 7 points over 47 games. His third season with the Canucks was shortened by the 2012–13 NHL lockout. When the season started Ballard was again on the Canucks third pairing with Tanev. Early in the season the two were the Canucks' most consistent pairing. An injury to Kevin Bieksa allowed Andrew Alberts to get into the line-up and split the Ballard-Tanev pairing. After Bieksa's return it was Ballard who was removed from the line-up becoming a healthy scratch. In late March Vancouver suffered several injuries up front to help fill the void Ballard returned to the line-up as a forward. He played three games before suffering a broken foot. Though he <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> by the playoffs Vancouver opted to play Alberts and rookie Frank Corrado in the first round lost to San Jose. He finished the year playing in 36 games and recording two assists.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season for the 2002 Wolverines, one of June's notable {{performances}} was his individual effort to stop a bootleg play against Notre Dame on September 14, which forced a change of possession to give Michigan the ball with just over two minutes remaining. On September 28 against Illinois, he had a sack and made a notable lead block on the interception return of a fellow defensive back. In the October 12 victory over Penn State, he made a key defensive play that almost resulted in an interception {{as part of an}} overtime goal line stand to hold Penn State to a field goal. In the 2321 victory over Purdue on October 19, he recovered the final onside kick by Purdue. A collision on October 26 in a game with Iowa halted play for ten minutes while June received medical attention after leaving the game on a stretcher. At the time, he had movement in his extremities. He was hospitalized after the incident, but was released from the hospital the following morning. June was sidelined for the Michigan – Michigan State Paul Bunyan Trophy game against Michigan State on November 2, but participated in two plays during the subsequent Michigan–Minnesota Little Brown Jug game against Minnesota on November 9. June <b>was</b> <b>healthy</b> in time for the 2003 Outback Bowl against Florida, where he recorded a season-high nine tackles. Over the course of the season, June had 36 tackles, 17 assists, four tackles for loss, and two sacks. He had 102 career tackles and 36 career assists, 10 tackles for loss, and six sacks.|$|E
