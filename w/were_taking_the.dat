5|$|Louis Stanislas {{travelled}} more through France {{than other}} members of the royal family, who rarely left the Île-de-France. In 1774, he accompanied his sister Clotilde to Chambéry on the journey to meet her bridegroom Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Piedmont, heir to the throne of Sardinia. In 1775, he visited Lyon and also his spinster aunts Adélaïde and Victoire while they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> waters at Vichy. The four provincial tours that Louis Stanislas took before the year 1791 amounted to a total of three months.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart {{were arrested}} on October 22, 2008, {{and found to}} be in {{possession}} of several weapons. The men told authorities of their planned assassination and killing spree, and said they intended to rob a gun store to obtain additional weapons and commit home robberies to help fund the operation. Although the United States Secret Service said they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> plot seriously, authorities were unsure how capable Schlesselman and Cowart were of carrying out the alleged plot. Both plotters pleaded guilty to various federal charges; Judge J. Daniel Breen of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee sentenced Schlesselman to 10 years imprisonment on April 15, 2010, and Cowart to 14 years in prison on October 22, 2010.|$|E

5|$|With Keith Miller {{injured and}} playing purely as a batsman, Johnston took the new ball, {{sharing it with}} Lindwall. He was unable to take a wicket initially, but the English openers were uncomfortable when he and Lindwall <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> new ball. Following the tea break, he {{returned}} with the second new ball after Compton and Yardley had put on an 87-run partnership to stabilise the middle-order. Johnston took Compton's outside edge and Miller completed the catch in slips. The left armer then claimed Evans, caught by a diving Miller after the Englishman had taken a swing of the bat wide outside off stump; this left the hosts at 7/145. Johnston ended with 2/43 from 22 overs as England were bowled for at 215 early on the third morning. After Australia declared at 7/460 on the fourth afternoon to leave the home side a target of 596, Johnston troubled the English openers with the new ball, but did not take a wicket.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E

25|$|South Africa used day 2 {{to ensure}} England {{had no chance}} in the match. Although Hashim Amla was {{dismissed}} by Pattinson for his maiden test wicket during the morning session, Ashwell Prince and AB de Villiers formed a strong partnership which would frustrate England {{for the rest of}} the day. Their batting was cautious, but not defensive, and they both gradually ground out large scores knowing that they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> match out of England's reach. By the end of day 2, South Africa's score was 322/4, a lead of 119.|$|E
25|$|However, {{on having}} noticed that Cinco Chagas had no guns aft, in a deft {{maneuver}} the English {{returned to the}} attack concentrating their fire on the stern panel of Portuguese ship. The Royal Exchange made another boarding attack this time succeeding in carrying the ship after bitter fighting. Whilst heavy hand-to-hand fighting was ongoing a fire had started on a tarpaulin during the exchange of fire and then spread further to the rigging and the masts. The fire could not be put out because sharpshooters on board the English ships <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese one by one {{as they tried to}} man the pumps.|$|E

Grand Duchess Elizaveta sent a message to the German Imperial couple asking for their help. Eventually KR and his entourage were allowed to depart Germany and transported to the first Russian station. The weakened KR had to proceed by foot across the front lines. By the time K.R. and Elizaveta arrived in St. Petersburg, now renamed Petrograd, the Grand Duke was in a dismal state of health.|$|E

25|$|After touring duties for {{the album}} were finished, Metallica {{filed a lawsuit}} against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to {{terminate}} the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal services contract after seven years. Metallica had sold 40million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} July 1916, John Nichols and Robert Murphy <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> {{great white}} more seriously. In Scientific American, Murphy wrote that the [...] "white shark is perhaps the rarest of all {{noteworthy}} sharks... their habits are little known, but {{they are said to}} feed to some extent on big sea turtles... Judging from its physical make-up, it would not hesitate to attack a man in open water." [...] He concluded that [...] "because it is evident that even a relatively small white shark, weighing two or three hundred pounds, might readily snap the largest human bones by a jerk of its body, after it has bitten through the flesh." ...|$|E
500|$|Medows' {{campaign}} in 1790 was a limited success. [...] He occupied the Coimbatore district against minimal opposition, but a forceful counterattack by Tipu reduced the British holdings to Coimbatore itself {{and a few}} other outposts. [...] Tipu had also descended to the coastal plain, where he plowed through the Carnatic and even met with the French at Pondicherry in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict. By September 1790 the British allies <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> field, but still did not want to face Tipu's strong force without significant British support. [...] Consequently, Cornwallis decided to personally take control of the main British force from Medows. [...] In early February 1791 he began a campaign that was squarely targeted at Mysore's capital, Seringapatam.|$|E

500|$|According to Yerlan Askarbekov, a Kazakh public {{relations}} professional {{who worked with}} both the British Council and the Kazakh government who wrote a piece for the BBC website in 2016, {{ten years after the}} film's release, many of his colleagues in the Kazakh media saw the character of Borat as a valuable PR opportunity. According to him some of the Kazakhs who were most upset by the film were students studying in the US and the UK, who understood the film's satirical intent but felt that their non-Kazakh peers <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> film at face value as an accurate portrayal of the country. He suggested that once Kazakhs grasped that the film was designed to [...] "...get an outsider’s view of the US and reveal the prejudices of the Americans who Borat interacts with... functioning as a sort of 21st Century Alexis de Tocqueville", interest in the character inside the country faded.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after 7 p.m. Friday, June 16, 1995, an {{explosion}} in the firebox of CPR 1278 burned three members of its crew. [...] One man, James Cornell, the son of the owner of the engine, was critically injured. [...] The train that the locomotive was pulling had 310 passengers on board. [...] None of the passengers, who <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Summer Eve Dinner Excursion" [...] to Mount Holly Springs, were hurt. An investigation done by the National Transportation Safety Board determined that the accident was caused by poor maintenance and operator training. [...] The board also pointed out that the Canadian design of the firebox may have prevented further injuries and perhaps deaths. Jerry Jacobson, the owner of the Ohio Central Railroad, (OCR) bought the engine at an auction in 1998. [...] After Jacobson sold the OCR, in 2008, he maintained ownership of the locomotive. As of 2009, it is stored at Jacobson's facility, the Age of Steam Roundhouse, in Sugarcreek, Ohio.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Ipswich, Ramsey began experimenting with a new style of play that would {{eventually}} lead to success in the World Cup and led to his England team being styled, [...] "The Wingless Wonders". As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing fullbacks, who would naturally {{expect to see a}} winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As Bobby Charlton remarked, [...] "The Spanish fullbacks were just looking at each other while we were going in droves through the middle". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.|$|E

500|$|When Lillian Walden {{retired in}} 1950, {{the price for}} {{a woman at the}} brothel was $5. Afterwards, the Dumas's {{operations}} went to Elinore Knott. The Nadeaus also ceased being owners of the brothel around this time. Knott's management of the Dumas was short. In 1955 she committed suicide after her lover died of a heart attack. When the late 1960s came about, several local police officers <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> initiative to close the three operating high-class sex houses: Hotel Victoria, Windsor Hotel and the Dumas. The Dumas did not remain closed for long however, with its next madam, Bonita Farren, operating it from 1955 until her death from cancer in 1969. In 1970 the Dumas was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a [...] "Victorian Brothel" [...] and an active house of prostitution. By the following year, Ruby Garret, a local resident of Butte for some thirty years, had purchased the Dumas. Garret would pay local police officers and officials $200 to $300 a month in return for their silence about the Dumas's activities. Under Garrett, the cost of a prostitute was $20. She would come upon financial difficulties however, being charged with tax evasion in 1981. The Dumas Brothel was closed the following year.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{earliest}} hardcore bands, regarded as having {{made the first}} recordings in the style, were Southern California's Middle Class and Black Flag. Bad Brains—all of whom were black, a rarity in punk of any era—launched the D.C. scene with their rapid-paced single 'Pay to Cum" [...] in 1980. Austin, Texas's Big Boys, San Francisco's Dead Kennedys, and Vancouver's D.O.A. were among the other initial hardcore groups. They were soon joined by bands such as the Minutemen, Descendents, Circle Jerks, Adolescents, and T.S.O.L. in Southern California; D.C.'s Teen Idles, Minor Threat, and State of Alert; and Austin's MDC and the Dicks. By 1981, hardcore was the dominant punk rock style not only in California, {{but much of the}} rest of North America as well. A New York hardcore scene grew, including the relocated Bad Brains, New Jersey's Misfits and Adrenalin O.D., and local acts such as the Mob, Reagan Youth, and Agnostic Front. Beastie Boys, who would become famous as a hip-hop group, debuted that year as a hardcore band. They were followed by the Cro-Mags, Murphy's Law, and Leeway. By 1983, St. Paul's Hüsker Dü, Willful Neglect, Chicago's Naked Raygun, Indianapolis's Zero Boys, and D.C.'s the Faith <b>were</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> hardcore sound in experimental and ultimately more melodic directions. Hardcore would constitute the American punk rock standard throughout the decade. The lyrical content of hardcore songs is often critical of commercial culture and middle-class values, as in Dead Kennedys' celebrated [...] "Holiday in Cambodia" [...] (1980).|$|E
