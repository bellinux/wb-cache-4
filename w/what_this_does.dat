Though the only two bidirectional networks (11 and 13) are in the highest grouping, so also is network 12, which is not bidirectional. One way to summarise these three networks is to say that they are the only networks whose edge sets are composed of a union of disjoint cycles. Another way to differentiate them from 9 and 10 is to say that these networks are the ones in which each node has the same number of outgoing as incoming connections. In appendix B, it is shown that the deterministic movement of the centre of mass of the network is determined by the projection of the state of the system onto a vector u, of dimension n (the size of the network), where u [...]...|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} pressure from school leaders in many countries for teaching to be based solely on ICT tools. The present study is interested in <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> to pupils’ attitudes towards ICT in language classrooms. Is a digital monopoly a good way for pupils to learn languages? Is it what they want? To understand for which tasks students feel that computers are an appropriate tool, a qualitative survey mapping upper secondary school pupils’ attitudes towards the ICT use for learning Spanish has been conducted. The study looks at ICT use for grammar practice. A group of pupils have completed lesson diaries, reflecting upon web-based grammar exercises, comparing them to paper-based exercises, and a questionnaire survey on general attitudes towards ICT in language learning. The {{results indicate that the}} majority of participating pupils ask for a greater variety of tasks and see a need also for traditional forms of grammar practice, especially written exercises which give time to reflect upon grammar, syntax and vocabulary. They want ICT use to be an option, not a constraint. Many complain on flaws in the design of web-based grammar exercises. This shows a need for more research into the effects of different designs of web-based tools. It also becomes clearer that decision-makers and teachers must focus more on the pedagogical purpose of learning tasks and that the first question to ask is: “How can I teach this in a way that suits my pupils?” rather than: “How can I add more ICT to my teaching?”...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to shed light on {{contemporary}} forensic psychiatric care through a philosophical examination of the empirical results from two lifeworld phenomenological studies from the perspective of patients and carers, by using the French philosopher Michel Foucault’s historicalphilosophical work. Both empirical studies were conducted in a forensic psychiatric setting. The essential results of the two empirical studies were reexamined in a phenomenological meaning analysis to form a new general structure in accordance with the methodological principles of Reflective Lifeworld Research. This general structure shows how the caring on the forensic psychiatric wards appears to be contradictory, in that it is characterized by an unreflective (non-) caring attitude and contributes to an inconsistent and insecure existence. The caring appears to have a corrective approach and thus lacks a clear caring structure, a basic caring approach that patients in forensic psychiatric services have a great need of. To gain a greater understanding of forensic psychiatric caring, the new empirical results were further examined in the light of Foucault’s historicalphilosophical work. The philosophical examination is presented in terms of the three meaning constituents: Caring as correction and discipline, The existence of power, and Structures and culture in care. The philosophical examination illustrates new meaning nuances of the corrective and disciplinary nature of forensic psychiatric care, its power, and how this is materialized in caring, and <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> to the patients. The examination reveals embedded difficulties in forensic psychiatric care and highlights a need to revisit the aim of such care...|$|E

40|$|Two {{questions}} frame {{this response}} to Amin’s article ‘The Remainders of Race’. It first introduces an epistemological question that recognizes {{the impossibility of}} separating ontology and epistemology in modern thought and asks why contemporary studies of racial subjugation so infrequently consider the concept of race’s onto-epistemological function. The second, methodological, question necessarily follows. Acknowledging that ‘the what of race ’ cannot {{be separated from the}} ‘how of race ’ makes it crucial to ask why the former is no longer considered in most analyses of the latter. There follows a mapping of the context of emergence of political-symbolic strategies that carve out racial difference and cultural difference as human (moral) attributes. The article shows that, rather than an extraneous notion or a referent of a natural (god-given) human attribute, the concept of race is the modern ethico-political device that refigures the workings of scientific universality in political and ethical texts. <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> is to enable the argu-ment that, instead of manifestations of human ‘sorting ’ instincts, the oper-atives (juridical, economic and symbolic) of raciality proliferating in the global present consist of biopolitical architectures, mechanisms and proce-dures designed and assembled with the main tools of racial power/knowl-edge, namely racial and cultural difference.

(1914 - 2009) made a {{significant}} turn in his theology towards radical hermeneutics, through which he dealt with the interpretation and evaluation of meaning present in reality. Prior to his groundbreaking Jesus trilogy, Schillebeeckx applied a version of his hermeneutical method {{to an analysis of}} the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. This short work is relatively undervalued today and deserves to be reconsidered. Schillebeeckx examines the way that interpretation influences human perception and experience of reality, and <b>what</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> to our understanding of ‘transubstantiation. ’ By viewing this argument through the wider lens of a hermeneutical ontology, where language becomes the primary structure of being, Schillebeeckx proposes to recontextualize the Council of Trent’s canons on the Eucharist. This linguistic understanding of reality reveals the sacraments as both signs and as points of mediation and inter-personal communication. The wider context for the sacraments, and specifically the Eucharist, is always their place within a liturgical framework that aids in our interpretation and trans-signification of reality. Here, we argue that these inter-personal, linguistic mediations are already based on God’s prior actions – especially in God’s on-going act of creation, such that there is always an objective (offer of reality) and a subjective (interpreted acceptance of reality) element involved in the Eucharistic event. The inter-personal mediation of the sacrament presupposes the personal presence of Christ in the Eucharistic elements, but this understanding will require a repositioning {{the way in which we}} understand Eucharistic change as a sacramental bond between God and creation, as well as a hermeneutically and phenomenologically sound understanding of the sacraments as signs of this bond. Here we propose to [1] critically retrieve Schillebeeckx’s hermeneutical interpretation of Trent; [2] to uncover the phenomenology of the sacraments that is implicit in this linguistic understanding of reality; finally, [3] to demonstrate how this linguistic ontology is productive for seeing the sacraments as interruptive, inter-personal, and revelatory events of mediation between creation and Creator. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{draw upon}} Donald Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s theories {{of language and}} the mental in order to {{argue that it is}} impossible for an agent to hold ethical beliefs that are, when taken as a whole, radically different than one 2 ̆ 7 s own. This argument starts with Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s theory that beliefs, desires and other mental objects are theoretical entities that are attributed to speakers in order to make sense of their intentional actions. These attributions must be made in accordance with the principle of charity and, as such, it is impossible for an agent to have a set of beliefs and desires that are radically {{different from those of the}} interpreter. The trick is to show that there are limitations on how much disagreement is possible with a subset of the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs. ^ In order to do this I stress the importance of holism within Davidson 2 ̆ 7 s theory of meaning. One result of his holism is that a belief gets its content from its connections to other beliefs in the belief net. Hence, changes in one belief create a ripple effect which changes the contents of related beliefs. Because of this effect, in order for two people to have the same belief they must have similar beliefs throughout their belief nets local to that belief. When combined with an argument about the interrelated nature of ethical beliefs we can conclude that in order for a speaker to hold any ethical belief they must share a number of ethical beliefs with the interpreter. ^ <b>What</b> <b>this</b> <b>does</b> not illuminate is how much agreement is necessary. In order to get a handle on this I turned to the arguments presented in Philippa Foot 2 ̆ 7 s “Moral Beliefs” and Bernard Williams 2 ̆ 7 “The Truth in Relativism. ” I argue that the eccentric that Foot presents is an example of a speaker who attempts to present a theory of ethics that is simply too different to be considered an ethical theory. Finally, I consider the distinction Williams 2 ̆ 7 makes between real confrontation and notational confrontation as a possible guideline for where real ethical disagreement begins to break apart. ...|$|E
