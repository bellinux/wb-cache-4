5000|$|The DVBST {{implements}} two electron guns: a [...] "flood gun" [...] and a [...] "writing gun". The <b>writing</b> <b>gun</b> scans {{across a}} wire grid, charging the grid {{to create the}} negative image. The flood gun then floods the grid. Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged.|$|E
50|$|Writing was {{accomplished}} by firing the <b>writing</b> <b>gun</b> at low voltage in a fashion similar to the Williams tube, adding a further voltage to the phosphor. Thus the storage pattern was the slight difference between two voltages stored on the tube, typically only a few tens of volts different. In comparison, the Williams tube used much higher voltages, producing a pattern {{that could only be}} stored for a short period before it decayed below readability.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the energy}} of the flood gun {{electrons}} is properly balanced, each impinging flood gun electron knocks out one secondary electron from the phosphor screen, thus preserving the net positive charge in the illuminated areas of the phosphor screen. In this way, the image originally written by the <b>writing</b> <b>gun</b> can be maintained for a long time â€” many seconds to a few minutes. Eventually, small imbalances in the secondary emission ratio cause the entire screen to [...] "fade positive" [...] (light up) or cause the originally written trace to [...] "fade negative" [...] (extinguish). It is these imbalances that limit the ultimate storage time possible.|$|E

50|$|He {{directed}} the feature films Assassin (1973) and Moments (1974). He also directed episodes of the American television series B.

Moonlighting, Murder, She <b>Wrote,</b> <b>Guns</b> of Paradise, Hunter and Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, his last directing credit.|$|R
25|$|For Walter Mirisch at United Artists Ladd {{appeared}} in The Man in the Net. He produced a pilot for a TV series starring William Bendix called Ivy League. That {{did not go}} to series; neither did another pilot Ladd produced for Paramount, The Third Platoon, which was written by a young Aaron Spelling. Spelling also <b>wrote</b> <b>Guns</b> of the Timberland for Jaguar and Warners, in which Ladd appeared; it was his last movie for Warners.|$|R
50|$|Reading was {{accomplished}} by scanning the reading gun across the storage area. This gun was set to a voltage that would cross the secondary emission threshold for the entire display. If the scanned area held the holding gun potential {{a certain number of}} electrons would be released, if it held the <b>writing</b> <b>gun</b> potential the number would be higher. The electrons were read on a grid of fine wires placed behind the display, making the system entirely self-contained - the Williams tube's read plate was in front of the tube, and required continual mechanical adjustment to work properly. The grid also had the advantage of breaking the display into spots without requiring the tight focus of the Williams system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{storage is}} {{accomplished}} using {{the principle of}} secondary emission. When the ordinary writing electron beam passes a point on the phosphor surface, {{not only does it}} momentarily cause the phosphor to illuminate, but the kinetic energy of the electron beam knocks other electrons loose from the phosphor surface. This can leave a net positive charge. Storage oscilloscopes then provide one or more secondary electron guns (called the [...] "flood guns") that provide a steady flood of low-energy electrons traveling towards the phosphor screen. Flood guns cover the entire screen, ideally uniformly. The electrons from the flood guns are more strongly drawn to the areas of the phosphor screen where the <b>writing</b> <b>gun</b> has left a net positive charge; in this way, the electrons from the flood guns re-illuminate the phosphor in these positively charged areas of the phosphor screen.|$|E
5000|$|Department S {{evolved from}} a {{previous}} punk/ska combo, Guns for Hire, fronted by Vaughn Toulouse and also featuring former Madness drummer John Hasler. Mike Herbage joined them on guitar and <b>wrote</b> <b>Guns</b> for Hire's only single, [...] "I'm Gonna Rough My Girlfriend's Boyfriend Up Tonight", released on the Korova record label. The group then became Department S {{with the addition of}} bassist Tony Lordan, drummer Stuart Mizon and keyboardist Eddie Roxy (born Anthony Edward Lloyd-Barnes).|$|R
50|$|Tektronix had {{originally}} developed their storage tubes {{in the late}} 1950s {{as a way to}} store images on oscilloscope displays for study, although the same system had already been used in radar displays. The basic concept uses a conventional CRT layout but with two sets of electron guns. One, the flood gun, provides a constant flow of low-energy electrons across the entire screen, causing it to glow slightly. The second, the <b>write</b> <b>gun,</b> is the normal gun of a black and white TV, and its beam was moved about on the display surface in the conventional fashion using electromagnets. However, this gun is set to a higher than normal energy. When its beam strikes the screen, it causes an effect known as photoemission that drives electrons out of the phosphorus towards the front of the display where they are picked up by a thin transparent electrode. This area now contains less electrons than normal, giving it a positive charge relative to its surroundings. This causes some of the electrons from the flood gun to be strongly attracted to that spot, which keeps it lit up. The display using this technique is instantly recognizable by the bright flash of the <b>write</b> <b>gun</b> beam as it moves about the display.|$|R
