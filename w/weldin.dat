40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{essential}} characteristics of a weld is its strength. The mechanical properties of weld metal can be enhanced {{in a number of}} ways. One of them is to include nanopowder into weld metal. In this article, it is offered to add nanopowder to the components of a welding electrode through liquid glass at the stage of its production. This will help to enhance the arc stability and increase the strength of a weld joint, which will in its turn have a positive effect both {{on the quality of the}} weld joint and on the safety of the construction in general. There is not much information published on to the use of nanostructured materials in the welding production. However, for the recent years the research in using nanopowders in the welding industry has increased. Key words: Nanopowder Welding electrode Liquid glass Weld metal and fusion <b>weldin...</b>|$|E

40|$|Welding of wood is a {{well-known}} joining procedure that offers several advantages over traditional mechanical fasteners or gluing. During welding, extensive solid-state transformation phases occur in the so-called melting zone and the heat-affected zone. The nature and the extension of such transformations are correlated to the energy input and thus to the heat generated during the process at the wood joint interface. In the present work {{the influence of the}} welding parameters and wood grain orientation on the temperature profile and distribution and final strength of welded connections was investigated. For this purpose, the characteristics of the joints were evaluated with both destructive and non-destructive techniques. Non-destructive evaluation was performed with infrared thermography, which allowed measurement of the maximal and average peak temperature, temperature profile and distribution, and rate of temperature increase.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a method of}} welding two thin sheets of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) with a heated pin, thus allowing construction of {{a relationship between the}} weld temperature and weld strength. Constructing a relationship between weld strength and temperature is necessary for modeling many welding processes, including laser transmission welding. An experimental approach to establishing this relationship is required because of the complex melting behavior of PVC. The designed experimental device uses a single heated pin to weld samples by using varying pressure and temper-ature for one second dwell time. An electro-mechani-cal loadframe pulled the welded samples until joint fail-ure occurred, thereby allowing determination of the weld strength. An experiment varying welding pin tem-perature and joining pressure found the temperature to be a highly significant determiner of weld strength, while the pressure was found to be not significant. A transient numerical heat transfer model was used to calculate the weld interface temperature for each pin temperature. The relationship established in this paper can be used to predict the weld strength from the tem-perature output from models of alternative <b>weldin...</b>|$|E
