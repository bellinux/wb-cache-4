25|$|Younis {{said he did}} not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> {{individuals}} but largely {{singled out}} players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season and said it was like a 'holiday for them'. Overall, he blamed it on poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – 'no one wants to hear the truth'.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their worst}} weekend in almost ten years, Ferrari were self-critical. Sebastian Vettel {{was quoted as}} {{describing}} his race as [...] "a shit job", and later took full responsibility for his race ending crash, saying that he [...] "probably just ask or want {{a little bit too}} much". Speaking about the collision between Kimi Räikkönen and Valtteri Bottas, Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said: [...] "It's an accident, it's part of the show. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> anybody." [...] He went on to describe the weekend as [...] "a good lesson" [...] for the team, taking positive things from the race, such as the good race pace shown by both cars. As a result of their double retirement, both Ferrari drivers lost their respective positions in the Drivers' Championship. While Vettel was overtaken by Rosberg into second place, Räikkönen lost fourth position to Valtteri Bottas. In the Constructors' Standings, Williams moved closer to Ferrari in second place, now trailing them by 131 points. At the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony on 3 December 2015, the organizers were awarded the prize as Best Promoter.|$|E

Norma Ledezma, organization coordinator for Justice for our Daughters, said that the death of Susana Chavez {{is part of the}} attitude of exemption that lives in Juarez. On the same note, the founder of the organization May Our Daughters Return Home, Marisela Ortiz denounced the culture of intolerance and impunity as perpetuating the idea that anyone can commit a crime.

Hilary is the chief counsel for the Northeastern, and he runs the Republican {{organization}} in this State for their benefit. But Austen made up his mind that there was no reason why he should grow up that way. He says that a lawyer should keep to his profession, and not become a lobbyist in the interest of his clients. He lived with the old man until the other day, because he has a real soft spot for him. Austen put up with a good deal. And then Hilary turned loose on him and said a lot of things he couldn't stand. Austen didn't answer, but went up and packed his bags and made Hilary's housekeeper promise to stay with him, or she'd have left, too. They say Hilary's sorry, now. He's fond of Austen, but he can't get along with him." ...|$|E

It was when she thought of the suffering of her lover from the silence which must have made him doubt her, that she could not speak. As soon as she governed herself against her first resentment she said, with a little sigh, [...] "It is all right, now, Mr. Osson," [...] and her stress upon the word seemed to trouble him with no misgiving.

But I reproached him with his wrong actions, and words and blows passed between us; and he said solemnly to me, after that, as it had been all nonsense and no more than a bit o' flirting.
