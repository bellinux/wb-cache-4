500|$|The {{neutrino}} {{accounted for}} the missing energy, but Fermi's theory described a particle with little mass and no electric charge that {{would be difficult to}} observe directly. In a 1934 paper, Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, and concluded [...] "there is no practically possible way of observing the neutrino." [...] In 1951, {{at the conclusion of the}} Greenhouse test series, Reines received permission from the head of T Division, J. Carson Mark, for a leave in residence to study fundamental physics. Reines and his colleague Clyde Cowan decided to see if they could detect neutrinos. [...] "So <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> want to detect the free neutrino?" [...] he later explained, [...] "Because everybody said, you couldn’t do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover art, {{a collage}} by Lou Beach, {{features}} a bull with the band's name branded on its rear end, while the packaging is decorated by {{images of the}} band as cowboys on a [...] "dude ranch". The gatefold packaging features a painting stating [...] "Greetings from the Blink-182 Dude Ranch," [...] which {{was intended to be}} a pastiche of both [...] "cheesy postcards" [...] and a parody of Bruce Springsteen's Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.. Art direction for the album was headed by Tim Stedman, with Stedman and graphic designer Ashley Pigford designing the package. The disc art, a revolver chamber, was designed by artist Victor Gastelum, while the band photography was done by Steven Shea. DeLonge recalled in 2012 that the only [...] "bad" [...] aspect of Dude Ranch in retrospect were the jokes found within the inside artwork: [...] "I remember sitting at the Sombrero taco shop going, 'Fuck, we’ve got to finish off our album cover, let’s just write some jokes to these cowboy pictures.' <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> do that? We should have had better jokes for those pictures." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} his monologue, Colbert {{introduced}} what he {{characterized as}} an [...] "audition" [...] video to become the new White House Press Secretary—Scott McClellan had recently left the position. The video spliced clips of difficult questions from the White House press corps with responses from Colbert as Press Secretary. Colbert's podium included controls marked [...] "eject", [...] "Gannon" [...] (a reference to erstwhile White House reporter Jeff Gannon, who was suspected of asking planted questions), and [...] "volume", which he used to silence a critical question from journalist David Gregory. The video continued with Colbert fleeing the briefing room and the White House, only to be pursued by White House correspondent Helen Thomas, who had been a vocal critic of the Bush administration. At one point, Colbert picks up an emergency phone and explains that Thomas [...] "won't stop asking why we invaded Iraq". The dispatcher responds with, [...] "Hey, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> invade Iraq?" [...] The entire second half of the video is a spoof of horror film clichés, particularly the film Westworld, with melodramatic music accompanying Thomas's slow, unwavering pursuit of Colbert, and Colbert loudly screaming [...] "No!" [...] at intervals. Widely available online, a portion of the mock audition tape aired on The Colbert Report on May 2, 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Government {{efforts to}} lower {{subsidies}} to unprofitable enterprises and {{to shrink the}} money supply caused the semi-official exchange rate for the Cuban peso to move {{from a peak of}} 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president Fidel Castro later admitted that many mistakes had been made, [...] "The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn’t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>we</b> not rationalize the industry?" [...] Living conditions in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.|$|E
