40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become an}} important strategy for international expansion, even though numerous acquisitions fail to achieve their financial and strategic objectives. The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. Due diligence is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. Due diligence is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a due diligence audit. Therefore, this study examines the role <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting due diligence, recognizing the elements affecting effective due diligence and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization <b>of</b> due <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting due diligence. However, conducting due diligence is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards due diligence exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting due diligence are identified as the main elements affecting effective due diligence. Altogether, due diligence can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles <b>of</b> due <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role <b>of</b> due <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced due diligence practitioners based on several factors. In attempt to increase the value <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> for acquirers, more than one role <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> is likely to exist. As a result of the different approaches and the controversy regarding the concept <b>of</b> due <b>diligence,</b> the demand for a new, wider definition <b>of</b> due <b>diligence</b> can be claimed to exist...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} aspects <b>of</b> judicial <b>diligence</b> {{as a measure}} of judicial performance. Consistent with US and Canadian approaches to judicial performance evaluation, five measures <b>of</b> judicial <b>diligence</b> were proposed to test several hypotheses. The results of a national barristers' survey indicate that appellate judges have significantly higher diligence ratings than trial judges. Female judges scored significantly lower diligence ratings than male judges. The survey indicates that judicial diligence deteriorates with judicial age or experience. Also, experienced barristers did not rate judicial diligence differently from inexperienced barristers. A national survey of judicial officers revealed that the proposed measures <b>of</b> judicial <b>diligence</b> were all regarded as important. These results are discussed in the context <b>of</b> judicial <b>diligence</b> as a potential measure of judicial performanc...|$|R

Rhetoric and fair play hide two relevant distortions in the legal practice and in the sports competition: the eristic argumentation and the gamesmanship strategy. The obligation of loyalty imposes to the lawyers a rhetorical dialogue in every legal proceeding and it prescribes to keep the relationship between opponents on a real level of equity. Just as the good athlete defends the team colors acting loyally in a race, so the good lawyer protects the dignity of his client not only by a diligent technique but also by fair tactics...|$|R

Little awareness for privacy concerns is asserted as the pivotal negative effect on diligence. Challenging this conventional wisdom, this study shows that physicians are fully aware of the privacy issues. Their lack <b>of</b> <b>diligence</b> mainly results from a trade-off between the prospected consequences resulting from a privacy breach and the impediments diligent data handling has on the actual workflow of the physicians. Based on the grounded theory method, we chose hospitals as research field since patient data is commonly perceived as especially sensitive. We add to the body of knowledge by emphasizing the role of actors processing personal data in contrast to existing research that focuses on the behavior of affected actors, such as consumers. In sum, we provide a new perspective on the factors leading to privacy breaches...|$|R
