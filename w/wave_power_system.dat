40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to climate change}} in combination with ever-growing energy consumption worldwide has boosted the demand for new green energy sources. Wave power is developing in many different branches {{to become part of}} the new era of electricity production. This thesis deals with a <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> in its primary stages of development. The system was investigated in order to estimate its potential to produce electric power from sea waves. It is a system consisting of a moored buoy to which the energy is transferred when the wave tilts the buoy in the pitch direction. Due to the increased pitch angle, an amount of liquid contained inside the buoy is allowed to flow via ramps to an upper container, from where it flows down through a hydroelectric turbine. A computer program was used to calculate the properties of the buoy in sea waves. Another program was written in MATLAB to simulate the movements in sea waves and from a set of given parameters calculate the power output. A brief economic study was made to determine if the power output was large enough for the concept to be of financial interest to any future investors. The results show that the <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> produced 0. 9  kW in a wave climate equal to that off the coast of Hanstholm, Denmark, and 1. 6 kW in a wave climate off the coast of San Diego, USA.

A number of enhancements were suggested to increase the power output of the system, and further investigation could be of use to improve the concept.

The system consists of a floating point absorber connected to a linear generator on the seabed.

Similarly, changing significant wave heights will affect {{the rate at which}} the translator leaves the stator. Both these effects will in some cases result in a smaller active area of the stator. A theoretical expression to describe this effect is derived, and compared to measured experimental values for the wave energy converter at the Lysekil research site. During the time of measurements, the still water levels at the site were in the range of [- 0. 70 m, + 0. 46 m], and the significant wave heights in the range of [0 m, 2. 7 m].

This paper explores whether it is possible to apply the equivalent electric circuit theory as an evaluation tool for point absorbing WEC system modelling. The circuits were developed starting from the force analysis, in which the hydrodynamic, mechanical, and electrical parameters were expressed by electrical components. A methodology on how to determine the parameters for electrical components has been explained. It is found that by using a multimeter, forces in the connection line and the absorbed electric power can be simulated and read directly from the electric circuit model. Finally, the circuit model has been validated against the full scale offshore experiment. The results indicated that the captured power could be predicted rather accurately and the line force could be estimated accurately near the designed working condition of the WEC.

30|$|In the {{mechanical}} part, the float moves {{up and down}} driven by waves, pulling pulley 2 and pulley 3 to rotate in opposite directions. During the wave falling period, only pulley 2, ratchet wheel 1 and driving pulley 4 work to drive the driving pulley 6. If the rotating speed of pulley 2 is {{equal to that of}} driving pulley 4 and the wave keeps falling, the connection between pulley 2 and driving pulley 4 is maintained by ratchet wheel 1. Similarly, during the wave rising period, only pulley 3, ratchet wheel 2 and driving pulley 5 work to drive the driving pulley 6. When pulley 3 keeps pace with driving pulley 5 through ratchet wheel 2 and the driving force is continually on pulley 3, the SRG rotating speed will increase. Through this process, the wave energy is captured and converted into mechanical energy. One thing to be noted is that two ratchet wheels ensure the rotor of SRG rotates in single direction during the whole process. The torque applied on the rotor is always negative, whether wave rises or falls. The work efficiency is greatly improved, compared with that of a single-direction driven float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system,</b> which works only when the wave is rising, or only when it is falling.|$|E
40|$|The {{wave energy}} {{arriving}} {{on the west}} coast of the United Kingdom represents a very substantial energy resource, amounting on average to more than twice the present installed capacity of the Central Electricity Generating Board. Recent comprehensive studies by the CEGB 1, 2 and the National Engineering Laboratory 3 suggest that although there is no obvious technical reason for being unable ultimately to harness much of this energy, and many methods have been proposed, there are still considerable uncertainties over the choice of <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> and its economics.

40|$|The {{principles}} of systems engineering are applied {{in order to}} establish the requirements for mooring wave energy conversion devices. These requirements capture both the function of maintaining position in energetic wave climates as well as the need to enable an economic lifecycle {{for the development of a}} viable wave energy conversion industry. As such, material costs, marine operations costs and concerns captured by existing industry regulatory bodies gain relative importance in the supporting discussion, though technical concerns remain central to the presented scientific methods. Requirements that would be unique to a particular method of wave energy conversion are avoided as the aim is to contribute to a general body of knowledge to support the wide variety of proposed solutions in this area. Engineering and scientific methods are applied to investigate which kind of mooring systems are most likely to fulfil these holistic requirements. Cable mooring solutions are studied in some detail. In addition the relative merits of fixed and articulated tower structures are assessed. Consideration is given to different scales of structures and different water depths. Previously established analytical methods are applied in conjunction with experimental work carried out at 1 : 60 scale. The overall conclusions show that mooring system design should be an integral part of <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> designs and not a postscript to the design process. There are significant challenges to the positioning of structures in this exposed, shallow-water regime, especially structures that must fundamentally have a wave absorbing wet surface. The choice of mooring design can significantly influence how wave power is extracted and how such systems are operated and maintained. The results and supporting discussion establish that technological breakthroughs in vertically loaded anchors will be required before point absorbing arrays can be viably used to generate electricity for the grid. Such anchors, in conjunction with articulated towers or elastic tendons are the most promising line of investigation. Such solutions could theoretically satisfy low material costs and enable acceptable seabed footprints. However, the lack of a versatile and inexpensive vertically loaded anchor or elastic cables with acceptable fatigue life, mean that these solutions are not yet commercially available...|$|E

These areas are the western seaboard of Europe, the northern coast of the UK and the pacific coastlines of North and South America, Southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand.

Currently, <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> technologies are neither mature nor have become widely commercialized. Although these technologies can cover onshore, near-shore and offshore applications, the vast majority of wave energy devices developed today from these technologies is still in prototype demonstration stage. It is, therefore, too early to predict which of these technologies will become the most prevalent one for future commercialization. Currently the major obstacles towards wave energy commercialization are the high capital costs of wave energy devices (translated into high electricity unit costs for power generation) and the adverse working weather conditions that these devices have to endure, requiring additional safety features which results in escalation of the capital costs. With the future commercialisation of the <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>systems</b> the operating costs are expected to reduce leading towards the competitiveness of this technology...|$|R
40|$|Wave {{power is}} {{renewable}} energy which is environmentally friendly. Unlike most {{of renewable energy}} resources, wave energy can produce power all the year. The wave energy is stored in the ocean worldwide and highly concentrated near the ocean surface. It can be captured by wave power devices. Wave power is considered as a competitive energy resource in future.   Waves are generated by wind blows {{across the surface of}} sea. Wave energy is one kind of mechanical energy which will be used for electricity generation. Wave power can’t be used directly to generate electricity; at first the wave energy is converted into the other form of useful mechanical energy and then converted into electricity. Wave power has a high potential to be captured and used for generating electricity in future as the technology develops further.   Wave energy has been used since 1890 s. There is a lot of energy stored in waves. 94 % energy of the ocean stored in the wave, and the other 6 % is tidal energy.   Only small a part of the wave power is used for commercial electricity generation today.   The China is a developing country with a very large population which annually consume about 3073 TWh electricity of which 496 TWh is from renewable energy.   The wave power was less than 1 GWh in 2007 (reference from International Energy Agency). The World Energy Council has measured the total useful power of the ocean wave energy to be more than 2 TW in the world and corresponding to 6000 TWh per year. There is about 70 GW useful wave power resources in China, equivalent to an annual useful wave power resource of 200 TWh.   The lowest capital cost for the <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> <b>system</b> is today around 0. 1 Euro/kWh.

This corresponds to less than 1 percent of the total use of electricity in China.   This thesis focuses on the functionality, efficiency and economic pay-off of existing ocean wave power systems, as well as how easy the ocean wave power can produce electricity. Firstly it discusses the physical concepts of wave power, and then focus on the existing wave power systems around the world.

The gravity, buoyancy and drag force acting on the wave energy converter (WEC) are all analyzed.

In this situation, current chopping control (CCC) is adopted with fixed turn-on angle and turn-off angle control mode to have a quick response for SRG. Further, {{in order to make}} the float keep in phase with the wave so as to improve the power generation efficiency, the reference current is dynamically adjusted according to the wave motion at all working stages.

30|$|Ocean {{wave energy}} has huge potential, {{and it is}} more stable and {{predictable}} than wind and solar power [5]. Ocean energy is stored in the ocean in various forms, such as tides, temperature gradient, waves and ocean currents, etc. From the 1970 s, many wave energy converters (WECs) have been invented [6]. With wave energy converters, the wave energy can be extracted into different forms of energy to be stored or used [7]. However, {{only a small amount}} of WEC equipment went through rigorous testing on the open sea [8]. Among these converters, Duck, French Flexible Bag, Clam, Archimedes Wave Swing (AWS), and Oscillating Water Column (OWC) technologies are more popular than other wave energy conversion technologies. At the same time, different control strategies have been implemented for the corresponding WECs [5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. At present, the OWC system is possibly considered to be the most reliable type of WEC because of its good structural strength [15]. However, it still has not been widely utilized for wave energy conversion due to its low efficiency and other economic reasons. In 2003, Hadano proposed a float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system</b> for off-shore use with many advantages, such as high efficiency, easy maintenance, and good mobility and adaptability [4]. The structure of this WEC is smart, in which the float moving in the vertical direction is used to capture the wave energy.

It is noted that the proposed float-type <b>wave</b> <b>power</b> generation <b>system</b> can extract energy only when the sea wave is rising, or when it is falling, which gives low efficiency.
