5|$|By {{the time}} Coke {{returned}} to Britain, plans were already under <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> enter Parliament. When an election {{was called in}} 1774, Wenman stood for the seat of Norfolk, with his son asked to stand in his place for Derby. Coke was not particularly enthusiastic about this, and withdrew when his opponent discovered he was under 21, the requisite age to stand for Parliament. With his father elected, Coke travelled with him to London, meeting members of the British high society. His sister Elizabeth and her husband James Dutton were also visiting, with Dutton's sister Jane, and Coke {{fell in love with}} her. Wenman was not impressed when Coke asked him to let them be married, as he had picked out the daughter of a baronet for his son, but with the intercession of Wenman's friend Harbord Harbord, he finally consented to their marriage, which occurred on 5 October 1775.|$|E
5|$|Irataba also welcomed {{bands of}} Yavapai onto the {{reservation}} {{after they had}} been subject to massacres by US troops, or suffered starvation due to having been driven from their lands. The meager resources of the reservation proved unable to sustain the additional population and eventually the Yavapai had to leave. Irataba frequently served as a mediator between Yavapai and Walapai who had become embroiled in conflicts with the US army, and participated in peace parlays. In 1871–72, General George Crook came to the Mohave reservation looking {{for a group of}} Yavapai thought to be responsible for the Wickenburg Massacre, and Irataba {{had no choice but to}} turn the war party over to the army. He traveled to the trial proceedings at Fort Date Creek, where he was instructed to hand tobacco to the Yavapai he believed to be responsible, as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> testify against them without their realizing it. As soldiers attempted to arrest the men that Irataba identified, fighting broke out and one of the Yavapai leaders, Ohatchecama, and his brother were shot. Despite having been shot twice and stabbed with a bayonet, Ohatchecama survived and escaped to organize the Tolkepaya Yavapai in resistance against the US army. The Yavapai felt betrayed by Irataba, and plotted to kill him in revenge, but were eventually persuaded that he was not the one who had turned them over to Crook.|$|E

Mourinho later cleared doubts regarding his future at Stamford Bridge, stating that there would only be two <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave Chelsea: if Chelsea were not <b>to</b> offer <b>him</b> a new contract in June 2010, and if Chelsea were <b>to</b> sack <b>him.</b>|$|R

25|$|Merovingian {{society had}} a militarised nature. The Franks called annual {{meetings}} every Marchfeld (1 March), when {{the king and}} his nobles assembled in large open fields and determined their targets for the next campaigning season. The meetings were a show of strength {{on behalf of the}} monarch and a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retain loyalty among his troops. In their civil wars, the Merovingian kings concentrated on the holding of fortified places and the use of siege engines. In wars waged against external foes, the objective was typically the acquisition of booty or the enforcement of tribute. Only in the lands beyond the Rhine did the Merovingians seek to extend political control over their neighbours.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} the metaphysics of the Buddhist conception of Reality {{to see how}} this can contribute to an ecological understanding of the human existence. Through this investigation I reveal that life from a Buddhist point of view is considered non-divided, alive and holy, and that man has the potential to realize and live according to this non-dual nature. This non-dual metaphysics also express itself through the human existence that according to Buddhism includes three different views of Reality, these are: the ordinary person, the bodhisattva, and the buddha, respectively. These three views are differentiated between according to different epistemic perceptions of Reality that generate three spontaneous different modes of relating to nature, one that is need based and one that is natural and based on compassion. Hence man has the potential to act naturally and spontaneously out of love through the realization of unity. The human existence therefore contains a potential that dramatically can alter man's relationship to nature. Hence a Buddhist perspective ecology argues {{that it is important to}} incorporate a broader understanding of the human existence in the environmental discourse. Through this humans can come to know his potential and understand that there is a different <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> relate to all of nature's forms...|$|R
25|$|As with {{unimolecular}} reactions, {{the keys}} to the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the many processes in emulsion polymerisation are the rate coefficients of the individual steps. These steps are initiation (how quickly a growing chain starts), propagation (how quickly individual monomer units are added), radical loss processes (the termination and transfer of radical activity), and particle formation (nucleation). With Prof D Napper, Gilbert applied equations that he had solved in gas-phase chemistry to the area of emulsion polymerisation. This opened the <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> develop—initially in collaboration with Napper—new theoretical and experimental methods for extracting the rate coefficients of elementary processes. He produced targeted data using these methods, particularly the time evolution of reaction rates and molecular-weight and particle-size distributions. This included novel types of systems, such as γ-radiolysis relaxation, in which events such as radical loss can be separated from radical propagation and growth.|$|E
25|$|As a {{university}} professor {{for much of his}} life, Dijkstra saw teaching not just as a required activity but as a serious research endeavor. His approach to teaching was unconventional. His lecturing style has been described as idiosyncratic. When lecturing, the long pauses between sentences have often been attributed to the fact that English is not Dijkstra's first language. However the pauses also served as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> think on his feet and he was regarded as a quick and deep thinker while engaged in the act of lecturing. His courses for students in Austin {{had little to do with}} computer science but they dealt with the presentation of mathematical proofs. At the beginning of each semester he would take a photo of each of the students, in order to memorize their names. He never followed a textbook, with the possible exception of his own while it was under preparation. When lecturing, he would write proofs in chalk on a blackboard rather than using overhead foils. He invited the students to suggest ideas, which he then explored, or refused to explore because they violated some of his tenets. He assigned challenging homework problems, and would study his students' solutions thoroughly. He conducted his final examinations orally, over a whole week. Each student was examined in Dijkstra's office or home, and an exam lasted several hours.|$|E
25|$|The equites and two senators, Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Scribonius Curio {{supported}} Cicero. They assembled on the Capitol {{and sent}} envoys to the consuls {{and the senate}} on his behalf. Lucius Ninnius tried to rally popular support. However, Clodius prevented him from taking any action. Aulus Gabinius barred the equites from accessing the senate, drove one of them who was persistent {{out of the city}} and rebuked Quintus Hortensius and Gaius Curio. Calpurnius Piso advised Cicero that leaving Rome was the only <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be safe. Cicero took offence. Caesar condemned the illegality of the action taken in 63 BC, but did not approve the punishment proposed by the law because it was not fitting for any law to deal with past events. Crassus had shown some support through his son, but he sided with the people. Pompey promised help, but he kept making excuses and kept making journeys out of Rome. Cicero got scared, considered resorting to arms and slighted Pompey openly. However, he was stopped by Cato and Hortensius, for fear of a civil war. Cicero left for Sicily, where he had been a governor, hoping to find sympathy there. On that day the law was passed without opposition. It was supported even by people who had actively helped Cicero. His property was confiscated and his house was demolished. Then Clodius carried a law that specified the terms of Cicero’s banishment. This banned him from a radius of 500 miles from Rome and both he and those who harboured him could be killed with impunity. Therefore, he went to Greece.|$|E
60|$|There {{were only}} two <b>ways</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get home: to turn tramp and walk back, or {{to go to that}} Mr. Sewell and borrow the money to pay his passage. To walk home would add intolerably to the public shame he must suffer, and the thought of going to Mr. Sewell was, even in the secret which it would remain between him and the minister, a pang so cruel to his pride that he recoiled from it instantly. He said to himself he would stand it one day more; {{something}} might happen, and if nothing happened, he should think of it again. In the meantime he thought of other things: of that girl, among the rest, and how she looked at the different times. As nearly as he could make out, she seemed to be a very fashionable girl; at any rate, she was dressed fashionably, and she was nice-looking. He did not know whether she had behaved very sensibly, but he presumed she was some excited.|$|R

500|$|Manstein's war memoir, Verlorene Siege (Lost Victories), was {{published}} in West Germany in 1955 and translated into English in 1958 for worldwide distribution. The book was a highly acclaimed best-seller, critical of Hitler and his leadership style. Historians such as Liddell Hart saw Manstein's emphasis on the purely military aspects of the war, while ignoring the political and moral aspects, as a <b>way</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> absolve himself and the high command of any responsibility for {{the events of the}} Holocaust. His favourable [...] portrayal of himself influenced popular opinion; he became the centre of a military cult which cast him not only as one of Germany's greatest generals, but also one of the greatest in history. He {{has been described as a}} militärische Kult- und Leitfigur ("military cult figure and leading personality"), a general of legendary — almost mythical — ability, much honoured by both the public and historians. Biographers, including Benoît Lemay, feel that his narrow focus on military matters to the exclusion of moral issues cannot be considered ethical.|$|E
