5|$|The {{condition}} of foreign domestic workers is being increasingly scrutinised by human-rights groups and criticised as tantamount to modern slavery.

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because <b>wages</b> <b>are</b> too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E

5|$|On 26 July 2012, for {{the first}} time since September 2010, Ireland was able to return to the {{financial}} markets, selling over €5 billion in long-term government debt, with an interest rate of 5.9% for the 5-year bonds and 6.1% for the 8-year bonds at sale. In December 2013, after three years on financial life support, Ireland finally left the EU/IMF bailout programme, although it retained a debt of €22.5 billion to the IMF; in August 2014, early repayment of €15 billion was being considered, which would save the country €375 million in surcharges.

5|$|Stanley Fischer (1977) {{responded to}} Thomas J. Sargent and Neil Wallace's {{monetary}} ineffectiveness proposition and showed how monetary policy could stabilize an economy {{even in a}} model with rational expectations. Fischer's model showed how monetary policy could have an impact in a model with long-term nominal wage contracts. John B. Taylor expanded on Fischer's work and found that monetary policy could have long-lasting effects—even after wages and prices had adjusted. Taylor arrived at this result by building on Fischer's model with the assumptions of staggered contract negotiations and contracts that fixed nominal prices and wage rates for extended periods. These early new Keynesian theories {{were based on the}} basic idea that, given fixed nominal wages, a monetary authority (central bank) can control the employment rate. Since <b>wages</b> <b>are</b> fixed at a nominal rate, the monetary authority can control the real wage (wage values adjusted for inflation) by changing the money supply and thus impact the employment rate.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and <b>wages</b> <b>are</b> locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

25|$|The {{justification}} {{for this was}} that when <b>wages</b> <b>are</b> higher, the supply of labor will increase relative to demand, creating an excess supply and thus depressing market real wages; when <b>wages</b> <b>are</b> lower, labor supply will fall, increasing market real wages.

30|$|The {{coefficient}} on the log of minimum {{wages in}} the equation where the dependent variable is the log of basic <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> 0.9, suggesting that a 1 % {{increase in the minimum}} <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> associated with an approximately 0.9 % increase in the basic wage. The coefficient in the bonus equation is a − 6.3, suggesting that a 1 % {{increase in the minimum wage}} leads to an approximately 6 % drop in bonus payments. Because bonuses are only 20 % of earnings while the basic <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> 60 %, a 1 % change in the basic <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> a much bigger absolute increase than a 1 % change in the bonus. This can easily be seen if we assume that the total <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> 100 (so that the basic <b>wage</b> <b>is</b> 60 and the bonus is 20). In this case, our results from Table  6 predict that a 1 % increase in the minimum wage would lead to an increase in the basic wage of approximately 0.54 (0.9 % of 60) and a drop in the bonus by 1.2 (6 % of 20).|$|R
