40|$|Airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> {{provide a}} novel {{solution}} to harvest <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> from altitudes {{that can not}} be reached by wind turbines with a similar nominal generator power. The use of a lightweight but strong tether in place of an expensive tower provides an additional cost advantage, next to the higher capacity factor and much lower total mass. This paper investigates the scaling e ects of airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems.</b> The <b>energy</b> yield of airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems,</b> that work in pumping mode of operation is at least ten times higher than the energy yield of conventional solar <b>systems.</b> For airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> the yield is defined per square meter wing area. In this paper the dependency of the energy yield on the nominal generator power for systems in the range of 1 kW to 1 MW is investigated. For the onshore location Cabauw, The Netherlands, it is shown, that a generator of just 1. 4 kW nominal power and a total system mass of less then 30 kg has the theoretical potential to harvest energy at only twice the price per kWh of large scale airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems.</b> This would make airborne <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>systems</b> a very attractive choice for small scale remote and mobile applications as soon as the remaining challenges for commercialization are solved.

5000|$|Ampyx Power is an {{airborne}} {{wind energy}} company founded in 2008 by Bas Lansdorp and Richard Ruiterkamp. It was created after Lansdorp dropped his five-year-long studies of wind energy at Delft University of Technology to found Ampyx Power. In 2011, Lansdorp sold {{a majority of}} his Ampyx Power shares to fund his new project, Mars One. [...] Wubbo Ockels' interest in energy began when he let a kite line slip and it burned his hand. He became interested and started to study and research how this could be turned into electricity. At Delft University, he formed a team with Bas Lansdorp that worked on developing kites that could retrieve energy from the sky. Richard Ruiterkamp became the team leader and he created a fixed wing aircraft that allowed greater controllability and allowing the generation of more energy. In 2008 he founded the company with Bas Lansdorp. Lansdorp worked on the business aspect, and Ruiterkamp {{was head of the}} science division. Currently, Ampyx Power has a team of 40 engineers. Their current prototype is the AP3 Ampyx Power Airborne <b>Wind</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>System</b> (AWES). The system is a tethered aircraft that converts wind into electric energy. The aircraft is tethered to an on the ground generator. When the aircraft moves and flies, it reels the tether and powers the generator. The plane is then reeled in through the tether and then re-released into the air.|$|E
