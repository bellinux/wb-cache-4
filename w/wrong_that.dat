5|$|During the conflict, Constantine arrives, {{takes the}} box, and {{transports}} himself and Zatanna to the Temple of Hephaestus. There {{they find that}} Madame Xanadu had been kidnapped and locked away in a secret bunker. Madame Xanadu tells everyone that Pandora had it <b>wrong,</b> <b>that</b> the box is actually a doorway. Superman, Wonder Woman and their respective groups arrive at the temple. Constantine, still in possession of the box, realizes that the box is allowing evil thoughts to go through everyone's mind, and a massive fight breaks out as the heroes struggle to get possession of the box.|$|E

5|$|The head of {{the legal}} system was officially the pharaoh, who was {{responsible}} for enacting laws, delivering justice, and maintaining law and order, a concept the ancient Egyptians referred to as Ma'at. Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes. Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes. More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided. Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth. In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators. Whether the charges were trivial or serious, court scribes documented the complaint, testimony, and verdict of the case for future reference.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} The Double Helix, Watson {{described}} being intimidated by Franklin {{and that they}} were unable to establish constructive scientific interactions during the time period when Franklin was doing DNA research. In the book's epilogue, written after Franklin's death, Watson acknowledges his early impressions of Franklin were often <b>wrong,</b> <b>that</b> she faced enormous barriers as a woman in the field of science even though her work was superb, and that it took them years to overcome their bickering before he could appreciate Franklin's generosity and integrity.|$|E

25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against the Black Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they were <b>wrong,</b> <b>that</b> she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, that they put Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again.|$|E
25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common sense of right and <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> does a city good—a decent guy. I {{certainly}} won’t find fault with a man like that. After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
25|$|Claims {{that some}} of the {{provisions}} of the tax code are unconstitutional are submissions of a different order. They do not arise from innocent mistakes caused by the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, they reveal full knowledge of the provisions at issue and a studied conclusion, however <b>wrong,</b> <b>that</b> those provisions are invalid and unenforceable. Thus, in this case, Cheek paid his taxes for years, but after attending various seminars and based on his own study, he concluded that the income tax laws could not constitutionally require him to pay a tax.|$|E

25|$|Weininger (1880–1903), who {{was also}} Jewish, argued that the {{concepts}} male and female exist only as Platonic forms, and that Jews tend to embody the platonic femininity. Whereas men are basically rational, women operate only {{at the level of}} their emotions and sexual organs. Jews, Weininger argued, are similar, saturated with femininity, with no sense of right and wrong, and no soul. Weininger argues that man must choose between his masculine and feminine sides, consciousness and unconsciousness, Platonic love and sexuality. Love and sexual desire stand in contradiction, and love between a woman and a man is therefore doomed to misery or immorality. The only life worth living is the spiritual one—to live as a woman or a Jew means one has no right to live at all; the choice is genius or death. Weininger committed suicide, shooting himself in 1903, shortly after publishing the book. Many years later, as a professor at Cambridge, Wittgenstein distributed copies of Weininger's book to his bemused academic colleagues. He said that Weininger's arguments were wrong, but that it was the way they were <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> was interesting.|$|E
500|$|As {{an example}} of this, the {{reviewer}} mentions Poulton's argument that Wallace must be <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the coloring whereby the sexes often differ {{one from the other}} in a startling way is occasioned by a surplus vitality" [...] because [...] "sexual colors are only developed in species which court by day or twilight" [...] and then only on parts of the body which the female [...] "would oftenest and best see them".|$|E
500|$|More {{revealing}} is {{a comment}} Lady Rosebery herself made to her husband, [...] "I sometimes {{think it is}} <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> I have thought less {{of the children in}} comparison to you" [...] shortly before her death in 1890, suggesting that when a choice between her children and husband was forced on her, she always chose her husband. However, the same comment also hints that she was not unaware that her choice was at the cost of her children.|$|E

500|$|An inquiry was {{chaired by}} High Court judge Sir Michael Connell, the deputy senior steward of the Jockey Club since 1988. His report apportioned some blame to Keith Brown for {{allowing}} the horses {{to get too}} close to the tape, but most blame to Ken Evans, the official further down the track, for failing to notice the second false start. Brown retired later that year and said: [...] "It was very sad for all concerned. Whatever could go <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> day did." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{anthropologist}} Paul van der Grijp believes Oviri {{was intended}} [...] as an epithet to reinforce Gauguin's persona as a [...] "civilised savage". [...] The artist {{wrote in his}} final letter to Morice that [...] "You were <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> day when you said I was wrong to say I was a savage. It's true enough: I am a savage. And civilised people sense the fact. In my work {{there is nothing that}} can surprise or disconcert, except the fact that I am a savage in spite of myself. That's also why my work is inimitable." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It wasn't a {{question}} of doing everything differently, although they changed the ending; it was mostly a matter of doing everything wrong. They said the lines...mostly...but they said them all wrong. And they cast it wrong. And they designed it wrong. And they scored it wrong. They did everything <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> they could possibly do. There's actually a fascinating lesson in filmmaking, because everything that they did reflects back to the script or looks like something from the script, and people assume that, if I hated it, then they’d changed the script...but it wasn’t so much that they’d changed the script; it’s that they just executed {{it in such a}} ghastly fashion as to render it almost unwatchable." ...|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ are {{strongly}} anti-Calvinist in {{their understanding of}} salvation and generally present conversion as [...] "obedience to the proclaimed facts of the gospel rather than {{as the result of}} an emotional, Spirit-initiated conversion". Churches of Christ hold the view that humans of accountable age are lost because they have committed sins. These lost souls can be redeemed because Jesus Christ, the Son of God, offered Himself as the atoning sacrifice. Children too young to understand right from wrong and make a conscious choice between the two, are believed to be innocent of sin. There is no set [...] "age" [...] for this to occur; it is only when the child learns {{the difference between right and}} <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> they are accountable (...) [...] Congregations differ in their interpretation of the age of accountability.|$|E
500|$|During {{this time}} he met [...] "a fine, hard riding young Kansan, who I had met on an Indian raid and whose nerve I greatly admired." [...] The young Kansan, who had been swindled by an unscrupulous {{superintendent}} of mines, had a plan to rustle cattle and horses from the superintendent and sell them to Curly Bill (William Brocius), an outlaw {{with whom he had}} indirectly been in contact. Both men were broke at the time, and the job sounded easy. But Burnham had always rejected the life of a thief and even as a wanted man, he did not view himself as a criminal. Burnham began to see that even though he joined the feud to help his friends, {{he had been in the}} <b>wrong,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "avenging only led to more vengeance and to even greater injustice than that suffered through the often unjustly administered laws of the land." ...|$|E

[...] However, Abra persisted, and was able to convince her to resume their relationship, and move in with him. Ayola said of the relationship at the time: [...] "It's love! Well, she loves him but I think he loves moving around the world more. He's a drifter. I wouldn't put any money on a happy ending for them. He's such a rolling stone and she's so emotionally <b>wrong</b> <b>that</b> I don't think it's going to work. On the plus side, I think this pair probably have a fantastic sex life and a great time down the pub." ...|$|E
