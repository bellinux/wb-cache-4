5|$|Darlington relates that {{he found}} in the New York City library Carl Jacobi's {{original}} paper on elliptic functions, published in Latin in 1829. In this paper Darlington <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find foldout tables of the exact elliptic function transformations needed for Chebyshev approximations of both Cauer's image parameter, and Darlington's insertion-loss filters.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve his chronic ill health, Darwin went in 1849 to Dr. James Gully's Malvern spa and <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find some benefit from hydrotherapy. Then, in 1851, his treasured {{daughter}} Annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary, and after {{a long series of}} crises she died.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} chosen among 15 debut {{works for the}} 2006 Berlin Film Festival. It {{received}} enthusiastic reception from the audience as it ran to packed houses to the Chopra's surprise. Expecting an audience of about 100 Westerners, a critic visiting the festival <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see the cinema hall full and people jostling for seats even on the steps.|$|E

5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed outside their walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, {{then as now}} {{considered one of the}} strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} Carriage House first. He {{was dressed in}} formal black and white attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find there were no scores written for the musicians to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E

5|$|Cordova-Buckley, {{who began}} {{appearing}} on the show during the third season, <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find the writers' characterization of Rodriguez in the episode to closely mirror her own life. Cordova-Buckley stated that, like how Rodriguez {{is seen in the}} episode, she dislikes nightclubs, and has found herself changing over time to be a different person from who her old friends remember; for Cordova-Buckley, this was seen in returning to Mexico after becoming an actor in the United States, which is reflected with Rodriguez's friends from Colombia from before she worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. as an Inhuman asset.|$|E
5|$|Even Born <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} that Paul Dirac {{had been thinking}} {{along the same lines}} as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1943 the District Engineer of the Manhattan Engineer District, Lt-Col Kenneth Nichols {{had several}} queries from Canada {{relating}} to contracts Canadian firms Eldorado Gold Mines and Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS of Cominco) {{had for the}} secret atomic bomb project; CMS was building a heavy water plant and Eldorado was mining and processing uranium ore. He phoned a C. D. Howe in Ottawa and arranged to travel on the overnight train to Ottawa and see Howe the next day (June 14). On arriving at the address given Nichols <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find that Howe was the minister of munitions and supply, and found him most friendly. Howe was told about the Manhattan Project, and Nichols was told that Eldorado was now a Crown company.|$|E

5|$|In the off-season, Malhotra {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the first round, seventh overall, of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. The Rangers scouted him as a strong, {{physical}} player with good hockey sense and character, comparing him to Adam Graves. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> have been selected by the Rangers, as they {{were one of the}} only teams to have not interviewed or met with him prior to the draft. He anticipated being drafted by the Calgary Flames at sixth overall, as the team's general manager, Al Coates had previously drafted him into the OHL as general manager of the Storm.|$|E
5|$|It is {{told that}} an Indian boy named Mariano Mayta {{used to watch}} over his father's herd of alpaca {{on the slopes of}} the mountain. He wandered into the snowfields of the glacier, where he {{encountered}} a mestizo boy named Manuel. They became good friends, and Manuel provided Mariano with food. When the boy did not return home for meals, Mariano's father went looking for his son. He <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find his herd had increased. As a reward, he sent Mariano to Cusco to get new clothes. Mariano asked to buy some also for Manuel, who wore the same outfit everyday. His father agreed, so Mariano asked Manuel for a sample in order to buy the same kind of cloth in Cusco.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E

5|$|Most of Riefenstahl's {{unfinished}} {{projects were}} lost {{towards the end}} of the war. The French government confiscated all of her editing equipment, along with the production reels of Tiefland. After years of legal wrangling, these were returned to her, but the French government had reportedly damaged some of the film stock whilst trying to develop and edit it, with a few key scenes being missing (although Riefenstahl <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find the original negatives for Olympia in the same shipment). She edited and dubbed the remaining material and Tiefland premiered on 11 February 1954 in Stuttgart. However, it was denied entry into the Cannes Film Festival. Although Riefenstahl lived for almost another half century, Tiefland was her last feature film.|$|E
5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no {{questions for the}} attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this would amount to treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{agreed to}} take on Weinstein, who decided to redevelop his Probe {{published}} short story into a script for the animated Star Trek. Cooper addressed the script to D.C. Fontana, who had recently left the show. When it arrived at the production office, it was forwarded to Fontana unread, who sent it back to Cooper as {{she had left the}} show. The script was subsequently resubmitted by Weinstein under his agent's name for the second season of the show. Producer Lou Scheimer contacted Weinstein and informed him that they wanted to purchase the script if the ending could be modified, which Weinstein agreed to. Weinstein was 19 at the time and staying in the dormitory at the University of Connecticut, and Scheimer <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find out that Weinstein was so young.|$|E
5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the gross income, and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' gross income, including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, he starred {{alongside}} Melissa Leo in Why Stop Now, a {{drama about}} a drug addict mother (Leo) and her piano prodigy son (Eisenberg), and in the magical realist romantic comedy To Rome with Love, directed by Woody Allen. That same year, he filed a $3million lawsuit against the producers of the 2010 direct-to-DVD film Camp Hell, claiming exploitation. According to the lawsuit, Eisenberg agreed {{to appear in the}} film as a favor to his friends. He was on set for one day of filming in 2007, earned about $3,000, and logged only a few minutes of total screentime. Because of his minimal involvement in the production, he <b>was</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see that his face was prominently featured {{on the cover of the}} DVD, implying that he starred in the film. His lawsuit asserts various California law causes of action, including claims for unfair business practices and publicity rights.|$|E
