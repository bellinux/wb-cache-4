5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
5|$|Two of the {{patients}} at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other {{was admitted to the}} medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing leukopenia (low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count).</b> Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In {{most cases the}} LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E

40|$|Dogs {{were exposed}} to either trichloroethylene(TCL) or 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane(TCE) in order to {{investigate}} {{the effects of these}} solvents on hematologic parameters. Further-more, because of unusual changes in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> following exposure of pregnant dogs to these solvents, investigation of the effects of several hormones given prior to exposure to the solvents was pursued. The results obtained were as follows. 1. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> showed a marked decrease immediately after starting exposure to TCL or 1, 1, 1 -TCE, though the decrease was temporary. On the other hand red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts,</b> hematocrit values and blood platelet counts showed no changes. 2. While each kind of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> decreased in number, the degree was greatest in neutrophils. 3. TCL caused a greater decrease in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> than 1, 1, 1 -TCE. 4. A dose-response relationship was seen between the concentrations of 1, 1, 1 -TCE from 200 to 700 ppm and the decrease in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts.</b> 5. No change in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> was observed following the exposure of pregnant dogs to 1, 1, 1 -TCE. 6. Premeditation with estradiol, progesterone and hydrocortisone had a preventive effect on the decrease in <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> caused by the exposure to 1, 1, 1 -TCE, but no such effect was seen with premedication of testosterone...|$|R

5|$|Like many {{scientists}} {{working on the}} project, Woods affected a casual attitude towards the danger posed by radiation. After a morning with Willard Libby soldering a canister containing a mixture of radium salt and beryllium metal, Woods absorbed about 200 roentgens, and her <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> halved. The doctors gave her a lecture on how a woman has only a fixed number of egg cells, a proposition that Woods was skeptical of. She considered that the important thing was that the solder was done correctly. When the team moved to their new home at Argonne, Woods had a dormitory all to herself.|$|E

Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E

5|$|The first clue to a {{diagnosis}} of AML is typically an abnormal result on a complete blood count. While an excess of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding with the leukemia, and leukemic blasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with isolated decreases in platelets, red blood cells, or even with a low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> (leukopenia). While a presumptive diagnosis of AML {{can be made by}} examination of the peripheral blood smear when there are circulating leukemic blasts, a definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as ruling out pernicious anemia (Vitamin B12 deficiency), folic acid deficiency and copper deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{radiation}} {{sources such as}} high-energy, ionizing cosmic rays can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to {{the immune system and}} changes to the <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count.</b> Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of cancer, plus damage to the eyes, nervous system, lungs and the gastrointestinal tract. On a round-trip Mars mission lasting three years, nearly the entire body would be traversed by high energy nuclei, each of which can cause ionization damage to cells. Fortunately, most such particles are significantly attenuated by the shielding provided by the aluminium walls of a spacecraft, and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research will be needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.|$|E
5|$|In Dorchester, {{a damaged}} cargo ship from China washes ashore; {{all of the}} crew members seem to be {{infected}} with squid-like creatures which soon erupt from their mouths, effectively killing their hosts. Other survivors flock to a contact house in Boston's Chinatown, only to suffer the same fate {{in the presence of}} a man (Tzi Ma). While investigating the crime scene shore, the Fringe team discover a healthy young Chinese woman, who tells them all of the passengers but her were given pills for their perceived seasickness, and that another ship is expected in two days. In the lab, Walter (John Noble) posits the creatures are gigantic parasitic worms, a modified version of Ancylostoma duodenale, that needs hosts for their gestation period, hence the distribution of parasitic pills. One of the still-living worms bites Walter, boosting his <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count</b> and making him suddenly feel better.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as markers of systemic inflammation in the diagnosis of localized testicular cancer as a malignancy with initially low volume. Materials and Methods Thirty-six patients with localized testicular cancer with a mean age of 34. 22 ± 14. 89 years and 36 healthy controls with a mean age of 26. 67 ± 2. 89 years were enrolled in the study. <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and NLR were calculated from complete <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts.</b> Results <b>White</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and NLR were statistically significantly higher in patients with testicular cancer compared with the control group (p< 0. 0001 for all). Conclusions Both <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> and NLR can be used as a simple test in the diagnosis of testicular cancer besides the well-known accurate serum tumor markers as AFP (alpha fetoprotein), hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) ...|$|R

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and systolic pressure for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>count,</b> {{which may}} then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for early detection of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the association of serum leptin with blood lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear (PMN) percentages as the markers of immune system function as well as nutritional status in maintenance hemodialysis patients. Design: In a group of maintenance hemodialysis patients, serum leptin, albumin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> consisting of lymphocytes and PMN cells were measured. Results: A significant positive correlation of serum leptin with body mass index, a significant positive correlation of serum leptin with lymphocyte percentage, and a significant inverse correlation of serum leptin with PMN percentage were seen. Near significant inverse correlations of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> with duration and dosage of dialysis, a near significant inverse correlation of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> with hemodialysis adequacy, and a significant inverse correlation of <b>white</b> <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>counts</b> with serum albumin were seen. Conclusion: Generally, increased neutrophil counts and reduced lymphocyte counts are independent predictors of increased mortality risk in hemodialysis patients. Although this study and others showed positive association of serum leptin with lymphocytes and an inverse correlation of serum leptin with PMNs, the authors conclude a protective role for leptin in decreasing mortality in hemodialysis patients; therefore, serum leptin in hemodialysis has a reverse epidemiology role for maintaining immune system function in hemodialysis...|$|R
