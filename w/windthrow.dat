5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, {{the tree line}} is often much lower than in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as <b>windthrow.</b> This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E

40|$|<b>Windthrows</b> are a {{recurrent}} disturbance in Amazonia and {{are an important}} driver of forest dynamics and carbon storage. In this study, we present {{for the first time}} the seasonal and interannual variability of <b>windthrows,</b> focusing on Central Amazonia, and discuss the potential meteorological factors associated with this variability. Landsat images over the 1998 – 2010 time period were used to detect the occurrence of <b>windthrows,</b> which were identified based on their spectral characteristics and shape. Here, we found that <b>windthrows</b> occurred every year but were more frequent between September and February. Organized convective activity associated with multicell storms embedded in mesoscale convective systems, such as northerly squall lines (that move from northeast to southwest) and southerly squall lines (that move from southwest to northeast) can cause <b>windthrows.</b> We also found that southerly squall lines occurred more frequently than their previously reported ~ 50 year interval. At the interannual scale, we did not find an association between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and <b>windthrows...</b>|$|R

25|$|Mature {{stands of}} white spruce in boreal regions often have {{well-developed}} moss layers dominated by feather mosses, e.g., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) B.S.G., Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., Ptlium crista-castrensis (Hedw.) De Not., and Dicranum Hedw. spp. rather than Sphagnum Dill. spp. (La Roi and Stringer 1976, Viereck 1987). The {{thickness of the}} moss–organic layer commonly exceeds 25nbsp&cm in the far north and may approach twice that figure. The mosses compete for nutrients and have {{a major influence on}} soil temperatures in the rooting zone. Permafrost development in parts of Alaska, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories is facilitated by the insulative organic layer (Viereck 1970a, b, Gill 1975, Van Cleve and Yarie 1986). The role of <b>windthrow</b> in maintaining diversification of the bryophyte flora in boreal spruce forests has been described by Jonsson et al. (1990) and Jonsson and Dynesius (1993).|$|E
500|$|The full-force of Monica's {{estimated}} [...] wind gusts were {{felt in the}} unpopulated tropical savanna {{regions of}} northern Australia. A large-scale <b>windthrow</b> event affected approximately 10,400km2 (4,000mi2) of forest, resulting in the damage or destruction of 140million trees. Damage extended [...] {{north and south of}} Monica's centre and progressed [...] inland. The affected areas primarily consist of Eucalyptus (namely E. miniata and E. tetrodonta) [...] and Corymbia (namely C. dichromophloia, C. latifolia, and C. foelscheana) tree species. Common grasses in the savanna area include Triodia bitextura and Sorghum. Areas near the cyclone's landfall point—Junction Bay—also comprise wetlands and Melaleuca swamp forests. The heaviest damage occurred just east of the landfall point, with more than 85percent of vegetation severely damaged; it spanned 139km2 (53.7mi2). In this area, trees were completely defoliated, snapped, and/or uprooted. Within [...] of Junction Bay, 77percent of all trees were uprooted or snapped at the trunk, while 84percent suffered total defoliation. In the Melaleuca swamps, 60percent of trees were snapped or uprooted once wind gusts exceeded [...] Approximately 12.7million tonnes of vegetative debris was created by the storm.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the alpine}} tree lines shown above, polar tree lines are heavily {{influenced}} by local variables such as aspect of slope and degree of shelter. In addition, permafrost has {{a major impact on}} the ability of trees to place roots into the ground. When roots are too shallow, trees are susceptible to <b>windthrow</b> and erosion. Trees can often grow in river valleys at latitudes where they could not grow on a more exposed site. Maritime influences such as ocean currents also {{play a major role in}} determining how far from the equator trees can grow as well as the warm summers experienced in extreme continental climates. In northern inland Scandinavia there is substantial maritime influence on high parallels that keep winters relatively mild, but enough inland effect to have summers well above the threshold for the tree line.

50|$|<b>Windthrow</b> {{is common}} in all forested {{parts of the world}} that {{experience}} storms or high wind speeds. The risk of <b>windthrow</b> to a tree is related to the tree's size (height and diameter), the 'sail area' presented by its crown, the anchorage provided by its roots, its exposure to the wind, and the local wind climate. A common way of quantifying the risk of <b>windthrow</b> to a forest area is to model the probability or 'return time' of a wind speed that would damage those trees at that location. Tree senescence can also be a factor, where multiple factors contributing to the declining health of a tree reduce its anchorage and therefore increase its susceptibility to <b>windthrow.</b> The resulting damage can be a significant factor {{in the development of a}} forest.|$|E

40|$|In the {{locality}} Zemská (the Low Tatras Mts.) {{the following}} aboveground parameters were measured in <b>windthrown</b> and undamaged Norway spruce Picea abies (L.)

The stem quotients, crown proportion index, height {{position of the}} green crown, and {{the height of the}} tree centre of gravity were calculated from these data. Our results agreed with the present understanding that a wide tree crown has a negative effect on spruce stability. Paradoxically, from the view of tree stability, more favourable values of crown proportion index, stem quotients, and height positions of tree centre of gravity were found in <b>windthrown</b> spruce trees. In addition, the forward stepwise method of discriminant analysis identified the variable height position of the tree centre of gravity in the resulting model as the second best predictor (crown width being the first) in distinguishing between <b>windthrown</b> and undamaged spruce trees, although this variable had a higher mean value (less favourable) in undamaged trees...|$|R

40|$|Radar {{remote sensing}} is an {{efficient}} method for monitoring forests over large areas. Radar waves transmitted from a system carried by a satellite or an aircraft interact with {{trees on the}} ground, and the reflected waves are used to form images which are independent of weather and light conditions. Information in the images is then used to retrieve forest parameters. CARABAS is an airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system. Due to the long wavelengths of the system (3 - 15 m), the radar signal is able to penetrate the forest canopies and for boreal forests the main backscattering component is the ground-trunk double-bounce. The scattering strength {{is directly related to}} the stem volume and hence stem volume retrieval with CARABAS has higher accuracy than SAR systems using shorter wavelengths. However, the ground-trunk double-bounce is very sensitive to ground slope and if not corrected for, ground slope will cause the stem volume to be underestimated. By using multiple images acquired with different flight headings and combining the image information with ground topography data in a model-based inversion method, most of the ground topography influence on the retrieved stem volume is removed. With four CARABAS images and a coarse digital elevation model with 50 m horizontal grid, the stem volume can be retrieved with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 48 m 3 /ha for stem volumes in the range 80 - 700 m 3 /ha. The proposed retrieval method gives better accuracy and is more robust than existing heuristic methods. By using this method, the retrieval accuracy in areas with ground topography is similar to that of similar forests standing on flat and horizontal ground. Another forestry application where CARABAS and other airborne SAR systems with long-wavelengths and high resolution can provide timely and useful information is in the detection of <b>windthrown</b> trees. A method for detecting <b>windthrows</b> in CARABAS images and a discussion about when <b>windthrows</b> can be detected is presented in this thesis. </p...|$|R
