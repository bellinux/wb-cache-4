5|$|Adult non-breeding plumage is {{brownish}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> {{neck and}} head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> culmen and tip, but {{in early spring}} the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.|$|E
5|$|T. m. nigrideus breeds from coastal {{northern}} Quebec to Labrador and Newfoundland and winters {{from southern}} Newfoundland south {{through most of}} the eastern US states to southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and northern Georgia. It is uniformly darker or blackish on the head, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> gray back. The underparts are slightly more red than those of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Shetland {{is based}} on locally {{produced}} lamb, beef and seafood, much of it organic. Inevitably, the real ale-producing Valhalla Brewery is the most northerly in Britain. The Shetland Black is a variety of blue potato <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> skin and indigo coloured flesh markings.|$|E

5|$|Type C is the {{smallest}} type and lives in larger groups than the others. Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E
5|$|According to the Shyamaladandakam, Matangi plays a ruby-studded veena {{and speaks}} sweetly. The Dhyana Mantra {{describes}} {{her to be}} four-armed, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> emerald complexion, full breasts anointed with red kumkum powder, and a crescent moon on her forehead. She carries a noose, a goad, a sugarcane bow and flower arrows, which the goddess Tripura Sundari is often described to hold. She is also described to love the parrot and is embodied in the nectar of song.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Andromeda Galaxy and its companions, the {{constellation}} also features NGC 891 (Caldwell 23), a smaller galaxy {{just east of}} Almach. It is a barred spiral galaxy seen edge-on, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> dust lane visible down the middle. NGC 891 is incredibly faint and small despite its magnitude of 9.9, as its surface brightness of 14.6 indicates; it is 13.5 by 2.8 arcminutes in size. NGC 891 was discovered by the brother-and-sister team of William and Caroline Herschel in August 1783. This galaxy is at an approximate distance of 30 million light-years from Earth, calculated from its redshift of 0.002.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 12-22 mm. The forewings are pale fuscous <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> fuscous median fascia and a paler discal spot. The hindwings are whitish <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wavy <b>dark</b> fuscous submarginal line. The termen is orange-fuscous.|$|R
50|$|Leucocoprinus magnicystidiosus is <b>a</b> similar mushroom, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> disc {{and larger}} cheilocystidia.|$|R

5|$|At 162km, Puck is {{the largest}} of the inner moons of Uranus and the only one imaged by Voyager 2 in any detail. Puck and Mab are the two {{outermost}} inner satellites of Uranus. All inner moons are dark objects; their geometrical albedo is less than 10%. They are composed of water ice contaminated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> materialâ€”probably radiation-processed organics.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius lignyotellus and L.lignyotus {{are similar}} to L.fallax, {{and they are all}} {{associated}} with Picea and Abies; examination of microscopic features cannot be used to distinguish between them. L.lignyotus is restricted in distribution to eastern North America and Europe. Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is black with a yellowish tip, and the cere is also black, with feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
50|$|Adults have brown wings <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>darker</b> submarginal band, and <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> dot {{near the}} centre of the costa of each forewing.|$|R

5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown hue, {{but there}} have been instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds have a black patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E
5|$|The {{juvenile}} pied butcherbird has {{dark brown}} instead of black plumage, lacks the pale collar {{and has a}} cream to buff lores, chin, and upper throat, becoming more brown on the lower throat and breast. Its underparts are off-white to cream. The bill is dark brown. In its first year, it moults into its first immature plumage, which resembles that of the juvenile, but has a more extensive dark brown throat. Its bill is blue-grey <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown or blackish tip.|$|E

5|$|The {{song thrush}} has three subspecies, with the {{nominate}} subspecies, T. p. philomelos, covering {{the majority of}} the species' range. T. p. hebridensis, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is the darkest subspecies, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> brown back, greyish rump, pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became unacceptable to public opinion, {{and the original}} play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> side.|$|E
5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E

5|$|Using {{an alcohol}} lamp, WÃ¶hler heated {{alternating}} layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder {{he saw that}} it was made of fine particles <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.|$|E
5|$|Amanita nothofagi {{mushrooms}} can {{be confused}} with A.australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check {{for the presence of}} clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in A.australis and absent from A.nothofagi. Ridley notes that the type collection was made <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble A.excelsa, which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from A.nothofagi largely on the basis of colourâ€”it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older. Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Many Japanese manga and anime {{have also}} adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow {{is known for}} {{creating}} the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes.|$|E
