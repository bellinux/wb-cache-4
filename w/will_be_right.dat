25|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{technique}} essential for creating designs that utilize an assortment of materials, the artist must first practice standardized styles. The classic standard Banmi Shofu Ryu designs are Moribana, Nageire, Chabana, Oseika and Gendaika. Ric Bansho also introduced a modern designed called Hashibana which comes in three expressions. These expressions are Maru (Global or spherical), Uate (tall and narrow) and Saba (low and narrow). Technical points that an artist needs to focus on when creating a design are: {{the length of the}} stems, degrees of slant, intentional space to be used, number of sections in the container, and whether the arrangement <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> or left-sided. Moribana, Nageire Keishatai, Oseika, and Banmi Shofu Chabana are only a few of such designs. Each design has its own characteristics, using particular flowers and specific arrangements styles, which may be appropriate for a certain environment such as a tearoom. The balance of the plants and flowers, combined with the appropriate container and spirit of the materials, creates a beautiful composition, which incorporates the naturalness of each design.|$|E
500|$|Colbert {{spoke in}} the persona of the {{character}} he played on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, a parody of a conservative pundit in the fashion of Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. He began by satirizing mass surveillance, joking [...] "If anybody needs anything else at their tables, just speak slowly and clearly into your table numbers. Someone from the NSA <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> over with a cocktail." [...] While many of his jokes were directed at President Bush, he also lampooned the journalists and other figures present at the dinner. Most of the speech was prepared specifically for the event, but several segments were lifted—largely unchanged—from The Colbert Report, including parts of the [...] "truthiness" [...] monologue from the first episode of the show, where Colbert advocated speaking from [...] "the gut" [...] rather than the brain and denounced books as [...] "all fact, no heart". Colbert framed {{this part of the}} speech as though he were agreeing with Bush's philosophies, saying that he and Bush are [...] "not brainiacs on the nerd patrol", implicitly criticizing the way Bush positioned himself as an anti-intellectual.|$|E

The exact reason for the rejection of private language has been contentious. One interpretation, which has been called memory scepticism, has it that one might remember the sensation wrongly, and that as a result one might misuse the term S [...] The other, called meaning scepticism, has it that one can never be sure of the meaning of a term defined in this way.|$|E
2500|$|The {{class of}} {{problems}} that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called BQP, for [...] "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run probabilistic algorithms, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of BPP ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It {{is defined as the}} set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half. A quantum computer is said to [...] "solve" [...] a problem if, for every instance, its answer <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP.|$|E
2500|$|After World War I, Rumler {{signed with}} the minor league Salt Lake City Bees of the Double-A Pacific Coast League (PCL). During spring {{training}} that season, the Oakland Tribune wrote that Rumler was [...] "one of the hardest hitters in the Bees camp", and that [...] "if he keeps up the clip throughout the season he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> up among the leading batters [...] ". He won a starting job with the Salt Lake club out of spring training. On the season, he batted [...]362 with 214 hits, 42 doubles, 17 triples, and 17 home runs in 140 games played. He {{led the league in}} batting average, doubles; was second in home runs; and third in triples. In January 1920, the St. Louis Browns, Rumler's former team, attempted to make a deal with the Salt Lake City Bees for him. However, the Browns did not offer the players that Salt Lake wanted, and the deal fell apart. Rumler injured his leg during spring training in 1920. On April 7, Rumler hit the first home run in the PCL by any batter in the 1920 season. On July 24, in a game against the Seattle Rainiers, he hit two home runs in the same game.|$|E

Typographically it's an AA+, {{visually}} it's AAA". Later, Gaga also revealed on her Facebook page that [...] "the first 500,000 physical copies of Artpop are crafted with LADY GAGA + ARTPOP cut out of hot pink metallic foil + silver foil. The foiling represents the true design of the cover as imagined by Koons, who hand collaged the typography himself." [...] The track listing was unveiled {{in a series of}} fan posts retweeted by the singer with pictures of a painted mural made by fans outside of a recording studio in Los Angeles where Artpop was being completed on October 9, 2013. Originally, the track listing was scheduled to be unveiled on September 29, 2013. In a Twitter post, Gaga said it was late due to two songs fighting for the twelfth place on the album. In January 2014, China's Ministry of Culture approved the uncensored release of Artpop in the country, making the album her first to be released in the country after she was blacklisted by the government for inappropriate music in 2011. However, to avoid further controversy with the release, the cover art for the Chinese release was altered to feature Gaga's legs covered in fishnet stockings, with the blue gazing ball enlarged to cover her exposed breasts.|$|E
