500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to grow up in a family of love, but one <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea. And I respected that." ...|$|E
500|$|Jose Sarria {{was born}} in San Francisco, California, to Maria Dolores Maldonado and Julio Sarria. His family was of Spanish and Colombian origin. His mother Maria {{was born in}} Bogot√° to an upper class and {{politically}} active family. During {{the events of the}} Thousand Days War and following her mother's death, Maria sought out the protection of her mother's friend, General Rafael Uribe Uribe, to escape Colombia. The general located Maria's surviving uncle, who took her to the American consulate. There she was made a ward of the United States and relocated to Panama. [...] "My mother got to Panama with directions to the home of a family called Kopp. He was the chairman of the big German beer company there", said Sarria. [...] "She {{went to work for the}} Kopps. ... My mother was the upstairs maid and took care of the children." [...] In 1919 she relocated to Guatemala City but remained there for just six months and, in 1920, sailed to San Francisco. As Sarria reported it, [...] "Now on the boat is <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> met my father, Julio Sarria. He came from a large and very wealthy family, very well known. ... His grandparents came from Spain." ...|$|E
60|$|A ray of {{sunlight}} {{fell into the}} room, lighting upon her coaxing face, making <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> stood seem shadow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's venison in the aumbry, Mary, [...] There's claret in the vat; [...] Come in, {{and breakfast}} in the hall [...] <b>Where</b> once <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> sat!' ...|$|R
6000|$|So he ran in, {{filled with}} wonder and great gladness. But {{when he saw}} her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, 'Why, <b>where</b> is <b>my</b> <b>mother?</b> For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went back}} to the village in the morning, and found a pretext for visiting Barryville under a device of {{purchasing}} drugs. The hooks were still in the wall <b>where</b> <b>my</b> silver-hiked sword used to hang; a blister was lying on the window-sill, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> 'Whole Duty of Man' had its place; and the odious Doctor Macshane had found out who I was (my countrymen find out everything, and a great deal more besides), and sniggering, asked me how I left the King of Prussia, and whether my friend the Emperor Joseph was as much liked as the Empress Maria Theresa had been. The bell-ringers would have had a ring of bells for me, but there was but one, Tim, who was too fat to pull; and I rode off before the vicar, Doctor Bolter (who had succeeded old Mr. Texter, who had the living in my time), had time to come out to compliment me; but the rapscallions of the beggarly village had assembled in a dirty army to welcome me, and cheered 'Hurrah for Masther Redmond!' as I rode away.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Shall {{we go on}} to <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is?' said Anne, less {{impressed}} by {{the beauty of the}} note than the trumpet-major himself was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{it seems}} to be the only place <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> can get just the {{combination}} of sea and mountain air that she wants." ...|$|E
60|$|I shrugged again--shrugged in {{token of}} my despair and grief and impotence--and I {{moved down the}} long room towards the door <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> waited.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I don't {{need that}} kind of money,' says I, looking Mr. Sheepman {{straight}} in the eye. 'The twelve dollars a month you pay me is enough. I need a rest, and I can save up until I get enough to pay my fare to Texarkana, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> widowed <b>mother</b> lives. If Black Bill,' I goes on, looking significantly at Ogden, 'was to have come down this way--say, a month ago--and bought a little sheep-ranch and--' ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} and left me and I entered the house <b>where</b> I found <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> sitting, still in her festal robes, like one who waits. She looked at my face, then asked what troubled me. I {{sat down on a}} stool at her feet and told her everything.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{well aware}} that I am the umblest person going,' said Uriah Heep, modestly; 'let the other be <b>where</b> he may. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> is {{likewise}} a very umble person. We live in a numble abode, Master Copperfield, but have much to be thankful for. My father's former calling was umble. He was a sexton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Victor didn't {{like the}} man, and he {{remained}} silent till Pettus repeated his question, then he answered, [...] "I can't tell you <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{and there}} I set off running over the moor, until I {{burst into the}} kitchen <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and father were sitting {{on either side of}} the ingle.|$|E
60|$|After this {{we pushed}} forward at a leisurely pace, and in {{comparative}} security, until {{we arrived at}} Corn Island, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> greeted Paul and me {{as if we were}} come from the dead.|$|E
60|$|It was on {{this very}} first day that I had the misfortune to throw her, though she was not subject to such {{weakness}} in general, {{into a state of}} violent consternation. I came into the room <b>where</b> she and <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> were sitting; and the baby (who was only a few weeks old) being on <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> lap, I took it very carefully in my arms. Suddenly Miss Murdstone gave such a scream that I all but dropped it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meaning," [...] said she, [...] "that I {{should never}} eat other fish {{than those from}} this river. No, sir; that may not be. I have a notion that the first foreign fish I shall eat will {{be found in the}} island of Jamaica, for my father said, that {{possibly}} he might first take a trip there, <b>where</b> lives <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> brother, whom we have not seen for a long time. But, as I told you before, nobody must know this. And now I must go to my supper, and you must take yours home with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Fortunately for my sanity I was {{not left}} long to brood unoccupied upon such themes. Our worldly affairs, under the {{sunshine}} of old Hasluck's round red face, prospered--for awhile; and one afternoon my father, {{who had been}} away from home since breakfast time, calling me into his office <b>where</b> also sat <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> informed me that the long-talked-of school was become at last a concrete thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no--Riolama. When I was a child, and {{the priest}} baptized me, he named me Riolama--the place <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was found. But it was long to say, and they called me Rima." ...|$|E
6000|$|The flush grew {{a trifle}} plainer in his daughter's cheek. [...] "It {{is not the}} value of the land," [...] she said. [...] "But think of such a man, a brutal, cattle-driving boor, ruling at Carnaby <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> lived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No! {{let me go}} to my own room,' murmured Ferdinand, in a faint voice. 'That room <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{said the}} day would come--oh! what did my mother say? Would there were only mother's love, and then I should not be here or thus.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I did {{not wait}} to hear what she said. I brushed past her, down the stairs. My heart was bursting--my flesh felt cold. I ran breathlessly and {{recklessly}} into the room <b>where</b> <b>my</b> father and <b>mother</b> had received me. They were both sitting there still. I ran up to them, wringing my hands, and crying out in a passion of tears: ...|$|R
6000|$|My dark {{mood was}} deepened into {{bitterness}} by <b>my</b> father's farm, <b>where</b> I found <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> imprisoned {{in a small}} cabin on the enormous sunburned, treeless plain, with no expectation of ever living anywhere else. Deserted by her sons and failing in health, she endured the discomforts of her life uncomplainingly-but my resentment of [...] "things as they are" [...] deepened during my talks with her neighbors, who were all housed in the same unshaded cabins in equal poverty and loneliness. The fact that at twenty-seven I was without power to aid <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> in any substantial way added to my despairing mood.|$|R
60|$|Her Ladyship sent up daily {{couriers}} {{to inquire}} after {{the health of}} Lord George; and, thinking to myself that she would probably be induced to come to Dublin {{if she were to}} hear that he was in danger, I managed to have her informed that he was in a precarious state; that he grew worse; that Redmond Barry had fled in consequence: of this flight I caused the Mercury newspaper to give notice also, but indeed it did not carry me beyond the town of Bray, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> dwelt; and where, under the difficulties of a duel, I might be sure of having a welcome.|$|R
6000|$|... "The other citizen {{also gave}} me five livres," [...] he said humbly. [...] "He lodges {{in the house}} <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is concierge. It is in the Rue de la Croix Blanche. He has been very kind to my mother. I would rather do as he bade me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Janette," [...] Lady Anne protested, [...] "why do you {{apologize}} for entering your own workshop? It is foolish, this. I go now, dear Julien, {{to put on}} my hat. You shall drive me to <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> is staying--the Ritz, I suppose? Afterwards you shall leave us. Wait in the street below. I shall be less than two minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grisell curtsied low, {{but still}} hung back, and Lord Warwick briefly explained. [...] "Daughter to Will Dacre of Whitburn, a staunch baron of the north. My mother {{bestowed}} her at Wilton, whence the {{creature of the}} Pope's intruding Abbess has taken upon him to expel her. So I am about {{to take her to}} Middleham, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> may see to her further bestowal." ...|$|E
6000|$|Where {{had they}} gone to, I wondered? To the priest's Heaven or Hell? Were they now telling their sins to some {{hard-faced}} angel while {{he checked the}} count from his book, reminding them of many that they had forgotten? Or were they fast asleep for ever and ever as a shrewd thinker whom I knew had told me secretly he was sure would be the fate of all of us, whatever the priests might teach and believe. And <b>where</b> was <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> whom I had loved and who loved me well, although outwardly she was so stern a woman, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> whom I had seen burned alive, singing as she burned? Oh! it was a vile world, and it seemed strange that God should cause {{men and women to}} be born that they might come to such cruel ends. Yet who were we to question His decrees of which we knew neither the beginning nor the finish? ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, after having been three years in Boston and six years absent from my old home in {{northern}} Iowa, I found myself with money enough to pay my railway fare to Ordway, South Dakota, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> father and <b>mother</b> were living, and as it cost very little extra to go by way of Dubuque and Charles City, I planned to visit Osage, Iowa, and the farm we had opened on Dry Run prairie in 1871.|$|R
60|$|At last, at the {{beginning}} of the week and at the end of my money, I bought passage to Wabasha and from there took train to a small town <b>where</b> some of <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> cousins lived. I had been in correspondence with one of them, a Mrs. Harris, and I landed at her door (after a glorious ride up through the hills, amid the most gorgeous autumn colors) with just three cents in my pocket--a poverty which you may be sure I did not publish to my relations who treated me with high respect and manifested keen interest in all my plans.|$|R
60|$|I {{found her}} {{down in the}} old {{neighborhood}} near the blueberry swamp, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> lived and where Lop-Ear and I had built our first tree-shelter. It was unexpected. As I came under the tree I heard the familiar soft sound and looked up. There she was, the Swift One, sitting on a limb and swinging her legs {{back and forth as}} she looked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "My father worships {{invisible}} deities," [...] she said, softly. [...] "Are you {{a visible}} deity? Has my mother sent you?" [...] She pointed {{as she spoke}} to the deserted hut behind them. [...] "You appear," [...] she went on, [...] "in the place <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> died. Is it for her sake that you show yourself to her child? Beautiful deity, come to the Temple--come to my father!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} this time that a slight {{defection}} arose {{on the part of}} Lop-Ear. He got into the habit of wandering off {{in the direction of the}} tree <b>where</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> lived. He had taken a liking to my vicious sister, and the Chatterer had come to tolerate him. Also, there were several other young people, progeny of the monogamic couples that lived in the neighborhood, and Lop-Ear played with these young people.|$|E
50|$|Clerk, who {{was old and}} ill, {{was unable}} to act as President. He {{resigned}} on 18 December, and Charles Goodall was appointed on 23 December 1708. He had been chosen treasurer on 16 April 1708, and retained that office {{as long as he}} lived. Clerk died at his house in Fenchurch Street in the autumn of 1714, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. In the annals of the college cited by William Munk the date of Clerk's death is given as 8 December, which is erroneous. His will was proved on 14 October. He desired 'to be decently, tho' very privately, buried by night in the vault in St. Olave Hart Street Church, <b>where</b> <b>my</b> honoured <b>mother</b> and <b>my</b> children lye, if it may be done with conveniency.' By his wife Abigail, who survived him, he left a daughter Elizabeth, married to Richard Wilshaw. Clerk's portrait is at the college.|$|R
6000|$|None {{the less}} I thought {{a good deal}} about birthdays that afternoon, and {{wondered}} how it was that we human beings can bear even to go on living between two such mysteries as {{the beginning and the end}} of life. <b>Where</b> was <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> now? <b>Where</b> was I but two-and-twenty years ago? What was all this [...] "Past," [...] this [...] "History," [...] of which I had heard so much and knew so little? Just a story? Better brains than mine have puzzled over these questions, and perhaps if I had studied the philosophers I should know the answers. In the evenings, wrapped up in a shawl, Pollie carried me downstairs, and we took a sober whispering walk in the hush and perfumes of the deserted garden. Loud rang the tongues of the water over the stones. The moths were fluttering to their trysts, and from some dark little coign the cricket strummed me a solo. Standing up there in the starry night the great house looked down on me like an elder brother, mute but compassionate.|$|R
5000|$|... ‚ÄúMy {{father is}} a Brooklyn-born weight-lifting Italian Roman Catholic who wields a pompadour and only drives a Cadillac. <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> is a kind, classic, 1950‚Äôs Brooklyn Jew who quit high school {{to work in a}} pencil factory.
