40|$|In the {{graduate}} thesis we treated different numeral systems {{with the emphasis}} on the history and introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system and Indian digits. For each of the <b>presented</b> numeral systems <b>we</b> represented their origin, development, important individuals and other contributions. In the chapter where <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> Hindu-Arabic numeral system <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> also important milestones of the implementation. In the practical part <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> also the algorithms for the conversion from the decimal numeral system into numeral systems with different basis. In addition, we also examined the algorithms for basic arithmetic operations...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduced}} a novel integral transform operator. We proved {{the existence and}} {{the uniqueness of the}} relatively new operator. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> some useful properties of the new operator. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> the application of this operator for solving some kind of fractional ordinary and partial differential equation containing some kind of singularity...|$|R
40|$|In my BSc thesis <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> model {{language}} Archimate and its practical use. Firstly, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> {{the language}} basics, its characteristics, structure and different viewpoints. Secondly, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> {{business information technology}} for mobile banking. <b>We</b> analyzed and <b>presented</b> {{software as a service}} and practical use of Archimate language and its viewpoints. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> the database and entity relationship diagram in Martin’s notation for mobile banking application {{from the side of the}} bank. In the next part, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> the process of logging into the mobile banking application and security, necessary at the login and during application management. There are many different ways of login. Security must be provided by the bank, as well as by application provider. The application cannot fully work without being connected to the bank, therefore, in the last part of the thesis we described all web services needed for proper operation of the application. Application users can perform the same procedures and processes through web services as they would do at the bank counter. The advantage being that the procedures and processes can be done any time, any day of the year. At the end, we stated conclusions in relation to the objectives set in the thesis...|$|R

40|$|A kind of {{parabolic}} equation {{was extended}} {{to the concept of}} fractional calculus. The resulting equation is, however, difficult to handle analytically. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>presented</b> the numerical solution via the explicit and the implicit schemes. <b>We</b> <b>presented</b> together the stability and convergence of this time-fractional parabolic equation with two difference schemes. The explicit and the implicit schemes in this case are stable under some conditions...|$|R
