Finnair CEO Pekka Vauramo currently has the role.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} the related tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids look {{very similar to}} sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
50|$|The {{components}} of a complex system may themselves be complex systems. For example, an economy <b>is</b> <b>made</b> up of organisations, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> up of people, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> up of cells - all of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> complex systems.|$|R

25|$|Most trace fossils {{are known}} from marine deposits. Essentially, {{there are two}} types of traces, either exogenic ones, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> on the surface of the {{sediment}} (such as tracks) or endogenic ones, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> within the layers of sediment (such as burrows).|$|R
5|$|Chicken is {{the most}} widely eaten meat in Israel, {{followed}} by turkey. Chicken is prepared in a multitude of ways, from simple oven-roasted chicken to elaborate casseroles with rich sauces such as date syrup, tomato sauce, etc. Examples include chicken casserole with couscous, inspired by Moroccan Jewish cooking, chicken with olives, a Mediterranean classic, and chicken albondigas (meat balls) in tomato sauce, from Jerusalem Sephardi cuisine. Albondigas are also prepared from ground meat., similar to albogindas is the more popular Kufta <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> of minced meat, herbs and spices and cooked with tomato sauce, date syrup, pomegranate syrup or tamarind syrup with vegetables or beans.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E

Greater dragonlances are blessed with the power of Good, unlike lesser dragonlances.|$|R
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered {{much of the}} North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing {{several areas}} to revert to sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Other {{antioxidants}} are not {{obtained from}} the diet, but instead {{are made in the}} body. For example, ubiquinol (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the mevalonate pathway. Another example is glutathione, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, glycine and glutamic acid before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as acetylcysteine can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.|$|E
5|$|Singapore {{inherited}} a Westminster {{system of government}} from the British. In such systems, there is an overlap between the executive and legislative branches of government. The head of state, who is the President of Singapore, {{is a member of}} both the executive Government of Singapore and the Parliament of Singapore but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies {{in the hands of the}} Cabinet, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> up of the Prime Minister of Singapore (the head of government) and other Ministers. At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also Members of Parliament (MPs).|$|E

5|$|The Government of Massachusetts {{is divided}} into three branches: Executive, Legislative, and Judicial. The {{governor}} of Massachusetts heads the executive branch; duties of the governor include signing or vetoing legislation, filling judicial and agency appointments, granting pardons, preparing an annual budget, and commanding the Massachusetts National Guard. Massachusetts governors, unlike those of most other states, are addressed as His/Her Excellency. The current governor is Charlie Baker, a Republican from Swampscott. The executive branch also includes the Executive Council, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> up of eight elected councilors and the Lieutenant Governor seat, which is currently occupied by Karyn Polito.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> up of the President and the Cabinet of Singapore. Although the President acts in her {{personal}} discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore, her role is largely ceremonial. It is the Cabinet, composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E
5|$|The Hubble Space Telescope {{has been}} used to provide convincing {{observational}} evidence of this stellar mass-sorting process in globular clusters. Heavier stars slow down and crowd at the cluster's core, while lighter stars pick up speed and tend to spend more time at the cluster's periphery. The globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> up of about 1 million stars, is one of the densest globular clusters in the Southern Hemisphere. This cluster was subjected to an intensive photographic survey, which allowed astronomers to track the motion of its stars.

5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} of Tawaf {{is followed by}} two Rakaat prayers at the Place of Abraham (Muqam Ibrahim), a site near the Kaaba inside the mosque. However, again because of large crowds during the days of Hajj, they may instead pray anywhere in the mosque. After prayer, pilgrims also drink water from the Zamzam well, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> available in coolers throughout the Mosque.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is in the}} West Branch Pine Creek {{drainage}} basin, {{where the}} underlying rocks are primarily conglomerate, sandstone, and shale. Two major rock formations are present in Cherry Springs State Park, both at least partly from the Carboniferous period. The youngest of these, which forms the highest points in the park, is the early Pennsylvanian Pottsville Formation, a gray conglomerate that may contain sandstone, siltstone, and shale, as well as anthracite coal. The lower formation is the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> of relatively soft grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. Outside the park the creek has cut down into the Devonian Catskill Formation, a reddish sandstone.|$|E
