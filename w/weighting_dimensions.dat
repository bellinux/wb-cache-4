40|$|We {{develop a}} fast variational {{approximation}} scheme for Gaussian process (GP) regression, where {{the spectrum of}} the covariance function is subjected to a sparse approximation. Our approach enables uncertainty in covariance function hyperparameters to be treated without using Monte Carlo methods and is robust to overfitting. Our article makes three contributions. First, we present a variational Bayes algorithm for fitting sparse spectrum GP regression models that uses nonconjugate variational message passing to derive fast and efficient updates. Second, we propose a novel adaptive neighbourhood technique for obtaining predictive inference that is effective in dealing with nonstationarity. Regression is performed locally at each point to be predicted and the neighbourhood is determined using a measure defined based on lengthscales estimated from an initial fit. <b>Weighting</b> <b>dimensions</b> according to lengthscales, this downweights variables of little relevance, leading to automatic variable selection and improved prediction. Third, we introduce a technique for accelerating convergence in nonconjugate variational message passing by adapting step sizes {{in the direction of}} the natural gradient of the lower bound. Our adaptive strategy can be easily implemented and empirical results indicate significant speedups. Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E

40|$|International audienceMild thermal {{treatments}} (below 160 °C) {{are increasingly}} {{considered as a}} mean to accelerate some beneficial effects of wood ageing. In this work, treatments were done in a pressurized reactor which has controlled conditions of temperature and relative humidity. We performed 5 treatments, each one applied to poplar (for study of dimensional stability in view of panel paintings applications) and to spruce (for study of axial and radial acoustic properties in view of musical applications). Three groups were treated at 150 °C with, respectively, 0 % (constant) relative humidity (RH), 25 % constant RH, and cyclic variations between these 2 RH. The same protocol was applied to three other groups at a temperature of 130 °C. The oven-dry <b>weight,</b> <b>dimensions</b> and colorimetric properties and the air-dry (3 weeks at 20 °C and 65 % RH) <b>weight,</b> <b>dimensions</b> and viscoelastic vibrational properties were measured before and after treatment. Intermediate data were also measured {{in the course of the}} treatments for <b>weight,</b> <b>dimensions</b> and colorimetric properties, in order to model the kinetics of modification. Although oven-dry weight loss were moderate (maximum 4 %) in these relatively mild conditions, properties were significantly improved. Moisture sorption and swelling/shrinkage were significantly reduced, as well as vibration damping, without negative effects of the rigidity. The effect of reconditioning at high relative humidity was also investigated...|$|R

40|$|Yield, {{fruit and}} stone <b>weight</b> and <b>dimensions</b> were studied in 24 apricot cultivars over a {{four-year}} period, to determine components of variability, heritability and genetic and phenotypic correlations. The {{analysis of the}} components of total variance evidenced that genetic differences between cultivars determined to the highest percentage the variability of fruit height and stone <b>weight</b> and <b>dimensions,</b> whereas the variation of yield, and fruit weight, breadth and thickness was predominantly determined by ecological factors. The values of heritability coefficients, in a broader sense, were found to be relatively high for fruit and stone <b>weight</b> and <b>dimensions</b> (88 - 93 %), and medium for yield (48 %). It was established by correlation analysis that all genetic and phenotypic coefficients of correlation between fruit and stone <b>weight</b> and <b>dimensions</b> were positive and statistically very significant.
