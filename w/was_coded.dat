5|$|Bond's number—007—was {{assigned}} by Fleming {{in reference to}} one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: {{the breaking of the}} German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> 0075, and {{which was one of the}} factors that led to the US entering the war.|$|E
5|$|The game {{took the}} form of a ROM hack of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Chrono Trigger. It <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> using Chrono Trigger ROM editing software, and was meant to be played on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System emulator. The {{finished}} game was intended to be released as a patch file in the IPS (International Patching System) format, so as to avoid illegal distribution of a full Chrono Trigger ROM.|$|E
5|$|When Bédard {{joined the}} project, the game {{focused on the}} 2D–3D {{mechanic}} and {{did not yet have}} open world ambitions. He coded the game in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. His first task, the level editor Fezzer, <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> from scratch in XNA and inspired by SketchUp. Bédard also wrote the game engine, Trixel Technology, which turns 2D tiles ("triles") into sides of a 3D cube pixel. The engine tracks player-character Gomez in 3D space even though the game behaves as a 2D platformer. Bédard also built the game to resolve collisions when converting between 3D and 2D space.|$|E
30|$|In Fig. 7, {{there are}} four flows. According to EMCC, flow 1 and flow 3 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 6, while flow 2 and flow 4 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 9. Besides, flow 1 intersects with flow 2 at node 12. And there are UI(12,flow 1) = { 7 }, UI(12,flow 2) = { 8 }, 11 ∈N(5), 13 ∈N(10). That {{is to say that}} {{condition}} (1) and (2) are not satisfied. According to EMCC, flow 1 and flow 2 cannot <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 12. Nevertheless, flow 1 and flow 2 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 12 actually, since node 11 and node 13 can get native packet successfully through decoding. Therefore, two flows satisfied with (1) and (2) of EMCC can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together. But two flows which can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together at intersecting node might not satisfy the (1) and (2) of EMCC. In other words, if two flows can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> together, it <b>is</b> not necessary that (1) and (2) of EMCC hold, which is sufficient not necessary.|$|R
50|$|When {{a summary}} is given for a feature users are {{displayed}} both {{with information on}} how many languages <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> as that value exclusively or as shared. There are for example 61% languages in APiCS that <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> as exclusively having the order SVO, and 10 that <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> as having that order and other orders as well (shared).|$|R

25|$|The group {{returns to}} the arena still in full-dive where Kirito, now OS's top-ranked player, dispatches the bosses with his new sword as Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the server room of Argus (the defunct company that ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' {{memories}} and fades out of existence since she <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> from the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill their promise they made {{to each other in}} Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together. Asuna returns Kirito's engagement ring so to properly put it on her hand, which he does.|$|E
25|$|Beams 2 through 9 were {{projected}} in horizontal array; 10 through 17 (although 10 actually lies in {{the horizontal}} row) were grouped as the vertical component. All beams of each group were powered simultaneously. Except for being controlled by a master timing signal, {{each of the eight}} channels operated independently of the others. Each transmitter was on a slightly different frequency to prevent interaction with the others. The transmitted pulse, 2000 microseconds long, <b>was</b> <b>coded,</b> or tagged, by being passed through a tapped delay line which may reversed the phase at 20-microsecond intervals. Upon reception the returned signal was passed through the same tapped delay line and compressed 100:1, to 20 microseconds in order to increase the accuracy and resolution of the range measurement, which was of course a function of the interval between transmission and return.|$|E
25|$|There {{was only}} one mass-produced {{derivative}} of the PS1, this was the coach variant with drop-frame extension for a luggage boot. This <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> PS1/1, and {{was a very strong}} seller, forming the major postwar fleet renewals for large UK coach firms such as Southdown Motor Services, Ribble, Wallace Arnold, Grey-Green and Barton Transport. Sales of the PS1 only ended in 1950 although it was nominally replaced by the PS2 on the home market from 1948, this gives an idea of the scale of advance orders for this coach. Many coachbuilers worldwide produced bodies on the Tiger PS, as the model was introduced at the all-time peak in demand for new buses and coaches few operators could get the body of their first choice within an acceptable time. Barton got most of its coaches fitted with Duple bodies but built its own body for its 490 (HVO729), to an American outline with shallow full-depth sliding side glazing. Wallace Arnold bought over a Leeds coachbuilder, Wilks and Meade, in 1942 to get enough bodies reserved for postwar reconstruction. Between 1946 and 1950 Wallace Arnold took 37 PS1, 11 PS2, 34 Bedford OB, 24 AEC Regals, ten Daimler CVD6 and one Guy Arab, a fairly typical sample of coach-buying preferences at the time. Southdown used six coachbuiilders on its all-Tiger coach fleet. Whilst Ribble refitted its later prewar Tiger coaches (which had previously been petrol-engined) with PS1 running units as well as taking PS1/1s.|$|E
30|$|In Fig. 6 a, flow 1 {{and flow}} 2 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 7, while flow 3 and flow 4 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 13, {{according}} to MCC. Since flow 2 and flow 3 <b>are</b> both <b>coded</b> flows, and for node 9 {{there are no}} upstream node to extract the intended native packet for node 9, there should <b>be</b> no <b>coding</b> opportunity at node 9 according to GCC. However, it is obvious from Fig. 6 a that flow 3 and flow 4 can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> at node 9 and each flow can obtain its native packet eventually.|$|R

500|$|One of the German {{documents}} {{cracked and}} {{read by the}} British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> 0075, and {{which was one of}} the factors that led to the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified and, as journalist Ben Macintyre has pointed out, [...] "to anyone versed in intelligence history, 007 signified the highest achievement of British military intelligence." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{praised the}} game's graphics, sound, and gameplay, but criticized its short span. Chahi, working for 16 {{hours a day}} for two months, responded with {{creating}} a new level just before the amphitheatre scene, when the alien friend rescues Lester {{at the end of a}} long dead-end corridor. Chahi said: [...] "I like this extra level a lot because it reinforces the close relationship between the hero and the alien by developing their mutual aid." [...] Also added were more dangers and more save points. This ended up being the 1992 DOS version, which <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> by Daniel Morais, and had the exact code wheel protection of the Amiga and ST versions. The Macintosh features higher resolution than the DOS version, but is otherwise identical.|$|E
500|$|A Secret Service agent, Bond was a {{composite}} {{based on a}} number of commandos whom author Ian Fleming had known during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during World War II, to whom he added his own style and a number of his own tastes. Fleming appropriated the name from American ornithologist James Bond. Bond's code number 007 comes from one of British naval intelligence's key achievements of World War I: the breaking of the German diplomatic code. One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram, which <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> 0075, and {{which was one of the}} factors that led the US entering the war. Subsequently, if material was graded 00 it meant it was highly classified. Fleming later told a journalist, [...] "When I was at the Admiralty... all the top-secret signals had the double-0 prefix... and I decided to borrow it for Bond".|$|E

30|$|The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} can be represented by a graph G(V,E), where V represents the set of sensor nodes and E represents the set of wireless links between nodes in the network. For any node v, the set of nodes with direct link to v is denoted by N(v), also called neighbor set of node v. If a node v belongs to a flow f, we say that v∈f. The packet that <b>is</b> not <b>coded</b> <b>is</b> called native packet, while the packet that has <b>been</b> <b>coded</b> <b>is</b> called <b>coded</b> packet. The node at which the network <b>coding</b> <b>is</b> carried on <b>is</b> called <b>coding</b> node. If there <b>is</b> no <b>coding</b> node on one flow, the flow is called native flow, otherwise it <b>is</b> called <b>coded</b> flow.|$|R
50|$|The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) classifies {{higher and}} further {{education}} courses using {{a more detailed}} framework using letter codes based on the original FHEQ. This separates postgraduate courses into research and taught, based on the largest component in terms of student effort. Doctorate-level courses <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> D for research and E for taught; master's-level courses <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> M for taught (including integrated master's courses) and L for research. Honours-level courses <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> H and non-honours bachelor's-level courses I (across {{the whole of the}} UK, not just Scotland, thus splitting level 6 on the England, Wales and Northern Ireland framework). Foundation degree/HND/DipHE-level qualifications <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> J and HNC/CertHE-level C.|$|R
500|$|The CD-I version <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> by Ashley Hogg. He {{stated that}} there were {{problems}} that only occurred on this console, and CD-Rs were expensive. The Game Gear team were originally against the [...] "on-rails" [...] handling of the Mega Drive version, and wanted to revert to the NES drifting. The Game Gear version was created by Ashley Routledge and Dave Saunders, who adjusted the Mega Drive graphics to the Game Gear's smaller screen. It was produced alongside the Mega Drive version, and programmed from scratch to run at 60 frames per second (FPS). The main problem was keeping as much detail as possible on the Game Gear's inferior storage and memory capabilities. Much of the art had to be redrawn with fewer colours at lower resolutions. The biggest problem was the screen size, which {{made it difficult to}} take corners at high speeds. The team tweaked the camera movement so the vehicle was positioned further back, so players were able to see the track ahead according to how fast the vehicle is travelling. Another thing considered important was the lack of options screens, as it was felt players should be able to [...] simply play the game.|$|E
500|$|The ROM hacking entailed assembly-level {{changes to}} the game code. Young equated the process to {{teaching}} someone another language by slowly altering their DNA bit by bit, through trial and error. Some of the technical changes included proportional fonts, graphics hacks, and custom software. The game <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> {{in such a way}} that there was not enough system memory available to display the requisite onscreen text. Since Japanese characters all occupy the same amount of space (monospaced), the team had to custom-code the new English characters to fit properly. Tomato said that [...] "no text display routine wound up untouched", such that the fixes for variable width fonts were useless until the team manually made room for the characters. Graphics hacks included the new intro screen and images imported from the English EarthBound, so as to preserve continuity of features. For example, an octopus statue pun from Mother 2 was converted to a pencil statue in the EarthBound English localization and was changed accordingly in the Mother 3 localization. The team also built custom software to aid in the translation, such as a cross-assembler and tools for handling the script and patching. Members of the hacking team included Tomato, Jeffman, byuu, and sblur, among others.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{important}} differences between APiCS and World Atlas of Language Structures, {{as well as other}} earlier surveys of languages, is that APiCS allows for languages to <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> for more than one strategy. For example, in the WALS there is one feature for the order of Subject, Object and Verb. Each language in WALS <b>is</b> <b>coded</b> as having one of the orders, or [...] "no dominant order". In APiCS there is a mirror feature, but here each language can <b>be</b> <b>coded</b> for having more than one order and the distribution is given in percentages. The language Media Lengua for example <b>is</b> <b>coded</b> as having 30% SVO and 70% SOV.|$|R
50|$|At {{least two}} more forms, GAD25 and GAD44 (embryonic; EGAD) are {{described}} in the developing brain. They <b>are</b> <b>coded</b> by the alternative transcripts of GAD1, I-80 and I-86: GAD25 <b>is</b> <b>coded</b> by both, GAD44 - only by I-80.|$|R

2500|$|Until {{the late}} 1960s, the Kingswood and Premier {{were sold in}} South Africa as Holdens, before the demise of Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impala and Chevelle, {{which led to the}} {{introduction}} of the Chevrolet Kommando and Chevrolet Constantia, which were based on the HG, and later HQ Kingswoods using either Holden's [...] straight-six, [...] V8, or later the Chevrolet [...] six. The Constantia name was in reference to the grand Groot Constantia wine estate, with its world-famous gabled Cape-Dutch homestead featuring as the model's emblem, while Kommando referred to the Boer Commando squads during the Anglo-Boer War. The South African version of the HQ <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> AQ, and was very similar to the Chevrolet 350 sold by Chevrolet/Vauxhall dealers in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesigned}} WJ 1999 Grand Cherokee shared just 127parts {{with its}} predecessor (mostly fasteners). The European model <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> WG. The spare tire was relocated {{from the side}} of the cargo compartment to under the floor. (Like the 1998 ZJ, the rear tailgate glass opened separately.) The two heavy pushrod V8 engines were replaced by Chrysler's then-new PowerTech. The new V8 engine produced less torque than the old pushrods, but was lighter, offered better fuel economy, and provided similar on road performance figures (the 23-gallon fuel tank was replaced with one of a 20.5-gallon capacity). The straight-six engine was also updated in 1999. A redesign of the intake manifold added [...] While other Jeep vehicles used the Mopar 5 x 4.5 bolt circle, this was the first Jeep following the 1987 Chrysler buyout to receive a wider bolt pattern:– 5 x 5.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike the IBM PC, {{which uses}} 8 kB of system ROM for {{power-on}} self-test (POST) and basic input/output system (BIOS), the Mac ROM is significantly larger (64 kB) and holds key OS code. Much {{of the original}} Mac ROM <b>was</b> <b>coded</b> by Andy Hertzfeld, {{a member of the}} original Macintosh team. He was able to conserve precious ROM space by writing routines in assembly language code optimized with [...] "hacks," [...] or clever programming tricks. In addition to the ROM, he also coded the kernel, the Macintosh Toolbox, and some of the desktop accessories (DAs). The icons of the operating system, which represent folders and application software, were designed by Susan Kare, who later designed the icons for Microsoft Windows 3.0. Bruce Horn and Steve Capps wrote the Macintosh Finder, {{as well as a number}} of Macintosh system utilities.|$|E
