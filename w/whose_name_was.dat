5|$|Hemlock Hoax, the Detective is an American short comedy film {{produced}} and distributed in 1910 by the Lubin Manufacturing Company.

5|$|Hun is {{familiar}} in 8th and 9th century England, for instance {{as part of}} a name with two elements. During the 9th century there were East Anglian bishops of Helmham named Ælfhun, Hunferthus and Hunbeorht and a bishop of Worcester called Æthelhun. Hun also occurred {{as part of a}} moneyer's name. There are several placenames in England that contain the term as a personal name element, such as Hunsdon, Hertfordshire and Hunston, West Sussex (but not Hunston, Suffolk). It is possible that Hun was a historical figure, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> run together with Beonna's by a scribe.|$|E

5|$|Warner Bros. cast 15-year-old Bonita Granville {{to portray}} Nancy, and {{utilized}} the same three-lead system that Torchy Blane used; John Litel portrayed Nancy's father, Carson Drew; and Frankie Thomas portrayed Ned Nickerson, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> changed to Ted {{to help the}} series be more up-to-date and mainstream. However, also like Torchy, the series retained several recurring characters: Renie Riano portrayed housekeeper Effie Schneider, while Frank Orth portrayed bumbling police captain, Captain Tweedy.

5|$|Soegija {{was born}} on 25November 1896 in Surakarta to Karijosoedarmo, an abdi dalem (courtier) at the Sunanate of Surakarta, and his wife Soepiah. The family was abangan Muslim, and Soegija's {{grandfather}} Soepa was a kyai; Soegija followed their religion. Soegija– <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> derived from the Javanese word , meaning rich– was the fifth of nine children. The family later moved to Ngabean, Yogyakarta. There, Karijosoedarmo began {{to serve as a}} courtier at the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat to Sultan HamengkubuwonoVII, while his wife sold fish; despite this, the family was poor and sometimes had little food. Soegija was a daring child, quick to fight, skilled at football, and noted for his intellect from a young age. While Soegija was still young, his father made him fast in accordance with Islamic law.|$|E

5|$|When {{the second}} {{version of the}} story was {{translated}} into English by Michael Turner and Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper, they made a number of alterations to the text. For instance, Monsieur Tom Hawake, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> a pun on tomahawk, was renamed Mr. Maurice Oyle, and the Slift factory was renamed Grynd Corp. Other changes were made to render the story more culturally understandable to an Anglophone readership; whereas the factory originally sold its mix of dogs, cats, and rats as hare pâté—a food uncommon in Britain—the English translation rendered the mix as salami. In another instance, garlic, pepper, and salt were added to the mixture in the French version, but this was changed to mustard, pepper, and salt for the English version, again reflecting British culinary tastes.|$|E
5|$|While the Picts and Scots {{would have}} {{remained}} pagan, most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after {{the departure of}} the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves and retreated as the Anglo-Saxons advanced north. Their gods included Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife. However, despite growing evidence of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (<b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E

5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (<b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E

The tour was divided into five segments: French Baroque-Marie Antionette Revival, Military-Army, Circus-Cabaret, Acoustic and Scottish-Tribal. The tour garnered positive reception from contemporary critics. The tour was chronicled in the documentary titled I'm Going to Tell You a Secret. Originally called The Re-Invented Process {{in reference to the}} world tour it documents and the exhibition, it was filmed during Madonna's visit to North America and Europe during May 24 to September 14, 2004, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund. Critical response towards the documentary was mixed, with one group of reviewers complimenting the live performances from the tour and the scenes involving her children and family, while others criticized the self-indulgent nature of the documentary and the preaching nature of Madonna's commentary in the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland can {{probably}} be {{found among the}} soldiers and ordinary Roman citizens {{in the vicinity of}} Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the 4th century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) which existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians. After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> <b>was</b> appropriated for the spring festival of Easter.
