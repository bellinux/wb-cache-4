Playing amiable pig farmer [...] "Pig" [...] Finn brought Nesbitt to international attention, particularly in the United States (where the film was released as Waking Ned Devine); the cast was nominated for the 1999 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Theatrical Motion Picture. In 1999, he appeared as the paramilitary [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Billy Wilson in The Most Fertile Man in Ireland (Dudi Appleton). The following year, he appeared in Declan Lowney's feature debut, Wild About Harry. Lowney had personally asked him {{to appear in the}} supporting role of cross-dressing Unionist politician Walter Adair. In 2001, he made his debut as a lead actor in a feature film in Peter Cattaneo's Lucky Break. He played Jimmy Hands, an incompetent bank robber who masterminds an escape from a prison by staging a musical as a distraction. On preparing for the role, Nesbitt said, [...] "Short of robbing a bank there wasn't much research I could have done but we did spend a day in Wandsworth Prison and that showed the nightmare monotony of prisoners' lives. I didn't interview any of the inmates because I {{thought it would be a}} little patronising as it was research for a comedy and also because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> every night in our fancy cars to sleep in our fancy hotels." [...] The film was a commercial failure, despite receiving good feedback from test audiences in the United States.|$|E

Hurrah!" [...] and he threw up his cap, and was joined in the shout {{by more than one}} of the youngsters around, for Richard and most of the elders were escorting the Queen out of the park, and Mistress Susan had been summoned on some question of household stuff. Cis, however, stood leaning against the balustrade, over which she had leant for the last glance exchanged with her mother, her face hidden in her hands and kerchief, weeping bitterly, feeling as if all the glory and excitement of the last few weeks had vanished as a dream and left her to the dreary dulness of common life, as little insignificant Cis Talbot again.|$|R

60|$|In {{a kind of}} {{way every}} one may see it, but {{what you see is}} not really it, but only the light in the windows. You see the light after Lock-out Time. David, for instance, saw it quite {{distinctly}} far away among the trees as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> from the pantomime, and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple, which is the name of his father's office. Angela Clare, who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop, saw more than one light, she saw hundreds of them all together; and this must have been the fairies building the house, for they build it every night, and always in {{a different part of the}} Gardens. She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others, though she was not quite sure, for they jumped about so, and it might have been another one that was bigger. But if it was the same one, it was Peter Pan's light. Heaps of children have seen the light, so that is nothing. But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built.|$|E
5000|$|Favoritism {{of colors}} varies widely. Often {{societal}} influences {{will have a}} direct impact on what colors we favor and disdain. In the West, the color black symbolizes mourning and sadness, red symbolizes anger and violence, white symbolizes purity and peace, and yellow symbolizes joy and luck (other colors lack a consistent meaning). From a recent study, it was discussed that associative learning is the process where an individual develops color preferences. In different countries, color preference vary. In China, red indicates luck, while in Nigeria and Germany it means the exact opposite. An excerpt from Isaac H. Godlove describes American views on color:"In recent years, these troublous times have made some of us chronically blue. Our business was in the red. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> with a dark brown taste in the mouth. We were unable to look through the old rose-tinted glasses to see the yellow-golden flood again flowing our way. The purple depression had us contemplating black mourning for dying business, departed bank accounts and profits. But we took a hitch in our belts and carried on, waiting for the rosy dawn, for we lacked the yellow streak. We toned up our product, gave it a more healthy complexion, made it more attractive; put more color spice into our sales appeal." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the decades}} prior to 1914, Watch Tower Society {{publications}} claimed that Armageddon {{would take place}} in 1914.

Many Bible Students believed they would be sent to heaven in 1914. At a convention at Saratoga Springs, New York, on September 27-30, Macmillan, believing that [...] "the church was [...] "going home" [...] in October", he announced that [...] "This is probably the last public address I shall ever deliver because <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> soon."

A.H.Macmillan, September 30, 1914Faith On The March, page 46 Following the convention, at a meeting at the Brooklyn headquarters, Russell announced: [...] "The Gentile Times have ended; their kings have had their day," [...] and added that, [...] "At 10:30 Sunday morning Brother Macmillan will give us an address." [...] Those present laughed about Macmillan's previous announcement of his [...] "last public address"; in the subsequent talk, Macmillan acknowledged, [...] "some of us had been a bit too hasty in thinking that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to heaven right away". Despite his expectations for October 1914, Macmillan remained committed to the Watch Tower Society.|$|R
