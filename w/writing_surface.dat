25|$|Rollerball pens {{employ the}} same ballpoint mechanics, {{but with the}} use of {{water-based}} inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the <b>writing</b> <b>surface.</b> Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to smearing—posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing right-to-left script)—and running, should the <b>writing</b> <b>surface</b> become wet.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} of these components {{can be compared}} with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ball point tip delivers the ink to the <b>writing</b> <b>surface</b> while acting as a buffer between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.|$|E

25|$|Although {{designs and}} {{construction}} vary between brands, basic {{components of a}}ll ballpoint pens are universal. Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the <b>writing</b> <b>surface),</b> a socket holding the ball in place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E

2500|$|Ballpoint pens with [...] "erasable ink" [...] were {{pioneered by}} the Paper Mate pen company. The ink {{formulas}} of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to rubber cement, allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the <b>writing</b> <b>surface</b> before drying and eventually becoming permanent. Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow—meaning {{they can also}} write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.|$|E

2500|$|A wax tablet is {{a tablet}} {{made of wood}} {{and covered with a}} layer of wax, often linked loosely to a cover tablet, as a [...] "double-leaved" [...] diptych. [...] It was used as a {{reusable}} and portable [...] <b>writing</b> <b>surface</b> in Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages. Cicero's letters make passing reference to the use of cerae, and some examples of wax-tablets have been preserved in waterlogged deposits in the Roman fort at Vindolanda on Hadrian's Wall. Medieval wax tablet books are on display in several European museums.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the scroll, wax tablets were commonly used in Antiquity as a <b>writing</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] Diptychs and later polyptych formats were often hinged together along one edge, analogous to the spine of modern books, {{as well as a}} folding concertina format. [...] Such a set of simple wooden boards sewn together was called by the Romans a codex (pl. codices)—from the Latin word caudex, meaning [...] "the trunk" [...] of a tree, around the first century AD. Two ancient polyptychs, a pentaptych and octoptych, excavated at Herculaneum employed a unique connecting system that presages later sewing on thongs or cords.|$|E

They were also sometimes written on tomb walls, stelae, canopic chests, papyri and mummy masks. Due to the limited <b>writing</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{of some of these}} objects, the spells were often abbreviated, giving rise to long and short versions, some of which were later copied in the Book of the Dead.|$|R
2500|$|Amate {{paper was}} created {{as part of}} a line of {{technologies}} to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the Olmecs and Maya through a form of hieroglyphic writing. Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials. In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a <b>writing</b> <b>surface,</b> especially in the production of chronicles and the keeping of records such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into [...] "books" [...] by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and are made of bark paper. These include the Dresden Codex from the Yucatán, the Fejérváry-Mayer Codex from the Mixteca region and the Borgia Codex from Oaxaca.|$|E
2500|$|Some spodomantic rituals {{require the}} use of a certain <b>writing</b> <b>surface.</b> Most of the rituals {{outlined}} above indicate the use of the hearth, floor, or exterior ground as the place to spread ashes. But some examples of spodomancy call for the use of other types of surfaces. Consider the use of bone: Divination techniques closely related to spodomancy include osteomancy (divination using bones, particularly that practice which heats them to produce cracks which are portentious), plastromancy (divination using turtle plastrons), scapulimancy (divination using the shoulder blade; the Scottish term is slinneanachd), and sternomancy (divination using the sternum). However, in these practices, fire is used to cause cracks to appear in the bone. Ash {{may or may not be}} used to fill in these cracks, making them more visible. [...] This is not spodomancy, however, as the cracks (not the ash itself) are being read. [...] In Mongolia, however, a divinatory ritual exists in which scapulimancy and spodomancy are combined: A smooth layer of ashes is spread on the shoulder blade of a cow, sheep, or ox, and a lama is divinely inspired to make calculations in the ash which indicate answers to questions or the future. Bone is not the only alternative surface used. Some ancient Greek rituals of spodomancy required that the ashes be spread on a plank of wood rather than the floor.|$|E

Elas-tomeric gratings were molded from holographically <b>written</b> <b>surface</b> relief gratings in an azobenzene sol-gel material.

A novel finite-deformation theory was found to match the device response excellently, without fitting parameters. The results clearly show that the grating underwent pure-shear deformation, and more surprisingly, that the mechanical properties of the electro-active substrate did not affect device actuation...|$|R
