5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially {{believed that they}} <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> transit through Russia, {{on their way to}} the Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> somebody’s house." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wear the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E

500|$|Mullen and The Edge both {{agreed that}} playing the Sarajevo concert {{had been the}} {{highlight}} of their careers; Mullen said, [...] "here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono described it as [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life", saying of the audience, [...] "I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve." [...] He also speculated that the loss of his voice had [...] "allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it happen. And they did." [...] After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, [...] "it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment". Following the concert, President Izetbegović presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2004 Daymond told WHAMMO.com.au [...] "I think [...] {{knew that}} we were looking to do {{something}} a little different. As a company they'd just gone through some major infrastructure changes {{in the last few years}} and I think by talking to us and realising that we were maybe not as happy as we were on the label when we signed – that the label had changed a lot and the roster was completely different". In an interview for Rolling Stone in May 2011, Thornton told music journalist, Andrew McMillen, that the band's manager at the time [...] "couldn’t be fucked fighting the label for anything that we wanted, and he'd made the decision that we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go with whatever the label reckoned. Near the end, it was fucking soul-destroying for me".|$|E
2500|$|Plans for {{producing}} two sequels {{of the original}} film were announced by the original film's creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted {{two of them to}} be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist Kurt Russell and James Spader in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. [...] "They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [...] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely." [...] These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by SG-1 and Atlantis if they are ever produced.|$|E

2500|$|Dixon {{had worked}} with Brian Higgins, of Xenomania, on her {{previous}} single, [...] "Knockdown", but it failed to enter the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, resulting in Dixon being dropped by her record label, Polydor Records. In early 2007, still with no recording contract, Dixon {{received a phone call}} from Higgins, who asked if she would like to continue working together. Dixon stated, [...] "The plan was to make the whole record with Brian without talking to any record labels, we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> wait until we had made something special and then approach people with a finished album." [...] However Dixon's profile was raised when she signed up to compete in Strictly Come Dancing, which she eventually won. Soon afterwards, Dixon signed a deal with Asylum Records. [...] "The Boy Does Nothing", by this time already written, was originally intended to be a jazz orientated track, but Dixon and Higgins decided to change the genre, incorporating mambo influences, due to her experience on Strictly Come Dancing. Dixon described the song as [...] "a very tongue-in-cheek record" [...] and Higgins likened the song to [...] "bottled happiness".|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, EastEnders made {{headlines}} in the UK press after they screened a kiss between Kelly and Zoe. The storyline was featured in a New Year's Eve episode that was filmed on-location in Scotland. In the storyline, a group of teenagers travel from London to Scotland for New Year's Eve, but their minibus crashes, leaving them stranded and injured on the freezing cold Scottish moors. While stranded, Kelly cares for an injured Zoe, they become over-emotional, and kiss. Kinsella explained the reasons behind the kiss: [...] "They're stuck in the hills, thinking they're going to die—it's {{a way of saying}} goodbye and also of showing how much they love each other as friends. Which is quite sweet really." [...] She claimed that the kiss was made easier {{due to the fact that}} she was kissing her off-screen best friend: [...] "That made it so much easier. We thought we <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be laughing and giggling the whole way through, but we were very professional. It was so cold that we just wanted to get it over with. We were shaking from cold—not from nerves—and it was raining, so we just thought, 'Let's do it and get it done with'. [...] We laugh about it now. When it came down to it, the truth was that it was just like any other screen kiss." [...] The episode featuring their kiss attracted [...] 9.5million viewers, and the precise moment that they kissed was watched by 44% of the available viewing audience.|$|E
