5|$|Minority Report {{presents}} {{a future of}} increasing electronic surveillance, personalized advertising, and it analyzes the role of media in a future state where electronic advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of the broken family.

The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500people left the island during a repatriation of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The repatriation <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. It is the least-populated country in Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{support for}} General Franco <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> several factors, {{including}} as {{a distraction from}} Hitler's central European strategy, {{and the creation of}} a Fascist Spain friendly to Germany to threaten France.

5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we describe an action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense we do {{so in order to}} deny either that the relevant agent <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E

5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, however, {{it appears}} that the ships were well-handled and commanded. Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> either humanitarian concerns or (at the very least) pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population. This has, however, caused a historiographical argument among scholars that persists to this day.|$|E

5|$|Fleming and {{the judge}} {{who presided over the}} trial each spoke with her; both argued that they did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that Washington was illiterate, and that all {{attempts}} to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching, although many disliked that his body was mutilated. She determined that the mob was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and that he <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> her domineering attitude towards him.|$|E
5|$|Given that Gadge is {{revealed}} {{to actually be}} a witch, Howick asked Shearsmith whether the former's character, Thomas, truly had witnessed Gadge engaging {{in some kind of}} supernatural activity. Shearsmith suggested that Thomas <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> greed. However, he begins to regret his choice when he witnesses Gadge being tortured. Pemberton, though, noted that the real-life accusations of witchcraft must have been based on some level of belief.|$|E
5|$|In 1891, a {{diplomatic}} crisis emerged in Chile, {{otherwise known as}} the Baltimore Crisis. The American minister to Chile, Patrick Egan, granted asylum to Chileans who were seeking refuge during the 1891 Chilean Civil War. Egan, previously a militant Irish immigrant to the U.S., <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> a personal desire to thwart Great Britain's influence in Chile; his action increased tensions between Chile and the United States, {{which began in the}} early 1880s when Secretary Blaine had alienated the Chileans in the War of the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defences, it doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police. The Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved from January 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win support from the European Community (EC) and the United States for Croatia, and he disregarded advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuđman's stance <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.|$|E
5|$|Insane Clown President: Dispatches {{from the}} 2016 Circus is a non-fiction book by Matt Taibbi about Donald Trump and the 2016 United States presidential election.

His work was inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, who had previously published Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{the desire}} to buy time for its {{withdrawal}} from Southeast Asia, to protect its ally in South Vietnam, and {{to prevent the spread}} of communism to Cambodia. American and both South and North Vietnamese forces directly participated (at one time or another) in the fighting. The U.S. assisted the central government with massive U.S. aerial bombing campaigns and direct material and financial aid.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Code horror cycle <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{financial}} necessity. Universal {{in particular}} buoyed {{itself with the}} production of horror hits such as Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein, then followed those successes up with Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932), The Mummy (1932), and The Old Dark House (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions. Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom of the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off {{at the box office}} {{by the end of the}} pre-Code era.|$|E
5|$|The town {{voted in}} October 2007 {{to secede from}} the region of Veneto and join the {{neighbouring}} region, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. This <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> improved cultural ties with the small Ladin-speaking community in South Tyrol and the attraction of lower taxes. The referendum is not executive and a final decision on the matter can only be taken by law of the Italian parliament with consent of both regional councils of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige.|$|E
5|$|Tuđman's stance <b>was</b> <b>motivated</b> <b>by</b> {{his belief}} that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA. The ZNG was limited to defence, even though {{the actions of the}} JNA {{appeared}} to be coordinated with the Croatian Serb military. The impression was reinforced by buffer zones established by the JNA after armed conflicts between the Croatian Serb militia and the ZNGthe JNA intervened after the ZNG lost territory, leaving the Croatian Serbs in control of areas they captured before the JNA arrived. The JNA provided weapons to the Croatian Serbs, although most of the weaponry was provided from Serbia's TO and Ministry of Internal Affairs stocks.|$|E
