25|$|Filippo Maria Visconti, the Duke of Milan, has {{attended}} a ball, but he leaves early and encounters his assembled courtiers. He is bored with everyone; {{all seem to}} be paying obeisance to his wife because they regard her as the more powerful, his title and power having come only from his marriage to her: “Such torment and such martyrdom I cannot bear much longer”. His sycophantic courtiers tell him how much they sympathize but wonder <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not break free given his position as Duke. Also, they warn {{him that if he}} does not act, Beatrice's servants may well begin plotting against him.|$|E
25|$|Willow meets stoic Oz in {{the second}} season. Their {{courtship}} is slow and patient. Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more confident in their relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J. Douglas Rabb, a model for Willow to reference when she encounters her own attraction to evil. When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic {{that she has a}} boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one so cool. Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be. They stay together through graduation into college, but Oz is drawn to Veruca, another werewolf. He admits an animal attraction to Veruca, which he does not share with Willow. He sleeps with Veruca and leaves shortly after to explore the werewolf part of himself. Willow becomes very depressed and doubts herself. She drinks, her magical abilities are compromised, her spells come out wrong, and she lashes out at her friends when they suggest she get over it ("Something Blue").|$|E

Not for very long, but you see it. You get to meet his ex-wife (Karen Holness) and find out why his marriage ended. You understand more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division–how he feels about it and <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> what he does." ...|$|E

Brian then returns home, having been crying on the way back. Stewie cheers him up by saying that he only needs to like himself, and then professes his own admiration for Brian by letting him spend the night in his room.|$|E
500|$|Before {{his arrival}} on screen, Barber {{described}} Rhys as being determined and focused, while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said his arrival {{would cause a}} stir. Rhys is ambitious, persuasive and manipulative. His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is [...] "a bit of a backwater", while he {{is more of a}} city guy. Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague, Karl, in his quest to become a surgeon. He wants to succeed and can justify <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> certain things, which hurt other people. Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and he knows how to have a good time. Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Beyoncé for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). It was written by Knowles, Angela Beyincé, Solange Knowles and the Bama Boyz and produced by the Bama Boyz and Knowles. [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] is an R and dance-pop song that {{is set in a}} retro style. According to its lyrics, Knowles questions her love interest about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not value her fabulousness. Its 1950s-styled music video was directed by Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z, and it stars the latter as [...] "B.B. Homemaker". Knowles pays homage to Bettie Page in the video, which critics universally commended for its 1950's style sets and costumes. They also complimented Knowles for her acting skills.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{appeared}} on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, {{along with the}} former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, [...] "I don't think it's {{good for the country}} to have a former president criticize his successor." [...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's how Americans should view the deal." [...] Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a [...] "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.|$|E
500|$|The third {{song on the}} album, [...] "I Believe It", was {{the subject}} of the band's only music video from Toil. The video shows the band singing the song acoustically in the studio, much like the version that is {{featured}} on the album. Instrumentally, the song is guitar-driven and features the mandolin. The lyrics remind the listener to continue going forward even if it is painful. The song has been seen as symbol of the band's faith. The title track, [...] "Toil", is an acoustic protest song that was compared by one reviewer to the Bruce Springsteen album Wrecking Ball. The lyrics tell the story of an unhappy, overworked, working-class man. The song ends with the lyrics, [...] "I'm a slave to that whistle call. I’m a slave." [...] The tenth song, [...] "6'10"", is an alt-country ballad that was written in response to people making jokes about Bawinkle's height. The man depicted in the track is [...] tall and has to deal with people questioning him about <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not play basketball.|$|E
500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E

500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply a given that he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Given the {{off-season}} wrist surgery, Chappuis was questionable for the 1947 season. As the season got underway, Chappuis said the wrist was [...] "not as loose" [...] {{as it was}} in 1946, but he felt it was [...] "loose enough." [...] In the end, Chappuis broke his own Big Nine total offense record by gaining 1,405yards as compared with 1,284yards in 1946. He completed 48 out of 84passes for 976yards, including 11touchdown passes. He also scored 5touchdowns and gained 544yards rushing. In the season opener against Michigan State, Chappuis scored three touchdowns in a 55–0 victory, as Michigan outgained the Spartans 504yards rushing to 56. Michigan finished the 1947 season with a 21–0 victory over Ohio State. In his last game at Michigan Stadium, Chappuis set a Michigan single-game record for total offense that would last 20 years. Altogether, Chappuis accounted for 307yards, rushing for 90yards and completing 12 of 27 passes for 217yards. This stood as a school single-game total offense record for over 20years. At the end of the 1947 season, Chappuis was named a unanimous first-team All-American. He also finished second to Johnny Lujack in the 1947 Heisman Trophy voting, with Lujack receiving 742 first and second place votes to 555 for Chappuis. Despite the glowing adjectives heaped on him, reporters noted that [...] "Chappuis can still wear his regular size seven headgear." [...] Chappuis gave credit to his line saying, [...] "Anyone passing behind the protection that line gave me could have done as well." [...] In another sign of his modesty on a team with only two two-way players Chappuis said [...] "You have to smell where to go on pass defense—and my sniffer's not too good."

500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen {{to me in the}} first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re never going to have it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E

500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re {{going to make you}} wait for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, as well as the scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is <b>why</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E
