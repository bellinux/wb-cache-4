500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E

He wants to win so badly that he'll break the rules and take shortcuts to make it happen. His colors are blue and yellow and his player number is 5. His car has six tires unlike all the other cars. He {{is the only one}} of the Turbo Dogs who regularly uses his car's special apparatus to give him an unfair advantage during the races, however it usually ends up with him spinning out or crashing.

60|$|Oh! my friends, {{when people}} are talking about faith and works, and trying to {{reconcile}} St. Paul and St. James, as they call it, because St. Paul says Abraham was justified by faith, and St. James says Abraham was justified by works, if they would but pray for the simple, childlike heart, and the head of common sense, and look at their own children, who, every time they go on a message for them, settle, without knowing it, this mighty difference of man's making between faith and works. You tell a little child daily to do many things the meaning and use of which it cannot understand; and the child has faith in what you tell it; and, therefore, it does what you tell it, and so it shews its faith in you by obedience in <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{partners}} have more faith in it than I have," [...] Frank said.

All that's found in your claims will be yours; and if it turns out rich you shall pay us just as if we had been <b>working</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> by the day. When we have cleared out your claims we are to have the right of using your shaft for working right and left along the bottom over our claims. I think that's a fair offer." ...|$|E
5000|$|While {{in group}} therapy (for former supervillains), he began dating Brenda Drago (the {{daughter}} of Blackie Drago, the second Vulture), {{much to the}} chagrin of May who had developed a crush on him. During the events of the Season of the Serpent storyline, May confessed her feelings to Normie, but Normie did not think it would be appropriate. However, after he is shot in the chest by Mr. Nobody in the Marked For Death arc (who shot him to mess with May's head), Normie's true feelings are revealed in a coma vision where his grandfather taunts him, [...] "All {{you had to do was}} kill the girl. But no you had to fall in love with her, and how's that <b>working</b> out <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Normie?"
