[...] Trends in working hours and the effects of the Great Recession correlate with part-time <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> patterns. The impact of this provision may have been offset by other factors, including that health insurance helps attract and retain employees, increases productivity and reduces absenteeism; and the lower training and administration costs of a smaller full-time workforce over a larger part-time work force. Relatively few firms employ over 50 employees and more than 90% of them offered insurance. Workers without employer insurance could purchase insurance on the exchanges.|$|E

However, with the aging of the population there is an increasing threat to current welfare levels. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the possibilities of a rise in wealth through a change in (the trend of) <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> For the analysis we have created a unique data base which includes workers that have occupied the same job in the period 2003 - 2005. This means we abstain from {{dynamics in}} jobs, (i. e. job finders, job switchers, job losers), which can partly be attributed to changes in participation. Instead we focus completely at <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of a given job. The analysis is comprised of two parts, first we analyse factors determine the actual number of hours worked for both female and male occupied jobs. Second, we analyse the dynamics in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of a given job using a bivariate probit estimation with selection. This model takes into account what factors determine if a person does or does not change <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and subsequently examines which factors determine whether this change is an increase or a decrease in <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Women more frequently change their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> than men and both rather decrease than increase their <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Changes in work situation and household situation are important determinants of changes in <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> for women also changes in residential context play a role.

50|$|Lee Shu-Kam, Associate Professor of the Department of Economics and Finance of HKSYU, {{believed}} standard {{working hours}} cannot achieve ‘work-life balance’. He referenced the research to the US by the University of California, Los Angeles in 1999 {{and pointed out}} that in the industries and regions which the wage elasticity is low, the effects of standard working hours on lowering actual working time and increasing wage is limited: for regions where labor supply is inadequate, standard working hours can protect employees’ benefit yet cause unemployment; but for the regions, such as Japan, where the problem does not exist, standard <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> would only lead to unemployment. In addition, he said the effect of standard <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> {{is similar to that of}} giving overtime pay, say, making employees to favor overtime work more. In this sense, standard <b>working</b> <b>hour</b> does not match its principle: to shorten work time and increase recreation time of employees.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine whether there is any {{connection}} between <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and the worker ́s health. The study also aims to investigate if there are any differences over time. Earlier studies have shown that individuals need a balance in their life between worked hours and free time. This balance seems to be important for employees if they want to lead and remain a healthy lifestyle. If the employed doesn’t feel satisfied with his or her <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> then the balance can get disrupted which could lead to a number of health problems. There are a lot of studies that aim to explain the relationship between <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and health. There is a missing area which examines the relation between desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and the worker`s health. Therefore, this topic is interesting to study more closely. The study is conducted using data from the Swedish survey of living condition panel (ULF). The panels consist of people between 16 to 84 years old. The study started in 1975. Since 1979 the study has been conducted at 8 yearly intervals. The data is administrated by Statistic Sweden (SCB). Three hypotheses have derived from previous research 1; employees who are satisfied with their work hours are least fatigued 2; the relation between <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and desired <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> has bigger effects on women than men. 3; women who are satisfied with their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> are less fatigued over time.
