25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes Lander {{explained}} {{the meaning of}} Spit : [...] "People expect us to suck, then <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> stage and blow them away." [...] The song [...] "Spit" [...] {{was inspired by the}} attitude of local bands towards Kittie. According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, giving you a hard time because of who you are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many people think that the album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E
500|$|Although {{both were}} {{committed}} O.T.O. members, Northrup's usurpation of Helen's role led to {{conflict between the}} two sisters. The reactions of Parsons and Helen towards Northrup were markedly different. Parsons told Helen to her face that he preferred Northrup sexually: [...] "This {{is a fact that}} I can do nothing about. I am better suited to her temperamentally – <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> well. Your character is superior. You are a greater person. I doubt that she would face what you have with me – or support me as well." [...] Some years later, addressing himself as [...] "You", Parsons told himself that his affair with Northrup (whom he called Betty) marked a key step in his growth as a practitioner of magick: [...] "Betty served to affect a transference from Helen at a critical period ... Your passion for Betty also gave you the magical force needed at the time, and the act of adultery tinged with incest, served as your magical confirmation in the law of Thelema." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{a recent}} {{interview}} with American Songwriter Chris Hillman explained that [...] "the greatest legacy of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram is we were the alternative country band. <b>We</b> couldn't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> country radio and <b>we</b> couldn't <b>get</b> <b>on</b> rock radio! <b>We</b> were the outlaw country band for a brief period." ...|$|R

500|$|Despite {{remaining}} unenthusiastic {{with the}} script, Kanter agreed to commission it {{as a film}} {{on the condition that}} he reserve the right to select a [...] "" [...] director. Anderson would have selected David Lane, who had directed the two Thunderbirds film sequels, Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and Thunderbird 6 (1968). After a ten-week delay to filming, Robert Parrish, an American director whose latest project had been shelved, accepted the post. Parrish's film career up to 1968 had included co-editing Body and Soul (for which he had shared the 1947 Academy Award for Best Film Editing) and co-directing the 1967 James Bond spoof, Casino Royale. Anderson remembered Parrish as being [...] "very ingratiating", stating that he [...] "told us he loved the script and said it would be an honour to work with us. Jay Kanter gave Bob the thumbs up and we were in business." [...] Although the box office failure of Casino Royale had prompted Anderson to question Parrish's ability, he stated that Doppelgänger could not have been made without his recruitment: [...] "It wasn't a question of, 'Will <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with him?' or, 'Is he the right man?' He was a name director, so we signed him up immediately." ...|$|E
