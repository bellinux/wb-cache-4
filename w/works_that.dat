5|$|Gilbert's legacy, {{aside from}} {{building}} the Garrick Theatre and writing the Savoy Operas and other <b>works</b> <b>that</b> {{are still being}} performed or in print over a hundred and twenty-five years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the <b>works</b> <b>that</b> he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced {{the development of the}} modern musical throughout the 20th century. Gilbert's lyrics employ punning, as well as complex internal and two and three-syllable rhyme schemes, and served as a model for such 20th century Broadway librettists and lyricists as P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Ira Gershwin, Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II.|$|E
5|$|Girl with Ball was {{exhibited}} at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in Newsweek {{review of the}} show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's <b>works</b> <b>that</b> exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although {{the result of his}} painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>works</b> <b>that</b> {{make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, {{some just}} hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as done by a competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E

50|$|The term 'child labour', {{suggests}} ILO, is best {{defined as}} <b>work</b> <b>that</b> deprives {{children of their}} childhood, their potential and their dignity, and that is harmful to physical and mental development.

50|$|Some adverts offer {{legitimate}} {{forms of}} <b>work</b> <b>that</b> really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate {{the effort that}} will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of <b>work</b> <b>that</b> will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of <b>work</b> <b>that</b> will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise <b>work</b> <b>that</b> would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as extras, mystery shopping (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a nanny.|$|R

5|$|While {{composing}} {{the opera}} Siegfried, {{the third part}} of the Ring cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story Tristan und Isolde and his only mature comedy Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), two <b>works</b> <b>that</b> {{are also part of}} the regular operatic canon.|$|E
5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to fuel the glass <b>works</b> <b>that</b> had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{majority}} of his works were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrice Cenci). Many of his works were published only posthumously, often under arbitrary titles, as Słowacki never named them himself. He also left notes on <b>works</b> <b>that</b> he never began or never completed. Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.|$|E

Speyer was chairman of the UERL's backer Speyer Brothers and a partner in Speyer & Co. Sir George Gibb, general manager of the North Eastern Railway, was appointed managing director. The BS opened to passengers on 10 March 1906. The GNP followed on 15 December 1906, with the CCE on 22 June 1907.

5|$|Because he {{persistently}} programmed <b>works</b> <b>that</b> did not {{attract the}} public, Beecham's musical activities {{at this time}} consistently lost money. As {{a result of his}} estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, {{but it was not until}} father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.|$|E
