25|$|For steam-hauled trains, the Llanberis shunt {{movement}} {{includes a}} trip to the <b>water</b> <b>crane</b> and coaling stage outside the locomotive shed. At Halfway Station steam locomotives also take water from a <b>water</b> <b>crane,</b> fed from a large tank located just above the station. For emergency use another large water tank is situated near Clogwyn Station which can feed two water cranes.|$|E
25|$|The station {{buildings}} at Trawsfynydd {{were on the}} Down (northbound) side and provided a ticket office, waiting room, a lavatory and a urinal as well as rooms for staff use and a substantial signalbox on the platform. The Up platform had a waiting room. A goods shed backed onto the engine shed. The site was dominated by a very large water tank {{on top of the}} embankment on the Up side. Both platforms carried a <b>water</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|E
500|$|Closing {{the mines}} {{not only had}} the {{immediate}} effect of ending the line's core traffic, it led to depopulation of the villages south of the incline, reducing further what was in any event [...] "trifling" [...] income from goods and passengers. To add insult to injury, the closure of Gupworthy Old Pit removed the water supply for the line's only <b>water</b> <b>crane</b> south of the incline, so the crane and water tank had to be moved and erected at Brendon Hill.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>water</b> <b>cranes</b> {{consist of}} an upright steel pipe about 8 to 12 in in {{diameter}} with a horizontal, pivoting pipe connected to its upper end {{so as to}} form a swinging arm. The swinging arm is usually designed to rest parallel to the rails when not in use. <b>Water</b> <b>cranes</b> {{may be able to}} deliver up to 10 m3 gal of water per minute.|$|R

50|$|Historically, railroads {{that used}} steam {{locomotives}} required {{a means of}} replenishing the locomotive's tenders. Water towers were common along the railroad. The tenders were usually replenished by <b>water</b> <b>cranes,</b> which were fed by a water tower.|$|R
500|$|Hired by the Bacheller {{newspaper}} syndicate {{to serve}} as a war correspondent during the Cuban insurrection against Spain, the 25-year-old Stephen Crane boarded the filibustering steamship SS Commodore on New Year's Eve, 1896. The ship sailed from Jacksonville, Florida, with 27 or 28men and a cargo of supplies and ammunition for the Cuban rebels. On the St. Johns River, less than [...] from Jacksonville, Commodore struck a sandbar in a dense fog and damaged its hull. Although towed off the sandbar the following day, it was again beached in Mayport, Florida, and further damaged. A leak began in the boiler room that evening, {{and as a result of}} malfunctioning water pumps, the ship came to a standstill about [...] from Mosquito Inlet (now called Ponce de León Inlet). As the ship took on more <b>water,</b> <b>Crane</b> described the engine room as resembling [...] "a scene at this time taken from the middle kitchen of Hades." ...|$|E

The small boat overturned in the surf, forcing the exhausted men to swim to shore; one of them died. [...] Having lost the gold given to him for his journey, Crane wired Cora Taylor for help. [...] She traveled to Daytona and returned to Jacksonville with Crane the next day, only four days after he had left on the Commodore.|$|E

50|$|Heritage railway lines contain {{historic}} {{rail infrastructure}} {{that has been}} substituted or made obsolete in modern railway transit systems. Historical installations, such as hand operated points, <b>water</b> <b>cranes,</b> and rail fastened with hand hammered rail spikes, are characteristic features of heritage lines.

50|$|The motifs {{range from}} bold {{geometric}} prints to botanical, nature-inspired and lifestyle-inspired images.

Variations of popular designs from past collections are sometimes brought back by popular demand. From the beginning, the Japanese aesthetic—stylized waves, <b>water,</b> <b>cranes,</b> fans, chrysanthemum petals, bamboo, textures and brushstrokes—has been prominent in the line.|$|R
