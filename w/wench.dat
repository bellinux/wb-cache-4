Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although {{the extent of the}} black influence remains debated. Spirituals (known as jubilees) entered the repertoire in the 1870s, marking the first undeniably black music to be used in minstrelsy.|$|E

25|$|Other {{minstrel}} troupes {{tried to}} satisfy outlying tastes. Female acts {{had made a}} stir in variety shows, and Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels ran with the idea, first performing in 1870 in skimpy costumes and tights. Their success gave rise to at least 11 all-female troupes by 1871, one of which did away with blackface altogether. Ultimately, the girlie show emerged as a form in its own right. Mainstream minstrelsy continued to emphasize its propriety, but traditional troupes adopted some of these elements {{in the guise of}} the female impersonator. A well-played <b>wench</b> character became critical to success in the postwar period.|$|E

Virginia and Ohio made further cuts to the versions they approved for distribution.|$|E

Upon realizing that both their grooms were the same man – Jack Sparrow – the two <b>wenches</b> find {{themselves}} in an auction led by the Auctioneer. The short film serves as a prequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl, explaining just why Jack Sparrow's boat, the Jolly Mon, was seen sinking {{at the beginning of the}} whole story, and explaining why <b>wenches</b> Scarlett and Giselle were so upset with him, and it also implies how Cotton lost his tongue.

500|$|In 1598, {{there was}} a {{reference}} to cricket in an Italian-English dictionary by Giovanni Florio. His definition of the word sgillare was: [...] "to make a noise as a cricket, to play cricket-a-wicket, and be merry". Florio is the first writer known to have defined [...] "cricket" [...] {{in terms of both}} an insect and a game. In a later edition of his dictionary in 1611, Florio infers that [...] "to play cricket-a-wicket" [...] has sexual associations with references to frittfritt, defined [...] "as we say cricket a wicket, or gigaioggie", and dibatticare, defined [...] "to thrum a <b>wench</b> lustily till the bed cry giggaioggie".|$|E
500|$|James {{became obsessed}} with {{the threat posed by}} witches and wrote Daemonologie in 1597, a tract {{inspired}} by his personal involvement that opposed the practice of witchcraft and that provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth. James personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. After 1599, his views became more sceptical. In a later letter written in England to his son Henry, James congratulates the prince on [...] "the discovery of yon little counterfeit <b>wench.</b> I pray God ye may be my heir in such discoveries... most miracles now-a-days prove but illusions, and ye may see by this how wary judges should be in trusting accusations".|$|E
500|$|The tour used seven {{individual}} rigs for {{performers and}} props to become airborne. For dancers to be flown {{to the center}} of each upstage, a <b>wench,</b> which dropped 18inches {{off the face of the}} panel, was placed in the rig. Cyrus' flying required two wenches, one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage. Four elevators, or trap doors, were located throughout the stage, some of which had the option of a 4×4 or an 8×8 foot opening. All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services (SGPS)/Showrig. The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint, as there were only three weeks of rehearsal. Brian White, co-owner of SGPS, explained, ...|$|E

He {{describes}} her as wonderfully beautiful: [...] "The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun." [...] Rosaline, however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: [...] "She hath forsworn to love, {{and in that}} vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now." [...] This {{is the source of}} his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: [...] "That same pale, hard-hearted <b>wench,</b> that Rosaline, torments him so that he will sure run mad." [...] Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, Rosaline will look like [...] "a crow" [...] alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: [...] "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night." [...] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for Rosaline throughout much of the play.|$|E
