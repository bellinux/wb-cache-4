5|$|Pebe {{moved the}} family to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1991 after {{securing}} a new publishing deal for her songwriting. Pebe frequently brought Kesha and her brothers along to recording studios and encouraged Kesha to sing <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> Kesha's vocal talent. Kesha attended Franklin High School and Brentwood High School, but claimed {{that she did not}} fit in, explaining that her unconventional style (e.g., homemade purple velvet pants and purple hair) did not endear her to other students. She played the trumpet and later the saxophone in the marching band in school, and described herself in an interview with NPR as being a diligent student. After attaining a near-perfect score on her SATs, she was offered a full scholarship at Barnard College, but instead chose to drop out before graduation to pursue her music career.|$|E

After reaching the end of her rope and running out of money she fired the contractor. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> the window wells filling with water she called Mike. Along with no provision for drainage he noticed that they had not installed proper lintels above the window to support the brick. Once inside he noticed signs of poor workmanship in the basement finishing. Pulling some drywall for further inspection found improper construction, insulation, electrical and plumbing. Mike tore it all down and rebuilt the basement, plus corrected the windows.|$|E
25|$|While {{working with}} the WSPU, Lucy Burns met Alice Paul at a London police station. Both women {{had been arrested for}} demonstrating, and Alice Paul {{introduced}} herself <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> that Lucy Burns was wearing an American flag pin on her lapel. The women discussed their suffrage experiences in the United Kingdom and the American women's movement. Burns and Paul bonded over their frustration with the inactivity and ineffective leadership of the American suffrage movement by Anna Howard Shaw. Their similar passions and fearlessness in the face of opposition made them quickly become good friends. Both women were passionate about activism, and the feminist struggle for equality in the UK inspired Burns and Paul to continue the fight in the United States in 1912.|$|E

500|$|According to Baley, at {{approximately}} 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, Sallie Fox, screaming. She {{had been playing}} in a wagon <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out war whoops as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown. Udell described the attack as [...] "like a shower" [...] of arrows. According to Rose, [...] "I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them." [...] As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with {{their children to the}} covered wagons. Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours. Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to be leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.|$|E
2500|$|Castlin {{was born}} in Atlanta, Georgia to Kimberly and Rodney Castlin. [...] She did not take up track and field {{until the age of}} fourteen, only {{becoming}} interested <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> she was quicker than her classmates. While still in high school, she ran a Georgia state record time of 13.73 seconds for the 100 metres hurdles. She graduated in the top five percent of her class, and given her athletic ability, she gained a scholarship to study political science at Virginia Tech. Castlin was a freshman during the Virginia Tech shooting, in which Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 others. She graduated from Virginia Tech in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is {{a bacterial}} virus, or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered by}} Esther Lederberg in 1950 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E

2500|$|Jacqueline Noonan was {{practicing}} as a pediatric cardiologist at the University of Iowa <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> {{that children with}} a rare type of heart defect, valvular pulmonary stenosis, often had a characteristic physical appearance, with short stature, webbed neck, wide spaced eyes, and low-set ears. [...] Both boys and girls were affected. [...] These characteristics were sometimes seen running in families but were not associated with gross chromosomal abnormalities. [...] She studied 833 patients at the congenital heart disease clinic, looking for other congenital abnormalities, and in 1963 presented a paper: [...] "Associated non-cardiac malformations in children with congenital heart disease". This described 9 children who in addition to congenital heart disease had characteristic facial features, chest deformities and short stature.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Brun noticed Marie taking {{white powder}} from her {{malachite}} box and stirring {{it into the}} eggnog. When asked, Marie said it was [...] "orange-blossom sugar". But Anna's suspicions were aroused <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> a few white flakes floating {{on the surface of}} the eggnog after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Massénat; he tasted the eggnog and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some ceiling plaster that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; she put the rest of the eggnog in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} study interplanetary scintillation, Hewish built the Interplanetary Scintillation Array at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. The array {{consisted}} of 2,048 dipoles over almost five acres of land, and {{was built to}} constantly survey the sky at a time resolution of about 0.1 seconds. This high time resolution set it apart from many other radio telescopes of the time, as astronomers did not expect emission from an object to feature such rapid variation. Soon after observations were under way, Hewish's student Jocelyn Bell turned this assumption on its head, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> a signal which was soon recognized as emanating from {{a new class of}} object, the pulsar. Thus [...] "it was an investigation of interplanetary scintillation that led to the discovery of pulsars, even though the discovery was a by-product rather than the purpose of the investigation." ...|$|E
