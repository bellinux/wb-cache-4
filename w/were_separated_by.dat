5|$|The {{book had}} some very careful readers; the ornithologist Alfred Newton noticed that Rennie had used an {{identical}} paragraph to describe two birds, the beam bird (now called the spotted flycatcher) and the pied flycatcher, though their descriptions <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> 300 pages.|$|E
5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> {{less than a}} minute after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E

5|$|The Saturday {{practice}} sessions were again held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher set the fastest {{time of the}} third session, a 1:24.262. The Williams drivers were running quickly—Jenson Button in second and Ralf Schumacher fifth—they <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> Coulthard and Barrichello in third and fourth. Fisichella recorded the sixth fastest lap time. Villeneuve, Häkkinen, Salo and Johnny Herbert rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Michael Schumacher again set the fastest time, a 1:23.904; Barrichello set the third fastest time. They <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> Häkkinen with teammate Coulthard clinching the fourth fastest time. The Williams drivers continued to run quickly with Ralf Schumacher fifth, ahead of Button in sixth. Fisichella, Zonta, Villeneuve and Irvine (who suffered a rear suspension failure but regained control of his car) completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Mazzacane again suffered problems with his car when his engine ran out of air pressure {{and was forced to}} stop on the track while Wurz did not record any laps because of a fuel pick-up issue.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 10:30 Malaysian Standard Time (GMT +8) for a 30-minute warm-up session. It took place in warm and dry weather conditions. Zonta set the fastest time, a 1:40.032. Both McLaren drivers {{maintained}} their good pace from qualifying—Häkkinen was second, just off Zonta's pace; Coulthard had the fourth-fastest time.

50|$|In {{the context}} of the above law, the term degree, called chon (Hangul: 촌, Hanja: 寸) in Korean, refers to the {{distance}} of kinship between two persons. Siblings are considered to <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> two chons, while children and parents <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> one chon.

5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} of both men. Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E
5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> time interval. As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday from 11:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 14:00 CEST (UTC+2), and two on Saturday morning held from 09.00 to 09.45 and from 10.15 to 11.00 CEST. In {{the first two}} {{practice sessions}}, Prost driver Olivier Panis set the fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 22.735 seconds, one-tenths of a second faster than Arrows driver Damon Hill. Villeneuve and Rubens Barrichello were third and fourth. Mika Häkkinen and Coulthard, set the fifth and eighth-fastest times respectively for McLaren; they <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> Frentzen and Alesi. Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} county {{boundaries}} of Lancashire, {{until the early}} 19th century, Great Bolton and Little Bolton {{were two of the}} eighteen townships of the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors. These townships <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> the River Croal, Little Bolton on the north bank and Great Bolton on the south. Bolton Poor Law Union was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started to build a new workhouse at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth. Townleys Hospital was built on the site which is now Royal Bolton Hospital.|$|E

5|$|Proxy records {{based on}} paleotempestological {{research}} {{have revealed that}} major hurricane activity along the Gulf of Mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. Few major hurricanes struck the Gulf coast during 3000–1400 BC and again during the most recent millennium. These quiescent intervals <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> a hyperactive period during 1400 BC and 1000 AD, when the Gulf coast was struck frequently by catastrophic hurricanes and their landfall probabilities increased by 3–5 times. This millennial-scale variability {{has been attributed to}} long-term shifts in the position of the Azores High, which may also be linked to changes in the strength of the North Atlantic Oscillation.|$|E
5|$|The family Motacillidae {{consists}} of the wagtails, pipits and longclaws. The largest of these groups is the pipits in the genus Anthus, which are typically brown-plumaged terrestrial insectivores. Their similar appearances have led to taxonomic problems; the water pipit and the buff-bellied pipit were considered subspecies of the Eurasian rock pipit until they <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> the British Ornithologists' Union in 1998.

5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E

Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South Office Buildings, and these <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> a courtyard he named the People's Court.
