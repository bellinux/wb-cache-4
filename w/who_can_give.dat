25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> painful stings, though the birds do not seem to mind. Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the {{new book}} were as {{complimentary}} as those for its predecessors. The Times Literary Supplement wrote, [...] "French Provincial Cooking needs to be read rather than referred to quickly. It discourses at some length the type and origin of the dishes popular in various French regions, as well as the culinary terms, herbs and kitchen equipment used in France. But those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> the extra time to this book will be well repaid by dishes such as La Bourride de Charles Bérot and Cassoulet Colombié." [...] The Observer said that it was difficult to think of any home that could do without the book and called David [...] "a very special kind of genius".|$|E

The recreation of songs from the original film, [...] "Ye Mera Dil" [...] and [...] "Khaike Paan Banaraswala", received mixed comments. Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave the album a 4 out of 5, noting its success at surprising its listener, and wrote [...] "Shankar Ehsaan Loy do exceedingly well with the soundtrack and establish their supremacy as the composer trio <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> their own even while rearranging the songs from the past." [...] Planet Bollywood gave a rating of 6.5 out of 10, praising its lyrics and vocals, and termed [...] "Aaj Ki Raat" [...] as [...] "the best song in the entire soundtrack". Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com was less impressed with the album, calling it [...] "Snazzy, good mix" [...] and writing [...] "This lavish enterprise {{has a little bit}} of everything.

500|$|Kyla's [...] "no-nonsense" [...] {{personality}} {{has led to}} {{mixed reviews}} in the press. A number of episodes central to her storylines have been reviewed by various publications as televisual 'picks of the day' - from her introductory episode, {{to the death of}} her husband, to the surprise return of her former boyfriend Abra. Her [...] "fiery" [...] stance resulted in the assessment that, from a viewing perspective, the character [...] "has never been one of the more likeable members of staff", however her descent into alcoholism drew some more sympathetic reviews, with Linda Gibson of TV Quick writing of the character: [...] "Let's hope that Kyla pulls herself together, gets her son back and meets a man <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> her what she wants." [...] Conversely, Daily Mirror TV critic Jim Shelley opined that the character had formerly been one of the more [...] "normal" [...] and [...] "reliable" [...] members of the cast, but criticized the handling of her alcoholism storyline, stating that the character seemed to have become an alcoholic [...] "overnight".|$|E

[...] Governor of New Jersey Christopher J. Christie used his Twitter account to write that everything about the show was [...] "great". Beyoncé's husband and rapper Jay-Z, also wrote on Twitter that Beyoncé was the [...] "best performer in the world". A writer of Complex magazine further discussed his statements, [...] "Sure, he's married to her... But upon further reflection, he just might have a point. What other artist out there gives the type of live performance she does on a nightly basis? <b>Who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> you that incredible voice singing power ballads and up-tempo dance cuts—while dancing?... In a world with hotshots like Lady Gaga, legends like U2, and even Jay-Z and Kanye West's The Throne bodying stages worldwide, is Beyoncé best performer on earth?".|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E

500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's {{going to find that}} special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / <b>Who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?".

2500|$|Some {{researchers}} believe that experimental research is too complex {{for the general public}} ever {{to be able to give}} proper informed consent. [...] One such researcher is Eugene G.

Yalow who said [...] "In our laboratory we always used ourselves because we are the only ones <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> truly informed consent." [...] On the other side of the coin, there is the possibility that members of a research team may be coerced into participating by peer pressure.|$|E

50|$|While it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that compulsory vaccination may be needed to control a pandemic, many countries do not have a legal framework that would allow this.

50|$|When {{a person}} falls ill, a {{traditional}} practitioner uses incantations {{to make a}} diagnosis. Incantations are thought to give the air of mystical and cosmic connections.

If divination is required, then the practitioner will advise the patient to consult a diviner <b>who</b> <b>can</b> further <b>give</b> a diagnosis and cure.
