40|$|Starting from {{problems}} faced by Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force,</b> like rude treatment and inhuman, most of them also get good treatment as they should. In other side, {{in some cases they}} weren’t paid, hit, raped, threw by hot water, ironed, un-feed, locked in werehouse, etc. The treatments were part of violation to the Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> rights as stated in section 8 (b) Rule No. 39 2004 which stated that every Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> has rights to get the correct information about foreign work market and the Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> placement procedure in foreign country. But still many Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> didn’t get information as they should be. According to the problem, the writer tried to discuss it in a research titled : “Application of Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force’s</b> Rights To Get Information and Its Problems (Study at Megah Utama Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> Service Company Malang) ”. The research aimed to find out the application of Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> rights to get information also find out about the {{problems faced}} by Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> related with the mis-information accepted. The research was done at Megah Utama Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> Service Company Malang. Data collection used primary and secondary data using library research and field research. Analysis technique used qualitative descriptive study. Research showed that Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> rights in receiving information has been ruled by the government in rule No. 39 / 2004 about Placement and Protection of Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> in foreign Countries. Section 34 Chapter V about the arrangement of Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> Placement contained : (1) recruitment process, starting by information to Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> about recruitment arrangement, documents needed, duty and rights, condition and risk, and Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> protection; (2) information as stated in verse (1) was stated in correct and complete; (3) information as stated in verse (1) and (2) should be acknowledged by institution which has responsible in Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> placement. That’s why PT Megah Utama as Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> Service Company has not stated information related with right s and duty of Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> like sending off, full information about risk and situation in other countries but only explaining about the condition for being Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force,</b> salary, <b>work</b> field, etc though this information also was done by work information in corporate with village officers and people. Problems faced by Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> whether came to Singapore, Malay, Hongkong, or Taiwan were marital status manipulation, age, and address, also the delayed sending process. Since the employer kept the passport and the Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> didn’t arrange passport prolongation, the Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> became illegal. The effort to reduce illegal Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> were monitoring Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> Service Company more and applying harder sanction. Indonesian <b>Work</b> <b>Force</b> also should be given rights as stated in rule before and after working. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} how to introduce thermal {{fluctuations in the}} equation of motion of a magnetic system is addressed. Using {{the approach of the}} fluctuation-dissipation theorem we calculate the properties of the noise for both, the fluctuating field and fluctuating torque (<b>force)</b> <b>representation.</b> In contrast to earlier calculations we consider the general case of a system of interacting magnetic moments without the assumption of axial symmetry. We show that the interactions do not result in any correlations of thermal fluctuations in the field representation and that the same widely used formula can be used in the most general case. We further prove that close to the equilibrium where the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is valid, both, field and torque (<b>force)</b> <b>representations</b> coincide, being different far away from it...|$|R

It demonstrates how the socioecological model can be used to assess and inform the development of the infrastructure required for effective public health nutrition effort. An interpretive case study method was used involving triangular analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from multiple sources including semistructured interviews with advanced-level practitioners, literature review, a cross-sectional national <b>work</b> <b>force</b> survey, and position description audit and consensus development using a Delphi study. The findings of this analysis indicate that the Australian public health nutrition <b>work</b> <b>force's</b> capacity to effectively address priority nutrition issues is limited by determinants that can be categorized as relating to human resource infrastructure, organizational and policy environments, intelligence access and use, practice improvement and learning systems, and <b>work</b> <b>force</b> preparation. This socioecological analysis supports an intelligence-based focus for <b>work</b> <b>force</b> development effort in Australia and a conceptual framework for <b>work</b> <b>force</b> capacity assessment with potential applications in other countries...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} an {{axial compressor}} body <b>force</b> <b>representation</b> constructed from 3 D CFD calculations. The radial distribution of body forces {{is compared to}} that of a body <b>force</b> <b>representation</b> based on axisymmetric streamline curvature (SLC) calculations, and shown to be in qualitative agreement except {{in the vicinity of the}} blade tip. In terms of stall inception type and stall point, computations based on both representations exhibit agreement with rig test data. A parametric study is undertaken in which the magnitude of the forces in the blade tip region of both representations is reduced so as to obtain reductions in compressor pressure rise similar to those observed experimentally due to increased tip clearance. It is shown that on a back-to-back basis, a given change to the end wall forces produces similar effects on the computed stall point, whether the underlying body <b>force</b> <b>representation</b> derives from 3 D CFD or SLC. Based on this result one route to capturing effects of tip clearance on stall prediction can be the development of a tip clearance body force model for use in conjunction with SLC calculations. by Jonathan Kerner.

40|$|Abstract: Both {{supply and}} demand {{influence}} {{the ability of the}} dental <b>work</b> <b>force</b> to adequately and efficiently provide dental care to a U. S. population growing in size and diversity. Major changes are occurring {{on both sides of the}} dental care market. Among factors shaping the demand for dental care are changing disease patterns, shifting population demographics, the extent and features of third-party payment, and growth of the economy and the population. The capacity of the dental <b>work</b> <b>force</b> to provide care is influenced by enhancements of productivity and numbers of dental health personnel, as well as their demographic and practice characteristics. The full impact of these changes is difficult to predict. The dentist-to-population ratio does not reflect all the factors that must be considered to develop an effective dental <b>work</b> <b>force</b> policy. Nationally, the dental <b>work</b> <b>force</b> is likely to be adequate for the next several years, but regional <b>work</b> <b>force</b> imbalances appear to exist and may get worse. Against this backdrop of change and uncertainty, future dental <b>work</b> <b>force</b> strategies should strive for short-term responsiveness while avoiding long-term inflexibility. Trends in the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> must be continually monitored. Thorough analysis is required, and action should be taken when necessary...|$|R

It reports {{an analysis of the}} occupational structure and characteristics of the construction <b>work</b> <b>force</b> as an aid to meeting the challenges of maintaining a skilled craft <b>work</b> <b>force.</b> Information was collected through on-site structured interview surveys of 3300 construction workers and a questionnaire survey of contractors, consultants and clients which included 56 organizations. Results indicate that the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> consists of 51 % unskilled workers, 33 % masons, 10 % carpenters and 1 - 2 % each of plumbers, bar benders, painters and electricians. The highest percentage of skilled workers is aged 30 - 39 years. Approximately 80 % of the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> is casually employed, only 40 % is fully utilized and 86 % of the skilled <b>work</b> <b>force</b> have received informal training only. More than 20 % of the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> is dissatisfied due to low income, lack of job security and difficulty in finding regular work. Comparing HRD practices to those in the USA and the UK indicates that Sri Lanka needs to adopt a more structured approach, including a more formal training system and proper grading of the skilled <b>work</b> <b>force.</b> Labour Force Structure, Characteristics, Construction Industry, Sri Lanka,...|$|R

40|$|Using {{the eight}} guiding {{principles}} of Integrated Safety Management (ISM) - Worker Involvement - will move the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> on a forward path from just doing work to doing work safely. This path {{can be achieved}} by changing the safety culture in the work place. The <b>work</b> <b>force</b> is more likely to accept a process {{that will allow them to}} be accountable for their own safety if they feel ownership through Worker Involvement. The marrying of the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) and ISM will give workers this ownership. One of the concerns in implementing ISM is that, unless you keep it simple by applying the five core functions and eight guiding principles, you may over load the <b>work</b> <b>force</b> with more information then they need. If you can show them how their job applies to the five core functions, along with using VPP to change their safety culture, you will build a <b>work</b> <b>force</b> that will set the standards for doing work safely.
