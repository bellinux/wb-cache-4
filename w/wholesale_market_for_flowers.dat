40|$|This paper tests market co-integration, market {{leadership}} and price margins {{in the context}} of the recent development of European <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> imported off-season fresh fruit from countries in the southern hemisphere. The Engle-Granger and Johansen co-integration tests show that the main European <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> off-season fresh apples and table grapes were well integrated during the 1994 - 97 period. The vector autoregressive - error correction mechanism (VAR-ECM) model form is used to characterise the spatial co-integrating relationships among these markets during the same period. Statistical tests on meaningful restrictions on these VAR-ECM models show that the major import market of Rotterdam significantly leads the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> table grapes in Germany down the supply chain but does not lead the <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> in France and Germany for apples. They also show higher price margins between the import and <b>wholesale</b> <b>markets</b> <b>for</b> table grapes than for apples. The table grape variety imported from South Africawas consistently traded at a higher price during the 1994 - 98 period compared to the same variety from Chile.
