5|$|Big Gemini, or Big G, {{grew out}} of a 1963 {{proposal}} called Gemini Transport, to develop an enlarged Gemini spacecraft with docking capability, which would take advantage of the increased capacity offered by the Saturn IB and Titan IIIM rockets.

It would have been launched by a Heavy lift launch vehicle; either a Titan IIIG or Saturn INT-20, the former being intended for use on US Air Force missions and the latter being intended for NASA missions. The Titan IIIM was also considered, which would have launched a smaller version of the spacecraft due to its lower capacity, to resupply MOL space stations later in the program.

Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts.

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} behaviour of a 60 l threephase airlift bioreactor, of the concentric {{draught tube}} type, with an enlarged degassing zone has been studied.

5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur.

This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of solids-associated viruses in wastewater was studied {{to determine the}} effect of treatment processes on viruses associated <b>with</b> <b>solids.</b> Solids less than 0. 3 micrometers in diameter were separated from the liquid phase of each sample by using a continuous-flow centrifuge. The percentage of virus associated <b>with</b> <b>solids</b> larger than 0. 3 micrometers decreased from 28 % in the influent to 3. 4 % in unchlorinated effluent, and this was accompanied by a 92 % decrease in the total concentration of virus.

The total concentration of virus was reduced by 82 % by chlorination, and the percentage of virus associated <b>with</b> <b>solids</b> increased to 7. 7 % upon chlorination, indicating some protection due to association with particles larger than 0. 3 micrometers. When a suspension of fecal particles and a 0. 22 -micrometers filtrate of a fecal homogenate were sonicated, a threefold increase in virus titer was observed in each. This demonstrated that viruses may be attached to particles smaller than 0. 22 micrometers. Thus, small viral aggregates or viruses attached to submicron particles represented the major portion of solids-associated virus in treated sewage...|$|R
5|$|According {{to coach}} McKay, the team’s {{progress}} was set back as {{they spent the}} preseason {{trying to find out}} which veterans would develop into regulars, but found that the younger players were better. This meant that the team started over from the beginning as the regular season began. The tone for the season seemed to be set as the team got lost in the Houston Astrodome when leaving the locker room to take the field for their opening game. They spent 20 minutes trying to find their way out, and barely made it to the field in time for the opening kickoff. The team started out <b>with</b> <b>solid</b> defensive play, ranking in the top 10 until injuries began to set in. They began to wear out as the Buccaneers’ offensive ineptitude meant that the defense {{spent a lot of time}} on the field, over 100 plays in some games. Receiver Johnny McKay pointed out the tendency of the offense to feel pressured after a three-and-out possession, with the result that they would press even harder the next time, quickly going three-and-out again. Coach McKay said early on that controlling the ball for 40 percent of the game, as they were, was not long enough to win. Placekicker Mirro Roder was cut after missing three field goals in the first two games, in both of which the Buccaneers were shut out, giving their offense the nickname “Zero Gang”, which stuck with them through a total of eleven shutouts before their first victory as a franchise.|$|E

The Duke–Michigan rivalry {{is fueled by}} the fact that both institutions strive to be premier academic institutions <b>with</b> <b>solid</b> reputations for producing scholars and student athletes rather than just athletic powerhouses. Duke and Michigan have played one another in men's basketball 30 times. The teams have played twice in the same season three times: 1963–64, 1991–92, and 2008–09.

5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found on the floors of canyons and in a few irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, <b>with</b> <b>solid</b> ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.|$|E
