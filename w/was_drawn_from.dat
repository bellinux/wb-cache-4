5|$|The {{title of}} the album <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the book Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster, which Fanning had read during the recording.

5|$|All of the Irish kingdoms {{had their}} own kings but were {{nominally}} subject to the High King. The High King <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> {{the ranks of the}} provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept didn't become a political reality until the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally unifying rule of law: the early written judicial system, the Brehon Laws, administered by a professional class of jurists known as the brehons.|$|E

5|$|As {{the statue}} became {{an object of}} a pagan veneration, missionaries and the Bishop of Vannes Charles de Rosmadec asked Claude de Lannion, Lord of Blavet Quinipily, to destroy the statue. In 1661, Lannion ordered the statue to be thrown into the Blavet river. Abundant rain {{destroyed}} the harvest soon after, which peasantry and devotees interpreted {{as an act of}} anger by their insulted idol. In 1664, the statue <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the river and restored to its original location.|$|E
5|$|In early September, the German Army {{had sent}} a strong force into San Marino to defend it against the Allies; this would also give them control {{of one of the}} major roads in the area, and allow {{artillery}} observers to occupy the mountain peaks.

5|$|Most of the {{northern}} towers stand had four-storeys including a basements. The Eagle Tower at the western corner of the castle was the grandest. It has three turrets which were once surmounted by statues of eagles. The tower contained grand lodgings, and was probably built for Sir Otton de Grandson, the first justiciar of Wales. A basement level contained a water gate, through which visitors travelling up the River Seiont could enter the castle. Water <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a well in the eponymous Well Tower.|$|E

The ABA Specialist Group was intended to bring together studies taking place in a number of Australian forums and investigate potential options and policies relating to digital television.|$|E

5|$|Straczynski {{spent a year}} {{researching the}} story after hearing about the Wineville Chicken Coop case from a contact at Los Angeles City Hall. Almost all of the film's script <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> {{thousands}} of pages of documentation. His first draft became the shooting script; it was his first film screenplay to be produced. Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer produced Changeling alongside Malpaso Productions' Robert Lorenz and Eastwood. Universal Pictures financed and distributed the film.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Army was a Royal Yugoslav Army {{formation}} mobilised {{prior to}} the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II. It <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the peacetime 4th Army District. When mobilised, it consisted of three divisions, a brigade-strength detachment, one horse cavalry regiment and one independent infantry regiment. It formed part of the 1st Army Group, and was responsible for defending a large section of the Yugoslav–Hungarian border, being deployed behind the Drava river between Varaždin and Slatina.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. It would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, creatures who travel through time in sleeping units that look like sarcophagi. The name Nephilim <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the Old Testament and from various Jewish writings, where it refers {{to a kind of}} demon. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener.|$|E

5|$|Concept {{work for}} Xenosaga Episode III began during the later {{development}} of Xenosaga Episode II in 2004. The development team's {{aim was to}} address issues raised by fans and staff with the previous two Xenosaga games, along with bringing the story to a satisfactory conclusion. Due to the decision to turn the intended six-part series into a trilogy, the original draft for Episode III was substantially reworked. As with previous Xenosaga titles, the subtitle <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. While the game was praised by critics {{and went on to}} sell over 340,000 copies worldwide, the mixed response to the Xenosaga series as a whole left Monolith Soft staff in a state of low morale, partially leading to the development of Xenoblade Chronicles.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Borduria {{was based on}} Eastern Bloc countries. Their police force was modelled on the Soviet KGB. Hergé named the political leader of Borduria Plekszy-Gladz, a pun on plexiglas, although the English translators renamed him Kûrvi-Tasch ("curvy tash"), {{a reference to the}} fact that the leader's curved moustache, inspired by that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, was a prominent symbol in Borduria. As evidence for the accuracy of Hergé's {{depiction of}} an Eastern Bloc city, Farr highlighted that Borduria's Kûrvi-Tasch Platz closely resembled East Berlin's Platz der Republik, which would only be completed in the 1970s. All of the furniture in the Bordurian police headquarters <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> that found in the Studios Hergé premises.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1940s, {{the club}} invented {{the notion of}} penyes, a mix between a fan club and a {{financial}} support club, {{during a time when}} the club was in need of financial and public support in face of the hostility of Francisco Franco's dictatorship. The first Penya Solera, was formed in 1944 by a group of supporters and former players of the team. The penyes would later exhibit their financial prowess in 1953, when they proposed the building of the Camp Nou. Inspiration <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the financial plan Athletic Bilbao, a rival team, used to build San Mamés, where an association of penyes pledged to finance the construction. As a result, the subsequent construction of the stadium put the club into its supporters' hands, giving the penyes political influence over the club, which still lasts today.|$|E

The {{majority of the}} fleet was supplied by the UK, which provided 892 warships and 3,261 landing craft. There were 195,700 naval personnel involved. The invasion fleet was split into the Western Naval Task Force (under Admiral Alan G Kirk) supporting the American sectors and the Eastern Naval Task Force (under Admiral Sir Philip Vian) in the British and Canadian sectors. Available to the fleet were five battleships, 20 cruisers, 65 destroyers, and two monitors. German ships in the area on D-Day included three torpedo boats, 29 fast attack craft, 36 R boats, and 36 minesweepers and patrol boats. The Germans also had several U-boats available, and all the approaches had been heavily mined.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenery and}} {{background}} of the story was meticulously copied from existing sources; car model types like the Opel Olympia 38 in which Calculus' abductors escaped the police were drawn from real examples, while Hergé closely adhered {{to the reality of}} the port and docks at Saint-Nazaire. Professor Tarragon's house <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> a real house in Avenue Delleur, Boitsfort, which Jacobs had identified for Hergé's purposes. Hergé and Jacobs stationed themselves outside the house and completed a sketch of the building. Immediately after, two grey cars containing German soldiers pulled up; the house had been requisitioned by the Schutzstaffel (SS). Hergé realised that, had he and Jacobs been discovered sketching, they would have been interrogated.|$|E
5|$|Abaoji, {{who later}} became Emperor Taizu of Liao, was born in 872, {{the son of the}} chief of the Yila tribe. At that time, the Yila tribe was the largest and strongest of the eight {{affiliated}} Khitan tribes; however, the Great Khan, the overall leader of the Khitans, <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>from</b> the Yaolian lineage. In 901 Abaoji was elected to be the chief of the Yila tribe by its tribal council. By 903, Abaoji had been named the Yüyue, the overall military leader of the Khitans, subordinate only to the Great Khan. Four years later, in 907, Abaoji became the Great Khan of the Khitans, ending nine generations of Yaolian rule. Abaoji acquired the prestige needed to secure the position of Khitan Great Khan through a combination of effective diplomacy and a series of successful military campaigns, beginning in 901, against the Han Chinese forces to the south, the Xi and Shiwei to the west, and the Jurchens in the east.|$|E
