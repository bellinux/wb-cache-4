5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that judges were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it but routinely ignored the code.|$|E
5|$|The British {{followed}} the main raids and <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> all the approaching aircraft, {{save for the}} low-altitude 9 Staffel. The radar station near Dover began reporting a build-up over the Pas-de-Calais area. This activity increased until 12:45 when six separate concentrations were reported.

5|$|Ahead of the storm, the JMA issued 99typhoon bulletins, warning {{residents}} about Mireille. There were 236warnings {{related to}} storm surge, high winds, waves, and flooding. In Hiroshima, most residents <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the approaching storm, about 70% of residents {{did not expect}} significant effects. In general, residents were unprepared for the storm, {{partly due to the}} lack of recent storms. Transportation in Japan was disrupted after 480domestic flights cancelled, stranding 58,000individuals, and road, rail, and ferry traffic was halted. In Hokkaido, 207schools were closed due to the storm.|$|E

Vorster had avoided international condemnation as he had not publicly declared D'Oliveira unacceptable, but his stand had been clearly conveyed to London in private.|$|E

The survivors, some of them wounded and all of them female, were mostly brought to Gens, and perhaps to the Judenrat, to whom they relayed their stories. Gens urged them to keep quiet, and some of the wounded were kept in the hospital to prevent them from repeating their stories. Knowledge of the massacres at Ponary became common in the ghetto by late December 1941 or early January 1942.|$|E

Some who knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but had never seen his father conduct a service.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{fighting}} with the Partisans intensified. Not only had they liberated a substantial territory {{in the eastern part}} of Yugoslavia, but they encouraged rebellion all over the country. The German, Italian and NDH governments <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this danger and they used every means available to destroy the Partisan forces. They planned several large-scale operations for this purpose in which air support played a very important role.|$|E

In Europe, several further cases of intersexuality were documented, {{although there is}} no evidence that the photographers <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Nadar's work. In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E
5|$|Pierce fully {{expected}} to be renominated by the Democrats. In reality his chances of winning the nomination were slim, let alone re-election. The administration was widely disliked in the North for its position on the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and Democratic leaders <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Pierce's electoral vulnerability. Nevertheless, his supporters began to plan for an alliance with Douglas to deny James Buchanan the nomination. Buchanan had solid political connections and had been safely overseas through most of Pierce's term, leaving him untainted by the Kansas debacle.|$|E
5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in civilian life. They were denied {{the benefits of the}} G.I.

Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E

5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the German troops did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of,</b> or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline German troops were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to an {{effective}} intelligence network, British officials and their American Indian allies <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Clark's planned expedition {{as early as}} February 1781. In April, a council was held at Detroit in order to prepare a defense. The commander at Detroit was Major Arent DePeyster, Henry Hamilton's replacement, who reported to Sir Frederick Haldimand, the Governor of the Province of Quebec. DePeyster used agents of the British Indian Department such as Alexander McKee and Simon Girty, both of whom had close relations with American Indians of the Ohio Country, to coordinate British and Indian military operations.|$|E
5|$|The Falklands {{remained}} uninhabited {{until the}} 1764 establishment of Port Louis on East Falkland by French captain Louis Antoine de Bougainville, and the 1766 foundation of Port Egmont on Saunders Island by British captain John MacBride. Whether {{or not the}} settlements <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> each other's existence is debated by historians. In 1766, France surrendered its claim on the Falklands to Spain, which renamed the French colony Puerto Soledad the following year. Problems began when Spain discovered and captured Port Egmont in 1770. War was narrowly avoided by its restitution to Britain in 1771.|$|E
