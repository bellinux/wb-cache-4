5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic <b>wave</b> <b>in</b> vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the <b>wave.</b> <b>In</b> 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS: Propagation of {{disturbances}} in various media (gaseous, liquid, and solid) {{is familiar to}} everyone in forms such as transmission of sound and radio waves, spreading of ripples, and transmission of seismic tremors in the earth. These phenomena share many common features of wave propagation, despite of sufficient differences in physics. This course focuses on propagation of mechanical <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> solids. The subjects range from elementary theories for one-dimensional <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> strings to three-dimensional theories for <b>waves</b> and vibrations <b>in</b> plates. Along with theoretical development, experimental results and practical applications are presented for better physical appreciation of wave propagations. TOPICS: • Fundamental equations of elastodynamics • Transverse <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> strings • Longitudinal, torsional, and flexural <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> rods • <b>Waves</b> <b>in</b> infinite solids • Plane <b>waves</b> <b>in</b> semi-infinite solids (reflection and refraction at surfaces and interfaces) • <b>Waves</b> and vibrations <b>in</b> plates (elastic <b>wave</b> guides) • Approximate plate theories (classical theories for beams, membranes, and thin plates...|$|R

In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series Thomas & Friends, a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W.

Claudette remained a tropical storm until just before making landfall in Port O'Connor, Texas, when it quickly strengthened to a strong Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

After several days, Florence encountered an area of lesser wind shear and intensified into a hurricane on September10. It passed just west of Bermuda while recurving northeastward, and on September13 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
