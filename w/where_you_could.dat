You could choose which version of Xtra you visited using a front screen called Xtra Theme Park. XWorld was a virtual world <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> click on virtual buildings {{to perform functions}} (such as searching via Yahoo!). Text World was a simpler interface using just text for slower modems.|$|E
25|$|BC {{was perhaps}} the hardest Canadian {{province}} hit by the depression. Although Vancouver managed to stave off bankruptcy, other cities in the Lower Mainland were not so lucky, such as North Vancouver and Burnaby. Vancouver also {{happened to be the}} target destination for thousands of transients – unemployed young men – who traveled across Canada looking for work, often by hopping on boxcars. This {{was the end of the}} line and had for years been a “Mecca of the Unemployed” because, as some cynically joked, it was the only city in Canada <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> starve to death before freezing to death. “Hobo jungles” sprouted up in the earliest days of the depression, where men built makeshift shanty towns out of whatever they could find (or steal). The largest of these was shut down allegedly for being unsanitary. Vancouver was also the launching pad for the Communist-led unemployed protests that frequented the city throughout the decade, culminating in the relief camp strike and the On-to-Ottawa Trek in 1935. Communist agitators and their supporters also led strikes in other industries, most notably the 1935 waterfront strike, and organized a large proportion of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion from Vancouver to fight fascism in the Spanish Civil War as Canada’s (unofficial) contribution to the International Brigades.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Levine was {{mentioned}} {{in a hostile}} work environment lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by an unnamed security guard who claimed that Universal Music Publishing Group's Santa Monica location was [...] "infiltrated with pervasive drug use <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> smell marijuana seeping from various offices and openly used in common areas, and lounges". The guard claimed that when she complained about the cannabis smoke coming {{from one of the}} studios, she was told that [...] "it's Adam Levine ... if he wants to come to the lobby and do a line of cocaine on the floor, it's OK". In an official statement to The Hollywood Reporter, UMPG described the allegations as [...] "absurd".|$|E

I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were {{subsequently}} charged with drug offences. Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize {{that this was a}} whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do anything you wanted."

500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The first thing {{we wanted to do}} is make a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked to}} {{summarise}} hotels in London {{in the early}} 1920s, Barbara Cartland remarked that [...] "The Ritz stood for stuffiness and standards, the Carlton was for businessman, the Savoy was rather fast, some other ones were frankly scandalous, and the Berkeley, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> dance all night for ten shillings, was for the young". In 1921, Bonvin, {{the manager of the}} Ritz, died, and was replaced with J.S. Walters. Walter was a [...] "tireless salesman" [...] in promoting the hotel, especially in mainland Europe, and flaunted the hotel in the Tatler {{at a time when it}} was unpopular to do so. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma frequented the Ritz from his time as a Sub-Lieutenant onwards, and when his friend Charlie Chaplin arrived in London in September 1921 after a nine-year absence, great crowds gathered at Waterloo station and Chaplin had to be ushered to the hotel by some 40 policemen. He stayed in the first-floor Regal Suite and was photographed throwing carnations to his fans from the Arlington Street balcony.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, while {{attending}} the successful revival of The King and I, Chinese-American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived {{and decided to}} work on Flower Drum Song. [...] To Chinese Americans, the musical [...] "represented political incorrectness incarnate. [...] But [...] had a secret soft spot for the movie version. 'It {{was kind of a}} guilty pleasure ... and one of the only big Hollywood films <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen, singing and dancing and cracking jokes.'" [...] Ted Chapin, president of the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, announced that an unnamed [...] "Asian playwright" [...] had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song. [...] Chapin called the musical [...] "a naive, old fashioned, anti-feminist story with a truly great score.... It's one that ... needs changes." [...] Rodgers' will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to (Hammerstein's instructions are unknown), but during her lifetime, his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays. [...] Hwang's involvement was soon revealed, and in 1997, C. Y. Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval.|$|E

500|$|... "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] {{feature the}} first {{substantial}} {{appearance of the}} Lich, the series' primary antagonist, who made an early appearance in the season one episode [...] "His Hero" [...] being defeated by Billy in a flashback. The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series' pitch bible, which Ward himself had created in 2007. Ward's original drawing was re-designed by former creative director McHale; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried-up look, and was instrumental in crafting the Lich's rotting appearance. In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears, the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman. The snail, an easter egg that appears in every episode, appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part. Originally, the snail {{was inspired by the}} in-jokes in episodes of The Simpsons, and was Ward's attempt to [...] "make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time, <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> freeze-frame and find things in the background", such as the snail. However, in [...] "Mortal Folly", the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich's escape. The snail would also play an important part in other mythology-heavy episodes like [...] "In Your Footsteps", and [...] "The Lich". Osborne later noted that the snail's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by David Mould was filmed entirely in black-and-white in Plaça de Sant Felip Neri, Gothic Quarter (Barri Gòtic), Barcelona on October 10, 2003. Lee described {{the place of}} the filming during an interview with MTV News: [...] "We did it in a cool, old area of town. We shot some of it at this scenic point, and there was a rooftop <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see Barcelona below. It was really neat." [...] The version of the song used on the video is different from the one off the record, with the band entering the song {{at the end of the}} bridge and a string arrangement by David Campbell. [...] Evanescence wanted the band version to be on the album as well, but [...] "the label was stuck on the demo and wouldn't let us use the version we really wanted. We fought back and forth about it and finally we gave in, but we were all so angry about it." [...] The video was filmed two weeks before Ben Moody's departure from the band. Amy Lee admitted that the visuals in the video were [...] "striking in retrospect", but added that the similarities between what was filmed and Moody's departure were coincidental: [...] "We shot it in Barcelona about a week before Ben left the band unexpectedly. I think none of us knew, including him, that he was going anywhere. And when we got the video back and watched it, it was right after he had left. And it's bizarre how much the video is about that. We all sat there with goose bumps, like, 'Holy crap. We've got to watch that again.'" [...] In an interview with the British magazine Rock Sound, Lee further explained the concept which was related with his departure: ...|$|E

Nixon also dismissed potential policies involving forced evacuations, saying [...] "There used to be policies <b>where</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> make people leave but we're talking about adults."
