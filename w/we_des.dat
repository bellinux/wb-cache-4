40|$|Introduction The Absolute Block System (ABS) of railway {{signalling}} {{was developed}} in Britain during the 19 th century and refined {{during the first half}} of the 20 th century [1, 2]. Although largely superseded 1 by fully electronic systems, ABS represents an interesting case study in the modelling of a distributed concurrent system. 2 Background: The Absolute Block System Most railways operate what is known as double line working, that is, railway lines run in parallel and each line carries trains in a particular direction. In normal working this arrangement eliminates the potential for head-on collisions. However, additional constraints are required in order to prevent other kinds of accidents, e. g. one train running into the rear of another which has broken down. ABS is a signalling system which aims to prevent such accidents. In the following sections <b>we</b> <b>des...</b>|$|E
