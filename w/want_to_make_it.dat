Sessions proved to {{be difficult for the}} band as Wentz started taking LSD when Zach Blair lead guitarist for Rise Against made him try it at a party in April 2008. The goal in Wentz using LSD was to hope it would influence his songwriting, but it just made him distracted from writing songs, which annoyed Stump, so he stopped using LSD in August 2008. Wentz later said he had taken LSD over 50 times. Stump called the making of the album [...] "painful", noting that he and Wentz quarreled over many issues, revealing [...] "I threw something across the room over a major-to-minor progression." [...] On previous albums, Trohman felt he and Hurley did not have enough musical freedom and that Stump and Wentz exerted too much control over the group: [...] "I felt, 'Man, this isn't my band anymore.' It's no one's fault, and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> seem that way. It was more of a complex I developed based off of stuff I was reading. It's hard to hear, 'Joe and Andy are just along for the ride.'" [...] To amend the situation, Trohman sat down with Stump to communicate his concerns, which led to more collaboration on Folie à Deux.

[...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E
