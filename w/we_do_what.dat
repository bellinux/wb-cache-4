500|$|On May 12, 2009, Webb sent {{a message}} to his email mailing list stating that his next album Stockholm Syndrome was deemed too {{controversial}} for his record label to release. [...] "It seems I've finally found the line beyond which my label can support me, and apparently I've crossed it," [...] Webb writes. [...] "t this point we're not sure when the record will come out and in what form. The majority of the controversy is surrounding one song, which I consider to be among the most important songs on the record …. ecause of various legal/publishing issues we're having to be rather careful with how <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we're going to do next.".|$|E
500|$|... "Candy Shop" [...] is a mid-tempo {{dancefloor}} track. The {{song was}} produced by Scott Storch, who took influence from Middle Eastern music. The track samples The Salsoul Orchestra's [...] "Love Break". The production was described by IGN as having a [...] "Middle Eastern tinge" [...] with synthesized strings that [...] "unleash a darkly atonal whirl that sounds too much like something either Timbaland or The Neptunes or Mannie Fresh have concocted". The Guardian wrote that the production contains [...] "wan-sounding imitations of the Neptunes' sparse, breathy funk". PopMatters described the bridge as being [...] "relaxed yet faintly ominous" [...] with 50 Cent and Olivia crooning: [...] "Girl what <b>we</b> <b>do</b> (<b>what</b> we do) / And where we do (and where we do) / The things we do (things we do) / Are just between me and you (oh yeah)." [...] Rolling Stone noted the chorus for 50 Cent's [...] "amateur-sounding tenor croon".|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the songs}} on Cannibal are of the dance-pop genre, [...] while some of its songs {{incorporate}} elements of electro and electropop in its production and beats. Throughout the album, the use of Auto-Tune and vocoders are prominent. The album's title track, [...] "Cannibal", makes use of synth and dance driven backings while Kesha sings about maneater tendencies and makes a reference to serial-killer, Jeffrey Dahmer. Present throughout the song are snippets of Kesha yodeling. [...] "Blow" [...] shows a darker side of Kesha with lyrics like: [...] "We get what we want/ <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you don't." [...] The song is more dominantly an electro infused track that uses a synth beat backing. Vocally the song uses snippets of Kesha's yodeling, combined with heavy use of auto-tune. [...] "Sleazy" [...] changes pace from Kesha's normally persistent [...] "talk-singing" [...] vocal style, to a more rap driven style. She raps over a thundering bass line and ticking beat backing, while the song speaks of wealthy men hitting on Kesha, trying to buy her attention. The song has been cited for drawing influence from multiple songs including; Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] for its [...] "swagga", Jennifer Lopez's [...] "Love Don't Cost a Thing" [...] for its [...] "attitude", as well as combining [...] "a touch of Lil Wayne's [...] "Milli".|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} Cannibal, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine positively {{wrote that}} [...] "Blow" [...] was an undeniable [...] "stuttery club track". Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix {{wrote that the}} song was a [...] "club banger" [...] and that Kesha portrayed a bratty and cultural irritant attitude throughout the song referencing to the line, [...] "We are taking over — get used to it!" [...] Brockman commented that the song [...] "sends a shiver down your spine" [...] further complimenting the production of Dr. Luke. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News wrote that the song featured common Kesha elements citing her carpe diem attitude and grinding beats but noted that the lyrics also portrayed a darker side of Kesha, referring to the line, [...] "We get what we want/ <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> you don't." [...] Vena also wrote that the song contained a [...] "scream-along party-anthem chorus". Scott Shetler from AOL Radio felt that Kesha's lyrical [...] delivery was both sassy and brash. In a separate review from AOL Radio, the song was ranked at position nine on the website's list of [...] "10 Best Songs of 2011". The review concluded that Kesha's strongest songwriting skills pertained to party anthems. The review compared the song to previous singles, [...] "Tik Tok" [...] and [...] "We R Who We R".|$|E
2500|$|Maggie Smith {{is portrayed}} as an actress who prefers to work from home (or not work at all). Smith's {{portrayal}} was inspired by an incident that reportedly {{took place on the}} set of Downton Abbey. Ullman: [...] " [...] I heard a rumour that one day she was miserable on the show and they said, 'Maggie, what can <b>we</b> <b>do?</b> <b>What</b> can we do to make you more comfortable?' And she went, [...] 'Write me a death scene.'" ...|$|E

His UK publisher, Jamie Byng, called him [...] "one of the most inspiring people I've ever met". On hearing of the death, R singer Usher stated: [...] "I just learned {{of the loss of}} a very important poet...R.I.P., Gil Scott-Heron. The revolution will be live!!". Richard Russell, who produced Scott-Heron's final studio album, called him a [...] "father figure of sorts to me", while Eminem stated: [...] "He influenced all of hip-hop". Lupe Fiasco wrote a poem about Scott-Heron that was published on his website.|$|E

2500|$|As {{additional}} tests are discussed for {{addition to the}} panels, issues arise. [...] Many question if the expanded testing still falls under the requirements necessary to justify the {{additional tests}}. [...] Many of the new diseases being tested for are rare and have no known treatment, {{while some of the}} diseases need not be treated until later in life. [...] This raises more issues, such as: if there is no available treatment for the disease should we test for it at all? And if <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> <b>what</b> do we tell the families of those with children bearing one of the untreatable diseases? Studies show that the more rare the disease is and the more diseases being tested for, the more likely the tests are to produce false-positives. This is an issue because the newborn period is a crucial time for the parents to bond with the child, and it has been noted that ten percent of parents whose children were diagnosed with a false-positive still worried that their child was fragile and/or sickly even though they were not, potentially preventing the parent-child bond forming as it would have otherwise. As a result, some parents may begin to opt out of having their newborns screened. Many parents are also concerned about what happens with their infant's blood samples after screening. The samples were originally taken to test for preventable diseases, but with the advance in genomic sequencing technologies many samples are being kept for DNA identification and research, increasing the possibility that more children will be opted out of newborn screening from parents who see the kept samples as a form of research done on their child.|$|E
2500|$|The {{clash between}} order and chaos, {{and the people}} caught in between, plays an {{important}} role in Babylon 5. The conflict between two unimaginably powerful older races, the Vorlons and the Shadows, is represented as a battle between two competing ideologies, each seeking to turn the humans and the other younger races to their beliefs. The Vorlons represent an authoritarian philosophy: you will do what we tell you to, because we tell you to do it. The Vorlon question, [...] "Who are you?" [...] focuses on identity as a catalyst for shaping personal goals; the intention is not to solicit a correct answer, but to [...] "tear down the artifices we construct around ourselves until we're left facing ourselves, not our roles." [...] The Shadows represent another authoritarian philosophy cloaked in a disguise of evolution through fire (as shown in the episode in which Sheridan goes to Z'ha'dum and when he refuses to cooperate, Justin tells him: [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>what</b> we're told... and so will you!"), of sowing the seeds of conflict in order to engender progress. The question the Shadows ask is [...] "What do you want?" [...] In contrast to the Vorlons, they place personal desire and ambition first, using it to shape identity, encouraging conflict between groups who choose to serve their own glory or profit. The representation of order and chaos was informed by the Babylonian myth that the universe was born in the conflict between both. The climax of this conflict comes with the younger races' exposing of the Vorlons' and the Shadows' [...] "true faces" [...] and the rejection of both philosophies, heralding the dawn of a new age without their interference.|$|E
