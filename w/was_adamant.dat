5|$|Asa Gray (November 18, 1810 – January 30, 1888) is {{considered}} the most important American botanist of the 19thcentury. His Darwiniana was considered an important explanation of how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive. Gray <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that a genetic connection must exist between all members of a species. He was also strongly opposed to the ideas of hybridization within one generation and special creation {{in the sense of}} its not allowing for evolution, as he felt evolution was guided by a Creator.|$|E
5|$|Despite these setbacks, Simonds <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that Verrières Ridge {{should be}} taken and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to {{stabilise}} the precarious Allied position. Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich's armoured formations {{and by the time}} the operation was called off, Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge, including a now secure position on Point67. Four German divisions still held the ridge. In all, the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1,300 Allied casualties.|$|E
5|$|He was a {{relative}} late-comer to competitive running: {{in his late}} teens, scouts from a local athletics club suggested that his cycling stamina might translate to running and invited him to compete. He won the race and was spurred on by the victory to start taking the sport seriously and focus on running. Zersenay <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that his early years in cycling {{had given him a}} firm foundation for endurance running.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{explained}} that he instantly liked the song, but listened to it twice before making his final decision. Although the song was written by Kelly, Jackson <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that the production should be a collaborative effort amongst the two musicians. The tape sent to him had no harmony or modulations, so Jackson added a choir in the final portion and added a sense of climax and structure to the final piece. The song has a tempo of 60 beats per minute, {{making it one of}} Jackson's slowest songs.|$|E
5|$|The Temenggong and Sultan Ali {{submitted}} their {{proposals to}} the British Governor in April 1854. The Temenggong {{agreed to the}} Sultan's request of his titular recognition as the Sultan of Johor, but <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> of maintaining absolute charge over the whole of Johor. On the other hand, Sultan Ali had expressed his wish to the governor that the Kesang territory (around Muar) should be directly governed by him, citing reasons {{that some of his}} ancestors were buried there. The British persuaded the Temenggong to concede to Sultan Ali's request and accepted after much consideration.|$|E
5|$|Their debut studio album, Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M., was {{recorded}} over three daytime sessions in March 1964 and released in October. The album contains four original Simon compositions, {{with the remainder}} consisting of three traditional folk songs and five folk-influenced singer-songwriter numbers. Simon <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that they would no longer use stage names, and they adopted the name Simon & Garfunkel. Columbia set up a promotional showcase at Folk City on March 31, 1964, the duo's first public concert as Simon & Garfunkel. The showcase, {{as well as other}} scheduled performances, did not go well.|$|E

5|$|After his death, MGM {{tried to}} {{continue}} with Romance of the Pink Panther and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently turned back to Blake Edwards, who <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> not to recast the character, feeling certain {{that no one could}} adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released Trail of the Pink Panther, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three Panther films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million today), plus 3.15 per cent of the film's profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.|$|E
5|$|Akira is an effeminate {{male with}} a crush Nanako Momoi. After exchanging bodies with her, his {{personality}} and Nanako's feminine appearance causes his popularity to soar. His best friend, Shinnosuke Senbongi, learns his secret and becomes enamored {{with his new}} appearance. Initially, Akira <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> on returning to his body and maintaining his masculinity. During the series, he reluctantly reconciles Shinnosuke's feelings and upon realizing everyone is happier with the new statusquo, resigns to live in Nanako's body. He is voiced by Kenji Nojima in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Shun Shioya in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|At first, Queen Victoria opposed any {{engagement}} because Hélène was Roman Catholic. Victoria {{wrote to}} her grandson suggesting another of her grandchildren, Princess Margaret of Prussia, as a suitable alternative, but nothing came of her suggestion, and once Albert Victor and Hélène confided their love to her, the Queen relented and supported the proposed marriage. Hélène offered to convert to the Church of England, and Albert Victor offered to renounce his succession rights to marry her. To the couple's disappointment, her father refused to countenance the marriage and <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> she could not convert. Hélène travelled personally to intercede with Pope Leo XIII but he confirmed her father's verdict, and the courtship ended. She later became the Duchess of Aosta.|$|E

5|$|Before the Beatles {{achieved}} nationwide {{success in}} Britain, Epstein had permitted {{a small company}} (run by his cousins, and which initially catered only to fan club members) to produce Beatles' sweaters for 30 shillings and badges for six pence, eventually selling 15,000 sweaters and 50,000 badges as the Beatles' popularity grew. When Beatlemania stormed the UK in 1963, Epstein was besieged by novelty goods companies wanting to use The Beatles' name and images on plastic guitars, drums, disc racks, badges, belts and a huge variety of assorted merchandise. Epstein <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that the Beatles would not directly endorse any product, but through NEMS Enterprises he would grant discretionary licences to companies {{who were able to}} produce a quality product at a fair price, although many companies were already selling products without a licence.|$|E
5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and fall in the public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E

5|$|For La belle Hélène, Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to {{play the}} title role. Since her early success in his short operas, {{she had become a}} leading star of the French musical stage. She now {{commanded}} large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that no other singer could match her as Hélène. Rehearsals for the premiere at the Théâtre des Variétés were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.|$|E
5|$|In a troop {{movement}} that took all {{night on a}} makeshift raft, the Texian army crossed Buffalo Bayou at Lynchburg April 19 with 930 soldiers, leaving behind 255 others as guards or for reasons of illness. The idea had been floated of leaving the Twin Sisters behind as protection, but Neill <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that the cannons be taken into the battle. In an April 20 skirmish {{the day before the}} main battle Neill was severely wounded, and George Hockley took command of the heavy artillery. Estimates of the Mexican army troop strength {{on the day of the}} main battle range from 1,250 to 1,500.|$|E
5|$|Judah fought WBA (Super) {{champion}} Amir Khan in a unification bout on July 23, 2011 at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino, Las Vegas. Judah {{was knocked}} out by Khan in the 5th round after Khan landed an uppercut body shot. Judah was unable to answer the referee's 10 count, thus recording his 7th career loss. Khan was ahead 40-36 on all three judges score cards {{at the time of}} the knock out. Judah <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> that the body shot should have been called low and claimed that he had been expecting a mandatory five-minute recovery period.|$|E

5|$|Michelangelo, {{who was not}} {{primarily}} a painter but a sculptor, was reluctant {{to take on the}} work. Also, he was occupied with a very large sculptural commission for the pope's own tomb. The pope <b>was</b> <b>adamant,</b> leaving Michelangelo no choice but to accept. But a war with the French broke out, diverting the attention of the pope, and Michelangelo fled from Rome to continue sculpting. The tomb sculptures, however, were never to be finished because in 1508 the pope returned to Rome victorious and summoned Michelangelo to begin work on the ceiling. The contract was signed on 10 May 1508.|$|E
5|$|Wirkola got {{the idea}} to create a film based on the adult lives of Hansel and Gretel in 2007 while at film school in Australia. After being {{discovered}} by Gary Sanchez Productions, Wirkola pitched the idea at a meeting with Paramount Pictures and won a contract. Production began in March 2011 at the Babelsberg Studios in Germany and included extensive use of traditional special effects. In addition, Renner and Arterton had a month of training beforehand {{to prepare for the}} physical demands of their roles. In terms of the weapons and wardrobe, Wirkola wanted an old-world look with a modern touch, and he <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> about filming outdoors in European nature rather than in a studio. The project was filmed in Germany and featured an international cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|He {{is said to}} have meditated {{motionless}} in a standing posture (kayotsarga) for a year, during which time climbing plants grew around his legs. However, he <b>was</b> <b>adamant</b> and continued his practice unmindful of the vines, ants, and dust that enveloped his body. According to Jain text Ādi purāṇa, {{on the last day of}} Bahubali's one year long fast, Bharata came in all humility to Bahubali and worshiped him with veneration and respect. A painful regret that he had been the cause of his elder brother's humiliation had been disturbing Bahubali's meditation; this was dispersed when Bharata worshipped him. Bahubali was then able to destroy the four kinds of inimical karmas, including the knowledge obscuring karma, and he attained omniscience (kevala gyana). He was now revered as an omniscient being (Kevali). Bahubali finally attained liberation (moksha) and became a pure, liberated soul (siddha). He is said to be the first Digambara monk to have attained moksha in the present half-cycle of time (Avasarpiṇī).|$|E
