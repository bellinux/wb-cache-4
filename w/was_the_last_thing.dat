25|$|The {{winter of}} 1944–1945, {{known as the}} Hongerwinter (hunger winter), was severe, {{and there was a}} great lack of food, {{especially}} in the big cities.

25|$|The last contact Tobares {{had with}} someone was at 12:32p.m. on June 5, 2013, {{the day he}} disappeared. He was {{speaking}} to Verónica Román, a friend from Argentina. While on the phone, Tobares {{explained that he was}} doing Gerardo a favor by driving a vehicle from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara and exchanging it for another of his boss' preference. He told Verónica that they were guiding him along the way, but {{said he did not know}} where he was, that he was scared, and that the whole situation seemed strange to him. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> Tobares said to Verónica.|$|E
500|$|Boycott and Denness {{did not get}} on well, {{and at the end}} of {{the tour}} they clashed over Boycott's {{preference}} for a one-day match over a three-day game against Bermuda. Boycott recalled in his autobiography that when Denness confronted him on the issue he replied [...] "Get out of here before I do something I'll regret." [...] Boycott had [...] "no confidence in Denness's professional ability and no respect for him as a man and another tour like the previous one to the West Indies <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|When Madonna {{recorded}} it, even as our demo faded out, on the fade {{you could}} hear Tom saying, [...] "When your heart beats, and you hold me, and you love me..." [...] That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> you heard as our demo faded. Madonna must have listened to it very, very carefully because her record ends with the exact same little ad-libs that our demo did. That rarely happens that someone studies your demo so carefully that they use all that stuff. We were sort of flattered how carefully she followed our demo on that.|$|E
2500|$|All I can {{remember}} is, Bob Willis had this big inswinging, in-dipping action," [...] Darling says. [...] "The ball was pitched well outside off stump <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I remember. Once it swung in, it also cut in further. I {{was caught in}} no man's land. I was sort of caught out of position, and hit in the chest. Unfortunately, at the time, I was chewing a chewy, and I swallowed my tongue and chewy as well. That caused me to black out.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the Mishnah in Pesahim 119b, the afikoman is a {{substitute}} for the Passover sacrifice, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> eaten at the Passover Seder during the eras of the First and Second Temples and during the period of the Tabernacle. The Talmud states that it is forbidden to have [...] "afikoman" [...] after eating the meal, so that the taste of the matzo that was eaten during the meal remains in our mouths. Since the destruction of the Temple and the discontinuation of the Korban Pesach, Jews eat a piece of matzo now known as afikomen to finish the Passover Seder meal.|$|E

2500|$|... "Stool Pigeon" [...] was {{inspired}} by a newspaper article Darnell had read about a former Mafia boss who had been let out of jail after providing information about his former colleagues, and had now had his identity changed and protected by the FBI. Darnell said, [...] "I actually had compassion for the guy. I thought, wow, what a way to go. And I could understand why he did it. He sold out for the money and the comfort, I guess the very things that had brought him into the underworld." [...] The song also features Darnell's attempt at the then newly fashionable art of rapping—he later confessed, [...] "That's just me goofing at being a rapper, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> I ever wanted to do".|$|E
2500|$|The Golden Dome <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> to be finished, {{with the}} [...] iron framework, the panels and the columns {{supporting}} the dome, being added {{during the summer}} of 1882 and the dome itself was finished in September. The statue of Mary was hoisted in October. It was a gift from the sisters of adjacent [...] Saint Mary's College, Notre Dame's sister school. It was gilded in 1886 and crowned with a 19 feet tall statue of [...] "Our Mother", the namesake of the university. The statue was designed and furnished by the girls of the nearby Saint Mary's College; it replicates the pose of the statue of Mary on the Column of the Immaculate Conception in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, erected under Pius IX. It was designed by Chicago artist Giovanni Meli.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2001 Masters, Hunter {{beat his}} {{close friend and}} {{defending}} champion Matthew Stevens 6–5 in the last 16, Peter Ebdon 6–3 in the quarter-finals and Stephen Hendry 6–4 in the semi-finals. In the final Hunter recovered from a 3–7 deficit against Fergal O'Brien to win 10–9. Hunter compiled four centuries in six frames, and earned the £175,000 first prize. In his post-match interview, Hunter caused a media sensation by admitting he resorted to [...] "Plan B" [...] with Lindsey Fell, then his girlfriend, during the interval while 2–6 down. The 'B' in [...] "Plan B" [...] purportedly refers to the word [...] "bonk", a British slang term for sexual intercourse. Hunter and Fell retired to their hotel room and he recalled: [...] "Sex <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> on my mind. I just wasn't in the mood. But I {{had to do something}} to break the tension. It was a quick session – around 10 minutes or so – but I felt great afterwards. She jumped in the bath, I had a kip and then played like a dream. I reeled off four centuries in six frames. I won easily." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several days later, it was {{reported}} that Hayley Erin—who previously appeared as Abby Newman on The Young and the Restless had been hired to recast the role of Kiki Jerome. The network released a statement to wish Alderson well on her career and to confirm Hayley Erin's casting. Alderson herself also congratulated Erin on her casting on Twitter. Erin received a callback after her initial audition to read opposite head writer Ron Carlivati. [...] "It was between me and one other girl" [...] though she was unaware that it was for a recast. After the audition, Erin left the studio and was quickly contacted by her agent and manager instructing her to return to the studio for a wardrobe fitting. [...] "I started crying a little bit" [...] she revealed. Up until a few days before her audition, Erin revealed that a return to daytime after five years <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> on her mind. Erin had just expressed her interest in appearing on another soap and she booked the role of Kiki later that week. In the summer of 2015, rumors circulated that Erin would be replaced by a returning Kristen Alderson. Network executive Nathan Varni denied the rumors and said [...] "I have a lot of faith in the role of Kiki moving forward. Varni also praised the actress and said [...] "I think Hayley [...] is doing a fantastic, admirable job as Kiki." ...|$|E
2500|$|One out {{of twenty}} to twenty-five stories {{received}} each week by 20th Century Fox in 1988, the original screenplay for Alien Nation was submitted as a spec–script to producer Gale Anne Hurd. The agency representing the storyline asked the production staff {{to view it}} {{as quickly as possible}} due to it being submitted to other film studios as well. Both Hurd and her director of development Ellen Collett had the same initial response, seeing the script as a real page-turner. According to Hurd, what really interested her about the film's story was the whole approach to the immigrant setting and the extrapolation of that to a science fiction setting. The genre of science fiction in regards to representing aliens, tends to usually be in the form of one or two beings as shown on network series' like Star Trek. Typically, large numbers of stand-ins were not common in film since the Planet of the Apes picture twenty years earlier. Working with co-producer Richard Kobritz, Hurd secured funding from Fox Studios and began casting an experienced makeup team for the creation of the alien society. Later, Hurd contacted cinematographer Adam Greenberg at his home in Israel to work on the production. Caught by surprise, Greenberg recalled, [...] "I was vacationing on the Dead Sea in a kibbutz (it was 125 degrees) and I got a call from Gale. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> to expect there, ..." [...] Though mostly an action picture, Alien Nation was somewhat of a throwback to other similar genre films such as Planet of the Apes [...] and Silent Running. The alien Newcomers are relegated to a second-class status. Like other minorities, they live in their own neighborhoods, frequent their own clubs and develop their own underground. Following the murder of a policeman, a human must partner up with an alien to solve the murder. Their uneasy alliance creates a social mistrust, dealing with issues such as prejudice and racism. By the end of the saga, the two completely different humanoids have combined their talents and overcome their social barriers to complete their task.|$|E
