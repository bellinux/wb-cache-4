Nashville is {{a nice way to}} fail.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, García Márquez was {{diagnosed}} with lymphatic cancer. Chemotherapy provided by a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful, and the illness went into remission. This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs: [...] "I reduced relations <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> to a minimum, disconnected the telephone, canceled the trips {{and all sorts of}} current and future plans", he told El Tiempo, the Colombian newspaper, [...] "...and locked myself in to write every day without interruption." [...] In 2002, three years later, he published Living to Tell the Tale (Vivir para Contarla), the first volume in a projected trilogy of memoirs.|$|E
500|$|Though it {{was noted}} that even [...] "She" [...] has [...] "passing moments of lyrical {{humanity}} to go with the pliant music ("When I'm <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> I just put on a front / But {{in the back of my}} top I'm writing songs about 'we'"). It's almost like there's boyish innocence lurking underneath all that bile." [...] The Village Voices Eric Harvey mused that the [...] "sinuous Frank Ocean feature [...] "She" [...] ramps up the voyeurism" [...] and noted that he [...] "keeps things within a Rear Window framework. He admits he's going through the dating motions strictly to get laid, but he also says that his violent front is just a show for his boys." ...|$|E

500|$|As a {{child he}} [...] "hoped to be a {{musician}} or a hockey player." [...] At Main Street Elementary School, with {{the encouragement of}} his teacher James Doyle, he developed an interest in writing, serving as editor for his school newspaper. He graduated from West Springfield High School in 1974, having been voted [...] "Most Likely Not to Live Up to Potential" [...] by his classmates, and dropped out of Holyoke Community College after one day, undecided about {{what he wanted to}} do with his life. He took up work in the clothing department at Steiger's department store, as a janitor at the Baystate Medical Center and also as a driving instructor. He commented: [...] "I think if I had actually succeeded at college and gotten a degree in accounting or something, I might have given up too quickly on writing. Having no marketable job skills was a tremendous incentive to keep trying to succeed as a writer." [...] He realized [...] "there probably wasn't going to be a career in riding around <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> listening to Foghat," [...] so Scully decided he [...] "definitely wanted to break into comedy" [...] even though he [...] "really had no reason to believe [...] could succeed." [...] Regardless, he moved to Los Angeles, California in 1982.|$|E
500|$|At age twenty, Del Rey {{signed a}} USD$10,000 {{recording}} contract {{and moved to}} a trailer park in New Jersey. The album that she recorded was later shelved, catalyzing her to pivot her focus. Instead, she began work in community service, and for the next five years, worked at homeless outreach, drug, and alcohol rehabilitation centers. She was quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "The only passionate people I met in New York, were social workers." [...] A few years later, Del Rey signed to 5 Point Records, an independent record label owned by David Kahne. With the label, she released the three-track EP, Kill Kill, in October 2008 and a full-length studio album Lana Del Ray in 2010. After hearing Del Rey's demo, Kahne contacted her; she obliged, knowing his reputation as a producer and his wish to produce music other than pop. Del Rey also explained why she then changed her stage name from Lizzy Grant to Lana Del Rey: [...] "I wanted a name I could shape the music towards. I was going to Miami quite a lot at the time, speaking a lot of Spanish <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> from Cuba – Lana Del Rey reminded us of the glamour of the seaside. It sounded gorgeous coming off the tip of the tongue".|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends.</b> Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

[...] But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking with Prestige Hong Kong, Thicke explained: [...] "The {{new album}} is call Morning Sun. It’s about fresh starts, new beginnings, and the heralding in {{of a new}} day.

[...] Thicke also spoke of working again with Pharrell and Timbaland as well as with new collaborators DJ Mustard, Max Martin, and Ricky Reed. Another new single [...] "Back Together", featuring Nicki Minaj, was released on August 6, 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{that he was}} a bad student, but {{he found}} early on that he would rather immerse himself in arts or {{football}} than attend to his studies. According to his own account: [...] "The good old socialist block of flats I lived in {{was in the middle of}} a magical Bermuda triangle in which I got lost – the stadium, the cinema and the circus. I spent all my time there – playing with a ball, wandering <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> sneaking into the ballerinas' trailers, acting scenes from films I'd just watched, so I often forgot to go home until late at night. The school was something in between, but never became a part of this triangle".|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{these early}} events caused Emin {{to be well}} known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she {{appeared}} on a Channel 4 television programme in 1997. The show comprised a group discussion about that year's Turner Prize and was broadcast live. Emin said she was drunk, slurred and swore before walking out. From the interview: [...] "Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?... They're 25 minutes behind us, think about that... I'm leaving now, I wanna be <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends,</b> I wanna be with my mum.

We was trying to go to the radio and not do the typical R {{featured}} record. I was trying to be more creative and find somebody who can do melody as well as rap on the record. Nelly doesn't really rap on this song, he's singing. He has that different style. That's kind of what the record is. We see that enough: R with a rapper feature. That's why I call this a duet as opposed to a feature".|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{described}} the video's concept, revealing [...] "its just me hanging out <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> {{and going to}} a club. [...] It has the feel of being in an apartment in Tokyo, where every inch of your space is so important, it's used well." [...] Kahn {{described the}} clip's premise as [...] "epic minimalism," [...] saying [...] "I think every music video right now has big sets, big things, big everything, and we're going to see how small {{we can make it}} and still make it big." [...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not just doing what other people are doing, she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me. In doing so, you're taking risks, taking chances, and some people might love it, others may hate hate it, period." ...|$|E

This is what I love.'" [...] She said, [...] "To have all that material and to be there in the moment ... I didn't want to be in any other place." [...] She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment [...] "for a long time," [...] {{it turned out to be}} [...] "a big pay-off." [...] She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, 'This is the moment.' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character's perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, 'This is so important.' Because it was not a big deal for my character — she had no idea what was coming.|$|E

2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> up in our attic from the time I was in the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. You could hardly tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. Both of my parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times." [...] Viglione played bass for a year in a and was exposed to music that played a large and influential role in his playing. [...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paulini uses life {{experiences}} {{her and her}} friends and family have gone through as inspiration for writing songs, and tries to keep the lyrics as honest as possible. She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects I was told to do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just kind of go, 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it's what I've gone through, or what I’ve interpreted {{from my point of view}} with other situations <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>friends</b> and family." ...|$|E
