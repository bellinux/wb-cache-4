5|$|In 1913, Queen Mary asked Garrard & Co. {{to make a}} copy of a tiara {{owned by}} her grandmother, Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel, using the queen's own {{diamonds}} and pearls. French in its neo-classical design, the tiara has 19 oriental pearls suspended from lover's knot bows each centred with a large brilliant. Mary left the tiara to Elizabeth II, who later gave it to Diana, Princess of Wales, as a wedding present. She <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> often, notably with her 'Elvis dress' on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989, but on her divorce from Prince Charles it was returned to the Queen. In 2015 and 2016, the Duchess of Cambridge <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> to a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace.|$|E

It is so {{elaborate}} and conspicuous. I don't see how I could ever have liked it. But I vowed to <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> and <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> I will.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because,' {{said the}} secretary, looking up with {{something}} between a snarl and a smile; 'because to sit still and <b>wear</b> <b>it,</b> or to fall asleep and <b>wear</b> <b>it,</b> is a mockery. That's all, friend.' ...|$|R

5|$|The George III Fringe Tiara is a circlet {{incorporating}} brilliant diamonds {{that were}} formerly owned by George III. Originally commissioned in 1830, the tiara has been worn by many queens consort. Originally, {{it could be}} worn as a collar or necklace or mounted on a wire to form the tiara. Queen Victoria <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> as a tiara {{during a visit to}} the Royal Opera in 1839. In Franz Xaver Winterhalter's painting The First of May, completed in 1851, Victoria can be seen wearing it as she holds Prince Arthur, the future Duke of Connaught and Strathearn. In a veiled reference to the adoration of the Magi, the Duke of Wellington is seen presenting the young prince with a gift.|$|E
5|$|The first {{nighttime}} {{football game}} was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier kick to the head.|$|E
5|$|The band {{met at the}} Londonderry Hotel on Park Lane, {{overlooking}} the park, where they had booked a tenth-floor suite, and proceeded to the park in the armoured personnel carrier, together with their two official photographers, Michael Cooper and Spanish Tony Sanchez. They alighted from the carrier into a caravan-trailer behind the stage. Jagger, his face heavily made up and with a studded leather collar around his neck, was clad in a white dress. He had borrowed the dress, which had been made for Sammy Davis Jr. at the Mr. Fish boutique, and <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> to Prince Rupert Lowenstein's white ball, where he had shown it to Princess Margaret. Jagger was only to wear it for half-an-hour at the Hyde Park concert, after which he tore it off to reveal a violet T-shirt and white loon pants.|$|E

5|$|This garment {{instantly}} received significant global media coverage, and {{has been}} cited along with Elizabeth Hurley's black Versace dress {{as one of the}} most high-profile dresses that made the designer Versace a household name. In addition, this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace. It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath's Dress of the Year collection, at which point it was described as a key example of the close relationship between fashions, celebrities and publicity. Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015, Lopez still owns the original gown. In 2015, fifteen years since Lopez first <b>wore</b> <b>it,</b> the dress is still inextricably associated with her and Versace.|$|E

5000|$|The NSW Teachers Federation {{supports}} <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day, {{but some}} schools have received {{criticism in the}} face of celebrating <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day. Cheltenham Girls’ High School principal Susan Bridge received letters from parents about their disagreement with the introduction of the overarching national framework of Safe Schools, which included [...] "...theme days at the school such as <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day...". Miranda Devine alleged that the celebration of <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day at Cheltenham Girls' High School caused [...] "...some students... to ...feel marginalised and excluded if they do not embrace the ideology.", with MP Damien Tudehope adding that students are [...] "ostracised" [...] if they do not support [...] "Purple Day" [...] sic. David Phillips, then-National Director of FamilyVoice Australia, gave evidence to the Australian Parliament's Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, that students were vilified and bullied if they upheld the traditional definition of marriage and chose not to participate in <b>Wear</b> <b>it</b> Purple Day.|$|R

25|$|When {{the former}} King EdwardVIII went into exile as the Duke of Windsor in 1936 {{following}} his abdication, he took {{with him the}} Coronet of George, Prince of Wales– a highly controversial act. This coronet had been specially created for King GeorgeV, when Prince of Wales, and he <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> at his father's coronation in 1902. George's son, Edward, when Prince of Wales, <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> at the coronation of his father in 1911. When Edward was invested as Prince of Wales a new coronet was designed and used. In 1969, it was judged impractical to charge the ex-king with effectively stealing the coronet, which would {{be returned to the}} United Kingdom after his death in 1972.|$|E

25|$|Women wore matanpushi, {{embroidered}} headbands, and ninkari, earrings. Ninkari was a metal {{ring with}} a ball. Women <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> {{through a hole}} in the ear. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. However, women wear them now. Furthermore, aprons called maidari now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called tekunkani.|$|E
25|$|While Hatshepsut was {{depicted}} in official art wearing regalia of a pharaoh, {{such as the}} false beard that male pharaohs also <b>wore,</b> <b>it</b> is most unlikely that she ever wore such ceremonial decorations, {{just as it is}} unlikely that the male pharaohs did. Statues such as those at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, depicting her seated wearing a tight-fitting dress and the nemes crown, are thought to be a more accurate representation of how she would have presented herself at court.|$|E
25|$|His simple origins {{became clear}} right after his election, when {{he wore a}} {{pectoral}} cross made of gilded metal {{on the day of}} his coronation and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope complained that he always <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> and that he had brought no other with him. He was well known for cutting down on papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the pope dining alone, which had been established by Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends to eat with him.|$|E
50|$|Like his own {{character}} of Ralph Hinkley/Hanley, William Katt found the suit very uncomfortable and hated <b>wearing</b> <b>it.</b> Producers made various {{modifications to the}} suit to help him, and accommodated him by scheduling filming so {{he would not have}} to <b>wear</b> <b>it</b> all day during a shoot.|$|R

25|$|A belt {{could also}} be {{fastened}} over a simple tunic-like garment or undergarment, just below the breasts or over the breasts. When the apodesmos was worn under the breasts, it accentuated them. Another word for a breast-band or belt was strophion (Gr: στρόφιον). A further term was kestós (Gr: κεστός, Latin: cestus), used specifically for Aphrodite's charmed girdle in the Iliad, whose power was to make every woman who <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> irresistible to men. In view of its association with the love goddess, this type of garment probably had an erotic connotation because of its effect to accentuate the breast.|$|E
25|$|As {{the series}} progresses, Creek {{gradually}} changes from an asocial anorak {{to a man}} {{with a great deal of}} wit and charm. This helps to fuel the romantic thread between him and Maddy. Jonathan's trademark duffle coat worn in the first series was actually Alan Davies' own coat that he wore to the auditions; it helped him win the role, as the writer and producers thought it suited the character. After the first series, Jonathan's coat was supplied by the wardrobe department. Davies kept the original at his home, and <b>wore</b> <b>it</b> again for the 2009 New Year's special.|$|E
