50|$|Wally English, {{previously}} {{an assistant}} with the NFL's Miami Dolphins, {{took over the}} Tulane head coaching position in 1983, beginning a controversial two-year reign. The day before the 1983 season opener with Mississippi State, Jon English, Wally's son, filed suit in district court in New Orleans against the NCAA and Tulane, alleging that he was unjustly being deprived of a final season of eligibility. He asked for and received {{a temporary restraining order}} that allowed him to play while the case worked its way through the court process, and he got to play six games before his attorneys ran out of legal maneuvers and he was declared ineligible. The two games that Tulane won while Jon English played were forfeited to Ole Miss and Florida State, and the Green <b>Wave</b> <b>wound</b> up with a 2-9 record. Future NFL performers like Bubby Brister, Don Maggs, Ron Tilton and Burnell Dent dotted the roster. Brister left the team after being replaced by Jon English midway through the first two games of the season. The 1983 team lost a lot of close games and was beaten by two TDs only once all season. Dent set a new Tulane record for tackles in a season with 172 that fall to register the most impressive individual performance.|$|E

Again he spoke of angels, but in a milder and mournful tone.|$|R

The third <b>wave</b> mortally <b>wounded</b> , which later sank. All of the damaged vessels — save Paul Hamilton and Lansdale — reached Bizerte, Tunisia, on 21 April 1944. Taney later {{departed}} Bizerte with homeward-bound convoy GUS-38 and arrived at New York City on 21 May 1944.|$|R

Firstly, we review a model for surface wound healing in the cornea {{and focus on the}} speed of healing {{as a function of the}} application of growth factors. Secondly, we present a model for scar tissue formation in deep wounds and focus on the role of key chemicals in determining the quality of healing. Thirdly, we propose a model for excessive healing disorders and investigate how abnormal healing may be controlled...|$|R

Super 17 at first seems impervious to Goku's attacks, but when Android 18 attacks him for killing Krillin, Goku {{takes advantage of the}} distraction to penetrate through Super 17 with his Dragon Fist technique, then fires a Kamehameha <b>Wave</b> through the <b>wound.</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} experimental observation that incapacitation and injury {{can be caused}} by a ballistic pressure <b>wave</b> independently from <b>wounding</b> caused by crushing effects of a bullet in the wound channel. Live animal test subjects partially immersed in water were observed to be incapacitated by a ballistic pressure wave created by a bullet passing through the water close to the test subject without hitting the test subject. The water coupled the pressure wave to the thoracic cavity of the test subject without perforation. Bullets producing larger pressure waves caused incapacitation, whereas a load producing smaller pressure waves did not...|$|R

2500|$|Even though Wang et al. {{document}} remote neural damage for {{low levels}} of energy transfer, roughly , these levels of neural damage are probably too small to contribute to rapid incapacitation. Courtney and Courtney believe that remote neural effects only begin to make significant contributions to rapid incapacitation for ballistic pressure wave levels above [...] (corresponds to transferring roughly [...] in [...] of penetration) and become easily observable above [...] (corresponds to transferring roughly [...] in [...] of penetration). Incapacitating effects in this range of energy transfer are consistent with observations of remote spinal injuries, observations of suppressed EEGs and apnea in pigs and with observations of incapacitating effects of ballistic pressure <b>waves</b> without a <b>wound</b> channel.|$|R
40|$|The {{breakup of}} {{rotating}} scroll waves in three-dimensional excitable media {{has been linked}} to important biological processes. The known mechanisms for this transition almost exclusively involve the dynamics of the scroll filament, i. e., the line connecting the phase singularities. In this paper, we describe a novel defect-induced route to breakup of a scroll wave pinned by an inexcitable obstacle partially extending through the bulk of the medium. The <b>wave</b> is helically <b>wound</b> around the defect inducing sudden changes in velocity components of the wavefront at the obstacle boundary. This results in breakup far from the filament, eventually giving rise to spatiotemporal chaos. Our results suggest a potentially critical role of pinning obstacles in the onset of life-threatening disturbances of cardiac activity. Comment: 5 pages and 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear matter {{properties}} are evaluated using our nonstatic OBEP. The binding energy of nuclear matter is calculated to the first-order reaction ~atrix G. As the nucleon-nucleon interaction, four kinds. of potentials are considered that reprodu~e approximately equivalent phase shift, but differ {{from each other}} in the core potential (static Gaussian or velocity' dependent) and in the retarded effect (included or not). Our OBEP including retardation gives- 12 MeV in binding energy at a saturation density kF=l. 5 fm- 1 • The retarded effect of the OBEP is appreciable on the off-energy-shell G-matrices, and decreases simultaneously 2. 0 ~ 2. 5 MeV in the binding energy and ~ 0. 05 fm- 1 (in Fermi momentum) in the density. The relativistic correction to the Bethe-Goldstone equation tends to increase the binding and the density. The defect <b>wave</b> function and <b>wound</b> integral for each potential case are examined · in detail...|$|R
5000|$|On Black Friday, a {{smallpox}} pandemic, {{transmitted by}} a virus planted on banknotes, sweeps through New York City. The disease, known as [...] "Green Poison" [...] or [...] "The Dollar Flu", causes widespread chaos, and Manhattan is placed under quarantine. The U.S. Government activates sleeper {{agents in the}} population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Division, or simply [...] "The Division", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In Brooklyn, the protagonist, a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the VTOL meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander along {{with most of the}} second <b>wave</b> and severely <b>wounding</b> Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF-commandeered news helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the James A. Farley Post Office Building as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally {{want to take advantage of}} the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from Rikers Island, and the Cleaners, insane New York Sanitation workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Gordon Amherst.|$|R
50|$|Anne {{continues}} {{to fight the}} Espheni who are now disorganized and without their mechanized support. Tom returns from space {{with the help of}} the Espheni's Great Enemy, the Dornia, but Lexi dies in the attack on the power core. Anne aids Tom as he rallies the militias around the world for a world-wide counterattack on the Espheni bases, with the militias in the United States marching on Washington, D.C.. After linking up with a militia known as the 14th Virginia, the resistance learns from an Espheni communications device that the Overlords serve a queen. Anne monitors Ben as he uses the device to try to locate the queen and works with Marty to modify the Dornia bioweapon to be non-lethal to humans. She also has to face the possible return of Lexi who claims to have been saved by the Dornia like Tom but who everyone thinks is actually an Espheni trap. Anne refuses to accept Lexi and proves to be right as she turns out to be an Espheni clone created to assassinate Tom. After the Lexi clone is killed by the Dornia bioweapon, proving its effectiveness, Anne admits she didn't know for sure that it wasn't really Lexi but did hope it was. Anne acts as part of the strike team that heads to the Lincoln Memorial to kill the queen and is freaked out by Espheni eggs in the city's service tunnels. When confronted by Tom about it, she tells him that she is once again pregnant. As they make their way through the tunnels, the hatchlings awaken and Lieutenant Wolf kills them with a grenade launcher. Unknown to anyone else, Anne is hit by shrapnel from the explosion and is mortally wounded. Anne keeps her injury from the rest of the group as they look for another way out of the tunnels, having been cut-off from Tom. Soon after they get out, Anne collapses and tells Weaver to go on without her. Weaver and the rest of the team desperately try to save Anne, but she dies of her wounds, watching as the Espheni are destroyed. Ben brings Tom, who infected the Espheni with the bioweapon through their queen to Anne and he is left devastated by her death. Remembering how the Dornia had saved him, Tom carries Anne to the beach where he'd last seen the Dornia and begs them to save Anne since he got them their vengeance. After a moment, the Dornia pull Anne beneath the <b>waves.</b> A mortally <b>wounded</b> John Pope arrives, but upon seeing Tom's grief at Anne's death, lets go of his own vengeance and dies of his wounds. The Dornia resurrect Anne and her baby and restore her to Tom. Months later, a visibly pregnant Anne attends Tom's speech at the rebuilt Lincoln Memorial where a now-united humanity has gathered to choose a new leader.|$|R
