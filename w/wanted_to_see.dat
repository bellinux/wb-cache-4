5|$|Suleiman {{said that}} he had come to protect John Sigismund's interests, but also {{announced}} that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the infant king, because he had heard rumours about Isabella's having actually given birth to a daughter. Six Hungarian lords (including George Martinuzzi and Bálint Török) accompanied John Sigismund to the sultan's camp on 29August. During the meeting, janissaries entered Buda, saying that they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the town. This {{turned out to be a}} trick that enabled them to seize the capital of Hungary without opposition. Bálint Török was captured in the sultan's camp. Suleiman declared that John Sigismund could retain the territories to the east of the river Tisza in exchange for a yearly tribute of 10,000 florins.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} {{told him that the}} club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that the stage was small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene on his behalf, but this had no effect.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the subject}} of a 60 Minutes segment, in which Jacobson told Mike Wallace, after pausing for several seconds and looking downward, that he broke down and ordered Boys Who Love Boys because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> just what it was that he was being so heavily {{solicited}} to buy. A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
5|$|Latter Days {{was filmed}} in several {{locations}} in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $850,000 budget. After Cox had financed {{the search for}} initial backing, funding was acquired from private investors who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film made. However producer Kirkland Tibbels still faced several bottlenecks, as financing the whole film remained difficult. It was distributed through TLA Releasing, an independent film distributor, who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films, which specializes in gay-themed media.|$|E

5|$|Whether it {{involved}} {{the history of}} the number zero or the invention of the transistor, two things stood out to me. First is that the discovery {{that turns out to be}} the most valuable is usually dismissed as a side-effect. Second is that prototypes almost never include neon lights and chrome. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a story play out that was more in line with the way real innovation takes place than I had seen on film before.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of the accreditation procedures for organisations to access ContactPoint, {{it became clear that the}} vast majority of voluntary organisations would not have been able to access ContactPoint. This meant that the majority of organisations that work with children or young people e.g. sports groups, uniformed groups and faith groups, would not be able to register their involvement, representing a real challenge for practitioners who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who was working with a particular child or young person.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War {{ended in}} 1945, Hampden started to host Scotland matches more frequently. Before then, Hampden had only hosted 15 matches against England and one match each against Austria and Czechoslovakia. During the post-war {{attendance}} boom, Hampden {{was the only}} stadium big enough to host the crowds who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the team. Matches that would have ordinarily attracted a crowd of 40,000 were being attended by nearly 100,000. The Hampden fixture list was also expanded by the new Scottish League Cup competition. In 1947, Rangers defeated Aberdeen in the first League Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean's {{birth in}} 1975, Lennon took a hiatus {{from the music}} {{industry}} and became a househusband to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sean before he was put to bed. Following the murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.|$|E
5|$|Hindenburg never {{responded to}} the memo, and it remains unclear whether he even saw it, as Otto Meißner, who decided that his future was aligned with the Nazis, may not have passed it along. It is {{noteworthy}} that even those officers who were most offended by the killings, like Hammerstein and Mackensen, did not blame the purge on Hitler, whom they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> continue as Chancellor, and at most wanted a reorganization of the Cabinet to remove some of Hitler's more radical followers.|$|E

5|$|In January 2009, Lovato {{first started}} writing the songs for her sophomore album Here We Go Again, right after filming {{from the first}} season of Sonny with a Chance. In April 2009, Lovato {{explained}} about the album's process and collaborating with other songwriters and artists, such as Jon McLaughlin and The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett. Unlike her first studio album Don't Forget, she did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers, as she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what her sound would be like without their input. According to Lovato, the album's writing process was nearly completed in just two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Later volumes {{were also}} praised; Otaku USAs Joseph Luster {{appreciated}} the series' battles and Allen's development. The revelation that Allen {{would be an}} enemy of the Order and the 14th Noah was well received by Grant Goodman of Pop Culture Shock and Chris Beveridge of the Fandom Post. However, Goodman criticized early-volume reliance on comedy rather than plot. Beveridge and Erkael of Manga News were impressed with Kanda's dark past. Douresseaux liked Allen's situation in volume 21 (due to the character's connections with the Noah), and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more of that and less of Kanda's fight with Alma Karma.|$|E
5|$|On a dare, Antonucci {{then decided}} that he would try {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E
