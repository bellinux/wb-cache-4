But his domestic form for Mashonaland was good and he made his ODI debut against West Indies {{at the end of}} the year. In three games as opener he scored a fifty in the match Zimbabwe won. Against Bangladesh, he played as opener and scored a fifty in the decisive third ODI victory. He then joined Heath Streak's rebellion and played no part in the ODI series against Sri Lanka, Australia and England. He was, along with Gavin Ewing and Charles Coventry the first player to settle the dispute with the board. He must have realised that as a young man he might only get this chance at high-class cricket.|$|E

500|$|Hard {{apple cider}} {{was by far}} the most common {{alcoholic}} beverage available to colonists. This is because apple trees could be grown locally throughout the colonies, unlike grapes and grain which did not grow <b>well</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in New England. Cider was also easier to produce than beer or wine, so it could be made by farmers for their own consumption. Since it was not imported, it was much more affordable to the average colonist than beer or wine. Apple trees were planted in both Virginia and the Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1629. Most of these trees were not grafted, and thus produced apples too bitter or sour for eating; they were planted expressly for making cider. Cider was sometimes also distilled or freeze-distilled into applejack (so called because freeze-distillation was called [...] "jacking"); the cold climate of the Northeast in the wintertime encouraged the process. The beverage was particularly popular in New Jersey, where applejack was occasionally called [...] "Jersey lightning" [...] and was sometimes used to pay road-construction crews.|$|E

This match did not go over <b>well</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> with the audience in attendance at the Tacoma Dome. One source cited that the match should have showcased the best of WCW, but instead featured too many restholds and not enough action.

A WWF source close to Vince McMahon said that Vince had [...] "absolutely hated" [...] the segment.
