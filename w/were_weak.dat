5|$|Numerous tornadoes {{touched down}} across Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, {{and several other}} states. Most of the tornadoes <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> but a few caused {{considerable}} damage. A long-tracked wedge tornado caused EF2 damage along a path through rural portions of Texas and Louisiana. An EF3 tornado destroyed multiple structures and caused severe damage at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, as well. A total of 55 tornadoes were confirmed the 26th, though no fatalities occurred.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} storms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed {{early in the evening}} of February28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 <b>were</b> <b>weak.</b> However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} area {{of severe}} weather also developed that afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> though an EF2 tornado touched down {{near the town of}} Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage to homes in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario as far north as Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E

50|$|Star Force also borrows {{the same}} {{elemental}} properties that Battle Network uses. The four elements include: Heat (fire-based), Aqua (water and ice-based), Elec (electricity-based), and Wood (plant and wind-based). Elements {{are attached to}} certain attacks and to enemies' (or Mega Man's) defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> to, double-damage <b>is</b> dealt. Heat <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Aqua but strong against Wood, Aqua <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Elec but strong against Heat, Elec <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Wood but strong against Aqua, and Wood <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Heat but strong against Elec.|$|R
50|$|Star Force {{continues}} the same elemental properties that previous Star Force titles have used. The four elements include: Heat, Aqua, Elec, and Wood. Elements {{are attached to}} certain attacks and to enemies' defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> to, double-damage <b>is</b> dealt. Heat <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Aqua but strong against Wood, Aqua <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Elec but strong against Heat, Elec <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Wood but strong against Aqua, and Wood <b>is</b> <b>weak</b> against Heat but strong against Elec. However, in a Person VS. Person match, attacking the other player with an element that they <b>are</b> <b>weak</b> to does not deal double damage. Instead, it makes their Noise go down to 0%, and reverts them back to normal.|$|R
5|$|Announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, it {{received}} four nominations from Game Critics Awards including Best of Show. The game received a generally positive reception from critics, with praise mostly {{directed to the}} game's tense multiplayer and focus on tactics. However, the game was criticized for its progression system and its lack of content. Initial sales <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> but the game's player base doubled as Ubisoft subsequently released several packages of free downloadable content, developed in conjunction with Blue Byte. The company also partnered with ESL to make Siege an eSports tournament game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{simplified}} experiment {{indicated that}} lawyers trained {{in a systematic}} selection method made better predictions of juror verdicts in two of four cases – the sale of illegal drugs and a military court-martial (the other two cases were murder and drunk driving). The systematic method was more effective in those two cases where the predictive relationships between demographic variables and attitudes/verdicts were strongest, and least effective where such predictive relationships <b>were</b> <b>weak</b> or nonexistent.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's booming economy, its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy <b>were</b> <b>weak.</b> The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E

5|$|The 2005 North Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} {{destructive}} and deadly to southern India, although most storms <b>were</b> <b>weak.</b> The basin covers the Indian Ocean {{north of the}} equator as well as inland areas, sub-divided by the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Although the season began early with two systems in January, the bulk of activity was confined from September to December. The official India Meteorological Department tracked 12depressions in the basin, and the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) monitored two additional storms. Three systems intensified into a cyclonic storm, which have sustained winds of at least 63km/h (39mph), {{at which point the}} IMD named them.|$|E

5|$|Tornado watches {{were issued}} for the Atlantic coast from Pennsylvania to Florida {{at the start}} of the day and {{continued}} through the morning and early afternoon, but tornadoes were forecasted to generally be weaker and more isolated. Despite this, the secondary portion of the outbreak that had begun producing scattered tornadoes throughout the Mid-Atlantic and East Coast regions the previous evening intensified during the early hours of the morning, producing numerous tornadoes in Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Maryland. While most <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> some of the tornadoes that struck portions of Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania were strong. Although tornado watches were issued, no tornadoes were spotted in New Jersey or Washington, D.C. In the wake of the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, widespread flooding hit the Midwest, South, and Eastern Seaboard, with extensive flood and flash flood warnings issued. One particularly damaging and deadly EF3 tornado struck the town of Glade Spring, Virginia very early in the morning, where three people died. The last tornadoes of the outbreak touched down that afternoon in eastern North Carolina, which was hard hit in the April 16 outbreak, though the tornadoes that impacted the area this time around <b>were</b> <b>weak.</b> The system moved out into the Atlantic Ocean that evening, with the exception of isolated thunderstorms over central Florida that night into April 29, although there were no tornadoes then.|$|E
5|$|When Governor Isaac Shelby {{announced}} he would not seek reelection, Garrard's friends encouraged {{him to become a}} candidate. The other announced candidates were Benjamin Logan and Thomas Todd. Logan was considered the favorite in the race due to his military heroism while helping settle the Kentucky frontier. However, his oratory was unpolished, and his parliamentary skills <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> despite his considerable political experience. Todd, who had served as secretary of all ten Kentucky statehood conventions, had the most political experience, but his youth was considered a disadvantage by some. Garrard benefited from his political connections in Bourbon County, and many held him in high regard due to his work in the Baptist church.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others <b>were</b> <b>weak</b> and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E

5|$|Challenging {{the very}} core of the caste-based society, the Veerashaivas {{conducted}} a marriage between an upper caste Brahmin bride and a lower caste Shudra groom. The resulting confrontation between rebellious Veerashaivas and the conservative upper classes lead to the assassination of King Bijjala II and the eviction of most devotees, including Basavanna, from Kalyani. The successors of King Bijjala II <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> prompting Chalukya Someshvara IV, ruling from Annigeri, to attempt rebuilding his empire by invading Kalyani in 1183. Though his invasion was successful, his overall efforts failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi in 1189. Though these turbulent events caused a setback to the Veerashaiva gatherings and creation of poems, the movement had set roots in the Kannada soil and regained popularity in the 15th century under the patronage of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronica outsold Shenmue (1999) {{within its}} first week on shelves in February 2000. In total, the Dreamcast version sold almost 450,000 {{units in the}} United States and 1.14 million copies worldwide. The sales <b>were</b> <b>weak</b> {{compared}} to series predecessors, but strong compared to other Dreamcast games. The PlayStation 2 version of Code: Veronica X had sold 900,000 copies and earned $27 million in the United States by July 2006, outselling Resident Evil 4. It went on to sell 1.4 million copies worldwide. Next Generation ranked it as the 63rd highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in the United States. Combined console sales of Resident Evil games released in the 2000s reached 3 million units in the United States by July 2006.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in {{the last part of the}} game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian was not {{the only}} {{challenger}} to Carinus' rule: the usurper M. Aurelius Julianus, Carinus' corrector Venetiae, took control of northern Italy and Pannonia after Diocletian's accession. Julianus minted coins from the mint at Siscia (Sisak, Croatia) declaring himself as emperor and promising freedom. It was all good publicity for Diocletian, and it aided in his portrayal of Carinus as a cruel and oppressive tyrant. Julianus' forces <b>were</b> <b>weak,</b> however, and were handily dispersed when Carinus' armies moved from Britain to northern Italy. As leader of the united East, Diocletian was clearly the greater threat. Over the winter of 284–85, Diocletian advanced west across the Balkans. In the spring, some time before the end of May, his armies met Carinus' across the river Margus (Great Morava) in Moesia. In modern accounts, the site has been located between the Mons Aureus (Seone, west of Smederevo) and Viminacium, near modern Belgrade, Serbia.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian naval defences <b>were</b> <b>weak.</b> The Egyptian fleet had {{declined}} from its Umayyad-era peak and was mostly {{employed in the}} Nile {{rather than in the}} Mediterranean. Fortifications along the coastal marshes, which had been manned by volunteer garrisons, had been abandoned in the later 8th century. The Byzantines had exploited this in 811/12 and again in ca. 815 launching raids against the coasts of Egypt. The Byzantine fleet arrived at Damietta on 22 May 853. The city garrison were absent at a feast for the Day of Arafah organized by the governor Anbasah ibn Ishaq al-Dabbi in Fustat. Damietta's inhabitants fled the undefended city, which was plundered for two days and then torched by the Byzantines. The Byzantines carried off some six hundred Arab and Coptic women as well as large quantities of arms and other supplies intended for Crete. The fleet then sailed east and attacked the strong fortress of Ushtun. Upon taking it, they burned the many artillery and siege engines found there before returning home.|$|E

An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. That cell would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E
