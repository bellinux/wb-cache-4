40|$|Abstract—White {{cheese is}} a soft or semi-hard cheese {{variety of the}} brined cheeses family which had its origin in the Turkey and other Mediterranean countries. The changes in physico-chemical properties, {{proteolysis}} and bitterness of <b>White</b> <b>cheeses</b> made from animal-calf rennet (A) and microbial rennet from Rhizomucor miehei (M) were investigated during a 90 day ripening period. Physico-chemical characteristics were similar for cheeses made with both types of rennet. Phe, Leu- Ile, Gln, Val, Pro and Ala were the principal free amino acids (FAAs) in the <b>White</b> <b>cheeses</b> at all stages of ripening. The differences in {{the contents of the}} total bitter tasting amino acids (Phe, Leu- Ile, Val and Pro) were not influenced by the type of rennet.

500|$|Tuberculosis is {{classified}} {{as one of the}} granulomatous inflammatory diseases. Macrophages, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and fibroblasts [...] aggregate to form granulomas, with lymphocytes surrounding the infected macrophages. When other macrophages attack the infected macrophage, they fuse together to form a giant multinucleated cell in the alveolar lumen. The granuloma may prevent dissemination of the mycobacteria and provide a local environment for interaction of cells of the immune system. [...] However, more recent evidence suggests that the bacteria use the granulomas to avoid destruction by the host's immune system. [...] Macrophages and dendritic cells in the granulomas are unable to present antigen to lymphocytes; thus the immune response is suppressed. Bacteria inside the granuloma can become dormant, resulting in latent infection. Another feature of the granulomas is the development of abnormal cell death (necrosis) in the center of tubercles. [...] To the naked eye, this has the texture of soft, <b>white</b> <b>cheese</b> and is termed caseous necrosis.|$|E
