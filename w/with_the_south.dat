5|$|Before the war, New Albany was {{the largest}} city in the state, mainly because of its river {{contacts}} and extensive trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>South.</b> Over half of Hoosiers with over $100,000 lived in New Albany. During the war, the trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> came to a halt, and many residents considered those of New Albany as too friendly to the South. The city never regained its stature. It was stilled as a city of 40,000 with its early-Victorian Mansion-Row buildings remaining from the boom period.|$|E

5|$|Post-war {{development}} was different in southern Indiana. The state's commerce along the Ohio River was reduced during the war, {{especially after the}} closure of the Mississippi River to commercial trade <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> and increased competition from the state's expanding railroad network. Some of Indiana's river towns, such as Evansville, recovered by providing transport to Union troops across the Ohio River, but others did not. Before the war, New Albany was the largest city in the state, primarily due to its commerce <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> but its trade dwindled during the war. After the war much of Indiana viewed New Albany as too friendly to the South. New Albany's formerly robust steamboat-building industry ended in 1870; the last steamboat built in New Albany was named the Robert E. Lee. New Albany never regained its pre-war stature; its population leveled off at 40,000, and only the antebellum, early-Victorian Mansion Row district remains from its boom period.|$|E
