He played Josh Miller, a comedy writer, who [...] "transformed" [...] each episode into a character Miller has imagined, [...] "provid a humorous outlet for his frustrations at home and work". Production closed after five episodes and it was canceled after just two aired, due to poor critical reaction and ratings. Azaria later commented on the show: [...] "I {{wanted to do something}} really truthful and interesting and impactful. We had a bunch of executives sitting in the room, all agreeing that The Larry Sanders Show was our favorite thing on television, but we couldn't do it on NBC, and nor <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to from a business standpoint; it simply wouldn't make enough money. By the time it aired, the writing was sort of on the wall, and I don't blame them at all. It was apparent it wasn't working." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1974 book Anarchy, State and Utopia philosopher Robert Nozick {{discusses}} an [...] "experience machine", {{a hypothetical}} device which can provide its users with any simulated reality they desire. If given the choice, <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to plug ourselves {{into such a}} machine? If not, then according to Nozick {{there seems to be}} something wrong with hedonism, the view that pleasure and happiness are the primary or most important intrinsic goods and the proper aim of human life. Nozick's thought experiment has been widely debated since.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1980 {{fan club}} interview, Noddy Holder {{spoke of the}} success in Belgium: [...] "What {{happened}} in Belgium was that Return to Base was available on import, and it started to climb the import charts. I don't know why, it {{was as much a}} surprise to us as it was to anybody. Warner Bros. Records then said to us, due to it starting to show some action, <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to release it over there as a major release. We thought [...] "why not?" [...] – and now it's the number one album over there!" [...] Speaking of [...] "I'm a Rocker", Holder said: [...] "That was the track getting the most airplay from the album. But it's not just a case of that applying in Belgium – we've had so many people writing to us asking why we've not released it as a single. [...] "I'm a Rocker" [...] is not even one of our songs though – it's a Chuck Berry number." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{collapse}} of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying [...] "that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do this?". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the [...] "Play Station", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.|$|E
2500|$|The Saturdays {{were formed}} in June 2007 after auditions {{were held to}} find members for the group. The group was put {{together}} through the record label Polydor Records which meant they would have an instant record deal and were signed to Fascination Records, a sub-label of Polydor. Big Brother 13 housemate Lydia Scott-Lee was in the running {{to be in the}} line up, but was not chosen in the final 10. The band began recording their debut album while touring with Girls Aloud on their Tangled Up Tour. They were also offered songs which were rejected by Girls Aloud. They said [...] "We all thought {{it was a bit of}} a cheek. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> their rejects? [...] It's bad enough with all the comparisons being made." [...] Whilst on tour with Girls Aloud, the band released their first single [...] "If This Is Love". The song features additional backing vocals from Danish singer Nabiha. The song charted at number eight on the UK Singles Chart after it sold 14,990 copies in its first week of release. The single was also the second highest new entry of the week behind Katy Perry's [...] "I Kissed a Girl" [...] which debuted at number four. As well as supporting Girls Aloud, The Saturdays also supported the Jonas Brothers at their Hammersmith Apollo gig.|$|E

Listen," [...] continued the Man in Asbestos, [...] "you seem to have been something of a social reformer, and yet you don't understand the new life at all.

On July 8, 2012, Kourtney gave birth to their second child, daughter Penelope Scotland Disick. She was named after Scotland because of Kourtney's Scottish ancestry.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the year, Lennon {{left the}} music {{business}} for several years. He followed his interests in cooking, sailing, and sculpting during his leave from the music industry. After he began his performing career there was occasionally unfounded media speculation that Julian would undertake performances with Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. However, in the Beatles Anthology series in 1996, the three surviving Beatles confirmed there was never an idea of having Julian sit in for his father as part of a Beatles reunion, with McCartney saying, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to subject him to all of this?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Chase also {{addressed}} {{the opinion of}} some that the open-ended finale was insulting to the show's longtime fans: [...] I saw some items in the press that said, [...] "This was a huge fuck you to the audience." [...] That we were shitting in the audience's face. Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do that? Why would we entertain people for eight years only {{to give them the}} finger? We don't have contempt for the audience. In fact, I think The Sopranos is the only show that actually gave the audience credit for having some intelligence and attention span. We always operated as though people don't need to be spoon-fed every single thing—that their instincts and feelings and humanity will tell them what's going on.|$|E
5000|$|The Saturdays started {{production}} of their debut album in May 2008 while supporting Girls Aloud—with whom {{they shared the}} same record label—on their Tangled Up Tour.

[...] The last track of Chasing Lights, [...] "Why Me, Why Now" [...] was originally a demo written and recorded by Alex Cartana, but later picked up by The Saturdays.

5000|$|Stone {{called her}} {{assistant}} {{and asked for}} her touring musicians, who flew from the United States to Devon the following day. Along with Reeves, Shorten and her band, Stone spent [...] "an intense week of creation" [...] at Mama Stone's. [...] "We wrote the song and then we rehearsed it for, like, a little minute, and then we recorded it and then we wrote another one and recorded it. We didn't sit down and say, 'OK, how <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> this album to represent Joss? What songs {{are we going to}} choose? and blah, blah, blah ...' It wasn't any of that", Stone explained. She also enlisted guest musicians such as rapper Nas, guitarist Jeff Beck, percussionist Sheila E. and saxophonist David Sanborn.|$|E
5000|$|Monbiot {{also thinks}} that {{economic}} recession {{can be a}} good thing for the planet: [...] "Is it not time to recognise that we have reached the promised land, and should seek to stay there? Why <b>would</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to leave this place in order to explore the blackened waste of consumer frenzy followed by ecological collapse? Surely the rational policy for the governments of the rich world is now to keep growth rates as close to zero as possible?" [...] While he does recognize that recession can cause hardship, he points out that economic growth can cause hardship as well. For example, the increase in sales of jet skis would count as economic growth, but they would also cause hardships such as water pollution and noise pollution.|$|E

Labelling construction toys as boys’ toys and craft or dolls as girls’ toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help hone different skills. Telling girls that construction and science toys are for boys we limit what they think they can achieve before they've even had the chance to try it out. … There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a doll for Christmas, or a boy a car - but children need a variety of play.
