25|$|On December 12, 2012, Lambeau Field {{was damaged}} by a minor fire when {{construction}} workers were cutting a metal beam near the fourth floor. The sparks from the cutting landed inside {{a wall and}} ignited the foam insulation. The area was temporarily evacuated and a minor back injury {{to one of the}} responding firefighters was reported. Green Bay Fire Lt. Nick Craig says the fire was small but in an unwieldy area. He says fire officials had to proceed slowly because they didn’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the wall and allow the flames an oxygen supply until they had enough water on hand. The fire happened on Aaron Rodgers Day, a day the state proclaimed in honor of the Packers quarterback because Rodgers wears No. 12, and the date that Wednesday was 12-12-12. The fire damage cost $5,000 in repairs.|$|E

25|$|A {{year later}} EOKA revived its {{attempts}} to achieve the union of Cyprus with Greece. Turkish Cypriots were recruited into the police by the British forces to fight against Greek Cypriots, but EOKA initially did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up a second front against Turkish Cypriots. However, in January 1957, EOKA forces began targeting and killing Turkish Cypriot police deliberately to provoke Turkish Cypriot riots in Nicosia, which diverted the British army's attention away from their positions in the mountains. In the riots, at least one Greek Cypriot was killed and this was presented by the Greek Cypriot leadership {{as an act of}} Turkish aggression. The Turkish Resistance Organization (TMT, Türk Mukavemet Teşkilatı) was formed initially as a local initiative to prevent the union with Greece, which was seen by the Turkish Cypriots as an existential threat due to the exodus of Cretan Turks from Crete once the union with Greece was achieved. It was later supported and organized directly by the Turkish government, and the TMT declared war on the Greek Cypriot rebels as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{expectations}} on Spassky were enormous {{because for}} the Soviets, chess {{was part of the}} political system. While Fischer was often famously critical of his home country ("Americans want to plunk in front of a TV and don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a book ..."), he too carried the burden of expectation because of the political significance of the match. No American had achieved the world championship since the first champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, became a naturalized American citizen in 1888. The excitement surrounding the match was such that it was called the [...] "Match of the Century", even though the same term had been applied to the USSR vs. Rest of the World match just two years before.|$|E
500|$|There {{were four}} main {{individual}} classifications contested in the 2015 Tour de France, {{as well as}} a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses returned to the Tour {{for the first time since}} the 2008 edition. For all stage finishes, excluding the two time trial stages, the three first finishers of stages earned bonuses of 10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively. Of the reintroduction, race director Christian Prudhomme said: [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up the race, we want the race to be decided on any day of the Tour." [...] If a crash had happened within the final [...] of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey. Rain on the final stage forced the final times of the general classification to be taken on the first crossing of the finish line before the ten laps of the cobbled Champs-Élysées. Riders were required to cross the finish line on the final lap to receive their times.|$|E

He said in 2011 of choosing a New Jersey location, [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> a studio that would become just one of the studios in the area.

2500|$|According to Francis, the Rasmussen {{case was}} not the only one in which she {{believed}} DNA evidence was being purposefully ignored by the department.

Work she did on the DNA found on Jill Barcomb, believed to have been killed by the Hillside Strangler, revealed instead that she was a victim of Rodney Alcala, another serial killer active around the same time in the Los Angeles area; he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to death in 2010. After she suggested doing DNA analyses of semen found on two teenage girls also believed to be victims of the Hillside Strangler, another detective discouraged her with the words, [...] "We don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> that can of worms."

I don't think we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>open</b> up another front there and nor do the Yemenis want us to do that. So we have to find other ways of doing these things and in the meantime making sure Afghanistan doesn't revert to becoming, if you like, a 'second Yemen' – that is the Army's primary duty at the moment. Our role is to remain very close to them, to help them where they most need it and in the meanwhile focus our efforts on Afghanistan and assisting Pakistan to ensure they don't become the threat Yemen is beginning to be.|$|E
