25|$|Reporting of {{casualty}} numbers {{during the}} invasion varied widely and fluctuated day to day. On April 10, the BBC reported that Israel estimated 150 Palestinians {{had died in}} Jenin, and Palestinians <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> the number was far higher. That same day, Saeb Erekat, on a phone interview to CNN from Jericho, estimated {{that there were a}} total of 500 Palestinians killed during Operation Defensive Shield, this figure also including fatalities outside of the Jenin camp, {{in other areas of the}} West Bank. On April 11, Ben Wedeman of CNN reported that Palestinians were reporting 500 dead, while international relief agencies <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> possibly as many as 200; he noted that his efforts to independently verify the claims had so far come to naught since people were being prevented from entering the camp by Israeli soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Carl Sagan {{summarized}} what {{he heard}} Soviet commentators <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> about SDI, with a common argument being that it was equivalent to starting an economic war through a defensive arms race to further cripple the Soviet economy with extra military spending, while another less plausible interpretation was that it served as a disguise for the US wish to initiate a first strike on the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|Dornford Yates, {{a novelist}} {{who was a}} junior {{barrister}} at the trial, records that the remains were placed in lime {{so that they would}} be destroyed, but suggests that Crippen failed to realize that while dry quicklime destroys, if water is added, it becomes slaked lime and preserves. Yates used this fact in the plot of his novel The House That Berry Built and told the story of the trial from his viewpoint in his memoirs As Berry and I <b>Were</b> <b>Saying.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of September 8, 2010, the GCAA and UPS had not {{commented on}} the {{progress}} of the investigation, but according to Associated Press sources, people familiar with the investigation <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> the fire may have started in the cargo compartment and that the investigators were checking the cargo to determine what was loaded on the aircraft. On September 8, 2010 the head of the GCAA, director general Saif al Suwaidi, said that it was still too early to determine exactly what the cause of the crash was.|$|E

Despite earlier criticism, many fans commented and {{circulated}} {{that he should not}} be sorry, with many from India supporting him.

25|$|Historians {{until the}} late 20th century {{emphasised}} class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution. The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, {{with support from the}} sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy. However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> that the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support. Nevertheless, as Spang has shown, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of Beethoven's hearing loss, his {{conversation}} books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily {{in the last ten}} or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what they <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into Beethoven's thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, {{it has been suggested that}} 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after Beethoven's death by his secretary Anton Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive. However, Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.|$|E
25|$|While {{returning}} to Spain, the Niña and Pinta encountered the roughest storm of their journey, and, {{on the night}} of 13 February, lost contact with each other. All hands on the Niña vowed, if they were spared, to make a pilgrimage to the nearest church of Our Lady wherever they first made land. On the morning of February 15, land was spotted. Columbus believed they were approaching the Azore Islands, but other members of the crew felt that they were considerably north of the islands. Columbus turned out to be right. On the night of February 17, the Niña laid anchor at Santa Maria Island, but the cable broke on sharp rocks, forcing Columbus to stay offshore until the morning, when a safer location was found to drop anchor nearby. A few sailors took a boat to the island, where they were told by several islanders of a still safer place to land, so the Niña moved once again. At this spot, Columbus took on board several islanders who had gathered onshore with food, and told them that his crew wished to come ashore to fulfill their vow. The islanders told him that a small shrine dedicated to Our Lady was nearby. Columbus sent half of the crew members to the island to fulfill their vow, but he {{and the rest of the}} crew stayed on the Niña, planning to send the other half to the island upon the return of the first crew members. While the first crew members <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> their prayers at the shrine, they were taken prisoner by the islanders, under orders from the island's captain, João de Castanheira, ostensibly out of fear that the men were pirates. The boat that the crew members had taken to the island was then commandeered by Castanheira, which he took with several armed men to the Niña, in an attempt to arrest Columbus. During a verbal battle across the bows of both craft, during which Columbus did not grant permission for him to come aboard, Castanheira announced that he did not believe or care who Columbus said that he was, especially if he was indeed from Spain. Castanheira returned to the island. However, after another two days, Castanheira released the prisoners, having been unable to get confessions from them, and having been unable to capture his real target, Columbus. There are later claims that Columbus was also captured, but this is not backed up by Columbus's log book.|$|E

[...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we <b>were</b> <b>saying...</b> it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements.
