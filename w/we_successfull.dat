40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} influence of demographic factors on human genetic sub-structure. In our discovery cohort, we show significant demographic trends for decreasing autozygosity associated with population variation in chronological age. Autozygosity, the genomic signature of consanguinity, is identifiable on a genome-wide level as extended tracts of homozygosity. We identified an average of 28. 6 tracts of extended homozygosity greater than 1 Mb in length in a representative population of 809 unrelated North Americans of European descent ranging in chronological age from 19 â€“ 99 years old. These homozygous tracts made up a population average of 42 Mb of the genome corresponding to 1. 6 % of the entire genome, with each homozygous tract an average of 1. 5 Mb in length. Runs of homozygosity are steadily decreasing in size and frequency as time progresses (linear regression, p, 0. 05). We also calculated inbreeding coefficients and showed a significant trend for population-wide increasing heterozygosity outside of linkage disequilibrium. <b>We</b> <b>successfull...</b>|$|E
40|$|Supertree methods {{reconcile}} {{a set of}} phylogenetic trees into {{a single}} structure that is often interpreted as a branching history of species. A key challenge is combining conflicting evolutionary histories that are due to artifacts of phylogenetic reconstruction and phenomena such as lateral gene transfer (LGT). Although they often work well in practice, existing supertree approaches use optimality criteria that do not reflect underlying processes, have known biases PrePrints and may be unduly influenced by LGT. We present the first method to construct supertrees by using the subtree prune-and-regraft (SPR) distance as an optimality criterion. Although calculating the rooted SPR distance between a pair of trees is NP-hard, our new maximum agreement forest-based methods can reconcile trees with hundreds of taxa and> 50 transfers in fractions of a second, which enables repeated calculations {{during the course of}} an iterative search. Our approach can accommodate trees in which uncertain relationships have been collapsed to multifurcating nodes. Using a series of simulated benchmark datasets, we show that SPR supertrees are more similar to correct species histories under plausible rates of LGT than supertrees based on parsimony or Robinson-Foulds distance criteria. <b>We</b> <b>successfull...</b>|$|E

40|$|For synthesizing {{realistic}} {{images of}} a real three dimensional object, reflectance properties of the object surface, {{as well as the}} object shape, need to be measured. This paper describes one approach to create a three dimensional object model with physically correct reflectance properties by observing a real object. The approach consists of three steps. First, a sequence of range images and color images is measured by rotating a real object on a rotary table with fixed viewing and illumination directions. Then, the object shape is obtained as a collection of triangular patches by merging multiple range images. Secondly, by using the recovered object shape, color pixel intensities of the color image sequence are mapped to the object surface and separated into the diffuse and specular reflection components. Finally, the separated reflection components are used to estimate parameters of the Lambertian reflection model and a simplified Torrance-Sparrow reflection model. <b>We</b> have <b>successfull</b> [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} cross-domain {{approaches that}} improve the {{effective use of}} multithreaded architectures. The contributions of the thesis can be classified in three groups. First, we propose several methods for thread assignment of network applications running in multithreaded network servers. Second, we analyze the problem of graph partitioning that {{is a part of}} the compilation process of multithreaded streaming applications. Finally, we present a method that improves the measurement-based timing analysis of multithreaded architectures used in time-critical environments. The following sections summarize each of the contributions. (1) Thread assignment on multithreaded processors: State-of-the-art multithreaded processors have different level of resource sharing (e. g. between thread running on the same core and globally shared resources). Thus, the way that threads of a given workload are assigned to processors' hardware contexts determines which resources the threads share, which, in turn, may significantly affect the system performance. In this thesis, we demonstrate the importance of thread assignment for network applications running in multithreaded servers. We also present TSBSched and BlackBox scheduler, methods for thread assignment of multithreaded network applications running on processors with several levels of resource sharing. Finally, we propose a statistical approach to the thread assignment problem. In particular, we show that running a sample of several hundred or several thousand random thread assignments is sufficient to capture at least one out of 1 % of the best-performing assignments with a very high probability. We also describe the method that estimates the optimal system performance for given workload. <b>We</b> <b>successfull</b> y applied TSBSched, BlackBox scheduler, and the presented statistical approach to a case study of thread assignment of multithreaded network applications running on the UltraSPARC T 2 processor. (2) Kernel partitioning of streaming applications: An important step in compiling a stream program to multiple processors is kernel partitioning. Finding an optimal kernel partition is, however, an intractable problem. We propose a statistical approach to the kernel partitioning problem. We describe a method that statistically estimates the performance of the optimal kernel partition. We demonstrate that the sampling method is an important part of the analysis, and that not all methods that generate random samples provide good results. We also show that random sampling on its own can be used to find a good kernel partition, and that it could be an alternative to heuristics-based approaches. The presented statistical method is applied successfully to the benchmarks included in the StreamIt 2. 1. 1 suite. (3) Multithreaded processors in time-critical environments: Despite the benefits that multithreaded commercial-of-the-shelf (MT COTS) processors may offer in embedded real-time systems, the time-critical market has not yet embraced a shift toward these architectures. The main challenge with MT COTS architectures is the difficulty when predicting the execution time of concurrently-running (co-running) time-critical tasks. Providing a timing analysis for real industrial applications running on MT COTS processors becomes extremely difficult because the execution time of a task, and hence its worst-case execution time (WCET) depends on the interference with co-running tasks in shared processor resources. We show that the measurement-based timing analysis used for single-threaded processors cannot be directly extended for MT COTS architectures. Also, we propose a methodology that quantifies the slowdown that a task may experience because of collision with co-running tasks in shared resources of MT COTS processor. The methodology is applied to a case study in which different time-critical applications were executed on several MT COTS multithreaded processors...|$|E
40|$|Oncocytic papiloma (OP) {{is a rare}} {{neoplasm}} of {{the nasal}} cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is the least common histological subtype of sinonasal papilloma. OP {{is regarded as a}} benign tumor like inverted papilloma (IP), but its biological behavior is not so benign due to its aggressive local growth, the high rate of recurrences and the risk of malignant transformation with associated carcinoma. Endoscopic resection is the treatment of choice for OP. No relevant reports on the use of radiotherapy are known in patients with OP with advanced disease or extrasinonasal extension without associated malignancy, although its application in advanced IP has been <b>successfull.</b> <b>We</b> report a case of unilateral left OP with advanced disease that involved lateral nasal wall, maxillary, ethmoidal and frontal sinus on the same side, treated with volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{transport}} process of momentum, the viscosity. We outline the historical development of hydrodynamics, the branch of physics in which the shear and bulk viscosities are expressed. We show the transition between the mechanical philosophy claiming that the conservation of energy is coupled to cyclic, reversible dynamics, and the birth of a new science, thermodynamics, in which the conservation of energy (the first law) is associated with the irreversibility (the second law). Through the 19 th century, the kinetic theory of gases was developed and accumulated successes establishing relationships between the microscopic dynamics of the atoms and molecules, and macroscopic properties, among which the viscosity. In this context appeared the paradox of irreversibility to which Boltzmann was the first to provide an explanation based on a statistical interpretation of the entropy. We finally outline the history of the theory of chaos and show how the chaotic character of the microscopic dynamics provides a dynamical explanation of the irreversible processes such as transport, and in particular, the viscosity. In this context, <b>we</b> present three <b>successfull</b> approaches developed the last two decades: the thermostated-system method, the escape-rate formalism and the hydrodynamic-mode method...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} role in galaxy {{formation and}} evolution {{is played by}} the CircumGalactic Medium (CGM), a very diffuse and ionized multiphase gas that constitutes the interface between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this thesis, {{we focus on the}} cold ionized phase, with the aim to understand its kinematics and physical state, in particular for early-type galaxies. Our goal is to reproduce, using kinematic models, the two main constraints given by the COS-Halos observations: the velocity dispersion and the hydrogen column density. We create a wide variety of models, with very different assumptions, and we investigate the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium state of the absorbers. First, we study the physical state of the cold clouds and we find that they cannot survive in the internal regions of the halos, where the interactions with the hot dense coronal gas would likely destroy them. These interactions are instead weak in the outer regions, where the hot gas is more diffuse, and the clouds have a nearly ballistic motion. We describe then the kinematics of the clouds with collisionless equilibrium models, solving the Jeans equation with very different assumptions for the cloud density distribution and the radial velocity dispersion profile, exploring various parametrizations. We find that we can reproduce both the observational constraints only if the clouds are confined to the external regions of the halos by tangentially biased orbits, in agreement with our findings for the cloud survival. Finally, we investigate models that describe a global inflow of the CGM clouds towards the galaxy, assuming that they are accreted from the IGM or created at large radii by the condensation of the hot corona due to thermal instabilities. <b>We</b> find <b>successfull</b> models with clouds coming from the IGM, slowed down by the drag force acted by the corona and disrupted by the hydrodynamical interaction with the hot gas at a given internal radius...|$|R
