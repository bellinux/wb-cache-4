5|$|Newly crowned TNA X Division Champion, A.J. Styles, went on {{to defend}} his {{championship}} against Christopher Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Against All Odds. Styles had to defend the championship against Daniels at the event as per a pre-match stipulation to their bout on the January 21 episode of Impact!, in which if Styles failed to defeat Daniels in under 10 minutes, then he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Daniels a title shot. Styles failed to win the contest in under ten minutes, which granted Daniels a title match. Dusty Rhodes then made the match a 30-minute Iron Man match. Styles {{went on to}} defeat Daniels at Against All Odds 2 to 1 in falls during over-time.|$|E
5|$|On 9 August 1941, RAF ace Douglas Bader {{bailed out}} over St Omer, France. Bader {{was well known}} to the Luftwaffe {{and at the time}} of his capture had been {{credited}} with 22 aerial victories. Galland himself claimed two Spitfires on that date. Galland and JG 26 entertained Bader over the next few days. Owing to the significant stature of the prisoner, Galland permitted Bader, under escort, to sit in the cockpit of a Bf 109. Apparently, despite losing one of his tin legs in the aircraft, Bader, in a semi-serious way, asked if they wouldn't mind if he took it on a test flight around the airfield. Galland replied that he feared Douglas would attempt to escape and they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> chase and shoot at each other again, and declined the request.|$|E

Three days later, head coach Larry Krystkowiak and Harris met with Yi, attempting to influence him to play for Milwaukee, however, Yi's representatives requested that the team trade Yi to another team with a city that had a large Chinese presence. Chinese officials also required that any team Yi played for <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him sufficient playing time for him to improve for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kohl made a special trip to Hong Kong to appeal to Yi personally and he assured Chinese officials that Yi would have sufficient playing time. On 29 August 2007, the Milwaukee Bucks and Yi agreed to a standard, multi-year rookie contract.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, British Airways {{took over}} British Midland International (BMI) which {{gave them a}} {{monopoly}} on UK mainland flights from Heathrow. In order for the deal to be completed, the European Union Competition Commissioner decreed that BA <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up 14 of BMI's landing slots at Heathrow to comply with EU competition regulations. 12 of these slots were set aside for domestic usage, which were bought by Virgin Atlantic after they outbid Aer Lingus for the required British domestic operating licence. Virgin announced that they would set up Virgin Atlantic Little Red as a subsidiary to use these slots to cover domestic UK mainland routes as Aer Lingus already provided competition for BA on flights to Northern Ireland from Heathrow. Little Red was later revealed to be operated on a wet-lease by Aer Lingus whereby the planes would be operated by Aer Lingus but would bear Virgin Atlantic livery. The pilots would be employed by Aer Lingus, with cabin crew supplied by McGinley Aviation. The cabin crew would wear Virgin Little Red uniforms and had training from Virgin, {{despite the fact that}} airline had not previously operated narrow-body aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends {{at home with her}} mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in Don Quixote at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E

25|$|Israel {{would retain}} around 9% in the West Bank in {{exchange}} for 1% of land within the Green Line. The land that would be conceded included symbolic and cultural territories such as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, whereas the Israeli land conceded was unspecified. Additional to territorial concessions, Palestinian airspace would be controlled by Israel under Barak's offer. The Palestinians rejected the Halutza Sand region (78km²) alongside the Gaza Strip {{as part of the}} land swap on the basis that it was of inferior quality to that which they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up in the West Bank.|$|E
25|$|Moshe Chaim Luzzatto (the RaMCHaL) {{posited that}} God's purpose in {{creation}} {{was to give}} a gift from God's good to another being. Since God is perfect, {{it would have been}} insufficient for God to give merely a partial good. Rather, God <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the ultimate good that God's creation – humankind – could receive. As God is the true good, that ultimate good is found in God. Allowing God's creatures to become more attached to God would thus allow them to experience this ultimate receivable good. Thus, the purpose of creation was to bring into existence a creature who could derive pleasure from God's own good. God further recognized that for humanity to most enjoy this good, humanity would have to feel that humanity had earned it. God therefore arranged that humanity be able to perceive right and wrong, and have access to both. God thus gave humanity the means to earn the attachment to God that God sought to give.|$|E
25|$|The magistrates {{were people}} who {{occupied}} a public post and formed {{the administration of the}} Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous public control. The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person drew out they obtained the post or not. This was a way of eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were strategos, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the strategoi and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an account of his administration and use of public finances.|$|E

25|$|Hewson {{was elected}} at the 1987 {{election}} to the House of Representatives for the affluent Sydney electorate of Wentworth. Prior to his election {{he was told he}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his Ferrari to get pre-selected. However, Hewson retained his car despite attracting controversy courtesy of it. He entered Parliament {{at a time when there}} was a leadership vacuum on the conservative side of politics. The Coalition, led by John Howard, lost the 1987 election and a majority of Liberal MPs voted to keep him as leader over his predecessor Andrew Peacock. In September 1988, Howard appointed Hewson shadow finance minister. In May 1989, when Andrew Peacock replaced Howard as Leader, Hewson became shadow treasurer. Prior to Howard's dumping, when Peacock was the shadow treasurer, Hewson had been seen as the real shadow treasurer. In the lead up to the 1990 election, Hewson, the trained economist, performed well against the then-Treasurer Paul Keating. Hewson claimed in December 1989 that Keating was reluctant to debate with him on the economy.|$|E
25|$|On 12 January 2000, Københavns Lufthavne, which {{operates}} {{among other things}} Copenhagen Airport, bought 33.3% of the shares in Rygge Sivile Lufthavn. The company stated that they had invited the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration to purchase part of the company, but that no decision {{had been made by}} the government agency. The company stated that they were therefore forced to invite a foreign airport operate to purchase part of the company to have sufficient competence in airport operations. In December, the Norwegian Civil Airport Administration stated that they were negative to the plans for civilian traffic at Rygge. The administration operates with the model that the large airports, in particular Gardermoen, make a profit, which is used to finance the deficits at smaller airports. The administration stated that establishing a civilian airport at Rygge would undermine the financial structure of Norwegian airports and would breach the political presumptions for constructing Gardermoen. If the administration was to be able to complete on price with Rygge, the state <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the necessary grants to cover the deficits at other airports. At the same time, Torp was required to pay their own air traffic control costs, which until then had been covered by the administration. In September 2001, the Norwegian Competition Authority supported the airport, stating that it would allow more competition on international flights from Norway, and could make it easier to establish domestic competition in the face of Scandinavian Airline's take-over of Braathens.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

500|$|The conference {{started on}} the morning of 26 August as planned. The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first, then around 40 nationalists entered and crowded around Muzorewa on the {{opposite}} side of the cramped railway carriage. Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side, where there was more space, and each spoke in turn, <b>giving</b> their blessing <b>to</b> the negotiations. Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith's invitation. Speaking assertively, the bishop gave three concessions which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>given</b> by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin: first, one man, one vote was established by Muzorewa to be [...] "a basic necessity"; second, an amnesty <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>given</b> for all guerrilla fighters, including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury; and finally, all of the nationalists <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be <b>given</b> permission <b>to</b> return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning. Smith replied calmly that Kaunda, Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC <b>had</b> agreed not <b>to</b> demand preconditions for talks, and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed this to him that same morning; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa's confrontational opening speech.|$|R
5000|$|In the Fall of 2000, {{talks were}} held at Camp David to reach a [...] "final status" [...] {{agreement}} on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Barak was prepared to offer the entire Gaza Strip, a Palestinian capital {{in a part of}} East Jerusalem, 73% of the West Bank (excluding eastern Jerusalem) raising to 90-94% after 10-25 years, and financial reparations for Palestinian refugees for peace. Israel <b>would</b> therefore <b>have</b> gained an additional 6-10% of the West Bank, including more of East Jerusalem than previously held, and Palestinian leaders <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the Right of Return.

Noades–by now the owner of Brentford, who were themselves interested in a groundshare at Loftus Road–said that Wimbledon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him 12 months' notice to leave Selhurst Park. The majority of Wimbledon and QPR fans quickly made their opposition to a merger known. Following Wimbledon's draw with Norwich City at Selhurst Park on 6 May, Koppel came onto the pitch and told the mostly jeering home fans that [...] "there never was a merger proposal with QPR"; the Loftus Road club had instigated the talks, he said. QPR abandoned the amalgamation plan two days later, citing potential fan alienation, while also announcing that there would be no further talks with Brentford.|$|E
500|$|Life in Hell {{caught the}} eye of Hollywood writer-{{producer}} and Gracie Films founder James L. Brooks, who had been shown the strip by fellow producer Polly Platt. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation on an undefined future project, which {{would turn out to be}} developing a series of short animated skits, called [...] "bumpers," [...] for the Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his Life in Hell characters for the show. Groening feared that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his ownership rights, and that the show would fail and would take down his comic strip with it. Groening conceived of the idea for The Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office and hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family: Homer, the overweight father; Marge, the slim mother; Bart, the bratty oldest child; Lisa, the intelligent middle child; and Maggie, the baby. Groening famously named the main Simpson characters after members of his own family: his parents, Homer and Margaret (Marge or Marjorie in full), and his younger sisters, Lisa and Margaret (Maggie). Claiming that it was a bit too obvious to name a character after himself, he chose the name [...] "Bart," [...] an anagram of brat. However, he stresses that aside from some of the sibling rivalry, his family is nothing like the Simpsons. Groening also has an older brother and sister, Mark and Patty, and in a 1995 interview Groening divulged that Mark [...] "is the actual inspiration for Bart." ...|$|E
