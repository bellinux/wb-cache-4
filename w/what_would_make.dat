500|$|In a very {{positive}} review, Planet Game Boy magazine praised the multiplayer mode for its selection of competitive games, concluding: [...] "Perfect Dark {{is one of the}} biggest handheld games ever made, and for fans of the [...] version it's a vital purchase." [...] IGN also praised the multiplayer mode and extras, but remarked that [...] "there's no real strategy involved in these deathmatch games other than to find the other person and open fire until one dies and respawns elsewhere on the map". In a retrospective review, Jon Wahlgren of Nintendo Life felt that Rare [...] "did a great job on squeezing so many features and technical magic into the little cart, but by focusing so heavily on the tech they seem to have sacrificed a lot of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> it more fun to play". In 2012, GamesRadar ranked it the 47th best game available on the Game Boy and/or Game Boy Color. The staff praised Rare for its adaptation of the Nintendo 64 game.|$|E
500|$|Johnson's {{thoughts}} on biography and on poetry coalesced in {{his understanding of}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> a good critic. His works were dominated with his intent to use them for literary criticism. This was especially true of his Dictionary of which he wrote: [...] "I lately published a Dictionary like those compiled by the academies of Italy and France, {{for the use of}} such as aspire to exactness of criticism, or elegance of style". Although a smaller edition of his Dictionary became the standard household dictionary, Johnson's original Dictionary was an academic tool that examined how words were used, especially in literary works. To achieve this purpose, Johnson included quotations from Bacon, Hooker, Milton, Shakespeare, Spenser, and many others from what he considered {{to be the most important}} literary fields: natural science, philosophy, poetry, and theology. These quotations and usages were all compared and carefully studied in the Dictionary so that a reader could understand what words in literary works meant in context.|$|E

500|$|Receiving empathically, in NVC, {{involves}} [...] "connection with what's {{alive in}} the other person and <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> life wonderful for them... It's not {{an understanding of the}} head where we just mentally understand what another person says... Empathic connection is an understanding of the heart in which we see the beauty in the other person, the divine energy in the other person, the life that's {{alive in the}}m... It doesn't mean we have to feel the same feelings as the other person. That's sympathy, when we feel sad that another person is upset. It doesn't mean we have the same feelings; it means we are with the other person... If you're mentally trying to understand the other person, you're not present with them." [...] Empathy involves [...] "emptying the mind and listening with our whole being." [...] NVC suggests that however the other person expresses themselves, we focus on listening for the underlying observations, feelings, needs, and requests. It is suggested that it can be useful to reflect a paraphrase of what another person has said, highlighting the NVC components implicit in their message, such as the feelings and needs you guess they may be expressing.|$|E
500|$|Character {{designer}} Shigenori Soejima made Yu {{with the}} idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions. As a result, he wanted Yu to look more ambiguous than the protagonist of Persona 3. Soejima compared Yu to the Blue Ranger from the Power Rangers franchise as such character tends to stand silent to follow the orders from his leader. His character design stayed relatively similar to its initial conception, with his tone and facial expressions changing the most. The feature Soejima focused on most was his eyes: he thought that having his eyes under the fringe of his hair would make him [...] "look cool." [...] The collar of his school uniform was made to stand a bit taller than other characters'. While designing the character, Soejima noted [...] "the main character needs to be well-rounded enough to be likeable, but also needs that extra little something to make him stand out {{from the rest of the}} cast." [...] He made a [...] "baby face" [...] sketch of the character so that he and the staff could discover Yu's [...] "special something" [...] and discuss <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him stand out as the protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might be right about evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra." [...] Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would {{do the right thing and}} tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E

The GT500 starts at an MSRP of $40,930 for the coupe, and $45,755 for the convertible version. Although Carroll Shelby had no hands-on involvement {{in the design of the}} car, he did provide Ford and SVT (Special Vehicle Team) input on <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> the car better and convinced Ford to enlist wider rear tires (from 255mm wide to 285mm wide).|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{is known}} for his theory that there is a single moral obligation, which he called the [...] "Categorical Imperative", and is derived from the concept of duty. Kant defines the demands of the moral law as [...] "categorical imperatives". Categorical imperatives are {{principles}} that are intrinsically valid; they are good in and of themselves; they must be obeyed by everyone in all situations and circumstances, if our behavior is to observe the moral law. The Categorical Imperative provides a test against which moral statements can be assessed. Kant also stated that the moral means and ends {{can be applied to the}} categorical imperative, that rational beings can pursue certain [...] "ends" [...] using the appropriate [...] "means". Ends based on physical needs or wants can create merely hypothetical imperatives. The categorical imperative can only be based on something that is an [...] "end in itself", that is, an end that is not a means to some other need, desire, or purpose. Kant believed that the moral law is a principle of reason itself, and is not based on contingent facts about the world, such as <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> us happy, but to act on the moral law which has no other motive than [...] "worthiness of being happy". Accordingly, he believed that moral obligation applies only to rational agents.|$|E
