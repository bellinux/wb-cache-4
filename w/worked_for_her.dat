5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E

During her reign, so much statuary was produced that almost every major museum with Ancient Egyptian artefacts {{in the world has}} Hatshepsut statuary among their collections; for instance, the Hatshepsut Room in New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art is dedicated solely to some of these pieces.|$|E

25|$|His wife's sister died {{only four}} months later, and Elizabeth left for England, {{never to return}} to New Zealand. In 1877 the widow married Alfred Richard Creyke, who had <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> first husband as a station manager.

500|$|McIlwraith's {{first issue}} was dated April 1940. [...] She was {{assisted}} by Lamont Buchanan, who <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> as associate editor and art editor for both Weird Tales and Short Stories. [...] August Derleth also provided assistance and advice, {{although he had}} no formal connection with the magazine. [...] Most of McIlwraith's budget went to Short Stories, since that was the more successful magazine; the payment rate for fiction in Weird Tales by 1953 was one cent per word, well below the top rates of other science fiction and fantasy magazines of the day. [...] War shortages also caused problems, and the page count was reduced, first to 112 pages in 1943, and then to 96 pages the following year.|$|E
500|$|The garden planting, {{laid out}} within the former {{forecourt}} {{and in the}} slightly sunken grassed parterre square, {{was the work of}} Mrs Ellen Phelips, who lived at Montacute from the 1840s to her death in 1911, and her gardener, Mr Pridham, who had <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> at Coker Court. The avenue of clipped yews that reinforces the slightly gappy mature avenue of trees stretching away from the outer walls of the former forecourt to end in fields, and the clipped yews that outline the grassed parterre date from that time, though the famous [...] "melted" [...] shape of the giant hedge was inspired by the effects of a freak snowfall in 1947. The sunken parterre garden design, with its Jacobean-style central fountain, designed by Robert Shekelton Balfour (1869–1942), is of 1894; Balfour's dated design is conserved in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Mixed borders in the East court were replanted by Phyllis Reiss of Tintinhull in powerful hot colours when the earlier tender colour scheme laid down by Vita Sackville-West proved insipid to modern taste.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's fourteenth studio album, Sweet Sixteen, was {{released}} in May 1989; it spent sixteen weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album to peak in the top 100 on the Billboard 200, reaching No. 78. The album was given positive reviews because unlike her previous studio album, the release, [...] "welcomes the fiddles and steel guitars back as she returns to the neo-traditionalist fold", according to Allmusic, which gave the release four-and-a-half out of five stars. Reviewer William Ruhlmann found Sweet Sixteen to [...] "double back to a formula that <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in the past". The lead single was a cover of The Everly Brothers' [...] "Cathy's Clown", with McEntire's version reaching No. 1 in July on the Billboard country music chart. Three more Top 10 hits followed from Sweet Sixteen: [...] "Till Love Comes Again", [...] "Little Girl", and [...] "Walk On", at No. 4, 7 and 2, respectively. In September she released Reba Live, her first live album, which originally certified gold but certified platinum ten years later.|$|E

500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... I ran into Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Needham's early life, {{but by the time}} she was middle-aged she was renowned in London as the keeper of a brothel in Park Place, St. James. Her house was {{regarded}} as the most exclusive in London, superior to those of Covent Garden, even to that of the other notorious bawd of the time, Mother Wisebourne. [...] She was said to still be attractive in middle-age; Hogarth described her as a [...] "handsome old Procuress... well dressed in silk", but mentions [...] "patches on her face" [...] and in his picture her face is seen to be pock-marked. She went by a number of aliases: Bird, Howard, Blewitt and Trent are among those ascribed to her, although Mother Bird was also the name of another brothel-keeper who was committed to Newgate Prison with Needham in 1724. Needham was apparently ruthless with the girls and women who <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> They were forced to hire their dresses from her, and, if they were unable to pay the exorbitant rentals, she would force them to take more customers or have them committed to debtors' prison until they met her demands (a scheme John Cleland's heroine falls prey to in Fanny Hill (1748)). Once they were too old or too ill to attract customers, she would throw them out.|$|E
500|$|Underwood {{performed}} [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] at the 40th American Music Awards on November 18, 2012. Amy Sciaretto of Taste of Country {{summarized the}} performance, writing: Underwood {{performed in a}} lacy, frilly black dress with a full skirt and black leather fingerless gloves, which she paired with smoky black eye makeup and black hoop earrings. The singer was {{the centerpiece of the}} performance, and her look was jaw-droppingly gorgeous. [...] There were bright lights above the stage and images of two black Cadillacs on the screens behind her, but that was about the extent of her production. And the simplicity <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She performed an acoustic version of the song during the 55th Annual Grammy Awards. During the performance, the singer's gown became a screen on which images varying from roses to butterflies and fireworks were projected. Underwood also performed [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards, in a medley with [...] "Good Girl", [...] "See You Again" [...] and [...] "Blown Away". [...] "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] was the third song in the medley, and Coti Howell of Taste of Country noted that, in that part, [...] "lighting ripped across the screen and everything went black, except Underwood and her sparkly microphone." [...] The song was also performed at the 2013 Academy of Country Music Awards and during the Blown Away Tour.|$|E
