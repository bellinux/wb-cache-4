5|$|Radial {{velocity}} {{is measured}} by the doppler shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. <b>With</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E

Some individuals <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zodiac Stones attempt to conspire with the Shrine Knights for its power, though most fail. Ramza also acquires proof of the Church's lies about Saint Ajora, a central figure in the religion, and attempts to use it along with the Zodiac Stone to reveal the organization's plot.|$|E
5|$|As {{the company}} expanded, it {{was subject to}} several legal issues {{regarding}} trademarks. Because of its use {{as a case study}} in American law schools, {{one of the most prominent}} incidents of infringement in the United States occurred with the similarly named Burger King located in Mattoon, Illinois. Eugene and Elizabeth Hoots owned an ice cream shop in the city of Mattoon; due to the success of the store, in 1957 they expanded it with an additional shop in a former garage next to the original operation. Keeping with theme related to the name of the ice cream shop, Frigid Queen, they named their burger stand Burger King and registered their trademark with the state of Illinois in 1959. In 1962 The Hootses, <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federal trademark held by Burger King Corporation, added a second location in Charleston, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes études (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B.

5|$|The desert nomads {{were also}} traders. The Sahara {{is a very}} large expanse of land {{stretching}} from the Atlantic rim to Egypt. Trade routes were developed linking the Sahel in the south with the fertile Mediterranean region to the north and large numbers of camels were used to carry valuable goods across the desert interior. The Tuareg were traders and the goods transported traditionally included slaves, ivory and gold going northwards and salt going southwards. Berbers <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region were employed to guide the caravans between the various oases and wells. Several million slaves may have been taken northwards across the Sahara between the 8th and 18th centuries. Traditional means of overland transport declined with the advent of motor vehicles, shipping and air freight, but caravans still travel along routes between Agadez and Bilma and between Timbuktu and Taoudenni carrying salt from the interior to desert-edge communities.|$|E

25|$|Maimonides {{states that}} anyone who does not accept the seven laws is to be executed, as God {{compelled}} the world to follow these laws. However, for the other prohibitions such as the grafting of trees and bestiality he holds that the sons of Noah {{are not to be}} executed. Maimonides adds a universalism lacking from earlier Jewish sources. The Talmud differs from Maimonides in that it handles the seven laws as enforceable by Jewish authorities on non-Jews living within a Jewish nation. Nahmanides disagrees with Maimonides reasoning. He limits the obligation of enforcing the seven laws to non-Jewish authorities taking the matter out of Jewish hands. The Tosafot seems to agree with Nahmanides reasoning. According to some opinions, punishment is the same whether the individual transgresses <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law or is ignorant of the law.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, a Roman fleet with an {{invasion}} force was underway to northern Iberia. Its commanders, the brothers Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio, knew that Hannibal {{had crossed the}} Ebro, but were surprised by the Carthaginian army's presence at the Rhone upstream of their ally Massalia, where they had landed. A scouting party of 300 cavalry was sent to discover the whereabouts of the enemy. These eventually defeated a Carthaginian scouting troop of 500 mounted Numidians and chased {{them back to their}} main camp. Thus, <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> location of the enemy, the Romans marched upstream, ready for battle. Hannibal evaded this force and by an unknown route reached the Isère or the Durance {{at the foot of the}} Alps in autumn. He also received messengers from his Gallic allies in Italy that urged him to come to their aid and offered to guide him over the Alps. Before setting out to cross the Alps, he was re-supplied by a native tribe, some of whose hereditary disputes he had helped solve.|$|E

25|$|P. regina {{is a very}} {{important}} species in medicocriminal entomology, an area in forensic entomology which uses entomologists to aid with arthropod evidence in criminal investigations. This aspect of forensic science stresses using arthropod evidence in solving crimes, most often of a violent nature, using two ideal approaches. One approach takes into account the general succession of arthropod communities to aid in estimation of post mortem interval, and the second factors in environmental influences in the development of arthropods. <b>With</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional insect fauna and times of carrion colonization, the insect gathering associated with the remains can be analyzed to determine a window of time in which death took place. The time elapsed since death before a corpse is discovered, referred to as post mortem interval, or PMI, is critical for investigations. PMI relies on an entomologist’s ability to correlate the species or stage of development of arthropods, in this case P. regina, to an approximation of the elapsed period between a person's death and the discovery of his/her body.|$|E
25|$|Business records exception: {{business}} records created during the {{ordinary course of business}} are considered reliable and {{can usually be}} brought in under this exception if the proper foundation is laid when the records are introduced into evidence. Depending on which jurisdiction the case is in, either the records custodian or someone <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> records must lay a foundation for the records, however. The use of police records, especially as substantive evidence against the accused in a criminal trial, is severely restricted under the Business Records exception. Typically, only generalized evidence about police procedure is admissible under this exception, and not facts about a specific case. For example, John is stopped for speeding 70 miles per hour in a 50-mile-per-hour zone. The officer, who determined John's speed with radar, records the speed in an incident report. He also calibrates and runs a diagnostic on his radar every day prior to beginning his shift. He records this in a log. At trial, the report itself would not be admissible as it pertained to the facts of the case. However, the officer's daily log in which he records his calibration and the daily diagnostics of his radar unit would be admissible under the {{business records}} exception.|$|E
25|$|On 8 September 2015, it was {{reported}} that Lockheed Martin would protest the award; on the same day it was also disclosed that AM General had decided not to file a protest. Any work that would be performed under the contract stopped during the review period. On 15 December 2015 the Government Accountability Office GAO dismissed Lockheed Martin's protest because the company on 11 December 2015 decided to file a “Notice of Post-Award Bid Protest” with the U.S. Court of Federal Claims; according to a source <b>with</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedures, it is uncommon for a company to file with the court close to a GAO protest decision. Immediately after the GAO dismissed the protest, the Army instructed Oshkosh to resume work on the JLTV order. Lockheed Martin filed a preliminary injunction on 17 December, stating that new Army-supplied information related to the contract emerged {{toward the end of the}} GAO's protest process that was not considered before their ruling and no deadline extension was granted. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied Lockheed Martin's request to stop work while the lawsuit was pending, allowing Oshkosh to continue work during the process. The company withdrew its protest in the Court of Federal Claims on 17 February 2016.|$|E
