40|$|THESIS 9019 The term ?cosmopolitanism? {{has been}} said to have become a key word of our time. The thesis {{presented}} {{here is that the}} political philosophy of cosmopolitanism is of relevance to, and has a history within, international law, such that it offers international law some hope of moving beyond a concern solely to secure the formal principles of external liberty between states, towards a greater concern for establishing a minimum level of <b>material</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>for</b> all individuals, regardless of their location, thereby engaging international law in an effort to address the greatest human rights problem of today - absolute poverty. This thesis is prompted by a desire to address the problem that, not only do we live in an unjust world, but we continue to persist in doing so, despite the fact that this {{has been said}} to be ?the least controversial claim in political theory? today. Given that domestic law has generally developed so as to ensure a minimum guarantee of <b>material</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>for</b> all, the question arises as to whether this persistence is an entropy peculiar to the nature of international law and its practitioners...|$|R
