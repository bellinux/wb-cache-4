5|$|Having seized Emesa, the Muslims <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> march {{away from}} Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously {{alarmed by the}} series of setbacks, Heraclius {{prepared}} for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his grand daughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what {{was meant to be}} a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not coordinate with the maneuver—probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government—and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although {{it is clear that}} equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E

25|$|Some routes {{were closed}} during the 1950s {{to take account}} of {{changing}} transport patterns and to remove obvious route duplication.

However, the route closures <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> small taste of what was to come.|$|E

25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important.

You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Calderone, Badalamenti and Di Cristina {{decided to}} go on and Francesco Madonia was murdered on April 8, 1978, by Di Cristina and Salvatore Pillera (from Catania, who was {{dispatched}} by Calderone). In retaliaton, Di Cristina was killed in May 1978 by the Corleonesi. Next was Giuseppe Calderone, who was killed on September 8, 1978. His rival Nitto Santapaola – who had forged an alliance with the Corleonesi – took over the command of the Catania Mafia Family. These skirmishes <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> prelude to the Second Mafia War that really started after the murder of Stefano Bontade in 1981.|$|E

25|$|The Toegye School, {{founded by}} Yi Hwang, {{believed}} that Li (rationality) was absolute, while Qi (material) was relative (this, however, {{does not mean}} that they believed that the Li was in any way superior to the Qi).

The latter idea was attacked by Yi I, who believed that ethics <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> positive side of the emotions. The Toegye School were the majority of the Southerners, and remained the contender of the Giho School to the eighteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} A.G.N.A. was signed, Ribbentrop {{followed}} up with the next step that was intended to create the Anglo-German alliance, namely the Gleichschaltung (co-ordination) of all societies demanding the restoration of Germany's former colonies in Africa. On 3 July 1935, {{it was announced that}} Ribbentrop would head the efforts to recover Germany's former African colonies. Hitler and Ribbentrop believed that demanding colonial restoration would pressure the British into making an alliance with the Reich on German terms. But there was a difference of opinion between Ribbentrop and Hitler: Ribbentrop sincerely wished to recover the former German colonies, whereas for Hitler, colonial demands <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> negotiating tactic. Germany would renounce its demands in exchange for a British alliance.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a long}} shared history between Saint Joseph and Mount St. Mary's. In 1815, Mother Seton sent {{several of}} the Sisters of Charity to manage the Infirmary at Mount St. Mary's. As {{enrollment}} at Saint Joseph's Academy grew in the 1800s, some professors from Mount St. Mary's {{were added to the}} Saint Joseph's faculty. And, since the campuses of the all female Saint Joseph College and the all male Mount St. Mary's <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> couple of miles apart, the schools historically depended on each other for social life. In 1967, female students at Saint Joseph College began taking some classes at Mount St. Mary's, and men from Mount St. Mary's began taking some classes at Saint Joseph. In 1973, with declining enrollment numbers and rising operating costs, Saint Joseph College closed its doors and merged with Mount St. Mary's, which has been fully co-educational since then.|$|E
