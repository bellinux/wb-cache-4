5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a good reason to dismiss anyone. In this <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
25|$|The town of Goshen {{was unable}} to bury its dead for 43 years, as the {{battlefield}} was too distant and the <b>way</b> <b>too</b> dangerous. Some of the soldiers' widows attempted the trip, but were forced to turn back. In 1822, a committee was formed {{to travel to the}} battlefield and comb the area for remains. The few bones recovered were buried in a mass grave, first in Barryville and later moved to the village of Goshen. A stone obelisk was erected for the centennial of the battle, engraved with the names of the dead.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the third hour was revamped on November 12, 2012, at which time it was given its own in-program title Today's Take. Roker was joined during the revamped third hour by Natalie Morales and Willie Geist (who had {{recently}} joined Today after ending his run as the original anchor of MSNBC's <b>Way</b> <b>Too</b> Early); MSNBC anchor and Today correspondent Tamron Hall was added as a co-host for that hour of the program on February 24, 2014, and Ellie Kemper joined the program on June 29, 2015 as a temporary co-host (until July 17, 2015).|$|E
60|$|WISE. Hold you there; some of Mr. Badman's sins were costly, as his drinking, and whoring, {{and keeping}} other bad company; {{though he was}} a man that had <b>ways</b> <b>too</b> many to get money, as well as <b>ways</b> <b>too</b> many to spend it.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to Sachs' critique, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their book blog with twelve specific points. First, {{on the role}} of geography, Acemoglu and Robinson agree that geography is crucial in shaping institutions but do not recognize a deterministic role of geography in economic performance. Second, on the positive role authoritarian governments can play in economic growth, {{especially in the case of}} China, the fast economic growth could be part of the catch-up effect. However, it does not mean that authoritarian governments are better than democratic governments in promoting economic growth. It is still <b>way</b> <b>too</b> early, according to Acemoglu and Robinson, to draw a definite conclusion solely based on the example of China. Last, on industrialization, they argue that industrialization is contingent upon institutions.|$|E
25|$|In another <b>way,</b> <b>too,</b> Stokes {{did much}} for the {{progress}} of mathematical physics. Soon after {{he was elected to}} the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university in difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils were glad to consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.|$|E
500|$|Upon retirement, Barkley {{was later}} quoted as stating, {{in regard to}} his career, [...] "I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing—the {{spitting}} incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting <b>way</b> <b>too</b> intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win <b>way</b> <b>too</b> bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning." ...|$|E

50|$|Tavecchio contributed {{in other}} <b>ways,</b> <b>too.</b> After hitting the field goal that put Cal ahead for good, the kicker tackled Arizona's Travis Cobb on a kickoff return. Bolstered by Cobb's return, the Wildcats drove deep into Cal territory.|$|R

500|$|Along {{with the}} release of Under My Skin, the musical style of [...] "Take Me Away" [...] was {{strongly}} compared with American rock band Evanescence. James R. Minchin III of Entertainment Weekly spoke out that Lavigne has transformed into a dour teen who seems to have spent <b>way</b> <b>too</b> much time listening to Evanescence. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that Lavigne's sound was now much heavier and darker and compared her to Amy Lee, the co-founder and lead vocalist of Evanescence.|$|E
500|$|Elissa Wall, {{who participated}} in the raid by [...] " [...] the Texas {{officials}} on the people", publicly defended the state's actions, saying, [...] "They have reason to fear that the girls are being married and having children at <b>way</b> <b>too</b> young of an age. They have reason to fear that children are in a dangerous place. It doesn't mean the mothers don't love their children. It doesn't mean they don't want to be good mothers. It just means there are reasons for what Texas is doing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] is the series' last episode {{to feature}} Mimi Rogers as Agent Fowley. After reading {{a copy of}} the script, Rogers {{realized}} that her character was going to die before she reached the ending. The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as [...] "by far the most [...] had to do in an episode." [...] She later explained, [...] "It occurred to me , uh oh, this is <b>way</b> <b>too</b> good. I have too much to do. They're going to kill me." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the engine}} of the Q-systems is highly non-deterministic, and the {{manipulated}} data structures are in some <b>ways</b> <b>too</b> simple, without any types such as string or number, Chandioux encountered limitations {{in his efforts to}} raise translation quality and lower computation time to the point he could run it on microcomputers.|$|R

500|$|During the post-race press conference, Harvick and Busch {{commented on}} their {{accident}} during the race. [...] "Harvick pulled a slide job on my {{earlier in the}} day, I crossed over and passed him clean. My guys worked <b>way</b> <b>too</b> hard {{to be in this}} position to have a wrecked race car {{at the end of the}} year. It means so much to me to finish the year strong.

500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was <b>way</b> <b>too</b> expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots I needed a real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Fodor's {{notions of}} mental modularity, informational {{encapsulation}} and domain specificity {{have been taken}} up and expanded, much to Fodor's chagrin, by cognitive scientists such as Zenon Pylyshyn and evolutionary psychologists such as Steven Pinker and Henry Plotkin, among many others. But Fodor complains that Pinker, Plotkin {{and other members of}} what he sarcastically calls [...] "the New Synthesis" [...] have taken modularity and similar ideas <b>way</b> <b>too</b> far. He insists that the mind is not [...] "massively modular" [...] and that, contrary to what these researchers would have us believe, the mind is still a very long way from having been explained by the computational, or any other, model.|$|E

500|$|While on {{tour with}} the Wildhearts, Townsend formed a {{short-lived}} thrash metal project with Metallica's then-bassist Jason Newsted. The band, known as IR8, featured Newsted on vocals and bass, Townsend on guitar, and Tom Hunting of Exodus on drums. The group recorded a few songs together, although Townsend {{says that they}} never intended to go further than that. [...] "People heard about it and thought we wanted {{to put out a}} CD, which is absolutely not true," [...] he explains. [...] "People took this project <b>way</b> <b>too</b> seriously." [...] A demo tape was put together, but the material was not released until 2002, when Newsted published the IR8 vs. Sexoturica compilation.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a more mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris criticized both Scully {{becoming}} the believer {{as well as}} the [...] "sky turning out to be a helicopter gimmick", which she notes [...] "has gotten <b>way</b> <b>too</b> old." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a relatively negative review of the episode. He noted, [...] "All [...] did was remind me why the show is a hollow shell of what it once was as long as Fox Mulder is strapped to an alien table and why The Doggett and Pony Show holds absolutely no appeal to me whatsoever." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{it became}} known that Billy, not Cane, fathered Chloe's {{daughter}} Delia, journalist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline that involved Chloe, Lily, Billy and Cane as [...] "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs". Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end <b>way</b> <b>too</b> quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially I hated the pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lily’s face a few years back, but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is <b>way</b> <b>too</b> much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Talk Soup", {{which is}} about a man who desires to go on {{television}} to tell the world about his strange life, was originally commissioned as a new theme for the E!

[...] "Waffle King", the track that had been intended for Off the Deep End, was written as [...] "a song about a guy who becomes incredibly famous for doing something kinda stupid, and then starts taking himself <b>way</b> <b>too</b> seriously".

[...] Steve Weinberg of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch gave the book a positive review, and described Szavalitz as [...] "a talented, relentless investigator". He noted: [...] "Her outrage surfaces frequently as children die, as once-loving families are atomized and as troubled-teen entrepreneurs escape criminal prosecution while using legal maneuvers to prevail in civil court lawsuits seeking damages", and characterized Help at Any Cost as [...] "an important book about an industry that sometimes helps troubled youth but causes harm <b>way</b> <b>too</b> often." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "The War of the Simpsons" [...] felt [...] "a bit flat", but [...] "even in [...] lowest points, humor is easy to find."
