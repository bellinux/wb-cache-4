2500|$|The {{consequences}} of Owen's actions resonate {{in the next}} episode, the first series finale [...] "End of Days". By opening the Rift, he has allowed more [...] "flotsam and jetsam" [...] to come through, including a Roman soldier, a group of mediaeval plague sufferers, and even a large UFO. As Jack puts it, opening the Rift has caused the cracks in time to widen on a global scale. The time travelling Bilis Manger shows Gwen {{a vision of the}} death of her boyfriend Rhys, convincing her to open the Rift even wider to reverse the damage that has already been done. When this happens, the entity known as Abaddon rises from [...] "beneath the Rift". Jack sacrifices himself to destroy Abaddon, and the Rift immediately closes. The team (including Jack, who has come back from the dead again thanks to his past experiences) still retains the memory of what happened, but some of the actual events have been reverted (such as Rhys returning to life), and Owen spearheads a minor clean-up mission. A year later in [...] "Exit Wounds", Jack's brother Gray has Captain John Hart widen the rift again to unleash chaos across Cardiff, unleashing monsters such as Hoix, Weevils and cowled ghouls from distant times and places. As a Time Agent, Captain John can use his <b>wrist-strap</b> vortex manipulator to travel to Cardiff through the Rift.|$|E
50|$|Nordic walking poles {{feature a}} range of grips and wrist-straps, or rarely, no <b>wrist-strap</b> at all. The straps {{eliminate}} the need to tightly grasp the grips.As with many trekking poles, Nordic walking poles come with removable rubber tips for use on hard surfaces and hardened metal tips for trails, the beach, snow and ice. Most poles are made from lightweight aluminium, carbon fiber, or composite materials. Special walking shoes are not required, although there are shoes being marketed as specifically designed for the sport.|$|E
5000|$|The {{insignia}} of appointment is four point-up chevrons worn on a <b>wrist-strap</b> whilst in shirt-sleeve order, or {{four large}} point-up chevrons worn on the uniform sleeve, surmounted by a drum. In the British Army, staff sergeants/colour sergeants {{have a small}} crown above the drum, whilst warrant officers class 2 have a larger crown and warrant officers class 1 wear the royal arms as usual. Since the drum major {{is part of the}} battalion staff, he wears a crimson sash instead of scarlet, and dresses as a warrant officer regardless of his rank. He is always referred to and addressed as [...] "Drum Major" [...] or [...] "Sir" [...] and not by his rank. In the RAF, a chief technician wears a four-bladed propeller above the drum, a flight sergeant wears a crown, and a warrant officer wears the royal arms. Royal Marines drum majors do not wear any additional badges to indicate specific rank.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{questioned}} whether postural phenomena {{associated with the}} coordination of pointing and stepping resulted from the sole juxtaposition {{of the dynamics of}} each task during the overlapping time period ("juxtaposition hypothesis"). Nine subjects were involved in three experimental conditions: (1) "isolated stepping" (the stepping was performed alone), (2) "isolated pointing" (the pointing was performed alone), and (3) an "experimental sequence" (pointing and stepping were coordinated). Acceleration of centre of gravity (x''G) and displacement of centre of foot pressure (xP) were recorded using a force plate. Pointing acceleration was recorded using a <b>wrist-strapped</b> mono-axial accelerometer. The dynamics of a "theoretical sequence" were calculated by the linear summation of x''G and xP traces recorded in conditions (1) and (2). The juxtaposition hypothesis was tested by between-condition comparison of x''G and xP during the anticipatory postural adjustments of stepping, i. e., at time intervals when pointing was expected to most significantly influence stepping. Results showed that x''G and xP were higher (p 0. 05). Altogether, our results suggest that the postural dynamics of pointing and stepping are not simply juxtaposed when both tasks are coordinated in a motor sequence. Conversely, the biomechanical consequences of the focal movement (pointing) on the mobility task (stepping) may be anticipated and integrated in the motor planning of quick stepping...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of a}} {{handheld}} adapter equipped with a tri-axial accelerometer is the most convenient and efficient approach for measuring vibration exposure at the hand-tool interface, especially when the adapter is incorporated into a miniature handheld or <b>wrist-strapped</b> dosimeter. To help optimize the adapter approach, the specific aims {{of this study are}} to identify and understand the major sources and mechanisms of measurement errors and uncertainties associated with using these adapters, and to explore their improvements. Five representative adapter models were selected and used in the experiment. Five human subjects served as operators in the experiment on a hand-arm vibration test system. The results of this study confirm that many of the handheld adapters can produce substantial overestimations of vibration exposure, and measurement errors can significantly vary with tool, adapter model, mounting position, mounting orientation, and subject. Major problems with this approach include unavoidable influence of the hand dynamic motion on the adapter, unstable attachment, insufficient attachment contact force, and inappropriate adapter structure. However, {{the results of this study}} also suggest that measurement errors can be substantially reduced if the design and use of an adapter can be systematically optimized toward minimizing the combined effects of the identified factors. Some potential methods for improving the design and use of the adapters are also proposed and discussed.
