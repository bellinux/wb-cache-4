5|$|Not {{listed below}} are Hugh Magnus, eldest son of Robert II, and Philip of France, eldest son of Louis VI; both were co-kings <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> (in {{accordance}} with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.|$|E
5|$|Following the Surrender of Japan to the Allied forces, Japanese {{military}} personnel and civilians were repatriated to Japan between 1945 and 1946, although some 350 labourers and technicians were permitted to remain behind to carry out repair works to Palau's infrastructure. However, offspring of Japanese-Palauan intermarriages were allowed to remain, although a few migrated to Japan <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> In the 1950s, Japanese-Palauans formed an organisation, Sakura-kai to assist Japanese-Palauans and Japanese youths who were abandoned by their parents to search for their parents and kinsmen who were forcibly separated {{as a result of}} forced repatriation of Japanese settlers back to Japan. The organisation became a cultural organisation from the 1980s onwards, as most Japanese-Palauans had reunited with their Japanese families or voluntarily chose to leave certain family separations as they were.|$|E

25|$|Following on from this, a {{research}} article that was compiled {{with the help}} of the Minorities Research Group was 'On the Genesis of Female Homosexuality by E. Bene' for The British Journal of Psychiatry, September 1965, pp.815–21. This included further research into the parental relationship by sampling 37 lesbians from the group and 80 married women. The results also pointed towards lesbians having a poor relationship <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b>|$|E
25|$|In summary, {{the article}} 'A Quick Look at Lesbians by Dilys Rowe' (Winter 1962–1963) {{was based on}} an {{interview}} with three self-confessed 'homosexual women' and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in families where they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> during their formative years.|$|E

25|$|Ridge & Feeney (1998) {{have studied}} {{a group of}} gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the {{frequency}} of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participant's relationship <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moses called {{heaven and}} earth to witness against the Israelites that should they make for {{themselves}} a sculptured image {{when they were in}} the land, then God would scatter them among the peoples, leaving only a scant few alive. There in exile they would serve man-made gods of wood and stone, that {{would not be able to}} see, hear, eat, or smell. But when they were in distress and they searched for God with all their heart and soul, returned to God, and obeyed God, then they would find God, even there. For God is a compassionate God, Who would not fail them, let them perish, or forget the covenant that God made <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Clemens {{was born}} in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his {{great-grandfather}} Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated {{when he was an}} infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt envious of other players was when he saw them in the clubhouse <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> Clemens lived in Vandalia, Ohio, until 1977, and then spent most of his high school years in Houston, Texas. At Spring Woods High School, Clemens played baseball for longtime head coach Charles Maiorana and also played football and basketball. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted to go to college.|$|E

25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, or look on {{from the other side}} of a mechitza (partition), in accordance with the value of tzniut (modesty). In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making sure there is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with the women on the songs that will be sung.|$|E
25|$|Successful males {{will form}} {{lifetime}} relationships {{with two or}} three females, which they will visit occasionally, while other males are left without a mate. Mating season is in the summer, but the actual implantation of the embryo (blastocyst) in the uterus is stayed until early winter, delaying the development of the fetus. Females will often not produce young if food is scarce. The gestation period is 30–50 days, and litters of typically two or three young ("kits") are born in the spring. Kits develop rapidly, reaching adult size within the first year. The typical longevity of a wolverine in captivity is around 15 to 17 years, but in the wild the average lifespan is more likely between 8 and 10 years. Fathers make visits to their offspring until they are weaned at 10 weeks of age; also, once the young are about six months old, some reconnect <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> and travel together for a time.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Latin towns, the Sabines, under the {{leadership}} of Titus Tatius, marshaled their forces and advanced upon Rome. They gained control of the citadel by bribing Tarpeia, the daughter of the Roman commander charged with its defense. Without the advantage of the citadel, the Romans were obliged to meet the Sabines on the battlefield. The Sabines advanced from the citadel, and fierce fighting ensued. The nearby Lacus Curtius is said to be named after Mettius Curtius, a sabine warrior who plunged his horse into its muck to stymie his Roman pursuers as he retreated. At a critical juncture in the fighting, the Romans began to waver {{in the face of the}} Sabine advance. Romulus vowed a temple to Jupiter Stator, to keep his line from breaking. The bloodshed finally ended when the Sabine women interposed themselves between the two armies, pleading on the one hand <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> and brothers, and on the other with their husbands, to set aside their arms and come to terms. The leaders of each side met and made peace. They form one community, to be jointly ruled by Romulus and Tatius.|$|E

500|$|Different {{kinds of}} homosexuals were {{compared}} {{to see whether they}} had differing developmental histories. The [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be important in the development of homosexuality among effeminate, but not non-effeminate, white homosexual men. Bell et al. noted that failure to identify with the father might serve to encourage effeminacy, but that alternatively boys who were effeminate for other reasons might find it difficult to identify <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> Pre-adult homosexual behavior was more important among men who were not effeminate. Bell et al. suggested that for effeminate males early homosexual feelings were the only important predictor of adult homosexuality, while other males were influenced by a combination of homosexual feelings and other factors. Comparing white bisexual men and white homosexual men, Bell et al. found that for the bisexuals sexual preference was much less strongly connected with pre-adult sexual feelings. Based on this and other findings, they concluded that exclusive homosexuality tends to emerge from a [...] "deep-seated predisposition" [...] but that bisexuality is [...] "more subject to influence by social and sexual learning." [...] Exclusively homosexual white men tended to report that they had not identified <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers,</b> but there was no significant tendency for white bisexual men not to identify <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers.</b> Only white homosexual men who had undergone psychotherapy had [...] "paternal variables" [...] that were consistent with what clinicians had considered typical of homosexual males.|$|E
500|$|Homosexual {{women were}} more likely to {{describe}} their relationships with their mothers as negative, and their mothers as having been hostile or rejecting. These measures were combined into a single measure, [...] "Hostile-Rejecting Mother", which appeared to have only minimal influence on the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to describe their mothers as having been pleasant people. This and two other connected variables were combined into a composite measure called [...] "Unpleasant Mother", which had a weak and indirect connection with adult homosexuality. Homosexual women identified less strongly with their mothers, though this appeared to have very little influence on adult sexual preference, having only indirect effects, dependent upon its encouragement of childhood gender nonconformity. Homosexual women gave less favorable descriptions of their relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers,</b> and {{were more likely to have}} negative feelings toward them, and to describe them as having been hostile or detached. These variables were combined into a measure called [...] "Detached-Hostile Father", which appeared to encourage childhood gender nonconformity and adolescent homosexual involvement. Homosexual women were less likely to identify <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers,</b> but the [...] "Identification with Father" [...] variable appeared to be unimportant.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there is much to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Laurie Guy {{observed that}} Sexual Preference relied on adult recollection of childhood, {{a type of}} evidence that had been criticized by Gagnon and Simon {{as long ago as}} 1973. Guy argued that gay rights organizations in New Zealand over-relied upon the work in the debate that preceded the passage of the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, writing that while important, it was only one study, and as such did not support gay rights activist claims that [...] "all evidence" [...] shows that sexual orientation is fixed early in life. The neuroscientist Simon LeVay wrote in Gay, Straight, and the Reason Why (2010) that statistical studies support Freud′s view that on average gay men are more likely than straight men to describe their relationships with their mothers as close and their relationships <b>with</b> <b>their</b> <b>fathers</b> as distant or hostile; he cited Bell et al. in support of this claim.|$|E
