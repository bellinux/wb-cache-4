There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore.

5|$|When {{dramatic}} plot developments made Sasuke {{one of the}} series' antagonists, Kishimoto compared him and Naruto to the yin {{and yang}} due to their notable differences and complementary natures. He has mentioned that when one progresses, he makes sure the other does as well. In 2013, as the series approached its climax, Kishimoto encouraged readers {{to look forward to}} Sasuke and Naruto's final fight. Since it started serialization, Kishimoto had planned that the series' ending would feature the final fight between the two characters, although he was not sure whether the characters would end the duel as friends or enemies. While the two use ninja techniques in the beginning, in the climax the author wanted both fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat. In the end, Kishimoto decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato, another former enemy. Anime staff Chengxi Huang said the animated adaptation of this fight, the group worked carefully to depict the action in every scene by showing changes on Sasuke and Naruto's clothes and hair. Huang added he felt fatigue by <b>working</b> <b>so</b> much into this fight due to reaching 70 successive cuts at a time.|$|E

5|$|When first {{introducing}} Sasuke, Kishimoto {{wrote him}} as a rival who never noticed Naruto. However, as the series continued, Naruto became strong enough to be recognized by Sasuke as a rival. He also intended both as brothers {{due to the fact}} both characters suffered loneliness, something which made the readers relate to them as he noted through fan latters. By Part I's ending, the bond between Naruto and Sasuke was weakened {{as a result of their}} fight but still expected the time when the Sasuke accepted Naruto as an equal. Kishimoto drastically changed Sasuke's character, and the plot, by making him one of the series' antagonists, comparing Sasuke and Naruto to the concept of yin and yang because of their notable differences. When one of the two progressed, Kishimoto made sure the other did too. Before the serialization began, Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters. He wanted the conflict to end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. By 2013 when the series was reaching its climax, Kishimoto told the readers to look forward the final fight between the two characters. In regards to the fight, Kishimoto wanted to focus on hand-to-hand combat rather than ninja techniques.

The {{cause of the problem}} was improper adjustment during maintenance on 22 July 1950, when all four propellers were changed. A problem was detected with number two during a test flight, and the ground crew was instructed to install new contactors. There was no paperwork indicating that this was done, and the entire maintenance crew was killed in the crash. The number three engine and propeller were not found. The generators were found to be <b>working,</b> <b>so</b> there was sufficient electrical power to retract the landing gear. No crew members recalled hearing the landing gear motors. The switches could not be checked due to the degree of destruction of the aircraft, but the fuse was intact.

[...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E

500|$|In casting Al [...] "Gee" [...] Giardello, Levinson {{decided not}} to make the {{character}} Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the Homicide role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, [...] "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show on the air with this sort of cast composition." [...] Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly moving camera style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that he could handle the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant Terrence McLarney. He was cast in the McLarney role, but it was rewritten to an Italian character for Polito. The actor found working on Homicide intense and demanding, claiming, [...] "Everybody's <b>working</b> <b>so</b> hard. This is much more of a theater atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time <b>working</b> <b>so</b> he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E
500|$|According to {{designer}} Ben Schneider, {{the basic}} story was {{built around the}} recurring motif in multiple mythologies where a younger generation of deities defeat older primal beings, with the main premise being that victory being overturned. They stayed within their mythological subject matter rather than straying into historical events: {{this was due to}} an incident during the release of Age of Empires where the developers needed to cut a scenario showing Korean people coming under attack from invading Japanese due to potential political and popular backlash in both countries. The game's story and script were written by Randall Wallace, a screenwriter who had written recent successful films Braveheart and Pearl Harbor. Titan Quest was his first time writing for a video game. Together with Iron Lore staff, Wallace created a story where humans and the Olympians faced both the Titans and the mythical beasts allied with them that had retreated to the forgotten parts of the world. According to Wallace, Iron Lore wanted story to be a priority in contrast to most other video games, with the player experience focusing on growing their character and learning the world's lore from NPCs. Speaking about his experience writing for the game compared to his work on films, he needed to work within more rigid guidelines and the need to make the story fit in with the gameplay and content. This meant that some scenarios needed to be cut either due to budget limitations or some sequences <b>working</b> <b>so</b> well that they were extended. A major change from his writing for films was that it was the side characters rather than the main character that drove the story forward, so he needed to make them entertaining and important to furthering the plot. The team wanted a world with a scope beyond the main story, with material covering all of its locations. They also included NPC storytellers that would relate local legends and myths to the player in a similar way to storytellers of the time. Later, lead gameplay designer Arthur Bruno faulted the presentation as unappealing compared to the version of Greek mythology portrayed by God of War series, saying that the original atmosphere [...] "was seriously lacking a sense of dread and mystery".|$|E
