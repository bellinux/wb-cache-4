Ayers stated that touring with Vendetta Red <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could have {{happened}} to the band, comparing it to touring with the band Green Day. He expressed that touring with a band with a similar style and an already established fanbase would influence the band members positively.|$|E

Independence Bowl president Cecil Lloyd said of the controversy in 1993, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever could have happened to the Independence Bowl. ...

500|$|Clinkscales {{expressed}} regrets over leaving Queens after Norm Roberts, who {{had shown}} {{an interest in}} him, was hired by St. John's. While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 push-ups every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations. In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court. Commenting on Clinkscales' decision to move to Florida, Clarence Washington said, [...] "Going down there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to him." ...|$|E

He makes {{a phone call to}} Irene to tell her he is leaving and that meeting her and Benicio <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to him. The Driver goes to meet Bernie, who promises that Irene will be safe in exchange for the money. He gives Bernie the money, but Bernie attempts to kill him, stabbing him in the stomach. Driver pulls out his own knife and fatally stabs Bernie. [...] Driver then abandons the money and leaves. Irene knocks at the Driver's apartment, but gets no response. The Driver drives off into the night.|$|E
500|$|When O'Malley {{admits he}} cares for Christine, she finally breaks down and reveals the ugly truth. Her {{husband had been}} {{corrupted}} by the power and adulation he received. He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos that would let him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge. She could have warned her husband, but decided that a [...] "clean death in the rain <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could happen to Robert Forrest". O'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest's scheme.|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 2, 1957, Browder {{appeared}} on the television program The Mike Wallace Interview, where he was grilled for 30 minutes about his past in the Communist Party.

2500|$|After André Bazin's {{death in}} 1958, Rohmer became {{editor-in-chief}} of Cahiers du cinéma. By 1962, Rohmer (known as {{more conservative than}} many of his fellow contributors) was often at odds with his staff for not promoting New Wave filmmakers. After several financial failures, the directors wanted better publicity, with Cahiers an [...] "instrument of combat" [...] of the New Wave. Rohmer profiled New Wave filmmakers in the December 1962 issue before his June 1963 resignation, when Rivette became his successor. Rohmer later said that the pressure to leave Cahiers <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> ever happened {{to him as a}} film director.|$|E

2500|$|Sue {{is fired}} from the William McKinley High School in [...] "Shooting Star", when Becky's gun is shot by accident, causing {{everyone}} to think that there's a school shooting. Sue says it was her gun and she misfired it while checking it, to protect Becky. Coach Roz replaces Sue as the cheerleader squad coach and takes her office. Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and Blaine tries {{to get her back}} on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could have ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that does not miss the Cheerios at all.|$|E
2500|$|During {{training}} in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement {{of the match}} for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: [...] "That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> happened to Ali {{when we were in}} Africa—the fact that I had {{to get ready for the}} fight without being able to box." [...] Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the praise}} from the England side, Pietersen {{claimed he was}} dropped from the Natal first team. Pietersen {{felt that this was}} due to the country's racial quota system, in which provincial sides were {{required}} to have at least four black players. Pietersen's view was that players should be judged on merit, and described it as [...] "heartbreaking" [...] when he was left out of the side, although he later reflected [...] "it turned out it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could have happened". Pietersen has since firmly criticised the quota system, which he feels forced him out of the country of his birth. He has also criticised Graeme Smith, who became captain of the South African side in 2003, calling him [...] "an absolute muppet, childish and strange" [...] and that his behaviour [...] "leaves a lot to be desired". Smith opposed this, saying, [...] "I'm patriotic about my country, and that's why I don't like Kevin Pietersen. The only reason that Kevin and I have never had a relationship is because he slated South Africa". Pietersen's outspoken views published in his autobiography, Crossing the Boundary, in September 2006, and in an interview for the South African edition of GQ magazine, led to unsuccessful calls for an ICC investigation regarding bringing the game into disrepute.|$|E
