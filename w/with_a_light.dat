5|$|Boletus pisciodorus {{is similar}} in form to Tylopilus tabacinus. Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when viewed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that is apparent in both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E

5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> {{microscope}} reveals finer {{details of their}} structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E

5|$|On 16 January 1958, a {{passenger}} train collided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> engine which was standing foul {{of the line}} and was derailed. The light engine ended up on its side. Thirteen people were injured. A signalman was blamed for the accident as he failed to ensure that the line was clear for the passenger train.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> microscope. They are {{fusiform}} (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells of the}} hymenium) are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|At kickoff, a {{light breeze}} was blowing from the {{northeast}} at , the air temperature was , and the weather was foggy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> rain. Rain had been falling for several hours, turning the field into a muddy mess that would hinder play throughout the game. 62,850 tickets were sold for the game, and that number was given as the official attendance. Real attendance estimates range from 40,000-50,000, due to the poor weather {{and the fact that}} the stadium was half-empty through much of the game.|$|E

5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a horizontal plane, but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E

5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Taizong set out {{to solve}} {{internal}} problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui legal code, he issued a new legal code that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.|$|E
5|$|The ascospores {{produced}} by Polytolypa are , yellow to yellow-orange in color, with dimensions of 2.5–5 by 3–4μm. Viewed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> microscope their surfaces {{appear to be}} smooth, but under scanning electron microscopy, they are revealed to be densely marked with punctures and small, hard, sharp projections. The structures that produce the ascospores are called asci. In Polytolypa they are numerous, spherical, and measure 9–10 by 12–13μm. Each ascus contains eight ascospores, which are released when the ascus dissolves away at maturity. The anamorph (asexual form of the fungus) resembles the genus Chrysosporium.|$|E

5|$|The foyer of {{the tower}} was {{originally}} planned to be an open-air forecourt between {{the building and the}} remains of the Palace Hotel, however extensive aeroelastic wind testing of the structure by the Institute of Environmental Sciences at Murdoch University forced this area to be covered with a glass canopy. Mocks of the curtain walls {{to be used in the}} tower were also tested to 1.5 times the proof load to ensure they could withstand cyclone-force weather and seismic shocks. The building is clad with green-tinted double-pane glass on windows, with the service core and structure of the building covered with aluminium sheeting skin coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> grey fluoropolymer paint.|$|E
5|$|The spores of Bovista pila are spherical, smooth (when viewed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> microscope), {{and measure}} 3.5–4.5μm. They have thick walls and very short pedicels. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, {{measuring}} 8–10.5 by 14–18μm. They are usually four-spored (rarely, some are three-spored), with unequal length sterigmata between 4 and 7.4μm. The capillitia (sterile fibers interspersed among the spores) tend to form loose balls about 2mm in diameter. The main, trunk-like {{branches of the}} capillitia are up to 15μm in diameter, with walls that are typically 2–3μm thick.|$|E
5|$|Before dawn on August 17, {{troops from}} both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment, {{supported}} by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion, attacked Hill 303, but heavy North Korean mortar fire stopped them {{at the edge of}} Waegwan. During the morning, American artillery heavily bombarded the North Korean positions on the hill. Throughout the morning of August 17 the North Korean guards exchanged fire with U.S. troops attempting to rescue the prisoners. Around 12:00 the North Korean unit holding the Americans placed them in a gully on the hill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>light</b> company of 50 guards. Several more American prisoners were added to the group during the day, bringing the number of prisoners on Hill 303 to 45. One survivor estimated that the total number of prisoners was 67, and that the balance of the prisoners were executed on August 15 or 16.|$|E
