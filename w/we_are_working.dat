Rohde responded [...] "You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower {{in the middle of a}} finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear." ...|$|E
500|$|A team of Icelandic negotiators {{arrived in}} Moscow on 14 October {{to discuss the}} {{possible}} loan. Russian deputy finance minister Dmitri Pankin said that [...] "The meeting {{took place in a}} friendly atmosphere.... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> thoroughly on the issue to take a final decision". On the same day, the Central Bank of Iceland drew on its swap facilities with the central banks of Denmark and Norway for €200 million each. Iceland has swap facilities with the other Nordic countries for a total of €1.5 billion. Iceland is also seeking assistance from the European Central Bank (ECB): there is some precedent for the move, as the ECB already has currency swap arrangements with Switzerland, another non-member of the European Union.|$|E

5000|$|In a 1990s interview, Kulakauskas {{described}} the Soviet squad by telling: [...] "It {{could be said}} that there were the physical preparations and shootings, however all the tactics and the game-play was given to them by us. I remember by preparing for the Olympics in February, in Moscow, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> on tactics for a month. On tactics exercises without any game-play. Not a single minute. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> the whole month on techniques and tactics improvement.

[...] On May 5, 2015, Dave Magley, head coach and general manager of the Brampton A's during the season, was appointed by the league's Board of Governors to lead the investigation. He had already conducted interviews and spoken to representatives from both teams involved in the brawl. Magley also said that he would consider assuming the position of commissioner if he was approached, succeeding Paul Riley, who was fired in January 2015. Vito Frijia was named league spokesman during the investigation.|$|E

We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It’s {{a bit of a}} shock, to be sure, but we’re {{doing everything we can to}} be respectful to this character’s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling." ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, only 18people at 3D Realms {{were working}} on the game. One former {{employee}} said that Broussard and Miller were still operating on a [...] "1995 mentality", before games became large-team, big budget development affairs. Because they were financing the project themselves, the developers could also ignore pressure from their publisher; their standard reply to when Duke Nukem Forever would ship was [...] "when it's done". In 2003, Take-Two CEO Jeffrey Lapin reported that the game would not be out that year. He further said the company was writing off $5.5million from its earnings due to Duke Nukem Forevers lengthy development time. Broussard shot back that [...] "Take-Two needs to ... We don’t want Take-Two saying stupid-ass things in public for the sole purposes of helping their stock. It's our time and our money we are spending on the game. So either we're absolutely stupid and clueless, or we believe in what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on." [...] Later that year, Lapin said 3D Realms had told him that Duke Nukem Forever was expected to be finished by the end of 2004, or the beginning of 2005.|$|E

500|$|By April 2000, Columbia dropped Doctor Strange, {{which then}} had Michael France {{attached}} {{to write a}} script and interest from Chuck Russell and Stephen Norrington to direct. By June 2001, Dimension Films acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of Murder Mysteries, and promised not to be highly dependent on computer-generated imagery. However, by August 2001, Miramax acquired the film rights from Dimension, and by March 2002, Goyer {{had dropped out of}} the project. A 2005 release date was announced the next March, while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad stated, [...] "We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on it. We are trying to find the real Jerry Garcia of the writing community." [...] In April 2005, Paramount Pictures acquired Doctor Strange from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165 million.|$|E
500|$|Newly {{elected to}} a mining seat, Benn was a {{supporter}} of the 1984–85 UK miners' strike, which was beginning {{when he returned to the}} Commons, and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a [...] "regional matter" [...] in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: [...] "The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, nor do we seek to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference." [...] This guest appearance was considered one reason why Benn did not become a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> on a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E
