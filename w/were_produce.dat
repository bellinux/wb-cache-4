The Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad in 1871 reached Ossipee Corner, with service extended in 1875 to Center Ossipee. The trains brought commerce and tourists, helping the town develop as a summer resort. Railroad service, however, would be discontinued in 1961 for passengers, and in 1972 for freight.|$|E

It is concluded that it is feasible to improve the HIC resistance of pipeline steels through crystallography texture control and grain boundary engineering. The use of warm rolling schedules has been proven an effective solution in achieving this goal as they lead to crystallographic texture dominated by the { 111 }ND-fiber texture, and to a high proportion of low-angle grain boundaries.

Once at CERN the tiles were wrapped with Tyvek and, on the two lateral sides where the fibers have to be connected, a small piece of aluminized Mylar was put (glued on one side and fixed with scotch tape in the other one) to keep the fibers in. The Tyvek sleeves <b>were</b> <b>produce</b> by the Irrigro Company, in Ontario. Approximately 160 tiles of each of the 11 sizes (see table 1), were assembled with sleeves.

For this, tiles could be processed at the rate of 20 tiles/hour. Most of this time was spent working with the Mylar strips. Fifteen tiles of each size were assembled with sl [...] ...|$|E
