5|$|Sources differ about Morgan's {{activities}} in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography of Morgan, considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued {{a letter of}} marque for the invasion of Curaçao, {{although he did not}} attack <b>Willemstad,</b> the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories of Morgan and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.|$|E
