5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in unemployment rates in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E
5|$|A film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Doctor Strange was initially listed as being in development at New World Pictures, with a script dated January 21, 1986 by Bob Gale. For unknown reasons, Gale's film never went further into production. By 1989, Alex Cox had co-written a script with Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee. The script had the character traveling to the Fourth Dimension before facing the villain Dormammu on Easter Island, Chile. A film using this script was almost made by Regency, but the company's films were distributed by Warner Bros. at the time, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a dispute with Marvel over merchandising. By December 1992, Wes Craven had signed to write and direct Doctor Strange for release in either 1994 or 1995, with Savoy Pictures distributing. In 1995, David S. Goyer had completed a script for the film. By April 1997, Columbia Pictures had purchased the film rights and Jeff Welch {{was working on a}} new screenplay, with Bernie Brillstein and Brad Grey producing.|$|E

5|$|Achilles {{missed the}} Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916 {{because she was}} refitting. On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in {{response}} to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. During the Grand Fleet's sortie, Achilles spotted a U-boat. During another sortie by the High Seas Fleet on 18 October 1916, Achilles and three other armoured cruisers were ordered to patrol the northern end of the North Sea, between the approaches to Pentland Firth and Hardangerfjord in Norway, but they saw no German ships.|$|E
5|$|Adam Mort {{established}} a grammar school by the chapel in 1631 <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> use until 1833. Children from poor families were admitted free {{and those who}} could afford to pay covered the costs. Mort's School closed in 1894. In 1832 children were taught in a barn at the vicarage, the curate, Alfred Hewlett, improved it and the chapel {{was used as a}} classroom. A national school built by subscription on land donated by Captain Durie of Damhouse opened in November 1841. Meanleys Infant School was opened at Gin Pit in 1904 to serve the mining community that had grown up by there. Other schools were built at Ellesmere Street and Marsland Green.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} Hayden {{moved to}} Detroit {{to work for}} Dodge but returned to Kentucky after the first summer because of homesickness. During the 1922-23 basketball season he coached at Kentucky Wesleyan College <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Winchester at the time. In his one season at Kentucky Wesleyan he went 8-1. He then taught and coached at George Rogers Clark High School while taking {{a job in the}} insurance business in Richmond, Kentucky. In 1926 he was called to replace Ray Eklund as the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky but was given only one week to prepare for the task with a team made up of unskilled members. The squad consisted primarily of football players, many of whom lacked the incentive to fully participate. The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E

5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|After the Israeli {{invasion}} of Lebanon in 1982, Israel occupied {{a strip of}} south Lebanon, which was controlled by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), a militia supported by Israel. Hezbollah was conceived by Muslim clerics and funded by Iran primarily to harass the Israeli occupation. Its leaders were followers of Ayatollah Khomeini, and its forces were trained and organized by a contingent of 1,500 Revolutionary Guards that arrived from Iran with permission from the Syrian government, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> occupation of Lebanon at the time.|$|E

The sectors most affected were service-related industries, fluctuating with the population. The only sector to truly thrive after landfall was construction, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> high demand to make needed repairs and rebuild destroyed homes.|$|E

5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by the Klan during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{policy was}} put forward in 1923 by the Australian Labor Party, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> opposition {{for all but}} {{two years of the}} 1920s and 1930s. It called for Australia's first line of defence to be a powerful air arm, supported by a well-equipped Australian Army that could be rapidly expanded to meet an invasion threat. This, in turn, required a strong munitions industry. Labor politicians cited critics like Rear Admiral William Freeland Fullam, who drew attention to the vulnerability of warships to aircraft, naval mines and submarines. The Labor Party's Albert Green noted in 1923 that when a battleship of the day cost £7,000,000 while an aircraft cost £2,500, there was a genuine cause for concern as to whether the battleship was a better investment than hundreds of aircraft, if the aircraft could sink battleships. The Labor Party's policy became indistinguishable from the Army's position.|$|E
