5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} <b>was</b> <b>free</b> navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests.

This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Around 1844, {{she married}} a free black man named John Tubman. Although {{little is known about}} him or their time together, the union was {{complicated}} because of her slave status.

Such blended marriages – free people of color marrying enslaved people – were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population <b>was</b> <b>free.</b> Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.|$|E
