For example, one researcher found that H. aspersa snails from Brittany seem to do better indoors than snails from another region. To breed snails indoors, the temperature needs to be kept at 70°F and the relative humidity at 80% to 90%; some sources say 95%. Another source recommends 75% humidity by day and 95% at night.

50|$|This step {{can occur}} {{in a variety of}} ways {{depending}} on the species but always occurs at the abscission zone. Detachment can occur when layers of parenchyma cells secrete cell wall enzymes to self-digest the middle lamella, which holds the cell walls together at the abscission zone. This causes the cells of the abscission zone to break apart and the leaf or other plant part to fall off.Another way detachment occurs is through imbibition of water. The plant cells at the abscission zone will take in a large amount of <b>water,</b> <b>swell,</b> and eventually burst, making the organ fall off.

30|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the various limitations of in situ gel technology, industry experts and researchers developed a novel technology to address conformance control problems called preformed gel technology. Preformed gels are three-dimensional, hydrophilic crosslinked polymers which, in contact with <b>water,</b> <b>swell</b> but do not dissolve {{as a result of}} a chemical or physical crosslinking and often than not will undergo a volume phase change when surrounding conditions such as temperature, salinity or pH change (Wen-Fu and Sung-Chuan 2006; Kytai and Jennifer 2002). The novelty and main difference between this technology and in situ gel technology is that with preformed gel, gel formation takes place at the surface well ahead before injection, whereas with in situ gelation, crosslinking and gel formation occur downhole in the reservoir (Bai et al. 2013; Frampton et al. 2004). This technology was revolutionary in that it addressed some of the problems posed by in situ gelation such as dilution and dispersion of gelant, chromatographic separation of gelant solution, dehydration, syneresis, and most importantly damage of low permeability zones.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the renal medulla is more susceptible to bacterial infection than the cortex. ' Although more than 100, 000 organisms are usually required to produce infection when injected directly into the normal renal cortex, fewer than 10 are necessary in the medulla. Many factors contribute to the remarkable ease with which infection is initiated in the renal medulla. Among these are the anti-complementary effect of ammonia 2 " and the interference with phagocytosis which occurs in a hypertonic environment. ' A feature which has received little consideration is that the renal medulla is theoretically well suited for the survival of protoplast forms of bacteria. A protoplast, or L-form, is a differently shaped bacterium. Its peculiar shape results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis which may be affected by the action of certain antibiotics or antibody, complement and lysozyme systems. ` 7 The spherical protoplast will inbibe <b>water,</b> <b>swell,</b> and finally explode in media isotonic to plasma, whereas it may persist and even multiply in hypertonic media. Removal of the inhibitor of cell wall synthesis permits the reversion of the protoplast to normal bacterial form. The formation of protoplasts has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo" ' and undoubtedly represents one means by which bacteria are destroyed in host tissues which are isotonic to plasma. The persistence of protoplasts in hypertonic media in sitro prompted the suggestion that these forms might also be able to survive in vivo in a hypertonic environment.

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} was to develop an {{economical}} oily-water treatment system based on reverse-osmosis (RO) membrane technology. The RO system would be used to: (1) reduce oil-production costs by reducing the volume of waste water for which disposal is required; (2) {{form the basis of}} a generic waste-water treatment system that can easily be integrated into oil-field operations, especially at production facilities that are small or in remote locations: and (3) produce water clean enough to meet current and anticipated environmental regulations. The specific focus of this program was to develop a hollow-fiber membrane module capable of treating oily waste waters. Typically, the organics in oily waste <b>water</b> <b>swell</b> or dissolve the materials used in conventional polymeric membranes and modules. Our goal was to develop hollow-fiber membranes and modules that were more solvent-resistant than conventional membrane modules. We successfully achieved this goal. During the course of this program. we developed thin-film-composite (TFC) membranes, which consisted of a solvent-resistant selective coating placed on a solvent-resistant hollow-fiber support. These TFC membranes were used in low-cost, hollow-fiber modules, which were made using solvent-resistant components. The modules were tube-side-feed modules, in which the oily waste water travels down the inside (lumen) of the hollow fiber. The selective coating allows water to pass freely through the wall of the fiber, but restricts the transport of oil and grease and some of the dissolved organics and salts in the feed. Using these modules, more than 90 % of the oily waste water can be recovered as clean permeate (suitable for discharge), while the remaining 10 % is removed as oily-water concentrate (which can be recycled for recovery of the oil or disposed of in an environmentally acceptable manner) ...|$|E
40|$|Periodic {{pressure}} fluctuations beneath ocean waves deform {{the seabed}} beneath them and can generate seismic waves that propagate around the globe. These pressure fluctuations are recorded on seafloor pressure gauges {{and the associated}} ground displacements on seismometers, where they contribute to ambient seismic noise. The signals offer an opportunity to study or monitor ocean waves that are traditionally difficult to measure because of their low wave heights (deep water infragravity waves) or their remote locations (deep <b>water</b> <b>swell</b> waves). However, the link between ocean waves and the oscillations of the pressure and seismic wavefields has remained unclear. The aim of this thesis was to increase our understanding of ocean sources of ambient seismic noise, including their location, how well they can be located, and their relationship with ocean wave parameters. Using cross-correlated pairs of seafloor pressure records, infragravity waves offshore California/Oregon were found to originate mostly from local coastlines during northern-hemisphere winter and from the south during summer. A first attempt to estimate the coastal reflection coefficient of remote arrivals was made and found to be 0. 49 - 0. 74, which has implications for infragravity energy in the deep ocean and may be important for models in which infragravity waves are propagated across ocean basins. P-wave sources in the North Pacific during winter were located using seismometers in California and found to be concentrated around 40 - 50 ◦N 160 - 180 ◦E. Observed source locations were within 10 ◦ of the modelled source locations. Significant wave height in the deep ocean was estimated from P-waves and correlated with modelled wave height with a correlation coefficient of 0. 63. Previous work only attempted to estimate coastal wave heights. Combining additional records from Japan and Europe improved source location, including imaging of multiple sources. Accuracy in source location and amplitude estimation are essential if microseisms are {{to be used to}} monitor wave activity in the deep ocean. <br/...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{properties}} of thin films from highly sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) have been investigated {{within the context of}} their application as membranes for the dehydration of compressed carbon dioxide. Spectroscopic ellipsometry has been used as the predominant measurement technique. The relationships between the presence of water during film formation and final film properties have been investigated, as well as the water-induced dynamic swelling. Furthermore, the effects on thermal stability of thin SPEEK films when the protons in the sulfonic acid groups are exchanged with sodium ions has been evaluated. Additionally, the feasibility of using composite hollow fibers in the dehydration of compressed carbon dioxide has been assessed with simulations in Aspen Plus®. Thin SPEEK films swell excessively in water, and the extent of water-induced swelling is shown to be correlated with the inherent optical anisotropy of the films. The inherent anisotropy in SPEEK films is indicative for the presence of molecular orientations and internal stresses in the material. Additionally, the hydration state of SPEEK during film formation impacts the final morphology of the films, which can significantly affect the swelling behaviour. Films formed without the presence of <b>water,</b> <b>swell</b> significantly less than their counterparts, prepared in identical way but in a humid atmosphere. Swelling of SPEEK films can be also suppressed by grafting of polyols molecules on sulfonic acid groups, predominantly reducing the affinity for water. Sodium counter-ions strongly enhances thermal stability of SPEEK. No thermally-induced changes have been observed for SPEEK-sodium films when these are heated up to 220 °C for 15 hours. In contrast, SPEEK-proton films that are heated up to only 160 °C for 15 hours exhibit significant decomposition. For dehydration application via membranes, a method is required to remove water from the permeate side such that the high driving force over the membrane is maintained for water permeation. In this study, the usage of a sweep gas in a low pressure, also carbon dioxide, has been discussed...|$|E

40|$|Intravascular {{catheters}} {{are essential}} for the appropriate management of hospitalized patients as they provide clinicians with useful means to administer nutrients, obtain blood samples and deliver drugs. However, these devices are a common cause of nosocomial infections. The significant increase {{in this type of}} nosocomial infections urged new strategies to prevent them (1). Our research is focused on a new tecnique aimed at preventing catheter-related infections, based on the chemical adsorption of antibiotic molecules on functionalized urethane polymers (2), chosen because they are the most largely employed polymers for catheter construction. In particular in this work the antibiotics, amoxicillin and rifampin, were chosen for their antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and for their ability, due to the presence in the molecules of suitable functional groups, to interact with our polymer surfaces. To verify the influence of functional groups on the polymer-antibiotic interaction, macromolecules provided with carboxyl groups, amino groups, positively charged groups, and sulfate groups were investigated. The evaluation of the amount of adsorbed antibiotic was made by UV-VIS spectroscopy and the kinetics of the antibiotic release was studied by placing the samples in physiological solution and changing the solution every hour for the first 5 h, and every 24 h for the longer times. To better simulate the in vivo elution, the antibiotic release with time was also studied under dynamic conditions, using a peristaltic pump, after coating of commercial catheters with our polymers. At regular sampling times catheters were disconnected from the line and their in vitro antimicrobial activity was assessed by a modified Kirby-Bauer test, using Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 35984) as test microrganism. The amount of antibiotic adsorbed by the polymers is particularly elevated (about 1 mg/cm 2) with respect to literature data. The antibiotic-polymer affinity increases with the introduction in the polymer side-chain of functional groups able to establish specificic interactions, such as ionic bonds. All the antibiotic-coated polymers show inhibition zone of the bacterial growth that lasts only a few hours for the amoxi-coated polymers while it remains at least for five mounths for the rifampin-coated ones. The half-life antimicrobial activity depends on the amount of the antibiotic adsorbed and on the <b>water</b> <b>swell</b> ability of the polymers. To verify the influence of the serum proteins on the duration of the antimicrobial action of the treated surfaces, they were immersed in human serum and incubated at 37 °C for increasing times, and their behaviour was compared to that of the abovementioned polymers treated with physiological solution...|$|E
