5|$|LeRoy King, one of {{the members}} of the Coolidge Mission, wrote in his report that the {{authorities}} in Maribor were suspicious of the work of the mission and apparently feared that it had uncovered information they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to conceal. He argued that there were Slovene populations in Styria who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the maintenance of Austrian rule.|$|E
5|$|Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chun, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{the film}} to be shot on {{location}} in Foshan and noted the mansion being more grand than the original.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Frieda, {{a friend}} of Esther who has never {{received}} any marriage proposals, tells Shira that Esther <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> that Yochay marry her {{in the event of}} her death. As a result, Shira tells Yochay that Frieda is more suitable, which he takes as an affront.|$|E
60|$|The best, the kindliest, {{if not the}} justest {{course is}} surely to leave untold such things as Mr. Polly <b>would</b> manifestly <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> untold.|$|R
5000|$|In The Great Shark Hunt, Hunter S. Thompson {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} not having been {{included on the}} list, writing [...] "I <b>would</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a vindictive tax audit {{to that kind of}} crippling exclusion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And please God {{you will}} not go away empty handed," [...] said Lingard, {{smoothing}} his brow. [...] "After all you and I were not meant to meet only to quarrel. <b>Would</b> you <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to see them pass into Tengga's keeping?" ...|$|R
5|$|Music critics {{received}} the album with favorable responses, where some <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a full album. The EP was a commercial success, peaking at number twenty on the Billboard 200 and at {{number one on}} Top Holiday Albums. Songs from The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection have been performed at several venues.|$|E
5|$|In early 1803, the Duke of York {{appointed}} Ernest {{as commander}} of the Severn District, {{in charge of the}} forces in and around the Severn Estuary. When war with France broke out again after the Peace of Amiens, the elder Duke appointed Ernest to the more important Southwest District, comprising Hampshire, Dorset and Wiltshire. Though Ernest <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> command of the King's German Legion, composed mostly of expatriates from French-occupied Hanover, he accepted the post. The Duke of Cumberland increased the defences on the South Coast, especially around the town of Weymouth, where his father often spent time in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Roberts' son, Kenny Roberts Jr., won the 2000 500cc World Championship, {{making them}} the only {{father and son}} duo to have won the title. Ironically, Roberts has stated that he {{considers}} himself a dirt tracker at heart and only took up road racing because {{it was necessary to}} do so if a rider was going to compete for the Grand National championship. He also said that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to remain in the United States to compete in the Grand National championship if Yamaha or another manufacturer had been able to construct a dirt track racer capable of competing with Harley-Davidson.|$|E
60|$|If the playfulness of Monsieur Rigaud were at all {{expressed}} by his smile at this point, {{the relations of}} Madame Rigaud might {{have said that they}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> his correcting that unfortunate woman seriously.|$|R
60|$|Jim {{insisted on}} {{carrying}} his muzzle-loader on this expedition, believing {{it a more}} trustworthy weapon than the revolver, and Jet made no objections, although he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> that the ancient musket had been left behind.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is {{the best}} thing I have ever heard,' {{answered}} the fox; and as they were two to one the bear had to be content, though in his heart he <b>would</b> much <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a good dinner at once to any friendship.|$|R
5|$|The DeKalb County Circuit Court {{came into}} {{existence}} in June 1839 when the first session of court met in Sycamore's first courthouse building, though the building was somewhat incomplete. At first, it seemed, that Sycamore {{might not be the}} location of the DeKalb County Courthouse; other towns were vying for the county seat title. A now defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden and Rufus Colton <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> Coltonville, where he made his home.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. Olivier <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the roles to be cast {{the other way}} about, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's family <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{him to have}} {{remained}} at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong to}} prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was expected of him, and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{sat down}} again, and making no answer, {{looked away from}} her, for though he <b>would</b> greatly <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> it he {{scarcely}} felt capable of reaching his tent. Then there was silence for several minutes until Mrs. Devine {{came back with the}} wine.|$|R
50|$|In {{northern}} Ghana, {{a region}} where male primogeniture predominates, rich households favoured sons over daughters. It is likely that first born sons <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>preferred</b> as they would inherit the wealth and therefore have higher reproductive prospects.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the two having feuded {{from the}} very start of the season, Vivica A. Fox {{admitted}} that she was upset to see Kate Gosselin fired, and that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> Kenya Moore to have gone instead.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{moderation}} and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to depose the Palaiologoi outright and install the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, {{and had to be}} placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, 25 {{years after}} the end of their relationship, Joyce Maynard {{auctioned}} a series of letters Salinger had written her. Maynard's memoir of her life and her relationship with Salinger, At Home in the World: A Memoir, was published the same year. Among other topics, the book described how Maynard's mother had consulted with her on how to appeal to the aging author (who was dressing like a child), and described Joyce's relationship with him at length. In the ensuing controversy over both the memoir and the letters, Maynard claimed that she was forced to auction the letters for financial reasons; she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to donate them to the Beinecke Library. Software developer Peter Norton bought the letters for US$156,500 and announced his intention to return them to Salinger.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela {{had helped}} create, {{called for the}} {{nationalisation}} of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but {{that this was not}} feasible {{as a result of the}} international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.|$|E
30|$|This section {{concerns}} some ‘basic concept’ {{for producing}} a sys-net. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> much <b>preferred</b> to use throughout this section only the contextual sys-nets for illustrating the systemic notations. But the first figure, an exception, seems better suited as an opening.|$|R
60|$|Anne <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{infinitely}} <b>preferred</b> a whipping to this punishment {{under which}} her sensitive spirit quivered {{as from a}} whiplash. With a white, set face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the blackboard above her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, Ben Ibyn, rather than excite your displeasure, though I <b>would</b> much <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{not to do}} so, for you speak so much more highly of the affair than it merits. I had myself the honour of being in command of that galley." ...|$|R
5|$|Uematsu had {{originally}} {{calculated that the}} game would require more than 100 pieces of music, but managed {{to reduce the number}} to 56. He has stated that he developed the ideas for the music by first reading through the script and creating the titles for all of the tracks, then composing melodies to match the themes of the story and titles. Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy V was much better than that of Final Fantasy IV. He also claimed that this resulted in the soundtrack release requiring two CDs as opposed to the one CD required for the Final Fantasy IV soundtrack. Uematsu has stated that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to keep the soundtrack to one CD, {{in order to keep the}} price of the album low.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Berger was {{responsible}} for the large numbers of non-Reich foreign recruits that joined the Waffen-SS between 1940 and 1945. Despite the fact that Berger <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> a field command, he was one of Himmler's few trusted senior lieutenants, and his recruiting and organisational skills meant he was kept as chief of the SS-HA throughout the war. The only exception was the short period as military commander in the Slovak State in the autumn of 1944 during the uprising. In September 1939, the number of non-Germans in what soon became the Waffen-SS was minimal. By May 1945, the force included 38 divisions, and the majority were non-Germans. None of the 38 divisions were exclusively manned by Reich Germans, and half were made up of mostly of personnel from outside the Reich.|$|E
5|$|William of Poitiers {{states that}} William {{obtained}} Pope Alexander II's consent for the invasion, signified by a papal banner, along with diplomatic support from other European rulers. Although Alexander did give papal approval to the conquest after it succeeded, no other source claims papal support before the invasion. William's army assembled {{during the summer}} while an invasion fleet in Normandy was constructed. Although the army and fleet were ready by early August, adverse winds kept the ships in Normandy until late September. There were probably other reasons for William's delay, including intelligence reports from England revealing that Harold's forces were deployed along the coast. William <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to delay the invasion until he could make an unopposed landing.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} made {{a sign of}} assent, {{and sitting}} down upon a ledge of rock took out a cigar. Wyllard now felt more sure of him, since {{it was evident that}} had he meditated any treachery he <b>would</b> naturally <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> him to make the visit unattended. In any case, it seemed likely that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> something to eat in his camp.|$|R
60|$|The porter was a good-tempered, shallow-minded, ignorant man. Mrs. Manston, being {{apparently}} in very gloomy spirits, <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> walking beside him {{without saying a}} word: but her companion would not allow silence to continue between them {{for a longer period}} than two or three minutes together.|$|R
5|$|While in Lwów, Steinhaus co-founded the Lwów School of Mathematics and {{was active}} in the circle of mathematicians {{associated}} with the Scottish cafe, although, according to Stanislaw Ulam, for the circle's gatherings, Steinhaus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> generally <b>preferred</b> a more upscale tea shop down the street.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Christopher Tolkien {{published}} {{a collection of}} more fragmentary material, under the title Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth. In subsequent years (1983–1996) he {{published a}} large amount of the remaining unpublished materials, together with notes and extensive commentary, in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle-earth. They contain unfinished, abandoned, alternative, and outright contradictory accounts, since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories. There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the two most closely related works, because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other. He commented in 1965, while editing The Hobbit for a third edition, that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> to completely rewrite the book because of the style of its prose.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{reviews of}} the title have been {{generally}} positive. Famitsu generally praised several aspects, but found the item management and weapon structures confusing, saying {{that it did not}} live up to the legacy of the Mana series. Reviewing the Vita port, Famitsu praised the game's general ease of play and use of the Mana series, but the button layout was criticized. Kyōsuke Takano of AppGet praised the gameplay and graphics, noting that the game avoided the possible pitfalls of being a mobile game while delivering a strong experience. His one point of reservation was that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> the game on another platform. 4Gamer.net praised the variety of control options, the feel of gameplay, and the graphics. The writer noted that the game should be played on more advanced mobiles despite recommendations, as the graphics and performance suffered on older smartphone models.|$|E
60|$|Millicent, at {{the risk}} of being guilty of eavesdropping, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> greatly <b>preferred</b> to stay where she was; but when the man did his wife's bidding, she could only follow and thank him. Lifting a cluster of fruit from the tray, she asked one question.|$|R
60|$|It {{was close}} upon the hour, and the tickets were being examined, when Mr. Rolles beheld this other fellow-passenger ushered by several porters into his place; certainly, {{there was not}} another {{man in the world}} whom he <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> - for it was old John Vandeleur, the ex-Dictator.|$|R
6000|$|Still Flora was good-tempered, though Ethel <b>would</b> almost <b>have</b> <b>preferred</b> {{her being}} provoked; [...] "I know," [...] she said, [...] "I {{have been using}} you ill, and leaving the world on your shoulders, {{but it was all}} in your service and Cocksmoor's; and now we shall begin to be {{reasonable}} and useful again." ...|$|R
