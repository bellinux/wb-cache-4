25|$|The Mumbai attack also {{triggered}} {{a chain of}} citizens' movements across India. People {{from all walks of}} life hit the streets with candles and placards to pay tributes to the victims of the tragedy almost every weekend after the 26/11 incident. While NSG commandos, Mumbai police officials, hotel staffers, etc. who participated in the operation to eliminate the terrorists became overnight heroes, the wrath of the citizens was directed towards the Government's inability to ensure adequate security to its citizens, and soon led to the chain of resignations, including that of the Indian Home Minister, Shivraj Patil. The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people. Some organised initiatives to carry forward the citizens' movement included a Hindustan Times-CNN-IBN Initiative, India Today Group's <b>War</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Terror,</b> and , besides a large number of blogs on the issue.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to provide}} a critic vision of the "ethic of {{violence}}" through authors like E. Bocardo, M. Castells, P. Singer, R. Bernstein and J. Butler. The ethic of violence was intended to justify the American <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> <b>terror,</b> {{instead of trying to}} solve the problem through dialogue or diplomacy. In their way, each of these authors criticize the ethics that were used to justify the American war, referring to their economical motivations and their media performance. An indication of the ethic is the one that President Bush showed at that time in his declarations of moral content —as his notorious phrase "the axis of evil"— in order to place himself in the side of good and them -his enemies- in the side of evil...|$|R

As part of efforts to end insurgency in Nigeria, the Ambassador of France to Nigeria Jacques Champagne de Labriolle visited Adewole in his office at the University of Ibadan. Adewole described the ambassador's visit as [...] "auspicious and timely in the history of Nigeria." [...] He said [...] "our country must gladly engage the French-speaking countries, if we really want to maintain security for the citizenry. I believe that creating a long-term security should be our main concern just as the initiative of our president was so strategic, having recently visited France." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to many experts, the Obama {{administration}} {{has relied on}} the CIA and their paramilitary capabilities, even more than they have on U.S. military forces, to maintain the fight against terrorists in the Afghanistan and Pakistan region, as well as places like Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. [...] Ronald Kessler states in his book The CIA at War: Inside the Secret <b>War</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Terror,</b> that although paramilitary operations are a strain on resources, they’re winning the war against terrorism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} of George W. Bush in 2000 {{brought a new}} generation of conservatives to power in Washington. Bush ran under the banner of compassionate conservatism, contrasting himself {{with other members of the}} Republican Party. Bush cut taxes in a 10-year plan that was renewed in late 2010, following major debate. Bush forged a bipartisan coalition to pass [...] "No Child Left Behind", which for the first time imposed national standards on public schools. Bush expanded Medicaid, and was criticized by conservatives. The September 2001 terrorist attacks resulted in American commitment to the <b>War</b> <b>against</b> <b>Terror</b> with invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.|$|E
5000|$|Neoconservative author Michael Ledeen {{argued in}} his 2002 book The <b>War</b> <b>Against</b> the <b>Terror</b> Masters that America is a revolutionary nation, undoing {{traditional}} societies: [...] "Creative destruction is our middle name, both {{within our own}} society and abroad. We tear down the old order every day, from business to science, literature, art, architecture, and cinema to politics and the law."

However, Ledeen maintains these statements are consistent since: [...] "I opposed the military invasion of Iraq before it took place and I advocated—as I still do—support for political revolution in Iran as the logical and necessary first step in the <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the <b>terror</b> masters." ...|$|R

He ascended to the position of tribal chief after the death of his father, Abdullah al-Ahmar, in late 2007. Unlike Abdullah, Sadiq and his brothers have not been seen as supporters of Ali Abdullah Saleh. Sadiq had publicly condemned al-Qaeda and had voiced some support for Saleh's <b>war</b> <b>against</b> the <b>terror</b> organisation, but remained critical and suspicious of the president's motives, declaring that Saleh's primary intent was not to combat terrorism but to extract aid money from the United States.|$|R
2500|$|After the September 11, 2001 attacks, this uproar {{escalated}} {{and lead}} to active uptake of surveillance activities. The Patriot Act {{was passed by the}} Congress to strengthen security, and thus, granted the President broad powers on the <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>terror,</b> which included the power to bypass the FISA Court for surveillance orders. Mass surveillance activities were conducted alongside various other surveillance programs under the head of President's Surveillance Program. [...] The NSA was authorised to monitor phone calls, internet activity, and messaging between people, without a warrant. Due to pressure from the public, the warrantless wiretapping program was allegedly ceased in January 2007 and the review of surveillance was returned to the FISA Court. However, the Obama Administration has alleged to have continued the surveillance.|$|E
2500|$|The People's Republic of China (PRC) said on Monday {{evening that}} the death of Osama bin Laden was [...] "a {{milestone}} and a positive development for the international anti-terrorism efforts".

China supported Pakistan amid growing questions in the U.S. about whether the country was complicit in harboring Osama bin Laden saying the, [...] "Pakistani government's determination to fight terrorism are staunch and its actions have been vigorous." [...] Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao discussed the issue with the U.S. in official talks. He asked the U.S. to respect Pakistan's sovereignty, and acknowledge its sacrifices in the <b>war</b> <b>against</b> <b>terror.</b> China also indicated that it would be assisting Pakistan in strengthening its Counter-Terrorism efforts, police force and army, with a specific focus on dealing with the specific domestic issues in Pakistan.|$|E

40|$|As the United States {{continues}} {{to fight a}} <b>war</b> <b>against</b> private <b>terror</b> organizations, we and our coalition partners must avoid resorting to terror ourselves, lest our moral and legal standing be undermined. Both in Afghanistan and in Kosovo, the United States employed a weapon that violates the spirit if not the letter of humanitarian law. That weapon, the cluster bomb, unduly endangers and terrorizes civilians. Although focusing primarily on NATO 2 ̆ 7 s use of this weapon in Serbia and its Kosovo province, the thesis of this Article also applies to the United States 2 ̆ 7 employing cluster bombs in our war in Afghanistan, a war to defeat and capture {{those responsible for the}} September 11 attacks...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, Mervin Frost {{stresses}} the inherent historical link between war and ethics. He focuses {{mainly on the}} three different types of wars after the Second World War: national liberation wars, new wars, and the <b>war</b> <b>against</b> global <b>terror.</b> The main argument is that “making war” is an activity developed within a social practice that involves a remarkable level of activity for the actors taking part in it. Without any doubt, war therefore gains an ethical dimension. The author first explores these ethical elements between colonial rulers and colonial societies that seek an independent state. Secondly, there are ethical elements in “new wars”, where violence {{is used as a}} way to humiliate the enemy. And finally, in the context of global terrorism, that cannot be understood as “absurd” or empty of ethics. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{foreign policy}} of the George W. Bush {{administration}} has won few admirers, and many anticipate that his successor will repudiate {{the actions of the}} past eight years. In their provocative account Lynch and Singh argue that Bush’s policy should be placed within the mainstream of the American foreign policy tradition. Further, they suggest that there will, and should, be continuity in US foreign policy from his presidency to those of his successors. Providing a positive audit {{of the war on terror}} (which they contend should be understood as a Second Cold War) they maintain that the Bush doctrine has been consistent with past policy at times of war and that the key elements of Bush’s grand strategy will continue to shape America’s approach in the future.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe United States faces a continuing need to conduct interagency operations, especially {{between the military}} and USAID. Surprisingly, however, this field has been treated much too casually in light of its merits as a potential force multiplier-and as a source of serious operational problems. US leaders will continue to choose the interagency approach (over unilateral options) to solve the sorts of complex problems that demand action and systematic intervention, yet allow room for political maneuver. By studying the activities of two inherently adversarial bureaucracies (USAID and the USMWGP) which needed to work together to solve a complex counterinsurgency problem in El Salvador, I have been able to determine which factors are most important for unity of effort in future interagency operations. In El Salvador the mission was to combat insurgents, but the principles and many of the tasks required to succeed then and there, apply today and elsewhere in waging the <b>wars</b> <b>against</b> drugs, <b>terror,</b> and other post- Cold War security threats[URL] United States Air Forc...|$|R
40|$|This article {{interprets the}} {{strategies}} {{that have been}} associated with the <b>war</b> on <b>terror</b> <b>against</b> the backdrop of historical geographies of colonial violence and dispossession. It joins those who argue that wider anxieties about the sources of danger, criminality, violence and terror have become intertwined. These reveal as much about sensibilities of race, class and 'security' as they do objective dangers. Thus the article considers how, drawing on the British case, detentions and deportations marked by race are connected with and form part of an overlapping regime of 'security', 'immigration' and asylum. This is exemplified via an account of the trajectory British sovereign territory of Diego Garcia, leading to wider reflections on contemporary forms of sovereignty and the operation of 'race' in geopolitics...|$|R
