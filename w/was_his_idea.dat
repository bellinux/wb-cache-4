5|$|On 26 November, {{the detainees}} were deported, {{along with their}} families. Although this was an entirely German initiative—Quisling himself was left unaware {{although}} government assistance was provided—Quisling led the Norwegian public {{to believe that the}} first deportation of Jews, to camps in Poland, <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea.</b> A further 250 were deported in February 1943, and it remains unclear what the party's official position was on the eventual fate of the 759 Norwegian deportees. There is evidence to suggest that Quisling honestly believed the official line throughout 1943 and 1944, that they were awaiting repatriation to a new Jewish homeland.|$|E

In 1977, he protested the extradition of Klaus Croissant to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police. In July that year, he organised an assembly of Eastern Bloc dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev to Paris. In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea,</b> even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
500|$|Gemini {{is widely}} {{believed}} to be Mani's first Tamil film, though he had already starred in Vaanchinathan (2001). There have been varying accounts on how he was cast: while Vikram claims to have suggested Mani {{for the role of}} Teja, Saran said in one interview that casting Mani <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea,</b> and contradicted this in another interview, saying that Mani was chosen on his wife's recommendation. While searching for an unfamiliar actor for the DGP's role, Saran saw Murali in Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001) and found him [...] "very dignified". He chose Murali as he wanted that dignity for the role. Though he had planned to make Murali a villain {{at the end of the}} film, Saran decided against it because he was [...] "amazed to see awe in everyone's eyes when Murali entered the sets and performed".|$|E
500|$|At {{most of her}} live {{performances}} of the song, the singer was accompanied by saxophonist Basasteanu on stage, which <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea.</b> Stan performed the song at French event Starfloor 2011, and on German show Ballermann Hits in late 2011; the latter appearance was controversial as the singer accidentally showed parts of her vagina. She went on to perform [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] at the 2011 Eska Music Awards, German music show The Dome and on German television ARD's Morgenmagazin as an acoustic version. It was also included on the setlist of concert tours promoting her debut studio album Saxobeats. Covers of the track were done by Russian singer Lena Katina in an acoustic approach, American band Selena Gomez & the Scene on their We Own the Night Tour (2011–12) in Latin America, and Dominican recording artist Omega, whose version peaked at number 25 on Billboard Latin Digital Songs component chart.|$|E

Upon first viewing the film, he joked that while it [...] "wasn't Gone with the Wind", it had commercial potential, and he expressed an interest in distributing it.

500|$|Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Tifa was {{not present}} in early {{versions}} of Final Fantasy VII, as initially, the game was to have only three playable characters; the protagonist Cloud Strife, Aerith Gainsborough and Barret Wallace. However, during {{a phone call to}} project director Yoshinori Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura later joked that this <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea,</b> so as to enable him to introduce Tifa into the game. Regardless, the notion of having two concurrent heroines, and having the hero waver between them, was something Kitase liked, describing it as something new in the Final Fantasy series. Nomura describes Tifa's character in Advent Children as having several dimensions, calling her [...] "like a mother, a sweetheart, and a close ally in battle" [...] and [...] "remarkably strong, not only emotionally, but physically as well." ...|$|E

[...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>idea.</b> [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.'
