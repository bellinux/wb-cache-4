5|$|While the WHA {{opened the}} door, and players slowly joined the NHL, those behind the Iron Curtain were {{restricted}} from following suit. In 1980, Peter Stastny, his wife, {{and his brother}} Anton secretly fled Czechoslovakia {{with the aid of}} Nordiques owner Marcel Aubut. The Stastnys' defection made international headlines, and contributed to the first wave of Eastern Europeans' entrance into the NHL.

However, defection was the only way such players could join the teams that drafted them. Michal Pivonka defected from Czechoslovakia in 1986, while Russian Alexander Mogilny defected following the 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Anchorage, Alaska. Czech teenager Petr Nedved walked into a Calgary police station in January 1989 after playing in the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament.|$|E
5000|$|The area of Anderston {{now known}} as Cranstonhill was known in ancient times as Drumother Hill. It became {{corrupted}} to Drumover Hill, {{the reason for this}} being a myth that it was the place where vagabonds were escorted to, to the tune of the [...] "Rogues' March", when they were drummed out of town. Alexander Peden prophesied in the 17th century that this hill <b>would</b> <b>one</b> <b>be</b> <b>day</b> <b>be</b> the site of the 'Cross of Glasgow.'

5|$|The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) {{wrote in}} his Meteorology of how the earth had the {{potential}} for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry.

Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and <b>would</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>be</b> filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands.

5|$|While European-born {{players were}} a part of the NHL since its founding, it was still rare to see them in the NHL until 1980, {{although}} the WHA employed a number of them. Borje Salming was the first European star in the NHL and Finns Jari Kurri and Esa Tikkanen helped lead the Oilers dynasty of the 1980s. The WHA opened the door, and players slowly joined the NHL, but those behind the Iron Curtain were restricted from following suit.

Shortly {{before the end of the}} 1988–89 regular season, Flames general manager Cliff Fletcher announced that he had reached an agreement with Soviet authorities that allowed Sergei Pryakhin to play in North America. It was the first time a member of the Soviet national team was permitted to leave the Soviet Union. Shortly after, Soviet players began to flood into the NHL.

25|$|While {{it is true}} {{that very}} little detail of Hephaestion’s {{childhood}} and education can be found, that which remains gives credence to what is known about his later life.

He had higher property qualifications than the aire forgill, but his prime claim to higher status was that he <b>would</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>be</b> king. Kings held the highest status that the laws describe. The basic king had an honour price of seven cumals, and higher kings had yet a higher status. Having the highest status, the king especially was expected to be careful to keep his honour.

25|$|The {{area that}} <b>would</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>be</b> Union City, however, {{remained}} sparsely populated {{until the early}} 19th century. The British granted Bergen a new town charter in 1668. In 1682 they created Bergen County, which was named to honor their Dutch predecessors. That county comprised all of present-day Hudson, Bergen and Passaic counties. Sparsely inhabited during the 17th and 18th centuries, the southeast section of Bergen County had grown by the early 19th century {{to the point where}} it was deemed necessary to designate it a separate county. The New Jersey legislature created Hudson County in 1840, and in 1843, it was divided into two townships: Old Bergen Township (which eventually became Jersey City) and North Bergen Township, which was gradually separated into Hudson County's present day municipalities: Hoboken in 1849, Weehawken and Guttenberg in 1859, and West Hoboken and Union Township. West Hoboken was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 28, 1861, from portions of North Bergen Township. The township was reincorporated on April 6, 1871, and again on March 27, 1874. Portions of the township were ceded to Weehawken in 1879. On June 28, 1884, West Hoboken was reincorporated as a town, based on an ordinance passed nine days earlier. The town was reincorporated on April 24, 1888, based on the results of a referendum passed 12 days earlier. Union Township, or simply Union, was formed through the merger of a number of villages, such as Dalleytown, Buck's Corners and Cox's Corners. The largest of these villages, Union Hill, became the colloquial name for the merged town of Union itself. The northern section of Union Township was later incorporated as West New York in 1898. Union City was incorporated on June 1, 1925, by merging the two towns of West Hoboken and Union Hill. The name of one of the city's schools, Union Hill Middle School, recalls the former town.|$|E
