40|$|Background: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco {{smoking is}} {{spreading}} globally and is increasingly becoming {{popular in the}} United States, particularly among young people. Although many perceive <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking to be relatively safe, clinical experimental studies indicate significant exposures to tobacco smoke carcinogens following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use. We investigated biomarkers of nicotine intake and carcinogen exposure from <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in the naturalistic setting of hookah bars. Methods: Fifty-five experienced <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users were studied before and after smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> in their customary way in a hookah bar. Urine samples were analyzed for nicotine, cotinine, the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4 -(methylnitrosamino) - 1 -(3 -pyridyl) - 1 -butanol (NNAL), and mercapturic acid metabolites of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Results: We found an average 73 -fold increase in nicotine, 4 -fold increase in cotinine, 2 -fold increase in NNAL, and 14 % to 91 % increase in VOC mercapturic acid metabolites immediately following <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. We saw moderate to high correlations between changes in tobacco-specific biomarkers (nicotine, cotinine, and NNAL) and several mercapturic acid metabolites of VOCs. Conclusion: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in a hookah bar is associated with significant nicotine intake and carcinogen exposure. Impact: Given the significant intake of nicotine and carcinogens, chronic <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use could place users at increased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. © 2014 AACR...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> {{smoking is}} a type of smoking habit which has been practiced {{extensively}} for about 400 years. In recent years, there has been a revival of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, notably among adults. However, there is limited data about the effect of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of this habit on pulmonary function and exercise capacity indices among healthy Saudi adults. Procedures: Forty Saudi male subjects were selected. Their ages ranged from 18 - 25 years old. They were divided into two groups. In experimental group there were 20 subjects who were smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (21. 8 ± 2. 6) years while in the control group there were 20 subjects (20. 6 ± 1. 9) years. After recording detailed personal and smoking habit information, all subjects performed pulmonary function test and cardiopulmonary exercise test. Result: Statistical analysis showed significant reduction in pulmonary function test and exercise capacity indices variables (P= 0. 000), VC, FVC, FEV 1, MVV, VO 2 max among <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers than in non smokers. Conclusion: <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking has marked adverse effect on ventilatory functions and exercise performance in the adult <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers. An early alarming and special attention should be considered to aware this interval of the community. Objective evidence of an effect of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking on pulmonary function and exercise capacity in this age group may assist educators and health care professionals in convincing adults to quit <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking {{appears to}} be an {{increasing}} public health concern, with anecdotal reports of higher prevalence than cigarette smoking among young people in some high-income countries. We examined the prevalence and predictors of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smoking among students attending secondary schools in a deprived, ethnically diverse part of inner London. METHODS: We conducted a 96 -item, validated smoking habits questionnaire with 2, 399 students from Years 8, 10, and 12 / 13 from 15 secondary schools in Brent, northwest London. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of current and ever cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking. RESULTS: Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking prevalence was more than double that of cigarette smoking prevalence (7. 6 % vs. 3. 4 %, p <. 001). One in 4 students had tried <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> compared with 1 in 6 who had tried cigarette smoking (24. 0 % vs. 15. 8 %, p <. 001). Significant predictors of ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use include being in a higher age group, South Asian or Middle Eastern ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use. Significant predictors of ever cigarette use include being in a higher age group, White ethnicity, and personal, family, or friends tobacco use.

40|$|Background: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> is a {{traditional}} method of tobacco use, which is epidemically spreading throughout Europe. There are scarce data {{about the use of}} <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and its relation to other addictive behaviors among young adults in Western countries. Objectives: It was our aim to identify the sociodemographic characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> users in Switzerland and to describe concurrent cigarette and cannabis smoking habits. Methods: Young adults aged 16 - 30 years were evaluated based on a 16 -item standardized questionnaire on tobacco consumption and exhaled carbon monoxide. Current <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use at least once within the last 4 weeks; regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was defined as <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> use {{at least once a week}} during the last 52 weeks. Results: Out of 353 volunteers, a total of 204 subjects (mean age 21 ± 3. 5 years, 113 males) met the inclusion criteria for the study. A total of 78 % (n = 160), 30. 0 % (n = 55) and 3. 9 % (n = 8) reported ever, current and regular <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, respectively. Males smoked more often than females: 2. 8 sessions/year (interquartile range 1. 1 - 8) versus 2 sessions/year (interquartile range 0 - 4; p = 0. 022). The major risk factor for ever smoking <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> was cigarette smoking (odds ratio 6. 22, 95 % confidence interval 2. 33 - 16. 62), followed by cannabis consumption (odds ratio 1. 44, 95 % confidence interval 1. 29 - 1. 62). Ever <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was more common among current cannabis users (100 vs. 0 %; p > 0. 0001) and related to higher exhaled carbon monoxide values (6. 0 ± 9. 0 vs. 2. 1 ± 4. 6 ppm; p > 0. 001).

40|$|Background & Aim: Tobacco smoking exerts a {{harmful effect}} on the {{periodontal}} tissues manifested by periodontal pockets, attachment loss and periodontal bone loss. Current evidences {{on the effects of}} tobacco on periodontal health mainly concern cigarette smoking. In view of the increasing popularity of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in Arabian countries and reports confirming that <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking has health effects similar to those of cigarette smoking, {{there is a need for}} a better understanding of the potential harm of this smoking habit. The present thesis was carried out in order to explore whether <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is associated with periodontal health in a manner similar to cigarette smoking. Material & Methods: Residents in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia, were invited to participate in the study by means of announcements in two daily newspapers. 355 individuals, 100 women and 255 men (17 - 60 years) responded to a standardized questionnaire and digital panoramic dental radiographs were taken. The questionnaire included information about oral hygiene practices, dental care and smoking habits. Of these subjects, 262 (73 %) also volunteered for clinical examination, including assessments of oral hygiene, gingival inflammation and probing depth. Subgingival microbial test was carried out in 198 individuals for the detection of 12 different bacterial species most commonly associated with periodontal disease using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique. Participants were stratified into <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers 33 %, cigarette smokers 20 %, smokers of both <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarettes (mixed smokers 19 %) and non-smokers 28 %. Results: Tobacco smoking is associated with a suppression of the gingival bleeding response to plaque accumulation. A suppressive effect was observed in both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers compared to non-smokers (Study I). Both cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking were associated with the presence of more than 10 pockets of ¡Ý 5 mm probing depth. The relative risk for periodontal disease was 5. 1 -fold and 3. 8 -fold increased in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was about 8 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 5 -fold elevated in cigarette smokers, suggesting an exposure-response effect (Study II). Tobacco smoking was associated with a reduction of the periodontal bone height. The reduction was of similar magnitude in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and cigarette smokers. The relative risk of periodontal bone loss of more than 30 % of the root length was 3. 5 -fold and 4. 3 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and cigarette smokers, respectively, compared to non-smokers (p < 0. 01). The relative risk associated with heavy smoking was 7. 5 -fold elevated in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and 6. 3 -fold elevated cigarette smokers (Study III). Further more, cigarette smokers, <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and non-smokers exhibited similar periodontal microflora (Study IV). Conclusion: Tobacco smoking is associated with inferior periodontal health. The impact of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is of largely the same magnitude as that of cigarette smoking. The association between tobacco smoking and an inferior periodontal health seems to be independent of the subgingival microflora. <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking habit should be considered in periodontal health...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (hookah) is {{a tobacco}} smoking tool which {{is thought to}} be more {{harmless}} than a cigarette, and there are no adequate studies about its hazards to health. Water-pipe smoking is threatening health of the youth in the world today. The objective of this study has been to investigate the carbon monoxide (CO) levels in breath, examine the changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) and to assess the change of the oxidative stress parameters in blood after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Material and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional analytical study that has included 50 volunteers who smoke a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and the control group of 50 volunteers who smoke neither a cigarette nor a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Carbon monoxide levels were measured in the breath and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were performed before and after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Blood samples were taken from either the volunteer control group or water-pipe smokers group after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> for the purpose of evaluation of the parameters of oxidative stress. Results: Carbon monoxide values were measured to be 8. 08 ± 7. 4 ppm and 28. 08 ± 16. 5 ppm before and after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> respectively. This increment was found statistically significant. There were also significant reductions in PFTs after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe.</b> Total oxidative status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS) and oxidative stress index (OSI) were found prominently higher after smoking a <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> for the group of water-pipe smokers than for the control group. Conclusions: This study has shown that water-pipe smoking leads to deterioration in pulmonary function and increases oxidative stress.

40|$|Introduction: Although <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco {{smoking is}} common in Lebanon and Syria, {{prevalence}} in neighboring Jordan is uncertain. The {{purposes of this study}} were (a) to assess the prevalence of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking among university students in Jordan and (b) to determine associations between sociodemographic variables and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking in this population. Methods: A trained interviewer administered a questionnaire among randomly selected students at four prominent universities in Jordan. The questionnaire assessed sociodemographic data, personal history of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco use, and attitudes regarding <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking. We used logistic regression to determine independent associations between sociodemographic and attitudinal factors and each of two dependent variables: ever use of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> and use at least monthly. Results: Of the 548 participants, 51. 8 % were male and mean age was 21. 7 years. More than half (61. 1 %) had ever smoked tobacco from a <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> and use at least monthly was reported by 42. 7 %. Multivariable analyses controlling for all relevant factors demonstrated significant associations between ever use and only two sociodemographic factors: (a) gender (for women compared with men, odds ratio [OR] = 0. 11, 95 % CI = 0. 070. 17) and (b) income (for those earning 500 - 999 Jordanian dinar (JD) monthly vs. < 250 JD monthly, OR = 2. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 31 - 4. 31). There were also significant associations between perception of harm and addictiveness and each outcome. Discussion: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking is highly prevalent in Jordan. Although use is associated with male gender and upper middle income levels, use is widespread across other sociodemographic variables. Continued surveillance and educational interventions emphasizing the harm and addictiveness of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> tobacco smoking may be valuable in Jordan. © The Author 2010.

Methods: A bronchoprovocation challenge with mannitol was performed in young adults recruited at the University of Basel, Switzerland. Subjects were categorized as acute <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers (single episode of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking, no or < 0. 5 pack-years cigarette smoking); chronic <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers (weekly for ≥ 4 weeks, no or < 0. 5 pack-years cigarette smoking); cigarette smokers (no <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers); and never-smokers (no cigarette or <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers). Primary outcomes were airway reactivity {{as measured by the}} response-to-dose ratio (RDR) and airway responsiveness measured by the provocation dose to cause a 15 % fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1; PD 15). Results: Seventy-four subjects {{with a mean age of}} 22. 5 ± 2. 5 years and FEV 1 % predicted 90. 1 %± 8. 6 % were included. Subgroups were matched in terms of age, gender, and spirometry results. RDR in chronic <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers and cigarette smokers was similar (0. 013 %/mg [0. 010 – 0. 015] vs 0. 023 %/mg [0. 011 – 0. 051], respectively; p= 0. 12) but significantly higher than in never-smokers (0. 007 %/mg [0. 005 – 0. 010], p< 0. 01).

Materials and methods: A total of 3735 men and women aged 25 years old or higher from three districts of Bushehr province (Bushehr, Genaveh, and Deylam) were {{participated in the study}} phase I in 2003, from which 1833 persons (49. 7 %) were participated in the phase II 6 years later in 2009. Demographic data and pattern of smoking, either cigarette or <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> were collected with personal interview. Gender specific crude and directly standardized prevalence of cigarette and <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking was calculated for both phases of the study. Results: Prevalence of cigarette smoking were 11. 9 % and 7. 5 % for the firstand second phase, respectively. 21. 6 % of men and 0. 4 % of women in the first phase and 13 % of men and 0. 7 % of women in the second phase were cigarette smokers. Prevalence of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking were 17. 9 % and 12. 9 % in the first and second phase, respectively. 10. 7 % of men and 25. 8 % of women in the first phase and 7. 1 % of men and 19. 05 % of women in second phase were <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smokers. Conclusion: <b>Water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in women in Bushehr province was significantly higher than other non-southern areas of Iran. More studies are needed to determine main causes of women tendency in <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking in southern provinces of Iran...|$|R
5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell), Pam (Jenna Fischer), and Ryan (B. J. Novak) are {{struggling}} {{to adjust to the}} work environment of the new Michael Scott Paper Company. The office space used to be a closet; <b>water</b> <b>pipes</b> run through the room, so they can hear the toilets flush from the Dunder Mifflin bathrooms above them. Ryan openly goofs off in front of Pam and Michael and insults both of them in their presence during phone conversations. Pam and Ryan bicker over who is responsible for making copies until Michael separates them into corners. Pam, who joined the company as a saleswoman, is given the corner where the photocopier sits. She is concerned that Michael will force her to be the receptionist, which is why she quit Dunder Mifflin in the first place. She goes upstairs and asks Charles Miner (Idris Elba) for her job back, but Charles has already given the job to a new employee, Kelly Hannon (Ellie Kemper), who ends up going by her middle name—Erin—to avoid confusion with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling).|$|E

40|$|AIM: The study {{set out to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking among first and fourth grade university students, examining the sosiodemograhic factors which are related to <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking and contributing the applicable programs which are oriented to protective measures. METHOD: Survey of First and Fourth Year Students in Nine Turkish Universities to Determine Their Lifestyles and Knowledge Regarding Adolescence (2009) {{was carried out by}} the International Children and # 8217;s Center (ICC) in the faculties of Science and Literature, Education and Medicine. Totally 5. 221 students were evaluated. Data were analyzed by using SPPS 16. 0 statistical package program. RESULTS: While 18. 9 % of first grade university students that they smoke <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> 24. 5 % of fourth grade university students smoke <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> (p< 0. 001). The first grade university students who were male (27. 4 %) and whose mothers and fathers are high-school graduate (28. 0 %- 24. 9 %), who study at faculty of arts and sciences (21. 0 %),who live alone (39. 3 %) and indicate their economic situation as good (21. 8 %) meaningfully smoke <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> more than others. The fourth grade university students who were male (33. 1 %) and whose mothers and fathers are high-school graduate (35. 9 %- 28. 5 %),who study at faculty of arts and sciences (28. 6 %) and who live with their friends (29. 8 %) meaningfully smoke <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> more than others. CONCLUSION: The <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is growing into a behaviour like smoking cigarette among young people. The rate of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking is especially more common among young people whose socioecomonic situations are better than others [TAF Prev Med Bull 2014; 13 (1. 000) : 19 - 28...|$|R
40|$|DOI: 10. 1016 /j. engfailanal. 2011. 01. 002 The {{safety of}} a {{population}} also relies on {{the safety of the}} <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> network systems. Good quality water supplying is required. A failure of these types of systems may have a huge social impact. The theory of vulnerability of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> networks intends to give a contribution in this context by tracing the vulnerable parts of the system and, consequently, giving guidance to increase its robustness. This theory is described in brief and supported on three <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> networks examples...|$|R
40|$|Background: In recent years, <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking {{has been}} spread among adults {{especially}} in Asian African {{communities in the}} Middle East and Arabic countries. The {{aim of this study}} is determination of the nicotine dependence status and some related factors among women consumer in Bushehr. Material and Methods: 430 <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoker women were examined in this cross-sectional study. Convenience and snowball sampling methods were used to collect data. After data collection, data were analyzed by SPSS software with using appropriate statistical tests. Results: In this study, 43. 4 % (N= 186) of women had moderate nicotine dependency. The overall mean and standard deviation score for nicotine dependence were 40. 71 ± 12. 63. In this study, consumer’s education (p= 0. 004) and job (p= 0. 015), husband’s education (p= 0. 003), and job (p= 0. 043), history of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> smoking (p= 0. 000), intention to quit (p= 0. 021), and type of tobacco (p= 0. 003), significantly associated with nicotine dependence. Logit regression results showed that husband 's education level, age at onset of <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> consuming and intention to quit <b>water</b> <b>pipe</b> explain nicotine dependence. Conclusion: Nicotine dependence among almost half of the consumer women was in average level and it is essential to design educational interventions for low socio - economic individuals particularly in teens and young people that this behavior has not institutionalized yet. Also for people who have no intention of quit <b>water</b> <b>pipe,</b> at first, we provide the conditions for their quitting through empowerment process and then encourage them to quit <b>water</b> <b>pipe...</b>|$|R
