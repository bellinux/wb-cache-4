The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) is {{depressed}} {{because it}} is the first Valentine's Day since he and Holly broke up. Michael donates blood at a mobile blood drive being held in the business park's parking lot and has a nice conversation with a female donor (Kathryn Aselton) sitting next to him. When they both finish at the same time, Michael passes out because he did not eat much before giving blood, and when he wakes up she is gone. A disappointed Michael finds a glove he assumes she left behind and takes it, hoping she <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for it. When Michael goes back into the office, he decides to gather all the single employees into the conference room to discuss their own personal romantic dilemmas. After becoming further depressed by their sad dating stories, Michael decides to try lifting their spirits by holding a singles mixer. He puts up flyers which also advertise the finding of a missing glove, and Michael hopes his mystery woman will come to the party as a result.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor, River, Amy, and Rory {{suddenly}} {{find themselves}} near the TARDIS in a New York graveyard back in 2012, Rory's plan having worked. As the four prepare to depart, Rory catches {{sight of a}} tombstone with his name on it. He is then touched by a surviving, albeit weakened, Angel and sent into the past. The Doctor is unable to take the TARDIS back to get him, due to the paradox Rory and Amy created. Amy refuses to be parted from Rory and willingly allows herself to be touched by the same Angel {{in the hopes of}} being sent back to the same time as he was. Her name then appears along with Rory's on the tombstone. The Doctor is distraught, but River reminds him that while their fates are now sealed, Amy likely published the Melody Malone book in the past and may have left him a message. The Doctor races back to where they had their picnic and recovers the final page, finding the afterword written by Amy to him. Amy explains that she and Rory lived out a good and happy life for themselves, and asks the Doctor to visit her childhood self to assure her that he <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for her to take her on amazing journeys. The episode ends with a young Amelia Pond sitting in her back garden, then looking up and smiling as the TARDIS engines are heard.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she eventually <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|Using {{sunscreen}} {{and avoiding}} UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may {{be tested for}} spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, {{and whether or not}} the overlying skin has broken down.|$|E
25|$|The Web of Caves, {{which is}} in black and white, sees Walliams and Putner as aliens (somewhat similar in {{appearance}} to Movellans) trying to persuade the Doctor (Gatiss) to defeat their schemes. The Walliams alien appears alone at first and outlines his scheme to hollow out {{the core of the}} Earth {{and replace it with a}} motor; the Doctor dismisses this plan, in a rather bored fashion, as having been done, and the alien suggests he <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> the next day with a new plan. The next day he returns, accompanied by the Putner alien, and proposes to drain the world's oceans into its core thus boiling them away; again the Doctor points out that it has been done, but decides he has to stop them. The two aliens and the Doctor agree on a time for their battle and the Doctor leaves in the TARDIS, only to have it rematerialise in the same spot, leaving the Doctor visibly annoyed. He disappears back into the TARDIS, only to have the Walliams alien obliviously comment on how nice the Doctor is.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> {{at the beginning of a}} circle, although you have tried to get out of that particular circle." ...|$|E
