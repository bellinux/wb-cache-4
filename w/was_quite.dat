5|$|In some {{locations}} in Pennsylvania {{the quality of}} the ore <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> good, with relatively deep veins containing 45% iron, and very low sulfur.|$|E
5|$|K.M. Landis <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{human and}} not infallible. If, for example, he did drag his feet at erasing baseball's color line, he was grievously wrong, but then so were many others of his post-Civil War generation.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tulkinghorn <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. Sir Leicester <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. My Lady <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, {{with his}} hands behind him, walks at Sir Leicester's side along the terrace. My Lady walks upon the other side.|$|R

5|$|Another common {{adaptation}} is a 160-yard track (11 laps to a mile) {{that fits}} into a common basketball court sized arena. This <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> popular when races {{were held at}} imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden, and the Sunkist Invitational formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Federation, overall {{literacy}} in Sarawak <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> low. In 1960, the overall literacy rate was 25%, with a heavy slant in the literacy rate towards the Chinese population, 53%, {{compared with that of}} indigenous peoples which was substantially lower, only 17%. By 2007, overall literacy in adults aged 15 and over had significantly increased to 92.3% and in 2012, this had climbed to 96%.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s {{food was}} still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general {{standard}} of the prison's food <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.|$|E

5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a fatwa from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E
5|$|From {{the outset}} the Jaguar was {{equipped}} with a navigation and attack system. While A versions had a reliable double gyroscopic system and a Doppler radar derived from the Mirage IIIE, the GR1s had a totally new digital system with an inertial navigation system and a heads-up display, plus a LRMTS (Laser Ranging and Marked Targeting System) in the nose. These systems were a step above the current technology of the time, but reliability <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> low.|$|E
5|$|Geri {{came in and}} sang: 'Too much of something/Da-da-da-da-da...Right. OK. You got that?' We {{started working}} on it {{and we wanted to}} do some sort of doo-wop vocal thing. So we {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> a good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to this, Lancaster was given palatinate status {{for the county}} of Lancashire, which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown. This grant <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> exceptional in English history; only two other counties palatine existed: Durham, which was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate, and Chester, which was crown property.|$|E
5|$|Karl Ernst Adolf Anderssen (July 6, 1818 – March 13, 1879) was a German chess master. He is {{considered}} {{to have been the}} world's leading chess player for much of the 1850s and 1860s. He <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> soundly defeated by Paul Morphy who toured Europe in 1858, but Morphy retired from chess soon after and Anderssen was again considered the leading player.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{expensive}} in 2009; {{a course of}} treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as {{would be used to}} treat tuberculosis cost about USS$60.|$|E

50|$|The {{results of}} this first day <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> minor, the Allies could not bite {{significantly}} into the enemy's defensive system, and the casualties <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> severe: 66 killed and wounded.|$|R

5|$|Most Spectrum {{software}} was originally distributed on audio cassette tapes. The Spectrum {{was intended to}} work with a normal domestic cassette recorder, and despite differences in audio reproduction fidelity, the software loading process <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> reliable and faster than on competing systems of the time.|$|E
5|$|Mu'azzam's {{imprisonment}} was not severe, {{and indeed}} he {{was kept in}} the lap of luxury by his captors. This was the custom with regard to high-born and potentially useful captives, and it <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> normal for captive and captor to become friends and even allies. Shivaji's own son, Sambhaji, was at roughly the same time a prisoner of the Mughals.|$|E
5|$|Named in 1976 by Sergei Kurzanov, Alioramus {{is another}} genus of tyrannosaurid from {{slightly}} older sediments in Mongolia. Several analyses have concluded Alioramus <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> {{closely related to}} Tarbosaurus. It was described as an adult, but its long, low skull is characteristic of a juvenile tyrannosaurid. This led Currie to speculate that Alioramus might represent a juvenile Tarbosaurus, but {{he noted that the}} much higher tooth count and row of crests on top of the snout suggested otherwise.|$|E
6000|$|I laughed, of course, {{but he had}} the air {{of being}} {{perfectly}} serious. [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> the best thing we could do. I should <b>be</b> <b>quite</b> ready to do it." ...|$|R

5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis. At Hippocrates' time, medicinal therapy <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> immature, and often {{the best thing that}} physicians could do was to evaluate an illness and predict its likely progression based upon data collected in detailed case histories.|$|E
5|$|The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, {{submitted}} three {{designs in}} early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April. The design <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> innovative {{in several different}} ways. It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour, which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured, {{the first to use}} a sloping armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament.|$|E
5|$|The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-211 was a {{prototype}} high-altitude Soviet fighter aircraft built during World War II. It was {{a version of}} the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210, itself a variant of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3, fitted with a Shvetsov ASh-82F radial engine. Its development <b>was</b> <b>quite</b> prolonged, although successful, but by the time it finished its manufacturer's trials in early 1944 {{there was no need for}} a high-altitude fighter and it was not worth reducing the production of existing fighters to convert a factory over to the I-211.|$|E
