I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent.

25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> about it. I gave them all the information I had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E

[...] <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> about this and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> about it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give {{me a couple of}} more years,’ I would have given it to him.

[...] I thought we should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one.

500|$|I enjoyed {{working with}} her very much. Mariah and I got along very great. We had never talked and never sang {{together}} before. We just had a chance for camaraderie, singer-to-singer, artist-to-artist, that kind of thing. We just laughed and talked and laughed and talked and sang in between that ... It's {{good to know that}} two ladies of soul can still be friends. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> about doing other things together, enterprise-wise, which is cool, because she's got a good, vivid mind, that girl.

500|$|The {{area was}} named after Scarborough, Yorkshire, England by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first {{lieutenant}} governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along Scarborough's Lake Ontario shores {{reminded her of the}} limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, [...] "The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well that <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough." [...] Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city.|$|E

It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention.

I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage.
