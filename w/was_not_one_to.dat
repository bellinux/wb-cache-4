5|$|Several years later, a {{new power}} had emerged in Asia. In 88 BC, a Roman army {{was sent to}} put down that power, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was defeated. Over the {{objections}} of the former Consul Gaius Marius, the Consul for the year, Lucius Cornelius Sulla was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, {{a member of the}} democratic ("populare") party, had a Tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates, so Sulla, a member of the aristocratic ("optimate") party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. Marius fled, and his supporters either fled or were murdered by Sulla. Sulla had become so angry at Marius' Tribune that he passed a law that was intended to permanently weaken the Tribunate. He then returned to his war against Mithridates, and with Sulla gone, the populares under Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city. The populare record <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be proud of, as they had reelected Marius Consul several times without observing the required ten-year interval. They also transgressed democracy by advancing un-elected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates, and in 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and captured the city again. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters, although one such supporter, a 17-year-old populare (and the son-in-law of Cinna) named Julius Caesar, was ultimately spared.|$|E

In the first of these, against New Zealand at Baroda, he took the first ever ODI wicket by a Dutchman when Craig Spearman was caught by Bas Zuiderent.

[...] "If Eddie Prokop were a fifth-string player, I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sit on anyone's bench," [...] he later said. Lavelli enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941 after learning that Paul Brown was appointed the football team's new head coach. Brown had developed a sterling reputation as the high school coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, losing only eight games in nine years there. Lavelli's catching ability had made him a star infielder in high school, and the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball recruited him to play second base in the low minor leagues. He refused the invitation, opting to concentrate on football.|$|E

500|$|The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff {{was opened}} in 1844 by the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party led by {{mountain}} men Caleb Greenwood and Isaac Hitchcock. Hitchcock, an old trapper {{and one of}} the first of his kind to have been in California in 1832, recommended that the wagon trail go due west from the Little Sandy and cross [...] of desert territory to the Green River and from there cross the ridge into the Bear River Valley, completely bypassing Fort Bridger and the crossing of Bear River Ridge. The route shaved about [...] and 7 days off the main route, but the decision to cross nearly 45 waterless miles before reaching the Green River <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be taken lightly. Settlers had to decide between time and the health of their livestock. A traveler in 1846 wrote: [...] The route reached the height of popularity during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s when a desire to speed to the California gold fields outweighed the risks. The route was named the Sublette cutoff by Joseph Ware in his popular 1849 guide book to the trail after an individual named Solomon Sublette who told him about the route, and not William Sublette as is popular myth. The popularity of the guide book during the 1850s cemented the name, though most scholars today call it the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff after its original discoverer.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{underwent}} a hernia {{operation in the}} close-season, but due to swelling and bruising around the bone his return was delayed and was an unused substitute for York's first match of 2003–04. He made his first appearance of the season as a second-half substitute for the injured Brass in a 2–0 defeat away to Bury on 30 September 2003, although Smith commented that: [...] "It was my first appearance but unfortunately it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> remember". Due to injuries to other players, his first start of 2003–04 came in a 2–1 defeat away to Halifax in the Football League Trophy first round Northern section on 14 October 2003. This was followed by his first league start four days later in a 1–1 home draw with Boston, and York went on a seven-match unbeaten run in the league with Smith in defence alongside Brass and Richard Hope. He received his fifth yellow card {{of the season in}} a 2–1 away win over Rochdale on 28 December 2003, meaning he was suspended for York's match against Northampton Town on 17 January 2004. Smith was dropped for York's match against Scunthorpe on 9 March 2004 after failing to be vocal and organisational in defence in a 4–1 defeat away to Kidderminster three days earlier, which was expected of him due to Brass' absence. His return came in a 0–0 draw against Torquay on 13 March 2004, with Brass praising his performance. After York's relegation to the Conference National was confirmed in April 2004, it was announced that Smith would be released in the summer, despite having been verbally offered a new contract over a month before. He finished 2003–04 with 30 appearances.|$|E

2500|$|As Fisher was Barker's choice, it {{is likely}} that the two men had similar views from the outset, so it is not {{surprising}} to find Fisher taking up the Puritan cause during his incumbency at Upton Magna. He seems to have followed controversies in Shrewsbury, which was very close. In a preface to some sermons he published in the 1650s, Fisher denounced those who had endangered his liberty by traducing his doctrine. While this might have applied to several phases of his career, he added in the margin: [...] "Mr Studley and some others." [...] At the time of Fisher's appointment Studley had become mired in a controversy over his book, The Looking-glasse of Schisme in which he sought to explain a sensational murder at Clun as the result of the Puritan principles of the killer. The book was published in London in 1634 and reissued in an expanded edition in 1635. Under Thorough, the experiment in absolute monarchy then in force, a reasoned reply by Richard More, a layman of St Chad's parish, could not be published and it did not appear until 1641. After the furore, Studley resigned from St Chad's and moved a few miles to a living at Pontesbury. Whether his offence to Fisher was more personal than the contents of his polemic is unknown. Certainly Fisher <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> ignore intemperate abuse of his faith. He wrote to Sir Robert Harley, then serving as MP for Herefordshire in the Long Parliament, to report some anti-Puritan banter that might have serious implications.|$|E
