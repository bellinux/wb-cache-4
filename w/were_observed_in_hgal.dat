For the month of April, minimum snow cover <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2004 (56, 236  km 2) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2002 (114, 588  km 2). For July, the minimum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2007 (7881  km 2) and the maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2003 (25, 851  km 2).

In case of temperature, the minimum in the month of April <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2006 (− 3.81  °C) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2007 (0.81  °C). In case of July, the minimum and maximum temperatures <b>were</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 2004 (7.20  °C) and 2006 (8.85  °C), respectively. On the other hand, for the month of October, the minimum temperature <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2002 (− 0.67  °C) and maximum <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> the year 2011 (1.43  °C). Apart from the role of temperature, other factors should also be taken into account to explain the reason behind the difference in snow melt trend of the other 2  months from that of January. For example, if the snow is older, its albedo will be lower and in such situation it absorbs more solar radiation. Again, if the temperature variation is not significant, snow melts faster in the windy condition than in the calm conditions. However, temperature being a dominant factor, this study evaluated the impact of increase in temperature on the snow cover.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} that the DOTS (directly observed therapy, short course) strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control can contain the emergence and spread of drug resistance {{in the absence of}} second-line treatment. We compared drug-resistance levels between 1996 and 2001 in the south of Vietnam, an area with a well-functioning DOTS program. METHODS: Sputum specimens were collected from consecutively diagnosed patients with smear-positive TB at 40 randomly selected public TB clinics. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were tested for susceptibility to first-line drugs. RESULTS: Among 888 new patients in 2001, resistance to any drug <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 238 (26. 3 %), resistance to isoniazid <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 154 (16. 6 %), resistance to rifampin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 22 (2. 0 %), resistance to ethambutol <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 12 (1. 1 %), resistance to streptomycin <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 173 (19. 4 %), and resistance to both isoniazid and rifampicin (multidrug resistance [MDR]) <b>was</b> <b>observed</b> <b>in</b> 20 (1. 8 % [95 % confidence interval, 1. 0 %- 3. 3 %]).

The prevalence of any drug resistance and of streptomycin resistance among new patients had decreased significantly (P <. 01) since 1996; there was no increase in the prevalence of MDR. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of drug resistance decreased despite high initial levels of resistance to isoniazid and streptomycin and despite the absence of second-line treatment. Therefore, a DOTS program can contain drug-resistant TB in this settin...|$|R
