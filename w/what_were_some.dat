For why may not God be merciful, and why may not God be just? And since he can be both merciful and just in the salvation of sinners, why may he not also save them from death and hell? Christ is God's salvation, and {{to show that he}} is not ashamed of him, he hath presented him, and the way of redemption by him, before the face of all people (Luke 2:30-32). Nor is the Son, who is become, with respect to the act of redemption, the author of eternal salvation, ashamed of this his doings. 'I gave my back to the smiters,' saith he, 'and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and smiting' (Isa 50:6). This he speaks to show <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of his sufferings when he engaged in the work of our redemption, and how heartily he did bear and go through them. 'For,' says he, 'the Lord God will help me,' that is, justify me in it, 'therefore shall I not be confounded, therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed' (v 7). And if God, and his Son Jesus Christ, are neither of them ashamed to own this way of salvation, why should the sinners concerned thereabout be afraid thereupon to venture their soul? I know, saith he, 'I shall not be ashamed'; I shall not, that is, when all things come to light, and everything shall appear above board; when {{the heart and soul of}} this undertaking of mine shall be proclaimed upon the house-tops, I know I shall not be ashamed.|$|E

50|$|Although housing an {{important}} collection of Georgian architecture and acting as Limerick's city centre, unfortunately Newtown Pery's {{position as the}} one time fashionable area {{of the city is}} long over. In addition to this, its Georgian heritage has been severely compromised, in particular around the retail core of O'Connell Street & William street. Economic decline & stagnation plagued Limerick during the 20th Century which saw some townhouses converted to tenements such as at Arthur's Quay & Bank Place. During this time very little investment was seen in Newtown Pery, only the exodus of families & industries to new suburban districts around the city due to modern requirements. By the mid 20th century dereliction had taken its toll as the townhouses at Arthur's Quay, Francis Street & Bank Place were completely lost. Lax development controls enabled the almost complete rebuilding of the northern end of O'Connell Street and replacing <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> iconic and illustrious buildings with more modernist (& perhaps less attractive) sixties style architecture. The loss of Todd's Department Store to a fire which gutted the building, the rebuilding of Cannock's Department Store, Royal George Hotel, AIB Bank amongst many more, completely altered the look of city and ultimately resulted in a loss of the districts heritage and character. Nevertheless, much of the districts Georgian townhouses remained intact, however many were converted to offices or flats while others remained unoccupied or neglected. However, despite the architectural losses & economic conditions; Newtown Pery remained the premier retail & services district for Limerick and the greater Mid-West Region well up into the late 20th and early 21st Century.|$|E

The fourth season episode [...] "Still," [...] which focuses only on Beth and Daryl, garnered praise in particular from television commentators, with viewers of the series having shipped Beth and Daryl as a couple. [...] Writing for IGN, Roth Cornet commended the [...] "Still" [...] episode, stating that [...] "Daryl and Beth revealed themselves to be more perfect a fit {{than any of the}} other combinations" [...] and that [...] "they brought out a raw honesty in one another that yielded <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>some</b> of the most grounded and engaging character moments of the season. They are two sides of a coin, and that's not something that had been entirely clear prior to this entry." [...] She additionally commented positively on Kinney's acting, saying it was: [...] "...the strongest acting we've seen from Emily Kinney, particularly in that final exchange on the porch." [...] Kinney said that the show was never clear on whether Beth and Daryl had a romantic or brother-sisterly connection, but that [...] "it was a situation where they were getting to know each other. First, they were just trying to get along" [...] because they did not see [...] "each other's point of view very well" [...] and, later, [...] "as the story went along they maybe became friends" [...] and [...] "it started to sort of go, 'Oh, what more could this be?

40|$|Understanding the {{physiologic}} and endocrinologic {{basis of}} fetal {{development is a}} major goal of perinatal biology. During the past decade a number of technological developments have allowed more precise evaluation of the fetus in utero and diagnosis of abnormalities.

This paper evaluates the following issues: <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>some</b> of the unique physiologic and endocrinologic features of the fetal milieu interieur? <b>What</b> problems <b>are</b> peculiar to fetal assessment?

Thousands of clinicians were displaced, and some—like their patients—were forced to relocate permanently to other areas of the country. Many who faced serious health consequences as a result of interrupted or delayed care were low-income and uninsured people. Because these interruptions prevented some patients from getting medications for transmissible illnesses, antituberculosis or antiretroviral medications, for instance, they threatened the health of the public at large [1, 2]...|$|E
