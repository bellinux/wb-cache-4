30|$|Respondents {{were also}} asked about a variety of family and {{individual}} characteristics. In terms of their parents, participants were asked about the educational attainment of their mothers and fathers. The higher of the two (when two parents were present) was then included {{as a measure of}} the highest parental education, with responses including “eighth grade or less” (1), “beyond the eighth grade but did not complete high school” (2), “high school degree” (3), “attended college but did not finish degree” (4), “four-year college degree” (5), and “graduate or professional degree” (6). Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes[*]=[*] 1, no[*]=[*] 0). Since the familial context is likely to influence both dating and marriage patterns among young adults, participants were asked: “For most of the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up,</b> did you think your parents’ marriage was not too happy (1), just about average (2), happier than average (3), or very happy (4).” Since western culture could potentially affect dating and marriage patterns among Chinese young adults, the respondents were also queried as to whether English was spoken in their homes (1 [*]=[*]yes, 0 [*]=[*]no). In regard to parental influence, participants were offered the following statement: “I would be willing to date someone of whom my parents/family did not approve.” Responses ranged from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5).|$|E

Maternal employment was also assessed, with respondents being queried about whether their mother was employed for pay outside the home (yes = 1, no = 0).

In order to assess the extent of parental influence, participants were offered the following statement: “I would be willing to date someone of whom my parents/family did not approve.” Responses ranged from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (5).|$|E

40|$|Selling to {{an agency}} Cue: Small-scale farmers {{wanting to take}} {{advantage}} of lucrative export markets, are likely to struggle if they work alone. Even if they are lucky enough to have contacts overseas, and <b>are</b> able to <b>grow</b> produce of the highest standard, there is still the problem of quantity. How can they ever grow enough to interest a foreign buyer? One solution is for farmers to sell their produce to a crop buying agency. Good agencies will not only buy the produce, but also support the farmers in growing it to the right standards. One such example is Agriflora, a company based in Zambia. Daniel Sikazwe spoke to Simon Maonde, Vice Chairperson of a farming co-operative that sells to Agriflora, and asked him about how the agency was helping the co-operative with its production and marketing. He also found out about how the co-operative is managing to sell vegetables to local buyers, in competition with imports from neighbouring countries. TAPE IN	?We formed the co-operative..... TAPE OUT	..... work hard to beat it. ? DURATION	 4 ? 06 ? Closing announcement:. Simon Maonde on his marketing strategy of attracting buyers to the farm, rather than taking produce to the buyer. Transcript Maonde	We formed the co-operative, we wanted to co-operate ourselves as a group, {{to make sure that our}} produce are put at one point where we can bargain for a better price. Then two years ago came in Agriflora scheme. So we then touched, and Agriflora has become the biggest, not only buyer but organiser of our co-operative. Sikazwe	Agriflora is a big company which exports small-scale producers? produce to other countries, but I am very sure that they will not accept just any crop that comes there. There is a standard that they are going to follow. How do you make sure that you grow the kind of crops that will meet their standard?. Maonde	Yes, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right. Agriflora is very very strict in the way the crop is grown. The seed has to be provided by Agriflora themselves to prove that it is the right seed. Second, the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>growing</b> we have an extension officer from MAFF and an agronomist from Agriflora itself, to see that the produce are the right type and don?t have any diseases or anything else. At the time of harvesting the Agriflora makes sure that they come to your farm, and they show me the type that we have to harvest, and which is not required called reject. Sikazwe	So in this case if Agriflora is going to accept your produce, it has to be of very high standard or quality. Tell me about the secret that it involved in you producing products that are of very high quality. Maonde	The secret first is the planting of it; you make sure that is planted according to the specification or spacing, as we call it. And secondly is to scout, as it grows you scout whether diseases or insects that attack it. Now if there <b>are</b> any <b>you</b> immediately go to Agriflora who send a person to scout and when they prove that one then they spray it. So if it is sprayed and well looked after the crop will be good. The last one is that there is a special standard the worldwide requires. If you have Mange Tout or Fine Beans which are bent, or it has a seed inside which is grown up, it <b>is</b> rejected. So <b>you</b> must make sure that you harvest the exact requirement. Sikazwe	Let?s now talk about some of the products that you take on to the local market. You have tomatoes, you have peas and many other crops. There is liberalisation in place. We have seen a lot of products coming from Zimbabwe and South Africa and other countries. You might find yourself disadvantaged because these are coming from places or countries where there are subsidies on agriculture. Just how do you manage to get your crops on the market? Maonde	That one <b>you</b> <b>are</b> right, it has been very difficult. But the only way we have done it, is because the South Africans and the Zimbabweans, they normally dump it at either supermarkets, or the bigger market which is Soweto. And the small businesswomen and men who need these things sometimes have no transport to get to the region. So in that way we decide to deliver our things in the townships. So in that way we beat them by going to the townships, or by making arrangements with the marketers themselves, coming to our farms to the co-operative. When they see the grade and not only that but the price; because if for example the box of tomato in Soweto market is at 20, 000, if he came to our co-operative and we sold it at 15, 000, so he is happier because, one, he has saved his 5000, plus even transport for himself or herself, plus the baggage he is carrying. As I said, the liberalisation of market, you really need to work hard to beat it. End of track. Selling to a crop buying agency is another marketing strategy that small-scale farmers may chose to adopt. This interview features a Zambian co-operative that sells its export vegetables (Mange Tout, Fine Beans, Babycorn) to an agency, for which it has to fulfil very strict production standards. It also sells vegetables (tomatoes, carrots, onions), to local buyers, competing with cheap imports by inviting buyers to the farm...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} his life, Pierre Hadot was a {{professor}} at the Collège de France — a “professor’s professor” — and he helped Michel Foucault, most famously, conceptualize ethics. Hadot devoted his career to recovering the ancient conception of philosophy, according to which the discourses of universities are but a fragment of what philosophy is. His engagement with this theme helped Bendik-Keymer understand and develop a personal counter-culture to his academic work, a kind of original academics truer to the idea of the philosophical school Plato first developed in his Ἀκαδήµεια. But while Plato’s school developed a useful form of life, it had an ambivalent relation to democracy and to everyday people. Whereas Plato was in some ways one of the first egalitarians by merit (especially concerning women), he was also deeply classist in his categorization of intellectual potentials. He effectively thought some people were stupid by nature, having no philosophical worth. Hence the Ἀκαδήµεια existed outside the city, in practice exclusive and somewhat sequestered. To some extent, Plato’s vision of philosophy — at least as explained by Hadot — had the practical point of philosophy right, but this point still needed to be rendered thoroughly democratic in the polyphony and multiple intelligences of people. Doing so coheres with what Foucault was after in his application of Hadot. It is also what Bendik-Keymer is after — to extract what is good from original academics and make it democratic, as opposed to dumbing people down. This “book of becoming” weaves together poetry, photo album, exploded essay (including tears and scotch tape), philosophical commentary, memoir, and aphoristic journal. …The breathtaking result is a philosophical askesis for our time: polyphonic, democratic, practical, and urgent. …This writing is inspiring, honest, and brave. ~Lynne Huffer, author of Mad for FoucaultImagine the kind of philosophy book you might have wished for <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>growing</b> <b>up.</b> Seeking a reader who would be patient and open-minded enough to live with her own questions and to walk around town with her thoughts, this book would not have a single thesis but would rather work through multiple problems and be an experience, born out of life-experience. It would not be summarizable. It would be larger than the reader and open onto different kinds of readings. This is the kind of philosophy book that was at home in the 19 th century. It is rare to come across a book that does what it says…. [Solar Calendar] enacts…[a] conversation with the reader that is generous, demanding, and disarmingly personal. Its unusual form bears some resemblance to Pessoa’s Book of Disquiet…. ~Shannon Lee Dawdy, author of Patina: a Profane ArcheologySolar Calendar (a follow-up to Bendik-Keymer’s The Ecological Life: Discovering Citizenship and a Sense of Humanity) contains six oddities: a family portrait, a parody-essay, a time-capsule poem, an exploded essay, a poetic record of an act, and an aphorism journal for a year. Their inspirations are Epictetus’ notebooks, Tarkovski’s Mirror, and Apollinaire’s roving “Zone. ” Also experiments in ecology — the study of home — the six sections originate in rifts that challenge us as growing people. They alternate between environmental problems and tensions within families, as if the fissures in love and in society wash back and forth between each other as we try to make a home in the world. Multiple times layer over each other like the sounds of a large, democratic city. The personal and the planetary intersect. The space before, and against, policy where politics arises as assertion opens up in glimpses, fragmenting the body and inertia of oppressive orders. Philosophy arises as a homely and idiosyncratic practice of multiple forms of intuition, reflection and intelligence for muddling through life. Painstaking exercises in being human are grounded in unconditional love and in truthfulness — in the desire to become. [P]hilosophy is an unfinished practice in being human. Unlike any other text I have read in recent memory, Solar Calendar expresses this practice by revealing the cosmos in the personal and the personal in the cosmos. … This is a text that does not rest complacently in the residue of its own insights. ~Ryan Johnson, Department of Philosophy, Elon UniversityTable of Contents // Preface a.
