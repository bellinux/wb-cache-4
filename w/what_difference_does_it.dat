40|$|One of {{the untold}} {{stories in the}} {{proliferation}} of independent media across Africa {{is the role of}} donor aid in this process. Overview This year, 2014, marks 25 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the symbolic end of the Cold War in 1989. It also marks the anniversary of the beginning of an extraordinary proliferation of media outlets in sub-Saharan Africa, which swept across the continent, freeing Africa’s press and liberating the airwaves from monopoly by the state. Economics, technology, and socio-political forces all played major roles in this boom of Africa’s media. But one of the untold stories of these changes is the role of donor aid in this process. This is the subject of the Center for International Media Assistance’s latest report, Africa’s Media Boom: The Role of International Aid, by veteran international media consultant Mary Myers. It explores these questions: 	How much of a catalyst were foreign donors in this mushrooming of Africa’s news media? 	What were the motives and mechanisms of this aid? 	<b>What</b> <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make at the time, and subsequently? 	Was media proliferation necessarily a good thing–did it lead to pluralism and genuine freedom...|$|R

40|$|Developers often write {{reusable}} code in {{the form}} of libraries or components, at least in the C++ world. Here I will describe a process of applying patterns to a data infrastructure library that was developed in our company. The first part describes the state of the infrastructure library before patterns were used, and the second part describes the state after, and <b>what</b> <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make. All examples are in C++. 1. BEFORE The infrastructure library has a collection of pointers to the abstract base class (ABC) Item as a part of its API. A client creates a concrete collection of Item * and passes it to the infrastructure. There are several reasons why we use a collection of pointers: the objects could be large; the same object could belong to several different collections and the duplication of objects is undesirable or unacceptable. All these objects must derive from the class Item, which declares some virtual functions. In order to use the infrastructure a client must use the same collections class library. There are two reasons why redesign was needed: • We have several applications that use different collection class libraries, and these applications need to be combined with the infrastructure library. You want to use a collection of your choice and if it is an associative collection to be sorted according to the collection; • There are cases when it is not feasible or desirable to make all classes inherit from the single class for a different reasons, legacy code, third party products, name clashes. - 1 - 1. 1. USAGE In the first implementation of the infrastructure the arguments to the function select( [...] .) were an object of type Criteria and an object of a concrete collection class; we will demonstrate this on an STL vector. This concrete class will contain pointers to Item, because the infrastructure returns Item * even if it really points to a derived class...|$|R
40|$|In 1789, it was {{possible}} to speak of a federation of distinct states joined together for their mutual advantage, but today, it is rather the nation that is divided into subnational units. What caused this shift in focus from the states to the federal government? Surely, the transformation from a collection of thirteen historically separate states clustered along the Atlantic seaboard to a group of fifty states largely carved out of federal territory has played a role. Building on previous analysis of the economics of federalism, this Article considers the dynamic effects of increasing the number of states on the efficient allocation of government authority between the state and federal governments. When the number of states is low, the externalities imposed by state-level actions are more limited, and so is the scope of federal power. When the number increases, however, the scope of efficient federal power expands because the states face collective action problems. In the second Part of this Article, we apply these insights from the economics of federalism {{to the question of the}} optimal number of states in a federal system. Having too few states will lead to insufficient cohesion at the federal level, risking secession, and ensuring weak government. On the other end of the scale, having too many states encourages the centralization of power. While the optimal number of states in a federal system will ultimately depend on geography, legal culture, and technology, the available data suggest that the ten provinces of Canada may be too few, but the fifty states of the United States may well be too many. <b>What</b> <b>difference</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> make to American federalism and constitutional law between 1791 and 1912 that the United States grew from being a federation of only thirteen coequal states to being a federation of forty-eight coequal states? This Article will attempt to speculate about that important question-a question which has not been systematically analyzed so far in the otherwise extensive law review literature on federalism. With its fifty states, the United States federation today has many more member units than it started out with and many more than do other federations around the world. Our thesis in this Article is that this trend in American federalism is a very consequential and under-appreciated development...|$|R

We are asked, on occasion, 2 ̆ 2 Yes, but <b>what</b> possible <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> Martineau make to sociology today? 2 ̆ 2 Sheer impudence aside, it is a question to answer carefully, with probity, and our answers must be convincing rather than contrived. The gravity of the question comes home to us if we rephrase the query, to ask: 2 ̆ 2 <b>What</b> possible <b>difference</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> make for sociology today if we had never heard of Durkheim, Weber, Marx, or Mead? 2 ̆ 2 Presumably, many of us would reply that the absence of such major figures would make an enormous impact, that the shape and scope of sociology as a disciplinary enterprise would be quite else than it is without their contributions. Thus so with Martineau. Any sociologies (especially the received ciology of the standard textbooks) that lack the conscious acknowledgment, influence, and impetus of her work are necessarily strange and distorted versions of sociology. Likewise, the absence of Durkheim, Weber, Marx, or Mead would also create curiously strange and unrecognizable sociologies. Our discipline grows stronger from inclusion and dialogue, not from exclusion and silence...|$|R
