40|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> are {{the most}} common cause for higher {{morbidity}} and mortality rate in India. Higher oxygen concentration of extrauterine existence causes increased erythrocyte lysis lead to release of iron in neonates. Iron is known to catalyze the formation of Reactive oxygen species. Involvement of hemoglobin and iron in oxygen-mediated reactions stimulate us to study the role of these in neonates. Objectives :i) To estimate the concentration of Haemoglobin, serum iron, serum lipid peroxidation in neonates <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> disorders; and compare those with that of healthy controls. ii) To study the role of these parameters in neonates <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> Materials and Methods: Present study includes 50 neonates suffering from <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and 50 healthy neonates as controls. Samples collected from these were used for the estimation of haemoglobin, serum iron, and serum lipid peroxidation. Observations: Significantly (p< 0. 001) increased levels of serum iron and lipid peroxidation were observed in neonates <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> when compared those with control values. These levels were found significantly (p< 0. 001) higher in preterm than full-term neonates. Concentration of haemoglobin showed no significant difference in both groups. Conclusion: Exacerbation of oxidative stress in neonates <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> may be due to hypoxia induced free radical generation, higher oxidative tendency of HbF and elevated iron. Premature neonates are probably unprepared for extra uterine life in an oxygen rich environment and due to this they are more prone to oxidative insult. Thus this study reveals the pro-oxidant role of HbF and iron, which enhances the oxidative stress in <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder...</b>|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] The survey {{aimed at}} {{studying}} the associations between prevalent respiratory symptoms in an occupational population and sickness absence due to <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> METHODS [...] A cross sectional survey among male workers in an animal feed mill was conducted. A total of 303 production workers and 102 office clerks completed a questionnaire on respiratory complaints, smoking habits, and occupational history. The questionnaire {{was used to}} identify <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> symptoms in the past 12 months. During this period all spells of sickness absence were recorded. Causes of sickness were classified in broad categories encompassing respiratory symptoms, influenza, musculoskeletal disorders, and others. RESULTS [...] Logistic regression analysis showed that <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> complaints experienced a higher sickness absence than those without respiratory complaints. Adjusted for age and smoking the odds ratio (OR) for sickness prevalence was 1. 9 among office clerks and 2. 6 among blue collar workers. Smoking increased the risk on sickness absence with ORs of 2. 4 and 1. 6, respectively. When restricting the analysis to sickness due to <b>respiratory</b> complaints, subjects <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> complaints had significantly higher risks for absence prevalence and absence rate than those without respiratory complaints. There were no differences in sickness absence between <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> asthma like complaints and those with chronic bronchitis like complaints. CONCLUSION [...] The clear associations between respiratory complaints and prevalence and rate of respiratory sickness absence indicate that <b>workers</b> <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> complaints {{are at risk of}} temporary disability and, thus, may experience a reduced ability to cope with routine activities at work...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Respiratory {{disease in}} calves is an actual problem, {{a major cause}} of {{economic}} losses due to mortality, growth delay and improper development. These conditions are frequent in calves due to the weaning stress, transport and environmental changes. Aims: The aim of this study was the isolation of bacteria from 30 calves <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and their antibiotic susceptibility testing. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from calves <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> (nasal discharge) aged 6 to 9 weeks in 2 series, using sterile swabs. Samples were initially inoculated on blood agar and MacConkey agar following the characteristics of the colonies and microscopic examination that enabled the identification of bacterial species. Isolated strains were used to flood Mueller-Hinton agar to carry out sensitivity testing. The antibiotics tested were represented by: Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid, Gentamicin, Florfenicol, Enrofloxacin, Marbofloxacin, Penicillin G, Cefquinone, Tulathromycin, Ceftiofur, Tylosin and Cephalotin. Results: Genus Streptococcus have been identified in 23 samples, followed by Staphylococcus identified in 14 samples, and Bacillus spp., in 10 nasal swabs; The most common bacteria associations were represented by Streptococcus-Staphylococcus, Streptococcus-Staphylococcus-Bacillus, and Streptococcus-E. coli. The most efficient antibiotic was Cefquinome (Cobactan), followed by Penicillin G and Amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (Amoxiclav); the least effective antibiotics were Florfenicol and Tulathromycin. Conclusions: The study carried out on nasal discharge samples collected from calves <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and their antimicrobial profile testing led to the following conclusions: 1) Low susceptibility to Florfenicol is caused by previous treatments when this molecule was excessively used and without prior sensitivity testing. 2) Cefquinome may represent an emergency therapeutic antibiotic for respiratory infections in calves, but the administration should always be preceded by susceptibility testing of the isolates...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) {{is common}} in {{patients}} <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and interstitial lung fibrosis from diverse disease processes. However, a cause-effect relationship has not been well demonstrated. It is hypothesized {{that there might be}} more than a coincidental association between GERD and interstitial lung damage. There is still confusion about the diagnostic steps necessary to confirm the presence of GERD, and about the role of effective control of GERD in the natural history of these <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders.</b> OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of GERD in patients <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> and lung involvement; the sensitivity of symptoms in the diagnosis of GERD; and the role of esophageal function tests (manometry and 24 - hour pH monitoring) in the diagnosis and treatment of these patients. METHODS: Prospective study based on a database of 44 patients (29 females) <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> disorders: 16 patients had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 11 patients had systemic sclerosis associated interstitial lung disease, 2 patients had polymyositis associated interstitial lung disease, 2 patients had Sjögren associated interstitial lung disease, 2 patients had rheumatoid artrithis associated interstitial lung disease, 1 patient had undifferentiated connective tissue diseases associated interstitial lung disease and 10 patients had sarcoidosis. The average forced vital capacity (% predicted) was 64. 3 %. All patients had esophageal function tests. RESULTS: Thirty patients (68 %) had pathologic reflux (average DeMeester score: 45, normal < 14. 7). The average number of reflux episodes recorded 20 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter was 24. Sensitivity and specificity of heartburn were 70 % and 57 %, of regurgitation 43 % and 57 %, and of dysphagia 33 % and 64 %. Twelve patients with GERD underwent a laparoscopic fundoplication which was tailored to the manometric profile: three patients in which peristalsis was normal had a total fundoplication (360 °) and nine patients in which the peristalsis was absent had a partial anterior fundoplication (180 °). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study show that: (a) abnormal reflux was present in about 2 / 3 of patients <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorders</b> (idiophatic pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue disorders and sarcoidosis), and it extended to the upper esophagus in most patients; (b) the sensitivity and specificity of reflux symptoms was very low; and (c) esophageal function tests were essential to establish the diagnosis of abnormal reflux, to characterize the esophageal function and guide therapy.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Respiratory viruses are a {{major cause}} of {{respiratory}} tract infections. The prevalence of a virus-positive respiratory sample and its significance in patients requiring mechanical ventilation remain unknown. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study in all consecutive adults ventilated for more than 48 hours admitted to a 22 -bed medical intensive care unit during a 12 -month period. Respiratory samples at the time of intubation were assessed by culture, by indirect immunofluorescence assay or by molecular methods in systematic tracheobronchial aspirates. Patients <b>with</b> a virus-negative <b>respiratory</b> sample at the time of intubation were considered unexposed and served as the control group. RESULTS: Forty-five viruses were isolated in 41 / 187 (22 %) patients. Rhinovirus was the most commonly isolated virus (42 %), followed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (22 %) and virus influenza A (16 %). In multivariate analysis controlling for the Acute Pathophysiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, patients <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder</b> at admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 8 - 5. 1; P = 0. 12), with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma patients (adjusted odds ratio, 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 6. 7; P = 0. 01) and with admission between 21 November and 21 March (adjusted odds ratio, 2. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 5. 9; P = 0. 008) were independently associated with a virus-positive sample. Among the 122 patients admitted <b>with</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>disorder,</b> a tracheobronchial aspirate positive for respiratory viruses at the time of intubation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 273; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 096 - 0. 777; P < 0. 006) was independently associated with better survival, controlling for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and admission for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest. Among the remaining 65 patients, a virus-positive sample on intubation did not predict survival.
