6000|$|Lizzie {{was still}} standing, {{waiting for an}} answer to her question,--Can you justify {{yourself}} in your own heart? Having paused for some seconds, she repeated her question in a stronger and more personal form. [...] "Had I been your sister, Lord Fawn, and had another man behaved to me as you have now done, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had behaved well, and that she had no ground for complaint?

6000|$|... "That is unmanly, Lord Hampstead. Because a poor weak girl such as I am cannot do {{all that}} you wish, are you to throw away your {{strength}} and your youth, and all the high hopes which ought to be before you? <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> it were well in another if you heard that he had thrown up everything, surrendered all his duties, because of his love for some girl infinitely beneath him in the world's esteem?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there is}} Jones, {{the editor of}} The Evening Gentleman," [...] I argued; [...] "he lives at Surbiton. It is just twelve miles from Waterloo. He comes up every morning by the eight-fifteen and returns again by the five-ten. <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a book {{is bound to be}} bad because it appeals to Jones? Then again, take Tomlinson: he lives, as you are well aware, at Forest Gate which is Epping way, and entertains you on Kakemonos {{whenever}} you call upon him. You know what I mean, of course. I think 'Kakemono' is right. They are long things; they look like coloured hieroglyphics printed on brown paper. He gets behind them and holds them up above his head {{on the end of a}} stick so that you can see the whole of them at once; and he tells you the name of the Japanese artist who painted them in the year 1500 B.C., and what it is all about. He shows them to you by the hour and forgets to give you dinner. There isn't an easy chair in the house. To put it vulgarly, what is wrong with Tomlinson from a high art point of view? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{doubt whether}} I am {{better than my}} neighbour," [...] Arthur continued, [...] "if I concede that I am no better,--I also doubt whether he is better than I. I see men who begin with ideas of {{universal}} reform, and who, before their beards are grown, propound their loud plans for the regeneration of mankind, give up their schemes {{after a few years}} of bootless talking and vainglorious attempts to lead their fellows; and after they have found that men will no longer bear them, as indeed they never were in the least worthy to be heard, sink quietly into the ranks-and-file,--acknowledging their aims impracticable, or thankful that they were never put into practice. The fiercest reformers grow calm, and are faire to put up with things as they are: the loudest Radical orators become dumb, quiescent placemen: the most fervent Liberals when out of power, become humdrum Conservatives or downright tyrants or despots in office. Look at the Thiers, look at Guizot, in opposition and in place! Look at the Whigs appealing to the country, and the Whigs in power! <b>Would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the conduct of these men is an act of treason, as the Radicals bawl,--who would give way in their turn, were their turn ever to come? No, only that they submit to circumstances which are stronger than they,--march as the world marches towards reform, but at the world's pace (and the movements of the vast body of mankind must needs be slow), forgo this scheme as impracticable, on account of opposition,--that as immature, because against the sense of the majority,--are forced to calculate drawbacks and difficulties, as well as to think of reforms and advances,--and compelled finally to submit, and to wait, and to compromise." ...|$|E

50|$|Self-rated health (also called Self-reported health, Self-assessed health, or {{perceived}} health) refers to both a single question such as “in general, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” and a survey questionnaire {{in which participants}} assess different dimensions of their own health. This survey technique is commonly used in health research for its ease of use and its power in measuring health.|$|E
50|$|The self-rated health {{question}} {{has been found to}} be a reliable measurement of general health since respondents rated the same general health assessment within a period where their health was unlikely to change. Despite the reliability of the measurement, the self-rated health question “in general, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” is particularly vague. Thus, this measurement has low level in reliability test than other self-rated measurements that assess a more specific aspect of health.|$|E

Brown, who said: [...] "My first impression is that it's reflective of the way these people think about our city, that this isn't a place where Americans live for some reason.

50|$|Self-rated health {{measures}} the present general health and gives answer choices, typically structured like a Likert Scale. The self-rated health question may take different forms. It may be formulated as “in general, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” {{as the first}} question in the SF-36 questionnaire. It may also be formulated as “In general, {{how would you rate}} your health today,” with the possible choices being “very good” (1), “good” (2), “moderate” (3), “bad” (4) or “very bad” (5)” as used by the World Health Organization. All questions do not necessarily have five answer choices; it can be more or less.|$|E
5000|$|However, in the 1948 BBC Radio Debate between Bertrand Russell and Frederick Copleston, Russell {{chose to}} assume the {{position}} of the agnostic, though it seems to have been because he admitted to not being able to prove the non-existence of God: Copleston: Well, my position is the affirmative position that such a being actually exists, and that His existence can be proved philosophically. Perhaps you would tell me if your position is that of agnosticism or of atheism. I mean, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the non-existence of God can be proved?

5000|$|Aired on October 12, 1991 (Season 17, Episode 3). Co-workers Siobhan Fallon Hogan, Phil Hartman, and Kevin Nealon give Pat a {{surprise}} birthday party. As they chat, Nealon asks whether Pat has a biological clock; Siobhan says, [...] "I think you'd make {{a really great}} moth... fath... role model," [...] but Pat tells them about a dysfunctional family and unhappy childhood. Hartman makes the next attempt: [...] "Pat, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you are more like your mother or your father?", but they reply, [...] "I'm a perfect combination of both!" [...] One of their estranged parents (Kirstie Alley), also androgynous and named Francis or Frances, comes into the party; when Nealon asks about Pat's birth, again there are only ambiguous answers, {{as well as the}} parent saying [...] "I had to be both mother and father to you ever since (Jean or Gene) ran off with...that thing". The co-workers start to sing For He's a Jolly Good Fellow, but have to change [...] "he's" [...] to [...] "Pat's." [...] Chris Rock had a minor role as a messenger.|$|E

3000|$|We note {{two issues}} that SWB {{researchers}} {{will need to}} be aware of when using the WVS China data. First, while there may seem to be two SWB terms in the WVS 1990, there is no Chinese questionnaire available to the public. It is difficult to tell which terms are being used from the English translation in the “results” file that is available on the website, so we do not use it. Second, the English translation in the 1995 codebook for V 11 may be misleading for SWB researchers because, while it seems like a general SWB question, it is actually a specific question about the respondent’s health. The results file translates the question as “Taking all things together, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> you are: Very good, Good, Fair, Poor, Very poor,” but examining the Chinese, the question is “整体上看,您最近的健康状况如何?,” which is more accurately, “Lately, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> your health has been: Very good, Good, Average, Not good, Very Bad.” [...]...|$|E
