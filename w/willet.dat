Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, {{played a central role in}} planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee <b>Willet</b> (of the studio that would become <b>Willet</b> Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|A strain {{known as}} Patch Hounds was {{developed}} by <b>Willet</b> Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the south {{half of the}} loop road became part of NY221, a new route extending from NY38 at Harford Mills to US11 {{in the village of}} Marathon. NY221 was extended east to its current eastern terminus in <b>Willet</b> by the following year. The portion of the route between the Harford loop road and <b>Willet</b> utilized a highway added to the state highway system sometime after 1926. NY221 was rerouted to follow its current alignment to the hamlet of Harford in the mid-1930s, and its former routing to Harford Mills was redesignated as NY200 in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Carancahua Bay is {{protected}} by the State of Texas and locally by the 300-member Carancahua Bay Protection Association. It is a nursery bay for shrimp, and is a habitat for shellfish including oysters. Finfish such as the redfish and black drum are commonly caught from the bay by recreational fishermen.

5|$|Within the village, {{the route}} gains the West Main Street moniker and heads through {{a mix of}} {{residential}} and commercial areas. NY221 crosses intersections with CR134A and CR134B and passes the former Marathon railroad depot before crossing the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway and the Tioughnioga River {{in the center of}} the community. After crossing the river, the renamed Main Street heads northeast through the village, intersecting with US11 (Cortland Street) just ahead of an interchange with Interstate81 (I-81) at the latter's exit9. After the exit from I-81, NY221 reenters another rural area and turns eastward past Dean Pond. After intersecting with CR161B (Texas Valley Road) and CR161C (Merrill Creek Road), NY221 crosses Merrill Creek and winds through farmland. Entering the town of <b>Willet,</b> NY221 crosses the southern terminus of CR167 (Bloody Pond Road) and makes a gradual curve to the north while intersecting with CR169 (Landers Corners Road). NY221 continues north to the hamlet of <b>Willet,</b> where it ends at an intersection with NY26 and NY41.|$|E
5000|$|The {{area was}} named after that portion of <b>Willets</b> Point Boulevard lying west of Flushing Creek, which flows northward past the area. <b>Willets</b> Point Boulevard once crossed a now-demolished bridge over Flushing Creek and {{continued}} to the <b>Willets</b> Point cape, at {{the confluence of the}} East River and Long Island Sound. The true <b>Willets</b> Point is the site of Fort Totten near Bayside, but {{over the course of the}} 20th century it became commonplace to apply the name [...] "Willets Point" [...] (derived from the street, rather than the geographical feature) to this area instead. The neighborhood, street, and cape's name are all derived from the <b>Willets</b> family, whose land the government bought in 1857 to build Fort Totten (originally named [...] "Fort at <b>Willets</b> Point").By the end of World War II, <b>Willets</b> Point was known as an area of auto junkyards. Since then, several redevelopment plans for <b>Willets</b> Point were proposed, but never implemented. Before the 1964 New York World's Fair, Robert Moses tried to incorporate <b>Willets</b> Point into Flushing Meadows-Corona Park but failed when the junkyard owners hired Mario Cuomo as their lawyer. Shea Stadium, a multipurpose stadium in <b>Willets</b> Point, was opened in 1964, the same year as the World's Fair.|$|R
50|$|In 1850, a {{road was}} built through Albertson on {{the lands of}} Isaac Underhill <b>Willets.</b> The road is still known as I U <b>Willets</b> Road. (<b>Willets</b> complained that Long Island has more roads than it would ever need). The Long Island Rail Road {{designated}} an Albertson train station in 1864.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Willets</b> {{was born}} to David <b>Willets</b> and Deborah Whitson in Westbury, New York. He married Mary Cromwell on December 29, 1843.

5|$|The route {{continues}} north {{through the}} towns of Greene and Smithville to the hamlet of Smithville Flats, where it meets the western terminus of NY220. NY41 heads northwest from this junction, passing by Long Pond and Cincinnatus Lake before crossing into Cortland County {{and the town of}} <b>Willet.</b> In the hamlet of the same name, NY41 intersects NY26. It joins NY41 here, and the two routes proceed northwest from the hamlet and across the Otselic River to a junction with the east end of NY221. Past this point, NY26 and NY41 head due north along the river's west bank into the town of Cincinnatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{stained glass}} windows of the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to <b>Willet</b> on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E
5|$|County Bus & Coach {{took over}} the former London Country North East garages at Harlow, Grays and Hertford. Under AJS's {{ownership}} it was managed by Graham <b>Willet,</b> previously London Country Bus Services' chief engineer. The company enjoyed some expansion: small independent Sampson Coaches and its garage at Hoddesdon were bought in February 1989; however, {{as a result of}} this, Hertford garage was vacated and sold for redevelopment by its owners Parkdale Holdings. The Debden and Wyatts Green depots and some local routes of the former East Midland owned Frontrunner operation were acquired in July 1989. County Bus & Coach's fleet policy was to use Mercedes-Benz minibuses on most routes, including in Grays when Lakeside Shopping Centre opened and when two London contracted routes were run; {{there is some evidence that}} passengers did not like these vehicles, and their use is thought to have reduced patronage in the area.|$|E
50|$|Lazarus {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} state attorney from 1978 until 1993. According to some, Lazarus's most notable case as a prosecutor was putting Kathy <b>Willets</b> and Jeffrey <b>Willets</b> behind bars for running a prostitution ring. This case involved Ellis Rubin seeking to claim that Prozac created an unquenchable sexual appetite as a defence for Kathy <b>Willets.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{post office}} called <b>Willets</b> was {{established}} in 1903, and remained in operation until 1934. The community was named for A. P. <b>Willets,</b> {{the owner of a}} local sawmill.|$|R

5|$|New York State Route221 (NY221) is a {{state highway}} in Cortland County, New York, in the United States. Its western {{terminus}} is at an intersection with NY38 {{in the town of}} Harford. The eastern terminus is at a junction with NY26 and NY41 in the town of <b>Willet.</b> Near its western end, NY221 intersects New York State Route200. Together, NY200 and NY221 form a loop route off NY38 between the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills within the town of Harford. NY221 originally followed modern NY200 and ended at U.S. Route11 (US11) in Marathon when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was extended to its present length by the following year and realigned to serve Harford later in the decade. NY200 was assigned in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Willet</b> Street is a {{northbound}} {{one-way street}} comprising three blocks, {{stretching from the}} southeastern corner of the park at the intersection with Madison Avenue to the northeastern corner with State Street. All of Willett Street is in the historic district, including approximately 33 buildings. The street is entirely residential except for the First Presbyterian Church, built in 1883 on the corner with State Street. Willett Street has many different styles including Queen Anne, Spanish Revival, Classical revival, Georgian, Romanesque, Italianate, and brownstones. Two larger apartment buildings, built in 1909 and 1927, break up the otherwise continuous row of older townhouses. One of those apartment buildings is the Willett, formerly the Wareham, a five-story building built in 1909 that spans 84â€“92 Willett Street. This building sits on a former site of the New York State Normal College, predecessor to the University at Albany, which burned in 1906. The oldest building on Willett to maintain its original facade, 22 Willett, was built in 1872. Nearby 28 Willett Street was the home of Martin Glynn, an owner {{and publisher of the}} Albany Times Union, a state comptroller, and the governor of New York from 1913 to 1914. Glynn was the first Catholic New York governor and the only longtime Albany resident to reach that position.|$|E
5|$|In late 1962, Ray Davies {{left home}} {{to study at}} Hornsey College of Art. He pursued {{interests}} in subjects such as film, sketching, theatre and music such as jazz and blues. When Blues Incorporated played at the college in December, he asked advice from Alexis Korner, who recommended Giorgio Gomelsky, the former Yardbirds manager, who put Davies {{in touch with the}} Soho-based Dave Hunt Band, a professional group of musicians who played jazz and R A few days after the Ray Davies Quartet supported Cyril Stapleton at the Lyceum Ballroom on New Years Eve, Davies, while still remaining in the Quartet, joined the Dave Hunt Band which briefly included Charlie Watts on drums. In February 1963, Davies left Dave Hunt to join the Hamilton King Band (also known as the Blues Messengers), which had Peter Bardens as pianist. At the end of the spring term he left Hornsey College with a view to study film at the Central School of Art and Design, around this time the Quartet changed their name to the Ramrods. In June, the Hamilton King Band broke up, though the Ramrods kept going, performing under several other names, including the Pete Quaife Band, and the Bo-Weevils, before (temporarily) settling on the Ravens. The fledgling group hired two managers, Grenville Collins and Robert Wace, and in late 1963 former pop singer Larry Page became their third manager. American record producer Shel Talmy began working with the band, and the Beatles' promoter, Arthur Howes, was retained to schedule the Ravens' live shows. The group unsuccessfully auditioned for various record labels until early 1964, when Talmy secured them a contract with Pye Records. During this period they had acquired a new drummer, Mickey Willet; however, <b>Willet</b> left the band shortly before they signed to Pye. The Ravens invited Mick Avory to replace him after seeing an advertisement Avory had placed in Melody Maker. Avory had a background in jazz drumming and had played one gig with the fledgling Rolling Stones.|$|E
