40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} different indium tin oxide (ITO) surface treatments {{on the performance of}} organic solar cells with different device architectures. Two types of devices (CuPc in contact with ITO treated <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>treatments</b> and C 60 in contact with ITO treated <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>treatments)</b> were fabricated. The surfaces of CuPc and C 60 layers deposited on ITO substrates treated with different surface treatments were examined using atomic force microscopy. The devices were characterized by measuring current-voltage characteristics in the dark and under AMI illumination. We found that a one order of magnitude improvement in the AMI power conversion efficiency for ITO/CuPc/C 60 /A 1 cells can be achieved for optimal ITO surface treatment, while ITO/C 60 /CuPc/Cu devices exhibit less sensitivity to surface treatments. Moreover, these devices exhibit better performance compared to ITO/CuPc/C 60 /Al devices. The observed differences in sensitivity to surface treatments were attributed to difference in the dependence of the film surface on ITO surface morphology for CuPc and C 60. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{functional}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (FMRI) has been increasingly used {{to investigate the}} neurobiology of schizophrenia. This technique relies on changes in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) -signal, which changes in response to neural activity. Many FMRI studies on schizophrenia have examined medicated patients, but {{little is known about}} the effects of antipsychotic medication on the BOLD-signal. In this review we investigated to what extent studies in patients with schizophrenia (SC), who were treated with different antipsychotics, could give insight in the effects of antipsychotics on the BOLD-signal. A PubMed search was performed using the search items "schizophrenia", "FMRI", "antipsychotics" and "schizophrenia", "BOLD", "antipsychotics". Only articles in which there were at least two groups of patients <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>treatments</b> or in which patients were scanned twice <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>treatments</b> were selected. 18 articles, published between 1999 and 2009, fulfilled these criteria. Paradigms and results of these studies were compared regarding differences induced by the administered antipsychotics. This analysis showed no general effect of antipsychotics on the BOLD-signal. However, there is some evidence that the extent of blockade of the dopamine (DA) D 2 receptor does influence the BOLD-signal. Higher affinity to the dopamine D 2 receptor, as expressed by a higher/lower inhibition constant (Ki) seems to cause a decrease in BOLD-signal...|$|E

After characterization of ITO, we deposited 100 nm (N,N′-di(naphthalene- 1 -yl) -N,N′-diphenyl-benzidine (NPB) film on the surface of ITO substrates treated <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>treatments</b> and characterized it with surface probe microscopy and Seebeck coefficient measurements. Then, OLEDs with structure ITO/NPB/rubrene/tris (8 -hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq 3) /LiF/Al were fabricated. The device performance was related to the ITO surface morphology and the ITO work function, while there was no obvious relationship to the ITO carrier concentration and mobility. From the treatments investigated here, {{it is not possible to}} distinguish whether relatively flat surface with isolated high spikes is sufficient on its own for good performance, or high work function value together with such surface morphology is required. The maximum luminous efficiency of 2. 0 lm/W was obtained for ITO/NPB/rubrene/Alq 3 /LiF/Al OLED with HCl followed by UV ozone treatment compared to 1. 7 lm/W with UV ozone treatment only. © 2004 Elsevier B.
