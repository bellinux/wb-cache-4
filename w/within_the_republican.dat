5|$|As President of the United States, Rutherford B. Hayes {{had caused}} heated {{tensions}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. Hayes had {{moved away from}} party patronage by offering government jobs to Southern Democrats instead of Northern Republicans. His actions drew heavy criticism from those inside his party, such as Roscoe Conkling of New York and James G. Blaine of Maine. Hayes had known since the dispute over the 1876 election that he was unlikely to win in 1880, and had announced at his 1877 inauguration {{that he would not}} run for a second term. Without an incumbent president in the race, the rival factions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, eagerly anticipated the 1880 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A heated {{public debate}} followed, which {{resulted}} in a substantial rift <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions. The bill was eventually defeated in the Senate on June 28, 2007, when a cloture motion failed on a 46–53 vote. Bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives. The Bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in law.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{friction}} <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party caucus, Boehner {{decided to}} step down as speaker and resign his seat in Congress. He scheduled a Republican caucus non-binding vote for speaker on October 8, and a full floor vote on October 29. Kevin McCarthy, the House Majority Leader and second-in-command to the Speaker, was initially viewed as the favorite to win the Speakership. However, due to the opposition of the Freedom Caucus, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8, and the caucus vote was postponed.|$|E
5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies of containment had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{opposition}} from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, {{as well as}} fallout from controversial comments he made about the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, McCarthy {{dropped out of the}} race on October 8. Following McCarthy's departure from the race, Republicans renewed their efforts to recruit Ryan as a candidate. Boehner personally called Ryan twice to ask him to run, and Chaffetz said that he would not run against Ryan if he chose to enter the race. Ryan also received calls from Mitt Romney and Trey Gowdy, among others, encouraging him to run for Speaker. Additional Ryan endorsements came from Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson, 2016 Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise from Louisiana. On October 9, close aides of Ryan confirmed that Ryan was reconsidering the possibility of a run.|$|E

After un{{successfully}} running for the United States Senate, Routt ran successfully for the governorship again in 1891, and served as Colorado's seventh Governor until 1893. His third term was marked by a high level of disagreement <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in Colorado's state government.|$|R

5|$|Thompson {{graduated}} from Jefferson College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in 1858 with a bachelor's degree, and studied {{for two years}} at the Western Theological seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary). In 1861, he was appointed professor of mathematics at Western College (now Leander Clark College), a United Brethren-affiliated college in Shueyville, Iowa, and taught there for one year. The United Brethren, a pietist church that arose first among Pennsylvania Germans during the Great Awakening, {{was one of the}} earliest churches in the United States to embrace abolitionism. By Thompson's time, they had also joined the fight for the prohibition of alcohol, though most did so from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party and did not join the small single-issue Prohibition Party.|$|E
5|$|President Harrison {{had proven}} unpopular; there were {{divisions}} even <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party {{as the year}} 1892 began and Harrison began his re-election drive. Although no declared candidate opposed Harrison, many Republicans were ready to dump the President from the ticket if an alternative emerged. Among the possible candidates spoken of were McKinley, Reed, and the aging Blaine. Fearing that the Ohio governor would emerge as a candidate, Harrison's managers arranged for McKinley to be permanent chairman of the convention in Minneapolis, requiring him to play a public, neutral role. Hanna established an unofficial McKinley headquarters near the convention hall, though no active {{effort was made to}} convert delegates to McKinley's cause. McKinley objected to delegate votes being cast for him; nevertheless he finished third, behind the renominated Harrison, and behind Blaine, who had sent word {{he did not want to}} be considered. Although McKinley campaigned loyally for the Republican ticket, Harrison was defeated by former President Cleveland in the November election. In the wake of Cleveland's victory, McKinley was seen by some as the likely Republican candidate in 1896.|$|E

Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle on September 1, 1906, Pardee commented that [...] "It is evident that the Railroad machine and Abe Ruef did not {{want me to be}} governor again, and as they were in control of the convention, what kick have I coming?" ...|$|R

2500|$|McCain's {{strategy}} was hampered by several other events <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> dominating <b>the</b> political {{discussion in the}} ensuing months: Fred Thompson's entry into the race in early September; the focus in debates over battles between Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney; and the discussion over the impact of Romney's religion. Mike Huckabee's sudden surge from the second tier into near-frontrunner status dominated much of the news in November and December 2007. Nevertheless, McCain persevered, riding his [...] "Straight Talk Express" [...] bus through New Hampshire and, as in the past, granting reporters and bloggers far more direct access than would other campaigns.|$|R
25|$|George Gilmore (1898–1985) was a Protestant Irish Republican Army (IRA) leader {{during the}} 1920s and 1930s.

Thereafter, Gilmore {{remained}} a significant left wing figure <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|Worried by {{his support}} among Republicans, Governor Chamberlain canvassed several {{counties}} of the state. Accompanied by Republicans held in low esteem {{by the white}} community, the meetings were often disrupted by Democrats. However, the growing strength and militancy of the Democrats served the purpose of reducing the opposition to Chamberlain <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party.|$|E
25|$|Boehner {{previously}} {{served as}} the House Minority Leader from 2007 until 2011, and House Majority Leader from 2006 until 2007. Boehner's almost nine years as the Republican Leader in the House (four years as Minority Leader and nearly five years as Speaker) was the longest consecutive tenure for a Republican Leader in the House since Bob Michel of Illinois served 14 years as House Minority Leader between 1981 and 1995. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus.|$|E

25|$|In the 2003 {{legislative}} session, Frist enjoyed many successes. He {{was able}} to push many initiatives through to fruition, including the Bush administration's third major tax cut and legislation that was against partial-birth abortion. However, the tactics {{that he used to}} achieve those victories alienated many Democrats. He also was instrumental in developing and then passing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the historic and unprecedented funding commitment to fight disease. In 2004, by comparison, he saw no major legislative successes, with the explanations ranging from delay tactics by Democrats to lack of unity <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{was also}} a key {{advocate}} for embattled conservative Trent Lott's return to a leadership post <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party in 2006. Lott had resigned his position as Senate Republican Leader in 2002, following controversy surrounding his perceived support of Sen. Strom Thurmond's (R-SC) segregationist politics. After the party {{lost control of the}} Senate in November 2006, Republicans elected Lott to the post of Minority Whip (the second-highest Republican position in the Senate.) During the closed-door election, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) nominated Lott for the position. Smith then seconded the nomination and delivered a supportive address before casting his vote.|$|E
25|$|The South Armagh Brigade of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{operated}} {{during the}} Troubles in south County Armagh. It was organised into two battalions, one around Jonesborough and another around Crossmaglen. By the 1990s, the South Armagh Brigade {{was thought to}} consist of about 40 members, roughly half of them living south of the border. It has allegedly been commanded since the 1970s by Thomas 'Slab' Murphy who is also alleged {{to be a member}} of the IRA's Army Council. Compared to other brigades, the South Armagh IRA was seen as an 'independent republic' <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>republican</b> movement, retaining a battalion organizational structure and not adopting the cell structure the rest of the IRA was forced to adopt after repeated intelligence failures.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the legislative elections, the split between Macron-compatible [...] "constructives" [...] <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> (LR) and <b>the</b> rest of the party re-emerged. On 21 June, Thierry Solère announced {{the creation of a new}} common group in the National Assembly with the Union of Democrats and Independents (UDI) likely to contain 18 UDI and about 15 LR deputies. The formation of two parliamentary groups on the right represented a symbolic divorce to the two threads on the right (the moderates and the hardliners) and the end of the old Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) which had been created in 2002 to unite the right and centre.|$|R
