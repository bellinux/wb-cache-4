5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who is {{preparing}} for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) if she has any reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him.

5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
50|$|Thunderblast is not {{the first}} Transformer to possess an {{especially}} feminine figure, with features such as a shaped torso, hips and even <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> breasts underneath her chest-plate, (Blackarachnia was perhaps most notable for this) but she <b>is</b> the first <b>to</b> have <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> nipples, seen only for perhaps one instant in the show itself.|$|R

5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets.

5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, {{it would have been}} termed a planet.|$|E
5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing an aerial photo that those trees form <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising a crucifix.|$|E

5|$|In July 2006 a major {{community}} archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the Museum of London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, {{as part of}} the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part.

5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors.

Amy and Rory witness one transformation and try to flee, but Amy is caught and becomes a doll herself, joining the others in chasing Rory.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a metal vertebra.

Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes.

Experts call it Singapore's only 'true fort'—one with protection all around—and it was considered one of Singapore's most important archaeological finds.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files.
