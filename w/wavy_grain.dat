40|$|Abstract. Soil deep {{ploughing}} {{has a significant}} role on packing prevention technologies of soil layer beneath topsoil. It demands high energy consumption. This investigation was intended to clarify the effectiveness of {{deep ploughing}} in various field relief conditions. The experiments were arranged in LUA RFS Vecauce Ltd during the years 2001 - 2007. Field trials were settled in loamy sand sod-podzolic soils with equalized micro-relief during the years 2001 - 2004. Winter wheat was grown after clover- timothy mixture. The field was treated with glyphosate herbicide after harvesting of fore-crop. Soil tillage included soil deep ploughing in the following treatments: untreated (without tillage), deep ploughing at 0. 25, 0. 35 and 0. 50 m depth. Subsequent soil treatment included soil ploughing at 0. 22 – 0. 25 m depth and direct sowing. Field trials in production fields were {{carried out in the}} years 2004 - 2007. Soil tillage included soil deep ploughing at the depth of 0. 35 and 0. 50 m. All observations were carried out in certain field points detected by GPS. The chosen fields had <b>wavy</b> meso-relief. <b>Grain</b> yield was determined by CLASS LEXION 420 GPS-established harvest maps. Soil deep ploughing at the depth of 0. 50 m gave the winter wheat yield increase by 7. 3 % or 0. 4 t ha- 1 on average of three year field trials in 2001 - 2004. A significant positive effect of soil deep ploughing at the depth of 0. 35 and 0. 50 m on yield of winter wheat in the next year was determined. The impact on soil resistance from soil deep ploughing was significant only on the trail of tine and 0. 10 m away from it. Significant increase of soil resistance was determined at th...|$|R

50|$|The second {{advantage}} of quartersawn wood is the decorative {{pattern on the}} board, although this depends on the timber species. Flat sawn wood (especially oak) will often display a prominent <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> (sometimes called a cathedral-window pattern) caused by the saw cutting at a tangent to a growth ring; since in quartersawn wood the saw cuts across the growth rings, the visible grain is much straighter; it is this evenness of the grain that gives quartersawn wood its greater stability.|$|E
40|$|Separate {{aspects of}} the mineralogy, {{geochemistry}} and petrology of the Catherwood and Kinley Saskatchewan meteorites were investigated in this study. Since Catherwood and Kinley were found approximately twelve miles apart, it was {{the purpose of this}} study to determine whether they were actually from the same fall. Olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, chlorapatite, troilite, kamacite and taenite, chromite, limonite and graphite are minerals typical of both meteorites. Textural features in the matrix and chondrules indicate that there was a period of high-temperature recrystallization in both Catherwood and Kinley. Absence of glassy chondrules, chondrules which diffuse into the matrix, dominance or anhedral and anhedral-subhedral olivine and orthopyroxene grains, uniform grain size, and smooth outline of some opaque minerals support this conclusion. Catherwood and Kinley have undergone significantly high stress levels. Olivine, orthopyroxene and chromite grains are fractured; mosaics of fine olivine grains are conspicuous; some chondrules occur as remnants and relicts; chondrules are commonly cracked, 'deformed', distorted and strained; taenite (Î³-iron), an irreversible transition product, is present; veinlets and intergrowths of troilite and Ni-Fe have been formed subsequent to brecciation and droplets of troilite and Ni-Fe have been mobilized within chondrules. These features are all indicative of shock. Several features indicate that Catherwood and Kinley represent different falls. These include crustal differences and differences in bulk chemistry and mineral composition. Ringwoodite, majorite and maskelynite (irreversible phase transition products) are present only in Catherwood and pigeonite and ilmenite only in Kinley. Also, plagioclase, troilite, kamacite and taenite distributions are different in both chondrites. Catherwood chondrules are less abundant, smaller, less closely packed and more closely 'integrated' with the matrix than are the finley ohondrules. 'Barred', 'radiating', 'jacketed' and lithic chondrules are present in both chondrites, but their percentages differ resulting in different normative and modal distributions for the olivine and pyroxene of which they are composed. Catherwood has been subjected to higher stress levels and recrystallization temperatures as is evidenced by fracturing and veining, <b>wavy</b> extinction (strained <b>grains),</b> a lowering of birefringence in some grains, and by chondrules having been mylonitized. All these features are more prominent in Catherwood than in Kinley. Catherwood and Kinley are typical ordinary olivine hypersthene chondrites. Bulk chemistry, homogeneity of olivine and pyroxene (Fo= 73 in Catherwood and 70 in Kinley; Fs= 18 in Catherwood and 15 in Kinley), absence of glass (except for minor amounts or maskelynite in Catherwood), moderate amounts of plagioclase (An 10) some grains or which are large and show a good-to-excellent development; the presence or maskelynite, some chromite, and taenite (Î³-iron), the kamacite-taenite-troilite assemblage, and extensive recrystallization classify both meteorites as L 6 chondrites of Van Schmus and Wood (1967).

This species of wood is valued for both acoustic qualities but mostly for aesthetic, using a natural defect of maple wood characterized by <b>wavy</b> <b>grain.</b> The paper presents the research on visco-elasticity behavior of maple wood with different types of grain deviation in wood from very curly maple to common maple. The storage modulus, loss modulus, damping capacity in varying temperature conditions and for different loading frequencies were determined using dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA).

40|$|Nucleation {{mechanism}} from initial {{grain boundaries}} {{and the process}} of texture formation during dynamic recrystallization in pure nickel were studied in uniaxial compression tests at temperatures of 293 K, 873 K and 905 K and true strain rates of 1. 0 × 10 ^- 3 s- 1 and 1. 0 × 10 ^－ 4 s^－ 1 ．Microstructures were observed by optical microscopy and SEM. Orientation measurements of individual grains were carried out by EBSP technique. Misorientation between neighboring points along grain boundaries in the specimen deformed at high temperature having <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries were greater than that in the specimen deformed at room temperature having smooth grain boundaries. Further, the misorientation was larger when the degree of grain boundary curvature was more severe. These indicate that vicinity of <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries is the region of inhomogeneous deformation. These regions have various orientations locally because of lattice rotation to various directions. New grains nucleated from these regions had almost random orientation. At high Zener-Hollomonp parameter conditions, area of high pole density was distributed about 10 degrees away from (011) to (001). The reason is as follows; at fully dynamically recrystallized material, new grains nucleate with random orientation followed by the orientation change towards (011) by the deformation. Before some grains reach to (011), however, new grains nucleate again with random orientation and grains with (011) orientation disappears...|$|E

The {{goal of this}} study was to analyse fiddleback figure and other log characteristics in sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and their contribution to the price of the timber. We studied sycamore maple logs at the annual auction of the highest quality wood assortments in Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia. Measurements were performed on the logs and <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> was analysed in 2013. In addition, data were used on logs auctioned between 2007 and 2012. Using the data collected at the auction in 2013 and a binary logistic regression model, the original sample was expanded considerably. The percentage of fi ddleback maple was 7. 4 % at the auction in 2013. Larger volume of maple logs was on average linked to higher price; however, the presence of fiddleback figure in a log per se did not guarantee above average price. Prices of more than half of the fiddleback figured maple logs at the auction in 2013 were below average. On the other hand, large fiddleback logs achieved the highest prices. Trees with fiddleback figure proved to be evenly distributed throughout the entire population of sycamore maple in Slovenia. The geographic origin of sycamore maple did not influence the occurrence of fiddleback figure. The presented results appear to be representative of the occurrence of fiddleback figure in Acer pseudoplatanus throughout its entire distribution range...|$|E
40|$|There {{appear in}} the wood of Entandrophragma, beside the basic {{interlocked}} grain, local minute undulations of grain the manifestation of which are checkered figures, either slanting or horizontal, on the radial face of boards. In reference to the model the slanting checkered figure is interpreted {{as the result of}} sudden appearance in the cambium of a wave of orientational tendency (morphogenetic wave) of relatively short wavelengths and stabilized amplitude from the moment of its appearance, moving vertically. This wave induces undulations in the arrangement of cambial initials. The undulation pattern also moves, however, its rate is half that of the morphogenic wave rate. The amplitude of the undulations oscillates between a maximal value and null which means that in successive wood layers there is <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> alternating with straight grain. The horizontal checkered figure may be explained by a local shift of the prase by one half of the period of the morphogenic wave of relatively long wavelengths underlying the interlocked grain formation...|$|E

In this study, the anatomical and physical-acoustical characteristics of its wood, taken from different trees with various surface figures, were characterized. Vibrational mechanical measurements were conducted taking into account radial and longitudinal directions and local variations. Waviness parameters were quantified on split blocks, and anatomical properties such as microfibril angle and ray dimensions were measured using light microscopy. Results provide a complete dataset on the properties of sycamore maple along a gradient of the wavy figure. Through statistical analysis, significant correlations {{were found between the}} measured parameters, particularly between the waviness and microfibril angle, and between the anatomical features and the specific modulus of elasticity and damping by internal friction of the wood in the longitudinal direction. Anisotropy was found to be very low but was not satisfactorily explained by the studied anatomical features. Prospects for future studies on the wavy figure are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The microstructures {{and crystal}} growth {{directions}} of {{permanent mould casting}} and directionally solidified Al-Mg alloys with different Mg contents have been investigated. The {{results indicate that the}} effect of Mg content on microstructure is basically same for the alloys prepared by these two methods. The primary grains change from cellular crystals to developed columnar dendrites, and then to equiaxed dendrites as the Mg content is increased. Simultaneously, both the cellular or columnar grain region and the primary trunk spacing decrease. All of these changes are mainly attributed to the constitutional supercooling resulting from Mg element. Comparatively, the cellular or columnar crystals of the directionally solidified alloys are straighter and more parallel than those of the permanent mould casting alloys. These have straight or <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries, {{one of the most important}} microstructure characteristics of feathery grains. However, the transverse microstructure and growth direction reveal that they do not belong to feathery grains.

40|$|We {{generate}} inherent structures, local potential-energy minima, of the "k-space overlap potential" in two-dimensional many-particle systems using {{a cooling}} and quenching simulation technique. The ground states {{associated with the}} k-space overlap potential are stealthy (i. e., completely suppress single scattering of radiation {{for a range of}} wavelengths) and hyperuniform (i. e., infinite wavelength density fluctuations vanish). However, we show via quantitative metrics that the inherent structures exhibit a range of stealthiness and hyperuniformity depending on the fraction of degrees of freedom that are constrained. Inherent structures in two dimensions typically contain five-particle rings, <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries, and vacancy-interstitial defects. The structural and thermodynamic properties of inherent structures are relatively insensitive to the temperature from which they are sampled, signifying that the energy landscape is relatively flat and devoid of deep wells. Using the nudged-elastic-band algorithm, we construct paths from ground-state configurations to inherent structures and identify the transition points between them. In addition, we use point patterns generated from a random sequential addition (RSA) of hard disks, which are nearly stealthy, and examine the particle rearrangements necessary to make the configurations absolutely stealthy. We introduce a configurational proximity metric to show that only small local, but collective, particle rearrangements are needed to drive initial RSA configurations to stealthy disordered ground states. These results lead to a more complete understanding of the unusual behaviors exhibited by the family of "collective-coordinate" potentials to which the k-space overlap potential belongs.

40|$|Aluminum 5456 -H 116 {{has high}} as-welded strength, is formable, and highly {{corrosion}} resistant, however, {{it can become}} sensitized when exposed to elevated temperatures for a prolonged time. Sensitization results {{in the formation of}} a continuous β phase at the grain boundaries that is anodic to the matrix. Thus the grain boundaries become susceptible to stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and intergranular corrosion cracking (IGC). Cracking issues on aluminum superstructures have prompted the use of a severe plastic deformation processes, such as ultrasonic impact treatment (UIT), to improve SCC resistance. This study correlated the effects of UIT on the properties of 5456 -H 116 alloy to the microstructural evolution of the alloy and helped develop a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that cause the microstructural evolution. Ultrasonic impact treatment produces a deformed layer at the surface ~ 10 to 18 µm thick that is characterized by micro-cracks, tears, and voids. Ultrasonic impact treatment results in grain refinement within the deformation layer and extending below the deformed layer. The microstructure exhibits weak crystallographic texture with larger fraction of high angle grain boundaries. Nanocrystalline grains within the deformation layer vary in size from 2 to 200 nm in diameter and exhibit curved or <b>wavy</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries. The nanocrystalline grains are thermally stable up to 300 °C. Above 300 °C, grain growth occurs with an activation energy of ~ 32 kJ/mol. Below the deformation layer, the microstructure is characterized by submicron grains, complex structure of dislocations, sub-boundaries, and Moiré fringes depicting overlapping grains. The deformation layer does not exhibit the presence of a continuous β phase, however below the deformation layer; a continuous β phase along the grain boundaries is present. In general the highest hardness and yield strength is at the UIT surface which is attributed to the formation of nanocrystalline grains. Although the highest hardness and yield strength was observed at the UIT surface, the results were mixed with some lower values. The lower hardness and yield strength values at the UIT surface are attributed to the voids and micro cracking/micro voids observed in the deformation layer. The fracture mode was transgranular ductile fracture with micro void coalescence and dimples. Both UIT and untreated material exhibit similar levels of intergranular corrosion susceptibility. Corrosive attack was intergranular with slightly deeper attack in the untreated material. Numerical simulation modeling showed that the calculated residual stress under the tool, ~ 80 MPa, is of the same order of magnitude as the compressive residual stresses measured by XRD measurements near the surface. Modeling also showed that high effective strains were induced almost immediately. The UIT process also resulted in rapid localized heating to a maximum temperature of ~ 32 °C during the first eleven pin tool cycles. The model also showed that during UIT processing, the material undulates as the pin tool impacts and retracts {{from the surface of the}} material. The undulations represent the elastic response of the surface to the compressive stresses built up during a pin tool cycle...|$|E
