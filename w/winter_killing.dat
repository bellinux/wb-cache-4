40|$|In central Turkey, {{common vetch}} is planted in spring, but {{frequent}} droughts cause crop failures. Autumn-sown vetch has more yield potential; but then <b>winter</b> <b>killing</b> {{is a major}} problem. Therefore, winter hardiness is a central requirement for successful vetch production. This study comprised two phases. First, eighteen lines out of 164 accessions were selected for their superiority, primarily for winter hardiness and earliness in 1999 / 00. Second, the selected lines along two local checks (var. SarıElçi and cv. KaraElçi) were evaluated for yield performances in multi-year trials established in autumn and spring from 2000 to 2003. Autumn-sown vetch displayed 14. 9 % greater yield potential than spring vetch. As winter mortality decreased, seed yield increased in two cold environments (r 2 = 0. 41 and r 2 = 0. 54). The two genotypes (L- 1430 and L- 1548) showed the greatest stability across six environments, while L- 581 and L- 1544 were the best lines for autumn sowing. In conclusion, the level of variation found in the base populations did clearly show potential for further development, and multi-environment trials singled out the V. sativa genotypes with enhanced winter hardiness...|$|E

2500|$|From Poland, {{there had}} been three incursions of the plague into Silesia (then {{belonging}} to the Bohemian Crown of the Habsburg Monarchy) in 1708: first into Georgenberg (Miasteczko), transmitted by a Cracow wagoner but successfully contained; then into Rosenberg (Olesno), where it killed 860 inhabitants out of 1,700; and also into two villages near Militsch (Milicz), from where it spread into the nearby lands of Wartenberg (Syców). After the Swedish defeat at Poltava in 1709, refugees from Poland including part of the Swedish-Polish corps of Joseph Potocki (called [...] "Kiowski") crossed into the Silesian borderlands, but also their Russian pursuers. This resulted in the infection of 25 villages in the Oels (Oleśnica) and Militsch area, and while the plague seemed to have faded out by February 1710, it struck again and even more severe from spring 1710 to <b>winter</b> 1711, <b>killing</b> more than 3,000 inhabitants of Oels and many villagers. In 1712, the plague crossed into Silesia for a last time from Polish Zduny, infecting the village of Luzin near Oels and killing 14 people before it vanished {{in the beginning of}} 1713. Contemporary to the plague, there was also a cattle plague in Silesia.|$|R

40|$|The hardy catalpa {{is one of}} {{the best}} fence post trees that can be grown in Iowa. Nearly all the catalpa {{plantations}} in the state have been studied by the forestry section of the experiment station. A large majority of them are successful, and seem to be a paying proposition for their owners. The hardy catalpa is a southern tree, its natural locality being throughout southern Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, eastern Missouri, and southward. Iowa is considerably north of its natural range. In the southern half of the state there is very little danger of <b>winter</b> <b>killing</b> if given a favorable location. In the northern part, however, there has been considerable trouble from this cause. For this reason it is not advisable to plant catalpas in extensive plantations in the extreme northern and especially in the northwestern part of Iowa. North of the line drawn between Harrison and Monona counties, and continued eastward across the state, catalpa plantations should be protected by a windbreak of hardier trees planted along the north and west sides of the grove. Three or four rows of cottonwoods or willows afford plenty of protection...|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa stands thin {{over time}} due to pests, poor fertility, <b>winter</b> <b>killing,</b> and {{stresses}} associated with harvesting. It {{would be useful}} to be able to improve alfalfa stands by overseeding periodically or at specific locations in a field where plants have been lost. Numerous studies have shown that alfalfa seedlings grow very slowly and often die when placed in close proximity to established alfalfa plants. For instance, Asbil and Coulman (1992) overseeded an existing alfalfa stand with 4 or 11 lbs/A of alfalfa seed (Fig. 1). Overseeding had no impact on yield the year of overseeding and increased yield only 1 T/A in the year after overseeding. Plant populations increased from 1. 5 /ft 2 to 3 and 4 plants/ft 2 for plots receiving 4 and 11 lbs seed/A, respectively. At these seeding rates 18 and 55 seeds/ft 2 are planted, indicating that only 5 to 8 % of the seed resulted in new plants. This extensive death of alfalfa seedlings when seeded into an established alfalfa stand is known as autotoxicity. Autotoxicity prevents managers from successfully thickening alfalfa stands by overseeding. It also can result in poor germination and reduced vigor of alfalfa seedlings replanted into destroyed (plowed or herbicide plus no-till) alfalfa fields without rotation (Fig. 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been made on the <b>winter</b> <b>killing</b> of cereals, but few data are {{available}} on their actual growth rates during fall, winter, and early spring. No attempt {{has been made to}} correlate growth with environmental conditions, at least in the great wheat belt of the Mississippi Valley and Great Plains. During the fall of 1921 a study of the development of winter wheat both above and below ground was begun. A strain of Turkey Red winter wheat recently developed at the Kansas Agricultural College and known as Kanred was grown. A plat of one tenth acre of fertile silt-loam soil was secured in the city of Lincoln. It was conveniently located near the University of Nebraska where living plants could be easily transferred for careful study to the laboratories of the department of botany. The field had been formed by breaking the native sod four years previously, and four crops had been grown. The 1921 crop was corn which had been cut during the latter part of August. The soil, which was in excellent tilth, was plowed to a depth of about four inches on September 20 and repeatedly harrowed until a good seed bed was obtained. The wheat was immediately drilled at a depth of 1. 5 to 2 inches, the rate being 75 pounds per acre. Immediately before plowing, all stubble and weeds were removed in order to prevent them from interfering later with root excavations...|$|E
25|$|Born {{and raised}} in Michigan, Swenson first reached the far north as a Nome {{prospector}} in 1901. The next year he signed on for a prospecting venture in Siberia, spending two summers and one winter on the Chukchi Peninsula. He returned to Siberia in 1905, this time {{with his wife and}} their infant son. His introduction to trading came when their ship was wrecked and he contracted to salvage cargo on a share basis. He continued to trade at Anadyr until 1911. In 1913, Swenson and C.L. Hibbard of Seattle formed the Hibbard-Swenson Company which operated trading schooners and steamers on the Siberian coast, buying furs and ivory and trading a variety of general merchandise until 1921. Swenson continued this business as Olaf Swenson & Co. until 1923 when the Bolshevik victory led to seizure of his business. Two years of negotiations led to a contract with the Soviet government to supply goods on a cost-plus basis and buy furs. This arrangement persisted through 1930. The difficulties of getting furs and personnel out of the Siberian Arctic led to the first commercial flights across the Bering Strait. The fourth such flight crashed in a Siberian <b>winter</b> storm, <b>killing</b> aviation pioneer Carl Ben Eielson and his mechanic in 1929. Swenson's memoir Northwest of the World contains observations on commerce, conditions, and native life in northeast Siberia and won critical praise for its direct style and vivid description.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the Black Plague in 1350, {{refugees}} from surrounding areas settled in plague emptied farmhouses in Wohlen, leading to an end of the separate populations in the village. [...] After 1500, the population began to grow again. The number of households climbed from 48 to 60 (1540-1570), i.e., about 240 to 300 people. Starting in 1635, there are church records, so the population is known. These records start just as the last large plague hit the city in the autumn and <b>winter</b> of 1635/36, <b>killing</b> approximately one quarter of the people. The population increased slowly until about 1800, as the local economy could not support rapid growth. However, in 1800 Wohlen had a larger population than either Bremgarten or Villmergen (1397 inhabitants against Bremgarten 599; Villmergen 888). After 1800, with new income opportunities, Wohlen increased its population steadily: 1800 to 1890 by 87%, from 1890 to 1950 it increased 154% and from 1950 to 2004 by 109%.|$|R
5000|$|Receiving {{the order}} to turn his command over to Wang, Gao left his army, which by this point was sieging Jiaozhi, with Wei, while heading back to Haimen to meet Wang and turn over the command. Meanwhile, though, the {{messengers}} that Gao and Wei had sent previously to submit reports to Emperor Yizong, the officer Zeng Gun (曾袞) and the eunuch Wang Huizan (王惠贊), believing that Li Weizhou would again intercept them, took a roundabout route and avoided Li's and Wang Yanquan's camp, and then headed for Chang'an. Upon Zeng's and Wang Huizan's arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Yizong was pleased by the reports, and issued another order promoting Gao and allowing {{him to keep his}} command. When Gao received the edict at Haimen, he returned to the Jiaozhi front — where Li Weizhou and Wang Yanquan had taken over but had lifted the siege. He resumed the siege, and finally captured it in <b>winter</b> 866, <b>killing</b> Duan and the local chieftain Zhu Daogu (朱道古), who was allied with Dali forces. Upon Gao's capture of Jiaozhi, Emperor Yizong converted Annan District to a new circuit, Jinghai Circuit, and commissioned him the military governor of Jinghai. It was said that Gao then rebuilt Jiaozhi's defenses such that Dali did not attack again.

40|$|Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) yields {{are higher}} when plantings {{are made in}} early winter in the Mediterranean region instead of during the {{traditional}} spring season, but <b>winter</b> <b>killing</b> is often a problem. Cold tolerant chickpea cultivars are needed to successfully utilize a winter sowing approach. A study was conducted at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Tel Hadya, Syria during 1982 to 1983 {{with the objective of}} developing a field screening technique for cold tolerance in chickpea, and to identify sources of tolerance. A set of previously identified tolerant, intermediate, and susceptible lines was sown from mid-fall to early spring. All susceptible lines sown during October were killed from cold injury, showing that the crop was more susceptible at the late vegetative stage than at the seedling stage. Consequently, a field screening technique was proposed, with an October sowing date to allow the crop to grow to the late vegetative stage before the onset of severe winter. Susceptible checks are grown at frequent intervals and evaluation takes place after the death of the susceptible check. This is followed by confirmation of tolerance. A 1 to 9 visual score was used to evaluate germplasm for cold tolerance. A total of 3276 germplasm accessions and breeding lines were evaluated from 1981 to 1987. Twenty-one lines were identified as tolerant. Cold tolerance was not associated with the phenotypic traits of leaflet area, seed size, time to maturity, plant height, or growth habi...|$|E
