40|$|Abstract　To find optimum {{parameters}} of a bistable wall attachment amplifier having higher recovery pressure, an experimental research {{is performed using}} devices with {{two different types of}} splitter. Devices with a <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter(1),(3) are not so good for obtaining higher recovery pressure because of mixing reattached flow with surrounding fluid in the output duct. For avoiding this phenomenon and getting higher recovery pressure, devices with a pentagonal splitter(2),(4) was originated so as to obtain the optimum output duct width free from the position of the splitter tip. As compared with devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, the remarkable merits of devices with the pentagonal splitter are observed. The recovery pressure gaind by closing the output duct is in most cases less 45 % of the supply for devices with the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> splitter, but over 45 % for devices with the pentagonal splitter. 　　側壁付着型２安定素子の設計には数多くの変数があって，その設計基準を定めるのは非常に困難である。本報では高い回復圧を得ることを目的として，スプリッタの形を楔形と駒形の 2 通りに変え，その各々に対してベント位置，スプリッタ角を変えて実験を行なった。　　楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，出力端で再付着流とまわりの流休とが混り合うために一般的に高い回復圧が得られ難い。ところが駒形のスプリッタを持つ素子は，楔形のスプリッタを持つ素子が起す上記のような現象はなく，下記に示すような著しい利点がみられた。　(1) スプリッタの位置に関係なく出カダクト巾を一定にできるので，統一的な実験が行なえる。　(2) 回復圧が非常に高い（楔形の場合は 45 %以下,駒形の場合ほ 45 %以上）。　(3) メモリタイプの素子が多く得られる。　　又，ベントに関しては， 3 次元方向にベントを開けた場合には，製作が容易であるいう利点があるが，積重ねて使用することができない，回復圧が低くメモリタイプの素子が少ないなどの欠点が多いことから，ペントは 2 次元方向に開けるのが望ましいということがわかった...|$|R

Also schlieren photographs of the starting flow pattern were made for some of the orifices investigated. The measured values of transmitted shock strength are compared with predicted values based on a theoretical one-dimensional flow model for both an ideal gas and a real gas. The agreement between the measured values of transmitted wave Mach number and the theoretically predicted values is extremely good in the Mach number range investigated for a <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> orifice at an ambient shock tube pressure of 5. 0 mm Hg, and also for a conical type orifice at an ambient shock tube pressure of 2. 5 mm Hg.

Investigation of the conical orifice with an area ratio 7. 67 at a low ambient pressure in the shock tube (0. 4 mm Hg) also yields measured values of transmitted wave Mach number greater than that predicted by the one-dimensional flow model, indicating the probable development of a thick boundary layer behind the transmitted wave downstream of the orifice...|$|R

Norway {{has one of the}} highest reported incidences of hip fractures in the world. Because of methodological challenges, vertebral fractures are not extensively studied. The aim of this population based study was to describe, for the first time, the age- and sex specific occurrence of osteoporotic vertebral fractures in Norway. Methods Data was collected in the Tromso Study, 2007 / 8 survey. By the use of dual x-ray absorptiometry (GE Lunar Prodigy) vertebral fracture assessments were performed in 2887 women and men aged from 38 to 87 years, in addition to measurements of bone mineral density at the femoral sites. Information on lifestyle was collected through questionnaires. Comparisons between fractures and non-fractures were done sex stratified, by univariate analyses, adjusting for age when relevant. Results The prevalence of vertebral fractures varied from about 3 % in the age group below 60 to about 19 % in the 70 + group in women, and from 7. 5 % to about 20 % in men, with an overall prevalence of 11. 8 % in women and 13. 8 % in men (p = 0. 07). Among those with fractures, only one fracture was the most common; two and more fractures were present in approximately 30 % of the cases.

The most common type of fracture was the <b>wedge</b> <b>type</b> in both sexes.

Randomized controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials. gov ID# NCT 01332110). Biomechanics laboratory and community. Thirty-six runners with physician-diagnosed PFP enrolled in the trial, and 27 were analyzed. Runners with PFP {{were randomly assigned to}} either an experimental 3 mm lateral wedge or control 6 mm medial wedge group. Participants completed a biomechanical gait analysis to quantify KAAIs with their assigned insole, and then used their assigned insole for six-weeks during their regular runs. Usual pain during running was measured at baseline and at six-week follow-up using a visual analog scale. Statistical tests were performed to identify differences between <b>wedge</b> <b>types,</b> differences between biomechanical response types (i. e. increase or decrease KAAI), as well as predictors of pain reduction. Percent change in KAAI relative to neutral, and % change in pain over six weeks. Clinically meaningful reductions in pain (> 33 %) were measured for both footwear groups; however, no significant differences between footwear groups were found (p = 0. 697). When participants were regrouped based on KAAI change (i. e., increase or decrease), again, no significant differences in pain reduction were noted (p = 0. 146). Interestingly, when evaluating absolute change in KAAI, a significant relationship between absolute % change in KAAI and % pain reduction was observed (R 2 = 0. 21; p = 0. 030), after adjusting for baseline pain levels. The greater the absolute % change in KAAI during running, the greater the % reduction in pain over six weeks, regardless of <b>wedge</b> <b>type,</b> and whether KAAIs increased or decreased. Lateral and medial wedge insoles were similar in effectiveness for treatment of PFP. Altering KAAI should be a focus of future PFP research.
