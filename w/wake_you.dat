500|$|After the 9th Armoured Brigade's action, Brigadier Gentry of the 6th New Zealand Brigade {{went ahead}} {{to survey the}} scene. On seeing Brigadier Currie asleep on a stretcher, he {{approached}} him saying, 'Sorry to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> John, but I'd {{like to know where}} your tanks are?' Currie waved his hand at a group of tanks around him, replying 'There they are.' Gentry was puzzled. 'I don't mean your headquarters tanks, I mean your armoured regiments. Where are they?' Currie waved his arm and again replied, 'There are my armoured regiments, Bill.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Rich {{struggled}} throughout 1979 having hits with United Artists and Epic. His singles were moderate hits that year, {{the biggest}} of them on either UA or Epic was a version of [...] "Spanish Eyes", which became a top-20 country hit. Rich appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie, Every Which Way but Loose, in which he performed the song [...] "I'll <b>Wake</b> <b>You</b> Up When I Get Home". This song hit number three on the charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records, and released a number-12 single, [...] "A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through" [...] {{in the fall of}} that year. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song [...] "Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream" [...] early in 1981, but Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight. For over a decade, Rich was silent, living off his investments in semiretirement and only playing occasional concerts. He also played a bit part in the 1981 movie Take This Job and Shove It which yielded his last charted single, [...] "You Made It Beautiful".|$|E

They tiptoed away; so I seen, easy enough, that they'd shoved {{in there}} to do up your majesty's room, or something, s'posing you was up; and found you WARN'T up, and so they was hoping to slide {{out of the way}} of trouble without <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> up, if they hadn't already <b>waked</b> <b>you</b> up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{some one}} {{knocking}} at the door outside," [...] she whispered. [...] "That is what <b>woke</b> <b>you.</b> I heard it several minutes ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ve {{pulled it}} fifty times myself before now," [...] said Joe, scathingly, [...] "and {{then had to}} climb over the gate and <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> up." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Sitting on {{sofa with}} her.] I am so sorry. I came in dreadfully late, and didn't like to <b>wake</b> <b>you.</b> You are crying, dear.|$|E
6000|$|She begged, [...] "I didn't mean to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> up, dear. And please don't smoke. You've been smoking so much. Please {{go back to}} sleep. I'm sorry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you sleep}} {{in a room with}} others, pin your money fast inside of your shirt. Then they can't get it without <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> up." ...|$|R
60|$|Trick. I dare be sworn 'twas in your sleep; for, when <b>you</b> are <b>waking,</b> <b>you</b> are {{the most}} honest, quiet bed-fellow, that ever lay by woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I do miss you, Will. But {{it will be}} {{pleasant}} to turn over in bed as often as I want to, without worrying about <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{daughter}} {{called you}} a god {{and you said}} that you knew we were coming to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> up, which is reading the future," [...] answered Bastin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! The vile beast," [...] he {{bellowed}} {{out in an}} unearthly tone {{which made}} the lantern jump and tremble! [...] "I shall <b>wake</b> <b>you!</b> Give me...give me..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to have had to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> up, Francis," [...] he said, {{stepping}} in; [...] "but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>woke</b> <b>you</b> up to ask {{you that}} question?" [...] Quest replied, [...] "but I guess it's pretty obvious. We might have saved the money we gave for those rifles in Port Said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's when you're sleeping. But when you're <b>waking,</b> <b>you</b> {{make people}} say {{just what you}} want. And that's why day dreams are so bad. If you make people say what you want, they {{probably}} don't mean it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Allen laughed. 'You'd be all right,' he said, 'if you weren't so beastly slow {{with your}} guard. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>wake</b> up? <b>You</b> hit like blazes.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not," [...] he answered. [...] "Just now I cannot talk any more. If my time {{comes in the}} night, I shall <b>wake</b> <b>you.</b> If not--to-morrow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fothergill {{has gone}} back to his hotel and Leonard went with him. I said I'd <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> and we'd follow directly, but I think I must have been dozing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know {{a little}} of these matters, and what you say shows me that you are under a herb enchantment--that is to say, {{that if you can}} find the herb whose smell <b>woke</b> <b>you</b> up the spell would be broken.' ...|$|R
60|$|Boy. O yes, sir; I {{forgot to}} tell you that: This morning a strange fellow, as ever eyes beheld, would needs come up to you, when you were asleep; but when he came down again, he said, he had not <b>waked</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "How are {{you getting}} through this long, dull afternoon, my dears? Quiet as mice till just now. What <b>woke</b> <b>you</b> up? A battle of the books? Alice looks {{as if she had}} laid in plenty of ammunition, and you were {{preparing}} to besiege her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{poured it}} over you to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> up. Don't {{you know you}} were making a noise with your nose?" [...] cried Martin {{at the top of}} his voice.|$|E

6000|$|I {{was sound}} asleep till the thumping of the drums set me fantastically [...] dreaming, and when I awoke I found they were real. Did they <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> [...] too, my dear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{eyes were}} quite {{enough to keep}} watch," [...] Dias said. [...] "I should have <b>waked</b> <b>you</b> if I had seen {{anything}} of the savages. Besides, Don Harry said {{you might as well}} go on sleeping if nothing happened, and I thought so too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-morning!" [...] {{came back}} in the rich, gentle voice of the Altrurian. I lifted my head with a jerk from the pillow, and saw him {{standing}} against the closed door, with my shoes in his hand. [...] "Oh, I am sorry I <b>waked</b> <b>you.</b> I thought--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Methinks," [...] said Nigel, [...] "I deserve more thanks than I have got, for rescuing {{you from}} such a danger by <b>waking</b> <b>you.</b> But, my pretty master, methinks all this tale of a tiger and a stag {{has little to do}} with your change of temper towards me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye had to {{be helped}} home last night, O'Grady, and it took Hoolan {{a quarter of an}} hour to <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> this morning. I heard him say, 'Now, master dear, the bugle will sound in a minute or two; it's <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> must, or there will be a divil of botheration over it.' I looked in, and there you were. Hoolan was {{standing}} by the side of you shaking his head gravely, as if it was a hopeless job that he had in hand, and if I had not emptied a water-bottle over you, you would never have been on parade in time." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the evening}} {{he called the}} prince and said: 'To-morrow I have no work for you, but when I <b>wake</b> <b>you</b> must come before my bed, and give me your hand in greeting.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “How could I <b>wake</b> <b>you,</b> {{when you}} didn’t wake me?” he retorted. “Now we shan’t {{get on the}} water till after twelve. I wonder you take the trouble {{to get up at}} all.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "According to my reckoning, mate, {{you have}} been asleep better'n five hours.

I would not have <b>waked</b> <b>you</b> till daybreak, but I found myself {{dropping}} off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't {{likely to}} come again--they hadn't any tools left to work with, {{and what was the}} use of <b>waking</b> <b>you</b> up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard at your house {{all the rest of the}} night. They've just come back." ...|$|R
