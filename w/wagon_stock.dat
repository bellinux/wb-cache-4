Chief White Eagle is shot during the scuffle, but Utah Joe escapes. LaCrosse is arrested and, under {{the threat of a}} firing squad, confesses that Utah Joe instigated the horse stealing at the fort, while he let loose the clever black stallion who opened the corral gate. LaCrosse also warns the caravan that Utah Joe is leading them into an ambush.|$|R

50|$|With further {{expansion}} of repair activities, a separate locomotive workshop was constructed at Dahod {{in the year}} 1928, thereby transferring all repair activities relating to locomotive repairs to Dahod workshop. Lower Parel and Mahalaxmi workshops were, therefore, left with carrying out repairs to coaching and <b>wagon</b> <b>stock.</b> In the year 1959, a separate wagon repair workshop was built at Kota. Repairs to the suburban electrical multiple stocks was progressively centralised at Mahalaxmi shop.|$|E
50|$|Open wagons form a {{large group}} of railway goods wagons {{designed}} primarily for the transportation of bulk goods that are not moisture-retentive and can usually be tipped, dumped or shovelled. The International Union of Railways (UIC) distinguishes between ordinary wagons (Class E/UIC-type 5) and special wagons (F/6). Open wagons often form a significant part of a railway company's goods wagon fleet; for example, forming just under 40% of the Deutsche Bahn's total goods <b>wagon</b> <b>stock</b> in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|They meet Kenny, {{his wife}} Katjaa {{and their son}} Kenny Jr. (nicknamed [...] "Duck") and head towards Macon; there, they find shelter with several other {{survivors}} in a drugstore that had been owned by Lee's family; the group are able to find escape and find safety in a motel with a defensible perimeter. Though protected from walkers, Lee and the survivors struggle to find food, and after three months, are at the last of their supplies. They are approached by the St. Johns, a family who own a nearby dairy. The group exchange gasoline to power the St. Johns' electric fence for food and shelter. However, while on the dairy, Lee discovers the St. Johns have engaged in cannibalism. The group escapes, leaving the St. Johns to their fate as the farm is overrun by walkers. On {{the way back to}} the motor inn, the group discovers an abandoned station <b>wagon</b> <b>stocked</b> full of provisions, which they take amongst themselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{workshop}} {{is spread}} over {{an area of}} around 14 Hectares {{in the heart of}} the city of Mumbai. The workshop was originally a Locomotive repair workshop during the British period and came up between the year 1870-76. The workshop was set up by the erstwhile BB&CIBombay Baroda and Central India Railway as a centralised workshop for BG locomotives, Railway passenger carriages and <b>wagon</b> <b>stock.</b> Later, as the repair activities were expanded with progressive increases in the holding of locomotives, coaches and wagons, a separate wagon repair workshop was set up at Mahalaxmi in 1910 as an extension to this workshop under its administrative setup.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{workshops}} on the North Central Railway. Wagon Repair Workshop, Jhansi deals with repairing of <b>wagon</b> <b>stock</b> of Indian Railways. It {{was established in}} 1895. Rail Spring Karkhana, Sithouli, deals with manufacturing of Coaching Stock springs as well as Locomotive springs. NCR also has an electric loco shed where damaged engine of Magadh Express has been modern technology to run Delhi-Howrah Duronto Express. The NCR has a total staff strength of 69,644. NCR {{in its effort to}} boost use of solar power under National Solar Mission has selected Vivaan Solar, a company from Gwalior to install a total of 1.5 MW rooftop solar power project at the wagon repair workshop of Jhansi Junction railway station. The company will install rooftop solar panels on production sheds and service buildings of the complex.|$|E
50|$|As of 2010, VSM has 19 steam {{locomotives}} and 22 diesel engines. Also over 20 {{passenger coaches}} and several goods <b>wagons.</b> The rolling <b>stock</b> is usually {{stationed at the}} VSM’s depot at Beekbergen.|$|R

50|$|A {{portable}} stock loading {{race and}} pen was constructed {{at the station}} by a local farmer in 1947 using materials provided by the Department. After difficulty was experienced with using the detachable race to load double-decker <b>stock</b> <b>wagons,</b> lifting equipment (including a hoist and winch) was provided in 1951.|$|R
50|$|The {{last quarter}} century of planned {{development}} of Indian Railways has witnessed extensive {{changes in the}} mode of traction as well as development of new types of coaches and wagons. Diesel and electric locomotives have gradually replaced steam locomotives. The number of passenger coaches in service has almost doubled. The <b>wagon</b> <b>stock</b> holding is roughly 2.5 times that in 1951. Financial limitations, however, did not permit development of maintenance facilities compatible with the growth of rolling stock. Only 5 new workshops have been set up since 1952. The increased demand for maintenance was largely catered by piece-meal expansion of the existing facilities. Expenditure on workshops in this period was less than 2.5% of the total plan outlay on the railways. Nevertheless, to meet the requirement of new rolling stock, three new production workshops were set up.|$|E
5000|$|For {{much of the}} company's {{life the}} {{locomotives}} were painted a light golden brown, often referred to by paintshop staff as [...] "autumn leaf" [...] or [...] "golden ochre". From 1922 the goods engines were painted dark brown, followed {{by the rest of}} the locomotives in 1929. The LNER painted the survivors black. Most of the carriages were ex-GNR and were varnished teak, but some of the older stock and rebuilds were painted and grained to look like teak. <b>Wagon</b> <b>stock</b> was generally brown oxide, the same colour as the GNR used, until 1917 when general stock under the common user agreement began to be painted grey. The number of M&GN wagons declined during the 1920s, and were eventually bought by the parent companies in 1928, leaving only service stock, which was painted red oxide. Under British Railways' control, carriages were often carmine and cream, then maroon.|$|E
50|$|In 1840 {{the need}} of a {{railroad}} became acute, as produce and supplies had to be hauled long distances by <b>wagon.</b> <b>Stock</b> was driven as far as St. Louis to market. Until {{the building of the}} railroad, the town had few settlers. A few adventurers had disposed of the deer and wolves and driven the Indians north- and west-ward. Life in the fifties and sixties was primitive. Winters were long, log cabins poorly heated. In December 1856, there came to Tacusah a remarkable man, Elisee E. Malhiot. With him came his brother Francis. He wished to found a Canadian colony of his friends and relatives-so, he induced 150 men, women and children from his early home to come to his settlement. He gave the name Assumption to his venture, in honor of his former Louisiana parish. Among the people from Canada were many mechanics and farmers. Soon, thirty or more houses were built. In 1858 Colonel Malhiot erected a large Flour mill. He brought sugar from his Louisiana plantation and sold it at wholesale prices to his neighbors. Marcus L. Barrett from Massachusetts was another factor in the town's growth. He first conducted a boarding house for men working on the railroad. In 1902 the village was incorporated as a city.|$|E
50|$|The line {{built its}} own rolling stock over the years, {{inspired}} by Heywood designs. There was {{a range of}} wagons for maintenance purposes including a ballast hopper, weedkiller tank, guards vans and open <b>wagons.</b> The passenger <b>stock</b> also varied from enclosed 4 wheel coaches to open sit astride trolleys.|$|R
6000|$|It was a {{spectacle}} that inspired Pan as never before. The wagons {{were lined up}} near the lake, their big white canvas tops shining in the afternoon sun, and higher on a bench stood the [...] "hoodelum" [...] or bed <b>wagon,</b> so <b>stocked</b> with bedrolls that it resembled a haystack. Beyond {{the margin of the}} lake, four hundred fine saddle horses grazed and kicked and bit at one another. Beyond the saddle horses grazed the day herd of cattle. And over on the other side dinned the melee over the main herd, the incessant riding, yelling of the cowboys and the bawling of the cows.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, {{control of}} {{the whole of the}} island passed to the Soviet Union, {{including}} the island's complete rail network and rolling <b>stock.</b> <b>Wagons</b> from the Soviet railways were re-gauged for use on the island. The locomotive factory in Lyudinovo produced diesel locomotives of the models TG16 and TG21 specifically for use on the island's narrow gauge network.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} nature and impact of path {{dependence}} in British rail coal haulage before 1939. It examines the factors which locked Britain's railways into a system of small coal wagons with highly fragmented ownership, the cost penalties of this system, and the reasons that attempts at modernization were unsuccessful. The analysis {{highlights the importance of}} decentralized ownership of a highly durable installed base of complementary infrastructure. Technical and institutional interrelatedness blocked incremental modernization, while the political requirement to compensate private wagon owners for the loss of their <b>wagon</b> <b>stock</b> made wholesale rationalization financially unattractive...|$|E
50|$|Following {{the type}} code in the {{classification}} code a letter may denote the type of coupler, nowadays optional, as all new freight cars are fitted with centre buffer couplers (CBC). An 'N' suffix is for 'pneumatic', or air-braked <b>wagons.</b> Most newer <b>stock</b> that is air-braked also has CBC couplers, so the 'C' is usually dropped. E.g., BOXN for air-braked BOX wagons, not BOXCN. Almost all the older stock is vacuum-braked.|$|R
