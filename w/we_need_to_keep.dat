Jayson Lipshutz of Billboard praised the interlude, writing [...] "We're all for birthday-themed naughtiness in pop music form, but only 78 seconds of 'Birthday Cake' {{is just not}} enough of a celebration!" [...] Lipshutz continued to compare the song's lyrical message to Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of [...] "Birthday Cake", writing, [...] "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long. 'Birthday Cake' is more decadent Rihanna filth, this time courtesy of sensual R The-Dream.

[...] Pip Ellwood of Entertainment-Focus noted that [...] "Birthday Cake", along with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", [...] "leave you under no misunderstanding that Rihanna is as sexual as she's ever been throughout her career."
