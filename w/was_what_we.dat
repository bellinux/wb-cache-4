500|$|The film {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. On 19 November 1978, the magazine Ananda Vikatan criticised {{the gaps in}} the film, particularly the abundance of English dialogue, the excessive focus on naturalism, and lower standard of technical work (especially the cinematography). Despite these perceived flaws, the magazine still appreciated the film, stating that the actors immersed themselves into their characters, leading to them not really acting before the camera but living the characters.

[...] Bourdon said the album was a {{challenge}} to complete; he said, [...] "We've been making music for a long time so one of the challenges was to evolve and make something to keep us interested and also {{have a lot of fun}} in the process. We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{first became}} {{involved}} with The Heart Truth awareness campaign in 2003. It is an organization established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women, and how to prevent the condition. She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a [...] "wake up call" [...] {{about the risk of}} heart disease. She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives." [...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|Seeking {{advice on}} the story, Hergé {{consulted}} his friend Bernard Heuvelmans, who had authored the non-fiction book L'Homme parmi les étoiles ("Man Among the Stars") (1944). In autumn 1947, Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke developed a script for the story, which they gave to Hergé. This version based Calculus' lunar expedition in a fictional location, Radio City, in the United States. It featured a return of Professor Decimus Phostle, a character who had previously appeared in The Shooting Star (1942), but this time as an antagonist; Phostle had sold {{the secrets of the}} mission in order to attain funds to buy a diamond for the actress Rita Hayworth. In early 1948, Hergé produced two black-and-white pages of this version of the story before abandoning it. Hergé retained some elements of this original script in his finished version, namely the scenes in which Haddock drinks whiskey in a gravity-free environment and that in which Haddock goes for a space walk and nearly becomes a satellite of Adonis, which appear on pages 5 and 8 of Explorers on the Moon. Nevertheless, Heuvelmans thought his influence on the story to be more significant, stating that [...] "In going through the two books we [...] really had the impression that it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had originally done at the beginning. In broad outline, that was it." ...|$|E

500|$|Oakley and Weinstein were {{appointed}} executive producers and showrunners {{of the seventh}} and eighth seasons. They were chosen partly {{because they had been}} with the show since the third season and understood many of its dynamics. The showrunner is responsible for overseeing all aspects of the show's production. Each episode takes ten months to produce, so the showrunner must [...] "oversee many different episodes in different stages of production all at the same time", with roles including head writer, making notes on the storyboards and working with the voice actors, animators, editors and composers. Oakley and Weinstein often set two script-rewriting rooms in motion at the same time, delegating leadership in the rooms to writers such as Steve Tompkins and David Cohen. Mirkin, who had suggested that the two take over, remained on the show in an advisory capacity, helping Oakley and Weinstein with technical aspects of the show such as editing and sound mixing. When they took over the series, they wanted many of the episodes to be realistic ones that focused more on the five members of the Simpson family and explored their feelings and emotions towards each other. They wanted to produce Treehouse of Horror episodes, episodes about Sideshow Bob, Itchy & Scratchy and several [...] "format-bending" [...] episodes such as [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield", for which Oakley wrote the Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers scene, the latter being his favorite character. They aimed for [...] "at least two episodes per season that 'pushed the envelope', [...] expanded the definition of what an episode could be." [...] This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced. Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored, such as divorce. Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices, and several of their guest stars were [...] "old grizzled men with distinctive voices" [...] such as R. Lee Ermey, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney. Oakley considered season three to be the single greatest comedic season of television ever produced and so attempted to recreate the feel of that season for the two he ran, focusing on stories with real emotions and situations, as well as some [...] episodes. Season three was their basis for Homer: [...] "We liked Homer the way he was {{in the second and third}} seasons. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> consciously used as our model. Dimwitted, loving, hyper-enthusiastic, creatively goofy, parody of the American father– drawn with real emotions, though admittedly amplified. This was exemplified in [...] "Mother Simpson", [...] "Lisa the Iconoclast", [...] "Diddly-Dum-Doodly", and a couple others. In some of the less reality-based episodes, i.e. the Beer Baron one– usually Swartzwelder's, we'd treat this stricture with a certain amount of latitude." ...|$|E

In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings. Drake then moved {{to one of the}} city's affluent neighbourhoods, Forest Hill, in 2000. When asked about the move to Forest Hill, Drake replied, [...] " [...] a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half.

2500|$|Hydrogen cyanide {{was first}} {{isolated}} from a blue pigment (Prussian blue) {{which had been}} known since 1704 but whose structure was unknown. It is now {{known to be a}} coordination polymer with a complex structure and an empirical formula of hydrated ferric ferrocyanide. In 1752, the French chemist Pierre Macquer made the important step of showing that Prussian blue could be converted to iron oxide plus a volatile component and that these could be used to reconstitute it. The new component <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now know as hydrogen cyanide. Following Macquer's lead, it was first prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name Blausäure (lit. [...] "Blue acid") because of its acidic nature in water and its derivation from Prussian blue. In English, it became known popularly as prussic acid.|$|E

2500|$|Setting {{time and}} [...] "early strength" [...] are {{important}} characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, [...] "natural" [...] cements, and [...] "artificial" [...] cements all rely upon their belite content for strength development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below , they contained no alite, {{which is responsible}} for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call today [...] "modern" [...] Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (e.g., Vicat and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at Northfleet, Kent was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were [...] "rule-of-thumb": Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln.|$|E
