50|$|In {{comparing}} {{wireless technologies}} subsea radio waves prefer shallow water and can cross the air/water/seabed boundaries easily. Subsea radio communication is generally limited to under 50m through seawater. Subsea radio waves are unaffected by turbidity, salinity and pressure gradients {{and also has}} a notable difference between acoustic and optical technologies in that radio waves can pass through the water-air and water-seabed boundaries easily. Subsea acoustics are efficient at long-range of up to 20 km and have relatively low power consumption for their range. Acoustic communication systems generally perform poorly in shallow water and complex environments and has a limited bandwidth. Subsea optical has an ultra-high bandwidth and a very short range. Subsea optical communication does not cross the water/air boundary and is susceptible to turbidity. Most under <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> networks choose acoustics as the medium for wireless transmission. Electromagnetic waves offer great merits for transmission in special under water environments. Applications for subsea wireless sensor technologies can include subsea wireless sensor networks (WSN) for production monitoring.

30|$|Instead of {{counting}} number of days, growers can improve water use efficiency by better timing their irrigation using soil <b>water</b> <b>sensors.</b> At present, {{many types of}} sensors that can provide real time continuous soil water data are available (Kallestad et al. 2006; Evett et al. 2009; Bittelli 2011; Pardossi and Incrocci 2011). About 57 % of the growers in the region use computers for farm business {{and many of these}} growers have access to internet (Kallestad et al. 2006). Soil water data from some of these inexpensive sensor systems can be downloaded wirelessly within the radio range (typically 1.6 – 4.8  km), making data acquisition much easier for busy growers.

Like all his projects, it was built to be roadworthy, and became Earl's personal automobile for two years after finishing its tour of the auto show circuit. With a body made of aluminium, magnesium, and fiberglass, it was powered by a supercharged 215 cuin L V8 able to run on gasoline (petrol) or methanol (like Indy roadsters of the period did), and had an unusually-placed rear-mounted Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission. This was later changed to a GM Hydramatic. In addition to its jet inspired design, the 1951 Le Sabre also featured numerous advanced features, including a 12-volt electrical system (most cars of the period were 6-volt), heated seats, electric headlights concealed behind the center oval [...] "jet intake", front bumper dagmars (later made famous on 1957-9 Cadillacs), a <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> to activate the power top, and electric lifting jacks integral to the chassis to aid tire changes.

50|$|Some filters, {{especially}} {{found on}} diesel engines, {{are of a}} bowl-like design which collect water in the bottom (as water is more dense than diesel). The water can then be drained off by opening a valve {{in the bottom of}} the bowl and letting it run out, until the bowl contains only diesel. Many fuel filters contain a <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> to signal to the engine control unit or directly to the driver (lamp on dashboard) if the water reach the warning level. It is especially undesirable for water in fuel to be drawn into a diesel engine fuel system, as the system relies on the diesel for lubrication of the moving parts, and if water gets into a moving part which requires constant lubrication (for example an injector valve), it will quickly cause overheating and unnecessary wear. This type of filter may also include a sensor, which will alert the operator when the filter needs to be drained.In proximity of the diesel fuel filter there might be a fuel heater to avoid the forming of paraffin wax (in case of low temperatures) inside the filtrating element which can stop the fuel flow to the engine.|$|E

40|$|Differentiation of {{solvents}} having similar physicochemical properties, such as ethanol and methanol, is {{an important}} issue of interest. However, without performing chemical analyses, discrimination between methanol and ethanol is highly challenging due to their similarity in chemical structure as well as properties. Here, we present a novel type of alcohol and <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> based on the subtle differences in interaction among solvent analytes, fluorescent organic molecules, and a mesoporous silica gel substrate. A gradual change in the chemical structure of the fluorescent diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives alters their interaction with the substrate and solvent analyte, which creates a distinct intermolecular aggregation of the DPP derivatives on the silica gel substrate depending on the solvent environment and produces a change in the fluorescence color and intensity as a sensory signal. The devised sensor device, which is fabricated with simple drop-casting of the DPP derivative solutions onto a silica gel substrate, exhibited a completely reversible fluorescence signal change with large fluorescence signal contrast, which allows selective solvent detection by simple optical observation with the naked eye under UV light. Superior selectivity of the alcohol and <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> system, which can clearly distinguish among ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and water, is demonstrated. clos...|$|E

40|$|Ablution is an {{essential}} practice as a Muslim {{because it is an}} abligatory required to perform prayer. A Muslim use approximately 5 litres of water per single ablution. Approximately, a Muslim use 25 litres of treated water to perform ablution. Islam categorized the used water produced from an ablution as Musta’mal water. Normally Musta'mal water will be left to flow into the drainage system. The accumulated amount of wasted water is significant when it is measured at a mosque or surau. The quality of Musta'mal water is far better than the typical quality of the waste water produced from washing activities because there were no oil, grease, soap and dirt except for small quantities of miccroorganisms. To overcome this problem, this study focused on the discussion of reusing ablution water based on Shari'ah law which {{led to the development of}} a system (or model) to reuse ablution water.

40|$|In {{this study}} a multi-objective {{optimization}} model is developed for <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> network design in water distribution systems. In this model the three criteria used {{for evaluating the}} performance of the <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> placement designed are directly used as the objectives of the optimization problem. These include minimizing the expected water volume contaminated, minimizing the expected time of detection and maximizing the detection likelihood. Due to the difficulty of determining sensor placement locations within thousands of junction combinations in the system, the sub-domain concept is introduced, which identifies a subset of junctions for candidate sensor locations. The sub-domains are determined using the roulette wheel method based on junction water demand values. The junctions with larger water demand have higher probabilities to be selected to the candidate sensor subset. For solution of the model an improved approach that is based on the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is used. The approach works over the sub-domain and the final Pareto optimal front is obtained through the sub-domain iteration process. The two water distribution systems provided in BWSN 2006 are chosen as examples to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} model and algorithm proposed. The impact of the non-detected scenarios in calculating objectives on the Pareto optimal front is also addressed in this study.

40|$|Underwater {{wireless}} sensor networks {{consist of}} {{a certain number of}} sensors and vehicles that interact to collect data and perform collaborative tasks. Designing energy-efficient routing protocols for this type of networks is essential and challenging because sensor nodes are powered by batteries, which are difficult to replace orrecharge, and because underwater communications are severely affected by network dynamics, large propagation delays and high error probability of acoustic channels In this paper, we propose EARQ, which is a novel routing protocol for under <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. It provides real-time, reliable delivery of a packet, while considering energy awareness. In EARQ, a node estimates the energy cost, delay and reliability of a path to the sink node, based only on information from neighboring nodes. Then, it calculates the probability of selecting a path, using the estimates. When packet forwarding is required, it randomly selects the next node. A path with lower energy cost is likely to be selected, because the probability is inversely proportional to the energy cost to the sink node. To achieve real-time delivery, only paths that may deliver a packet in time are selected. To achieve reliability, it may send a redundant packet via an alternate path, but only if it is a source of a packet. Experimental results show that EARQ is suitable for under <b>water</b> <b>sensor</b> networks, due to its capability for energy eficient, real-time,reliable communications...|$|E
