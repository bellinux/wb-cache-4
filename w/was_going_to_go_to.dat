5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. She {{was not going to be}} a fugitive, instead her husband <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E

500|$|Following an eleven-year hiatus {{producers}} asked Dennis {{to return}} to Neighbours for the 20th anniversary episodes. But their talks resulted in Dennis agreeing to return full-time. Alan Dale who played his on-screen father, Jim Robinson helped Dennis {{to make the decision}} to return. Dennis has since admitted that he made a mistake quitting Neighbours in 1992. He explained [...] "I was stupid. I thought I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood and conquer the world, and I didn't." [...] Dennis' return made Paul the only original character still appearing on Neighbours. The actor continued to publicise his commitment to staying on the show long-term.|$|E

5000|$|Outside of competitions, {{the term}} vert is not {{normally}} used. Instead, the {{specific type of}} ramp is denoted. So instead of saying [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ride vert," [...] one might say [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ride a half-pipe." [...] However, it would be correct to say [...] "in competitions, I usually ride vert," [...] in order to differentiate from other forms of competition (such as freestyle, park or street).|$|R
500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had kept me from [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Hell by mistake." ...|$|E
500|$|More than 1,000 viewers {{complained to}} ITV {{and more than}} 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and {{was not allowed to}} vote last and force a deadlock. A {{spokesperson}} for The X Factor explained: [...] "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [...] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [...] went back to her to clarify that it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a majority vote if she did that. [...] was unable to take the vote to deadlock as deadlock requires a valid active vote." [...] However, a Daily Mail poll of 6,890 people showed that 4,795 of them wanted Cole to be sacked for refusing to vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realized that Cole might abstain and decided in that if she did, they would go to a majority vote. After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Waissel received fewer votes than Cohen, meaning that if the result went to deadlock, Waissel would have been eliminated.|$|E

60|$|For {{an instant}} {{she was silent}} with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but {{something}} checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when {{it was simply a}} lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.|$|E
