40|$|The Ras proto-oncogenic proteins, prototypes of {{the small}} GTPases, work as {{molecular}} switches: they are active when bound to GTP and inactive when bound to GDP. A variety of evidence suggested that the Ras paradigm is not fully valid for the Rho-family of small GTPases. Indeed, permanent activation is not sufficient but it is rather the continuous oscillation between the GDP-bound and GTP-bound conformations (namely the GDP/GTP cycling or GTPase flux), that is required for Rho-GTPases to perform their biological functions and properly <b>coordinate</b> <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> reorganization. In our recent study, we show that Rac 1 needs to cycle between the GDP and GTP states in order to efficiently control cell motility. Similarly, it was previously reported that GDP/GTP cycling is required by RhoA for cytokinesis and by Cdc 42 for cell polarization. The future challenge is {{to understand why the}} GTPase flux is so important for the biological actions of Rho GTPases...|$|R

" By contrast, we show here that in melanomas invasiveness can be regulated epigenetically by the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, Mitf, via {{regulation of the}} DIAPH 1 gene encoding the diaphanous-related formin Dia 1 that promotes <b>actin</b> polymerization and <b>coordinates</b> the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> and microtubule networks at the cell periphery. Low Mitf levels lead to down-regulation of Dia 1, reorganization of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton,</b> and increased ROCK-dependent invasiveness, whereas increased Mitf expression leads to decreased invasiveness. Significantly the regulation of Dia 1 by Mitf also controls p 27 (Kip 1) -degradation such that reduced Mitf levels lead to a p 27 (Kip 1) -dependent G 1 arrest. Thus Mitf, via regulation of Dia 1, can both inhibit invasiveness and promote proliferation.

Tubulogenesis involves cell polarization and morphogenesis to specify the luminal, adhesive, and basal cell domains and to establish an open lumen. We explore a requirement for Talin, a cytoplasmic integrin adapter, during Drosophila melanogaster embryonic heart tube development. Talin marks the presumptive luminal domain and is required to orient and develop an open luminal space within the heart. Genetic analysis demonstrates that loss of zygotic or maternal-and-zygotic Talin disrupts heart cell migratory dynamics, morphogenesis, and polarity. Talin is essential for subsequent polarization of luminal determinants Slit, Robo, and Dystroglycan as well as stabilization of extracellular and intracellular integrin adhesion factors. In the absence of Talin function, mini-lumens enriched in luminal factors form in ectopic locations. Rescue experiments performed with mutant Talin transgenes suggest that actin-binding is required for normal lumen formation, but not for initial heart cell polarization. We propose that Talin provides instructive cues to position the luminal domain and <b>coordinate</b> the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> during Drosophila heart lumen development...|$|R

Activation of Rho GTPase signaling pathways requires the regulated release of Rho GTPases from RhoGDI complexes, followed by their reuptake after membrane cycling. We show here that Src kinase binds and phosphorylates RhoGDI both in vitro and in vivo at Tyr 156. Analysis of Rho GTPase–RhoGDI complexes using in vitro assays of complexation and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation analysis indicates that Src-mediated phosphorylation of Tyr 156 causes a dramatic decrease {{in the ability of}} RhoGDI to form a complex with RhoA, Rac 1, or Cdc 42. Phosphomimetic mutation of Tyr 156 →Glu results in the constitutive association of RhoGDIY 156 E with the plasma membrane and/or associated cortical actin. Substantial cortical localization of tyrosine-phosphorylated RhoGDI is also observed in fibroblasts expressing active Src, where it is most evident in podosomes and regions of membrane ruffling. Expression of membrane-localized RhoGDIY 156 E mutant is associated with enhanced cell spreading and membrane ruffling.

We show that growing microtubules can be captured and guided by stiff actin bundles, leading to global actin–microtubule alignment. Conversely, growing microtubule ends can transport, stretch and bundle individual actin filaments, thereby globally defining actin filament organization.

A lipid-binding assay revealed that pleckstrin- 2 binds with greatest affinity to D 3 and D 5 phosphoinositides. Pleckstrin- 2 expressed in Jurkat T cells bound to the cellular membrane and enhanced actin-dependent spreading only after stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor or the integrin α 4 β 1. A pleckstrin- 2 variant containing point mutations in both PH domains failed to associate with the Jurkat membrane and {{had no effect on}} spreading under the same conditions. Although still membrane bound, a pleckstrin- 2 variant containing point mutations in the DEP domain demonstrated a decreased ability to induce membrane ruffles and spread.

Although pleckstrin- 2 can bind to purified D 3 and D 5 phosphoinositides, the intracellular membrane association of pleckstrin- 2 and cell spreading are dependent on D 3 phosphoinositides, because these effects were disrupted by pharmacologic inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K).

Pharmacological inhibitors of PTKs and MAPKs and genetic interference with Src PTK and FAK functions caused a significant reduction of pIgR-mediated pneumococcal invasion but did not influence bacterial adhesion to host cells. Furthermore, pneumococcal ingestion by host cells induces activation of ERK 1 / 2 and JNK. In agreement with activated JNK, its target molecule and DNA-binding protein c-Jun was phosphorylated.

40|$|Abstract. Normal <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> {{organization}} in budding yeast requires {{the function of}} the Pan 1 p/ End 3 p complex. Mutations in PAN 1 and END 3 cause defects in the organization of <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> and endocytosis. By screening for mutations that can suppress the temperature sensitivity of a pan 1 mutant (pan 1 - 4), a novel serine/threonine kinase Prk 1 p is now identified as a new factor regulating the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> {{organization in}} yeast. The suppression of pan 1 - 4 by prk 1 requires the presence of mutant Pan 1 p. Although viable, the prk 1 mutant is unable to maintain an asymmetric distribution of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> at 37 �C. Consistent with its role in the regulation of <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton,</b> Prk 1 p localizes to the regions of cell growth and coincides with the polarized actin patches. Overexpression of the PRK 1 gene in wild-type cells leads to lethality and <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> abnormalities similar to those exhibited by the pan 1 and end 3 mutants. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrate that Prk 1 p is able to phosphorylate regions of Pan 1 p containing the LxxQxTG repeats, including the region responsible for binding to End 3 p.

This thesis aims {{to provide a more}} in depth understanding of chondrocyte biomechanics by focusing on the role of <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in {{the response of}} chondrocytes to mechanical loading. Novel single cell in vitro experiments in tandem with finite element simulations using a 3 D active modelling formulation, incorporating <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> remodelling and contractility, are performed. Experimentally, single chondrocytes are subjected to shear deformation by a horizontally moving probe. Untreated chondrocytes containing a contractile <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> exhibit a distinctive force-indentation curve whereby force increases rapidly upon initial probe contact, followed by a yield point and a reduced rate of force increase. In contrast, cells in which the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> has been disrupted exhibit a linear force-indentation curve, with measured forces being significantly lower that for untreated cells. Simulations using the active 3 D framework reveal that the distinctive response of untreated cells to applied shear is due to the yielding of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in tensile regions of the cell and dissociation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in compressive regions of the cell. In contrast, a simple passive hyperelastic model is sufficient to predict the linear force-indentation curve for cells in which the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> has been disrupted. Disruption of intermediate filaments and microtubules did not alter the distinctive force-indentation curve observed for untreated cells, further highlighting the critical role of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in chondrocyte biomechanics. The 3 D active modelling framework is also implemented to investigate the increased probe force required to detach spread chondrocytes form a flat substrate. Simulations reveal that spread cells with a flattened morphology have a more highly developed <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> than rounded cells. Rounded cells provide less support for tension generated by the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton,</b> hence a high level of dissociation is predicted. As a result of the higher level of <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in the cytoplasm of spread cells, significantly higher detachment forces are computed than for round cells, as observed in the experimental study of Huang et al. (2003). Furthermore, the biomechanical response of chondrocytes in situ, and in particular, the response of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> to physiological and abnormal strain loading is investigated. Simulations predict that the presence of a focal defect significantly affects cellular deformation, increases the stress experienced by the nucleus, and alters the distribution of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> It is also demonstrated that during dynamic loading, cyclic tension reduction in the cytoplasm leads to continuous dissociation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> In contrast, significant changes in cytoplasm tension are not predicted during static loading, and hence the rate of dissociation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> is reduced. The combined modelling-experimental approach presented in this thesis provides new insight into the role of the active contractility and remodelling of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in the response of chondrocytes to mechanical loading.

Multiple pathways were significantly impacted in AuNR-treated MDA-MB- 231 cells, including Huntington’s disease, ribosome, spliceosome, pathways in cancer, RNA degradation, endocytosis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, apoptosis, insulin signaling pathway, regulation of <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton,</b> etc. As energy production and the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> {{are closely related to}} the chemoattractant activity of metastatic cancer cells, we further analyzed the glycolysis pathway and the regulation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> pathway in AuNR-treated MDA-MB- 231 cells.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cells {{sense and}} physiologically respond to {{environmental}} stress via signaling pathways. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells respond to cell wall stress by transiently depolarizing the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> We report that cell wall stress also induces a transient depolarized {{distribution of the}} cell wall biosynthetic enzyme glucan synthase FKS 1 and its regulatory subunit RHO 1, possibly as a mechanism to repair general cell wall damage. The redistribution of FKS 1 {{is dependent on the}} <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> Depolarization of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> and FKS 1 is mediated by the plasma membrane protein WSC 1, the RHO 1 GTPase switch, PKC 1, and a yet-tobe defined PKC 1 effector branch. WSC 1 behaves like a signal transducer or a stress-specific actin landmark that both controls and responds to the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} role of lipid rafts and <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in CD 99 -mediated {{signaling}} to elucidate the mechanism of protein transport upon CD 99 engagement. CD 99 engagement in Jurkat cells elicited the exocytic transport of GM 1 {{as well as several}} surface molecules closely related with CD 99 functions. In addition, CD 99 molecules were rapidly incorporated into lipid rafts and appeared to rearrange the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> upon CD 99 stimulation. Association of CD 99 with <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> was inhibited by methyl-β-cyclodextrin, while CD 99 -mediated GM 1 clustering was inhibited by cytochalasin D. Therefore, we suggest that CD 99 {{may play a role in}} the vesicular transport of transmembrane proteins and lipid rafts from the intracellular location to the cell surface, possibly by effecting <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> reorganization...|$|R
40|$|The <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in root hair development. It is involved in both the delivery of growth materials to the expanding tip of root hairs and the regulation of the area of tip growth. This review starts with a discussion of the techniques that are available to visualize the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in fixed and in live root hair cells, including their advantages and drawbacks. We discuss the function that the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> performs during tip growth of root hairs, focusing first on filamentous actin organization during root hair development and the response of root hairs to the rhizobial signal molecule Nod factor, which reveals the function of actin in root hair elongation. In addition, we discuss the role of actin binding proteins in organizing the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> Image...|$|R

The dynamic regulation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> during hypoxia is complex, varies in different cells and tissues, and also depends on the mode of hypoxia. Several molecular players and pathways are emerging {{that contribute to the}} modulation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> and that affect the large repertoire of actin-binding proteins in hypoxia. This review describes and discusses the accumulated knowledge about <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> dynamics in hypoxia, placing special emphasis on the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases (Rho GTPases). Given that RhoA, Rac and Cdc 42 are very well characterized, the review is focused on these family members of Rho GTPases. Notably, in several cell types and tissues, hypoxia, presumably via Rho GTPase signaling, induces actin rearrangement and actin stress fiber assembly, which is a prevalent modulation of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in hypoxia.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> has previously been investigated using both experimental and computational techniques. However, these investigations have not elucidated the role the cytoskeleton plays in the compression resistance of cells. The present study combines experimental compression techniques with active modeling of the cell 2 ̆ 7 s <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> A modified atomic force microscope is used to perform whole cell compression of osteoblasts. Compression tests are also performed on cells following the inhibition of the cell <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> using cytochalasin-D. An active bio-chemo-mechanical model is employed to predict the active remodeling of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> The model incorporates the myosin driven contractility of stress fibers via a muscle-like constitutive law. The passive mechanical properties, in parallel with active stress fiber contractility parameters, are determined for osteoblasts. Simulations reveal that the computational framework is capable of predicting changes in cell morphology and increased resistance to cell compression due to the contractility of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> It is demonstrated that osteoblasts are highly contractile and that significant changes to the cell and nucleus geometries occur when stress fiber contractility is removed...|$|R
40|$|Normal cell {{growth and}} {{division}} in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae involve dramatic and frequent changes {{in the organization of}} the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> Previous studies have suggested that the reorganization of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> in accordance with cell cycle progression is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc 28. Here we report that by isolating rapid-death mutants in the background of the Start-deficient cdc 28 - 4 mutation, the essential yeast gene PAN 1, previously thought to encode the yeast poly(A) nuclease, is identified as a new factor required for normal organization of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton.</b> We show that at restrictive temperature, the pan 1 mutant exhibited abnormal bud growth, failed to maintain a proper distribution of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton,</b> was unable to reorganize <b>actin</b> the <b>cytoskeleton</b> during cell cycle, and was defective in cytokinesis. The mutant also displayed a random pattern of budding even at permissive temperature. Ectopic expression of PAN 1 by the GAL promoter caused abnormal distribution of the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> when a single-copy vector was used. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the Pan 1 protein colocalized with the cortical actin patches, suggesting that it may be a filamentous actin-binding protein. The Pan 1 protein contains an EF-hand calcium-binding domain, a putative Src homology 3 (SH 3) -binding domain, a region similar to the <b>actin</b> <b>cytoskeleton</b> assembly control protein Sla 1, and two repeats of a newly identified protein motif known as the EH domain. These findings suggest that Pan 1, recently recognized as not responsible for the poly(A) nuclease activity (A. B. Sachs and J. A. Deardorff, erratum, Cell 83 : 1059, 1995; R. Boeck, S.
