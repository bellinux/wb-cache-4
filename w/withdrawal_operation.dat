5000|$|The {{withdrawal}} of Soviet military forces began on May 15 1988, {{under the leadership}} of General of the Army Valentin Varennikov (with General Gromov commanding the 40th Army directly). As agreed, the withdrawal was [...] "front-loaded", with half of the Soviet force leaving by August. The withdrawal was complicated, however, by the rapid deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan. While the US was not bound to stop arms shipments, and continued to supply the mujahideen in Pakistan, Pakistan did not deliver on its commitment to prevent weaponry and troops from flowing into Afghanistan. The mujahideen also continued their attacks on withdrawing Soviet forces. The Soviet Union repeatedly reported these violations of the Geneva Accords to UN monitoring bodies, and even pleaded with the US to influence the factions they supplied. The desire of the Soviet Union to withdraw, however, coupled with the United States' inability to control the behaviour of the mujahideen, meant that the Soviet objections did not bring any results. The following conversation between a Soviet diplomat and the CIA Islamabad station chief (as told by the latter in a book he co-authored), is cited by Kalinovsky: [...] Botshan-Kharchenko: You must understand, Mr. Buurdon, that these attacks against our troops as they withdraw must stop. Bearden: And if they don’t? Botshan-Kharchenko: Then perhaps we will halt our withdrawal. Then what will you do? Bearden: It is not what I will do, Counselor; it is what the Afghans will do. And I think they will simply keep on fighting and killing your soldiers until you finally just go home. Botshan-Kharchenko: But you have some control over such matters. Bearden: No one has control over such matters, Counselor, except the Soviet Union. Botshan-Kharchenko: Mr. Buurdon, you must still understand that there will be consequences if these attacks continue. Bearden: I am sure there will be, Counselor. [...] As the Soviet withdrawal and rebel attacks continued, the deteriorating security of the Najibullah government caused policy disagreements between the different services of the Soviet Union. For example: while the Soviet military had succeeded in establishing a de-facto cease-fire with Ahmad Shah Massoud's forces as Soviet troops withdrew through territories under his control, the KGB and Shevarnadze attempted to convince Gorbachev that an attack on Massoud was necessary to guarantee Najibullah's survival. In the words of Soviet military commanders, Najibullah himself also aimed to retain the Soviet military in Afghanistan - Generals Varennikov (in charge of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>operation),</b> Gromov (commander of the 40th Army), and Sotskov (chief Soviet military advisor in Afghanistan) all pleaded with top Soviet military and political leadership to control Najibullah's attempts to use Soviet troops to achieve his own security, and to convey to him that the Soviet military would not stay in Afghanistan. After the departure of Yakovlev from the Politburo in the fall of 1988, Gorbachev adopted the Shevarnadze-KGB line of policy regarding supporting Najibullah at the cost of antagonising rebel factions, and a halt of the withdrawal was ordered on November 5, 1988. In December, Gorbachev decided to resume the withdrawal, but also to carry out an operation against Massoud, ignoring arguments from his advisors and military commanders on the ground. In January of 1989, the Soviet withdrawal continued, and on January 23 Operation Typhoon began against the forces of Ahmad Shah Massoud.Up {{until the end of the}} military withdrawal, Shevarnadze and the head of the KGB unsuccessfully attempted to convince Gorbachev to retain a contingent of Soviet military volunteers in Afghanistan to defend land routes to Kabul. On February 15, the 40th Army finished their withdrawal from Afghanistan. General Gromov walked across the [...] "Bridge of Friendship" [...] between Afghanistan and the USSR last. It is interesting to note that when Gromov was met by Soviet TV crews while crossing the bridge, he swore at them profusely when they tried to interview him. Recalling the events in an interview with a Russian newspaper in 2014, Gromov said that his words were directed at [...] "the leadership of the country, at those who start wars while others have to clean up the mess." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to remove {{information}} from an agent's stock of beliefs is of paramount concern in the belief change literature. An inquiring agent may remove beliefs for a variety of reasons: a belief may be called into doubt or the agent may simply wish to entertain other possiblities. In the prominent AGM framework [1, 8] for belief change, upon which the work here is based, one of the three central operations, contraction, addresses this concern (the other two deal with the incorporation of new information). Makinson [23] has generalised this work by introducing the notion of a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>operation.</b> Underlying the account proffered by AGM is the idea of rational belief change.

40|$|Abstract Semi-contraction is a <b>withdrawal</b> <b>operation</b> {{defined by}} Fermé in “On {{the logic of}} theory change: Contraction without recovery. ” In this paper we propose: (1) an axiomatic {{characterization}} of semi-contraction; (2) an alternative construction for semi-contraction based on semi-saturatable sets, inspired by Levi’s saturatable sets; (3) {{a special kind of}} semi-contraction that satisfies the Lindström and Rabinowicz interpolation thesis. 1 Introduction Recovery is the postulate of the AGM account of belief contraction that provokes most criticism (see Alchourrón and Makinson [3] and Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson [1]). According to recovery, so much is retained after contraction that everything can be recovered by adding the contracted sentence again. This may therefore be interpreted as a principle of minimal loss of information. However, this simple principle provokes nonintuitive results and, consequently, several authors reject it. Contraction functions that satisfy the AGM basic contraction postulates except recovery have been dubbed withdrawal functions (See Makinson [17]). Levi ([14], pp. 80 – 81, p. 123) has argued that measures of information should be replaced by measures of informational value, 1 and proposed an alternative construction. Another important withdrawal function, severe withdrawal, was introduced by Rott in [21] and Rott and Pagnucco in [23]. Hansson [12] noted that severe withdrawal satisfies the implausible property of expulsiveness (if ̸ ⊢ α and ̸ ⊢ β, then either K−β ̸ ⊢ α or K−α ̸ ⊢ β). Lindström and Rabinowicz [16] abstained from recommending either a particularly expulsive contraction (severe withdrawal) or a particularly retentive one (AGM contraction). They argued that these extremes should be taken as “upper ” and “lower ” bounds and that any “reasonable ” contraction function should be situated between them. This condition was called the Lindström and Rabinowicz interpolation thesis [22]...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we take {{advantage}} of the concepts developed for centralized module management, such as dynamic loading and unloading of modules, and show how they can be used to support the development and deployment of distributed applications. We do so through R-OSGi, a distributed middleware platform that extends the centralized, industrystandard OSGi specification to support distributed module management. To the developer, R-OSGi looks like a conventional module management tool. However, at deployment time, R-OSGi can be used to turn the application into a distributed application by simply indicating where the different modules should be deployed. At run time, R-OSGi represents distributed failures as module insertion and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>operations</b> so that the logic to deal with failures is the same as that employed to deal with dependencies among software modules.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to demonstrate limnological responses to a change in reservoir discharge from a predominantly surface withdrawal in 1991 to a hypolimnetic withdrawal in 2003. BACKGROUND: Control of reservoir discharge regime and flushing of different strata may be a viable means of improving water quality in Corps of Engineers reservoirs. For instance, a hypolimnetic withdrawal can be effective in removing internal phosphorus (P) loads from the system that would otherwise subsidize algal growth (Nürnberg 1987, Nürnberg et al. 1987). However, cold-water releases can also decrease thermal stability, making a reservoir more susceptible to mixing and vertical entrainment of nutrients, particularly from riverine interflows (Stauffer and Armstrong 1984, Gaugush 1984, Effler et al. 1986). In contrast, discharging primarily from the surface of a reservoir can result in strengthened thermal stability, reducing the potential for vertical entrainment of hypolimnetic nutrients for algal uptake. Increased flushing rates in the epilimnion may also be effective in removing algal populations from the system at a greater rate than their doubling time (Pridmore and McBride 1984, Soballe and Kimmel 1987). The objective {{of this research was}} to compare limnological responses of a Corps reservoir to changes in its withdrawal regime from predominantly surface discharge to hypolimnetic discharge during the summer period in order to explore the possibility of using selective withdrawal as a rehabilitation technique for reducing nuisance algae.

A previous prototype system, ``X- 330 Tails Cylinder Assay Monitor,`` was {{developed as a}} demonstration for the tails withdrawal station at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS).

An average value for a 1 -h period is then calculated by area control room personnel and assigned to the accumulated weight in the cylinder for the period. A potential problem with this method is that cylinder weight is not automatically recorded as often as the assay. The assay and withdrawal rate can both vary during the given period. This variation results in inaccuracies in the hourly weighted assays that are used to calculate the final weighted assay of the cylinder. Laboratory analysis is considered to be the most accurate method for determining the final cylinder assay; however, the cost and safety considerations of redundant cylinder handling limit the number of cylinders sampled to less than 10 %...|$|R
