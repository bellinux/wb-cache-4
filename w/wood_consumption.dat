Scenarios were analyzed with USFPM/GFPM ranging from a baseline 48 % increase to a 173 % increase in annual U.

Proportion estimates were tested by using a classical two-tail test of hypothesis. Subsequently, factors were identified and used in a multiple regression analysis. The study found that low income households equipped with electric space heating systems located in rural areas are the most wood intensive.

An Australian study of real-life emissions from woodheaters satisfying the current Australian standard, found that particle emissions averaged 9.4 g/kg wood burned (range 2.6 to 21.7). A heater with average <b>wood</b> <b>consumption</b> of 4 tonnes per year therefore emits 37.6 kg of PM2.5, i.e. particles less than 2.5 micrometers.

Specifically, the study aimed at examining the current status of <b>wood</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> in the study area, identifying the effects on the environment as a result of <b>wood</b> fuel <b>consumption</b> and assessing the effectiveness of measures taken to enhance sustainability of forest resources in the study area. Data were collected using questionnaire survey, interview with key informants and documentary review. Descriptive statistics, regression model and content analysis were used to analyze the collected data. The findings of this study indicate that, woodfuel is the main source of energy whereas almost 97 % of respondents use woodfuel for cooking. Annual woodfuel consumption in the selected villages was 18525 m 3 and per capita consumption was 2. 5 m 3 m. Household size was noted to have influenced the woodfuel consumption at the household level. Results of this study also indicaie that the minimum time spent by the respondents was 0. 5 hour and maximum time was 3 hours per one trip. In addition, 05 kilometer was a minimum distance and the maximum distance was 5 kilometers covered per trip. This implies that, 16 % of the production time is spent on firewood collection or looking for charcoal and hence reduce the time for production and also affects the time of children going to school. Effects of woodfuel consumption were reported to have accelerated deforestation, land degradation and climate change. It is therefore recommended that concerted efforts should be put in place as among the many effective mechanisms for ensuring sustainable energy supply in the area. Among the initiatives to be carried out may include diversification of source of energy, intensifying agroforestry farming system and provision of environmental educatio...|$|R
