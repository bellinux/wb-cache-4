25|$|According to the OFAC, this {{sanction}} {{was part}} of a joint effort with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles to work with the Mexican government. The intention of this sanction was to dismantle Los Cuinis' business network and uncover the businesses that were operating illegally with drug money invested in the economy. The U.S. government first heard of Hotelito Desconocido through a <b>wire</b> <b>tap</b> phone conversation Abigael had with Diana María Sánchez Carlón, one of his financial assistants. In that conversation, Abigael asked her how his hotel was doing, prompting the U.S. government to investigate what he was referring to exactly. Sánchez Carlón was introduced to Abigael by Jennifer Beaney Camacho Cázares, a close friend of hers and wife of Abigael. Both Sánchez Carlón and Camacho Cázares were sanctioned through the Kingpin Act for their alleged role in money laundering.|$|E

40|$|A {{recent and}} {{carefully}} documented study of <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> concluded that although it 2 ̆ 2 {{is a crime}} in almost every state, and {{although there is a}} federal law prohibiting the interception and divulging of the contents of telephone communications, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> is carried on virtually unimpeded in the United States today. 2 ̆ 2 This state of affairs is the culmination of many years of <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> history. Except for a one year interlude during World War I, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> was a common practice {{both in and out of}} government until 1924 when Attorney General Stone banned tapping by the FBI as 2 ̆ 2 unethical tactics. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 The Stone policy continued in the Department of Justice until 1931 when Attorney General Mitchell announced that the Department would approve <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> when requested by the director of the bureau concerned. For the next nine years the Department of Justice countenanced <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> but only in criminal cases of 2 ̆ 2 extreme importance 2 ̆ 2 and never 2 ̆ 2 in minor cases nor on Members of Congress, or officials, or any citizen except where charge of a grave crime had been lodged against him. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Finally, in 1940, after the Department had lost three test cases under Section 605 of the Federal Communications Act, Attorney General Jackson announced a return to the Stone policy of 1924 forbidding <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> by the FBI. 2 ̆ 2 Under the existing state of the law and decisions, 2 ̆ 2 Jackson concluded, <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> 2 ̆ 2 cannot be done unless Congress sees fit to modify the existing statutes. 2 ̆ 2 But this policy of prohibition lasted for less than a year. In March, 1941, in a letter to the House Judiciary Committee urging the adoption of pending <b>wire</b> <b>tapping</b> legislation, Attorney General Jackson reversed himself with the pronouncement that the 2 ̆ 2 only offense under the present law [Section 605] is to intercept any communication and divulge or publish the same. Any person, with no risk of penalty, may <b>tap</b> telephone <b>wires...</b> and act upon what he hears or make any use of it that does not involve divulging or publication. 2 ̆...|$|R

500|$|A state {{grand jury}} indicted Cisneros, Martínez, Garza, Olivarez, and Puentes Pizaña on July 28, 1993. Defense {{attorneys}} {{said they wanted}} to move the trial out of Cameron County because the case had attracted a lot of media attention in the local area. Martínez' defense attorney said he wanted to file a motion to change the venue, and have his client tried separately from the other accused. He also said that he would try to suppress a statement made by Martínez after she was arrested in April. On August 12, in a packed courtroom at the 357th State District Court house in Brownsville, Cisneros and Martínez pleaded not guilty to the murder charges. Garza also entered a not-guilty plea, and stood with the accused during the court session. The judge agreed to remove [...] "La Curandera" [...] (Healer-Fortune Teller) from Martínez' name on the indictment after the defense complained that the alias was a media creation. The judge set the hearing date for pre-trial motions for October 7, and the trial for November 8. On September 20, defense attorneys for Martínez and Garza filed motions to suppress statements their clients had made since March. Martínez's attorney said she did not understand her right to have a lawyer because she is not fluent in English, and that her arrest was unlawful. The defense asked the judge to discard the video and <b>wire</b> <b>tap</b> recordings because they claimed that their client was involuntarily coerced to make statements that incriminated her, and thus violated the Miranda warnings. Martínez' defense requested a court-appointed translator, the elimination of the indictment, and a severance to have their client tried separately. In addition, Garza's defense said that their client's constitutional rights were violated when he made his statements. They also said that Garza's encounter with Martínez after Fischer's murder was recorded without his knowledge.|$|E
