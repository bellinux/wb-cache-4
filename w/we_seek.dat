25|$|Dilthey {{strongly}} rejected using a model formed {{exclusively from}} the natural sciences (Naturwissenschaften), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> to understand {{in terms of the}} relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist Max Weber. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (Verstehen) could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of aesthetics in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|We {{prefer to}} look upon science and {{religion}} as separate domains which need not be in serious conflict and, therefore, need no reconciliation.

25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{norepinephrine}} cause {{an increase in}} reward dependence. When produced in normal levels, norepinephrine creates a sense of well-being, but low levels of norepinephrine cause symptoms of depression, lack of arousal and lack of motivation. In humans, this leads to then a negative feedback mechanism whereby <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> out pleasurable activities to remove the negative affect caused by the low levels of norepinephrine, therefore increasing our reward dependence.|$|E

25|$|We felt keenly {{that while}} the miraculous events of the {{founding}} of the State of Israel had found fitting expression {in the other Conservative siddurim} the more difficult experience of the Holocaust had yet to find an appropriate place in our prayers, Therefore, we composed a Nahum prayer for Yom Ha-shoah, inspired by that which appeared in Siddur Va-ani Tefillati of the Masorti Movement in 1998. In an insert into the Amidah, similar to that used traditionally on Tisha B'Av, <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> God's comfort in light of our people's losses in Europe during the Holocaust. We felt the need, beyond that, to acknowledge on a daily basis the enormous effect that the Holocaust has had upon our people. At the end of Tahanun papers, in a prayer which reflects our suffering, we added reference to the anguish we still feel.|$|E

In his annual State of the Union address to Congress of January 6, 1941, which was delivered {{at a time when}} Nazi Germany occupied much of Western Europe, he asked the American citizens to support war efforts in various ways. He stated his vision of a better future, founded upon four freedoms: [...] "In the future days which <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms," [...] some traditional and some new ones: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.|$|E

This project was treated with great suspicion in the House of Commons, and Fuller {{took the lead in}} opposing it. Although he used racist language, saying in December 1606 that [...] "the Scots in other countries are more like pedlars than merchants", this was aimed at drumming up support from xenophobic elements, and Wright concludes he was not himself a xenophobe. His main concern, rather, was over economic issues. Fuller argued that the Scottish merchants would undercut and impoverish English ones, and that the markets could not handle such an influx, saying that it was [...] "fit that <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> room to place them ...|$|E

500|$|Tony's doomed quest in the Brazilian jungle {{is framed}} in biblical terms; the {{relevant}} chapter title, [...] "In Search of a City" [...] alludes to Hebrews 13:14: [...] "For {{here we have}} no continuing city, but <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> one to come". However, Waugh remarked of the novel that it was [...] "humanist, and said all I wanted to say about humanism". He believed that the essential 20th century conflict was between Christianity and Chaos, and chose to present a chaotic world to demonstrate that civilisation did not have in itself the power to survive. Thus, in the Brazilian jungle, Tony encounters what Davis terms [...] "power without grace... secular feudalism unredeemed by the saving grace of Christianity". Todd is the symbol of humanist, irreligious power.|$|E
500|$|Newly {{elected to}} a mining seat, Benn was a {{supporter}} of the 1984–85 UK miners' strike, which was beginning {{when he returned to the}} Commons, and of his long-standing friend, the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill. However, some miners considered Benn's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike; firstly, that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a [...] "regional matter" [...] in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been. Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984, saying: [...] "The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers, nor do <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism. We are working for a majority labour government, elected on a socialist programme, as decided by conference." [...] This guest appearance was considered one reason why Benn did not become a member of Labour's Shadow Cabinet.|$|E
500|$|Sims said Victoria's {{suffering}} {{was shown}} to make the viewer sympathise with her, but noted it is difficult because she committed an unforgivable crime, although her mental state is not entirely clear {{because of the fact}} [...] "her mind has been erased so many times that the crime is barely a memory." [...] Lambie stated it was done to explore [...] "how human empathy breaks down when individuals are reduced to an image on a screen", and concluded, [...] "whether it's directed at the innocent or the guilty, cruelty is still cruelty". Atad asserted it ultimately lead viewers to choose between their [...] "so-called justice and the competing value of empathy". Writing for Sabotage Times, Gareth Dimelow concluded it leaves the viewer to ponder: [...] "If someone has no recollection of their crimes, can they be effectively punished? Does our societal bloodlust for vengeance make us just as dangerous as the criminals <b>we</b> <b>seek</b> to discipline?" [...] GamesRadar's Richard Edwards found that Brooker was able to present a [...] "morally complex idea" [...] without taking a side on the discussion. Sancto felt the episode [...] "plays with the viewer's emotions ... making it all the more difficult to find a moral stance on her story in the end".|$|E
