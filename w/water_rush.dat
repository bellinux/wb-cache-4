60|$|Swankie pulled, and {{the boat}} swept round with its bow to the east {{just in time to}} meet a billow, which, towering high above its fellows, burst {{completely}} over the rocks, and appeared to be about to sweep away all before it. For a moment the boat was as if embedded in snow, then it sank once more into the lead among the floating tangle, and the men pulled with might and main in order to escape the next wave. They were just in time. It burst over the same rocks with greater violence than its predecessor, but the boat had gained the shelter of the next ledge, and lay floating securely in the deep, quiet pool within, while the men rested on their oars, and watched the chaos of the <b>water</b> <b>rush</b> harmlessly by.|$|E
6000|$|I {{walked down}} to her and we then {{exchanged}} our few and only words. How beautiful the sea was, and how delightful to watch the waves coming in! I remarked. She smiled and replied that it was very, very beautiful. Then a bigger wave came and compelled us to step hurriedly back to save our feet from a wetting, and we laughed together. Just at that spot {{there was a small}} rock on which I stepped and asked her to give me her hand, so that we could stand together and let the next wave rush by without wetting us. [...] "Oh, do you think I may?" [...] she said, almost frightened at such an adventure. Then, after a moment's hesitation, she put her hand in mine, and we stood on the little fragment of rock, and she watched the <b>water</b> <b>rush</b> up and surround us and break on the beach with a fearful joy. And after that wonderful experience she had to leave me; she had only been allowed out by herself for five minutes, she said, and so, after a grateful smile, she hurried back.|$|E

60|$|Tearing {{away the}} sand on either side, floods of fresh <b>water</b> <b>rush</b> out furiously against floods of salt water leaping in, upheaved into mighty waves by the winter gale. A foaming roaring battle between two {{opposing}} {{forces of the}} same element takes place. The noise is terrific--it is heard like thunder, at great distances off. At last, the heavy, smooth, continuous flow of the fresh water prevails even over {{the power of the}} ocean. Farther and farther out, rushing through a wider and wider channel every minute, pour the great floods from the land, until the salt water is stained with an ochre colour, over a surface of twenty miles. But their force is soon spent: soon, the lake sinks lower and lower away from the slope of the hills. Then, with the high tide, the sea reappears triumphantly, dashing and leaping, in clouds of spray, through the channel in the sand--making the waters of the Pool brackish--now, threatening to swell them anew to overflowing--and now, at the ebb, leaving them to empty themselves again, {{in the manner of a}} great tidal river. No new change takes place, until a storm from the south-west comes on; and then, fresh masses of sand and shingle are forced up--the channel is refilled--the bar is reconstructed as if by a miracle. Again, the scene resumes its old features--again, there is a sea on one side, and a lake on the other. But now, the Pool occupies only its ordinary limits--now, the mill-wheels turn busily once more, and the smooth paths and gliding streams reappear in their former beauty, until the next winter rains shall come round, and the next winter floods shall submerge them again.|$|E
60|$|Another experiment, {{showing that}} {{extremely}} minute particles {{act on the}} glands when immersed in water, may here be given. A grain of sulphate of quinine was added to an ounce of water, which was not afterwards filtered; and on placing three leaves in ninety minims of this fluid, I was much {{surprised to find that}} all three leaves were greatly inflected in 15 m.; for I knew from previous trials that the solution does not act so quickly as this. It immediately occurred to me that the particles of the undissolved salt, which were so light as to float about, might have come [page 32] into contact with the glands, and caused this rapid movement. Accordingly I added to some distilled water a pinch of a quite innocent substance, namely, precipitated carbonate of lime, which consists of an impalpable powder; I shook the mixture, and thus got a fluid like thin milk. Two leaves were immersed in it, and in 6 m. almost every tentacle was much inflected. I placed one of these leaves under the microscope, and saw innumerable atoms of lime adhering to the external surface of the secretion. Some, however, had penetrated it, and were lying on the surfaces of the glands; and no doubt it was these particles which caused the tentacles to bend. When a leaf is immersed in water, the secretion instantly swells much; and I presume that it is ruptured here and there, so that little eddies of <b>water</b> <b>rush</b> in. If so, we can understand how the atoms of chalk, which rested on the surfaces of the glands, had penetrated the secretion. Anyone who has rubbed precipitated chalk between his fingers will have perceived how excessively fine the powder is. No doubt there must be a limit, beyond which a particle would be too small to act on a gland; but what this limit is, I know not. I have often seen fibres and dust, which had fallen from the air, on the glands of plants kept in my room, and these never induced any movement; but then such particles lay {{on the surface of the}} secretion and never reached the gland itself.|$|E

5000|$|Around noon on 26 April Wöhlermann was {{released}} from command and Mummert was reinstated as commander of the division. The following is from the diary of an officer with the Müncheberg Division and describes the evening of 26 April.Scarlet night. Heavy artillery fire. Uncanny silence. We get shot at from many houses. Foreign workers, no doubt. From the Air Ministry comes news that General Erich Bärenfänger has been relieved of his post of commander of the Berlin garrison. One hour later we hear that General Weidling is our new commander. General Mummert takes charge of the Tank Corps... On 27 April, {{very early in the}} morning, Hitler ordered the flooding of the Berlin underground to slow the advancing Red Army. Hitler's order resulted in the drowning of many German soldiers and civilians who had taken refuge in the tunnels. The diary of the officer with the Müncheberg Division went on to describe the flooding. New command post: Anhalter subway station. Platforms and control rooms look like an armed camp. Women and children huddle in niches and corners. Others sit about in deck chairs. They all listen for the sounds of battle... Suddenly water starts to pour into the station. Screams, sobs, curses. People fighting around the ladders that run through the air shafts up to the streets. Masses of gurgling <b>water</b> <b>rush</b> over the stairs. Children and wounded are abandoned and trampled to death. The water rises three feet or more and then slowly goes down. The panic lasts for hours. Many are drowned. Reason: On somebody's orders, engineers have blasted the locks of the canal between Schoeneburg and Mockern Bridges to flood the tunnels against the advancing Russians. Meanwhile heavy fighting has been going on above ground level. Change of position to Potsdamer Platz subway station in the late afternoon. Command post on the first floor, as tunnels still under water. Direct hits on the roof. Heavy losses among wounded and civilians. Smoke pours in through the shell holes. Outside, stacks of Panzerfists go up in the air. Another direct hit, one flight below street level. A horrible sight: Men, soldiers, women, and children are literally glued to the wall.|$|E
50|$|So {{could the}} {{movement}} of the container cause the disturbance? Consider the barges that bring water into Venice.

40|$|The study {{presents}} {{results of}} habitat creation and riparian vegetation recovery in artificial oxbow lakes in urbanized area within the large river valley. The investigation of open <b>water,</b> <b>rush</b> and wet meadows flora and vegetation in three ponds {{located in the}} city centre of Opole was conducted in years 2001 – 2013. Oxbow lakes were constructed as a compensation measure and no vegetation was transplanted into the ponds on purpose. 13 -years observation showed that (1) the red-listed species are able to spontaneous reoccurrence after habitat restoration, but they can thrive only in first years of oxbow lakes recolonisation process, (2) there are some restoration constraints, especially in relation to Phragmites australis and Nuphar lutea expansion, but alien species invasions were insignificant and (3) the species number and vegetation cover was constantly increasing during the recolonisation process in recreated oxbow lakes. The dynamic of vegetation was considerable, especially in first 6 years of experiment when the significant increase in diversity and richness of native plant species was observed. After that time, the increasing expansion of P. australis and N. lutea was noted causing the decline of several species and vegetation types. So, restoring just the environmental conditions may be sufficient for a limited period of time only. Strong disturbances, much intense that moderate inundations, imitating disastrous flooding within the valley each 10 – 13 years are need to maintain the ecological niches for river corridor and riparian species...|$|E
