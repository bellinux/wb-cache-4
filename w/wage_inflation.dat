25|$|Labour law in {{its modern}} form is {{primarily}} a creation {{of the last three}} decades of the 20th century. However, as a system of regulating the employment relationship, labour law has existed since people worked. In feudal England, the first significant labour laws followed the Black Death. Given the shortage of workers and consequent price rises the Ordinance of Labourers 1349 and the Statute of Labourers 1351 attempted to suppress sources of <b>wage</b> <b>inflation</b> by banning workers organisation, creating offences for any able-bodied person that did not work, and fixing wages at pre-plague levels. Ultimately this led to the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, which was in turn suppressed and followed up with the Statute of Cambridge 1388, which banned workers from moving around the country. Yet conditions were improving as serfdom was breaking down. One sign {{was the beginning of the}} more enlightened Truck Acts, dating from 1464, that required that workers be paid in cash and not kind. In 1772 slavery was declared to be illegal in R v Knowles, ex parte Somersett, and the subsequent Slave Trade Act 1807 and Slavery Abolition Act 1833 enforced prohibition throughout the British Empire. The turn into the 19th century coincided with the start of the massive boom in production. Gradually people's relationship to their employers moved from one of status - formal subordination and deference - to contract whereby people were formally free to choose their work. However, freedom of contract did not, as the economist Adam Smith observed, change a worker's factual dependency on employers.|$|E

40|$|During the {{transition}} from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, many countries seem to have experienced some degree of macroeconomic instability. This paper attempts to provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. The paper develops a simple monetary model and shows how macroeconomic stability can be achieved in a rigid centrally planned economy, despite the inherent structural imbalances and irrational price system. On the other hand, the study shows that without hardening enterprise budget constraints, wage and price decontrol tends to destablize the economy and may lead to persistent budget deficits and inflation. The paper also provides a rigorous analysis of household savings and money demand in a shortage economy, and clarifies the somewhat confusing concept of “monetary overhang” in the literature.

50|$|Friedman and Phelps opposed {{this idea}} on {{theoretical}} grounds, as {{they noted that}} if unemployment were to be permanently lower, some real variable in the economy, like the real wage, would have changed permanently. That this should be the case because inflation was higher appeared to rely on systematic irrationality in the labor market. As Friedman remarked, <b>wage</b> <b>inflation</b> would eventually catch up and leave the real wage, and unemployment, unchanged. Hence, lower unemployment could only be attained as long as <b>wage</b> <b>inflation</b> and inflation expectations lagged behind actual inflation. This was seen {{to be only a}} temporary outcome. Eventually, unemployment would return to the rate determined by real factors independent of the inflation rate. According to Friedman and Phelps, the Phillips curve was therefore vertical in the long run, and expansive demand policies would only be a cause of inflation, not a cause of permanently lower unemployment.|$|E
50|$|Some {{economists are}} {{concerned}} about potential inflationary effects driven by increased demand engendered by a fiscal stimulus. In theory, fiscal stimulus does not cause inflation when it uses resources that would have otherwise been idle. For instance, if a fiscal stimulus employs a worker who {{otherwise would have been}} unemployed, there is no inflationary effect; however, if the stimulus employs a worker who otherwise would have had a job, the stimulus is increasing labor demand while labor supply remains fixed, leading to <b>wage</b> <b>inflation</b> and therefore price inflation.|$|E
30|$|The {{results of}} the econometric {{exercise}} is best seen as multivariate determinants of {{the response to the}} question on whether the enterprise had a policy to adapt changes in base <b>wages</b> to <b>inflation</b> 22, rather than determinants of real wage rigidity. As noted in the previous section, the answers to this question were subject to serious response error, taking into account institutional arrangements for wage indexation in Slovenia as well as the WDN survey responses regarding the frequency of <b>wage</b> adjustments to <b>inflation.</b> General collective agreements covered all private sector employees in Slovenia for indexation of base <b>wages</b> to <b>inflation.</b> If all the survey responses were consistent with this institutional feature, the econometric exercise would be redundant because of lack of variability in the dependent variable. Still, wage indexation per se should not be taken as evidence of downward real wage rigidity. In Slovenia, the indexation of base <b>wage</b> to <b>inflation</b> was partial, thus allowing for a decrease in base wages in real terms in all years. The growth of total gross <b>wages</b> exceeded <b>inflation</b> because of additional wage increases linked to productivity gains and performance, and there was variation in annual developments in real gross wages.|$|R
40|$|The {{corporate}} governance problem of state enterprises in former socialist economies can {{give rise to}} excessive wage claims and/or capital decumulation. This paper focuses on these problems, highlighting the dynamic links between wage behavior, the fiscal deficit, inflation and the capital stock. Wage controls have been widely advocated {{as a response to}} the {{corporate governance}} problem. We show that in the presence of excessive wage claims a system of wage controls can help to limit capital decumulation and reduce <b>inflation,</b> since <b>wage</b> moderation implies higher government revenues from the profit tax and therefore lower money creation. More specifically, it is shown that when wage levels are initially excessive a reduction in the degree of wage indexation is effective in lowering <b>inflation</b> if nominal <b>wages</b> do not provide, on average, full protection against future inflation.

Furthermore, as product markets become more competitive, the macroeconomic outcomes in both regimes converge, and the degree of wage centralization becomes irrelevant.

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s new {{classical}} macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors. Keynesians emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flow.

To support these theories, Keynesians typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence. New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.|$|E

While some of these risks materialize slowly over time, others - such as interest rate risk - are felt with each measurement period. Liabilities are the actuarial present value of future plan cash flows, discounted at current interest rates. Thus, asset/liability management strategies often include bonds and swaps or other derivatives to accomplish some degree of interest rate hedging (immunization, cash flow matching, duration matching, etc.). Such approaches are sometimes called “liability-driven investment” (LDI) strategies. In 2008, plans with such approaches strongly outperformed those with traditional “total return” seeking investment policies.|$|E

Those two figures came from the yearly list of National Average Wage indexing series. This series gross up earlier years wages so that all years earnings up to age 60 are put on equal footing. Because it takes more than one year to fully collect such data, and because some people have January birthdays, the age 62 calculation done in 2006 must be based on the most recent data which is the 2004 national average wage. By law, all covered workers who attain age 62 in 2006 must be treated the same with respect to wage indexation so the 2004 figure for national average wage must be used for the entire 2006 year. Thus the age 61 and age 62 wages will get a bonus because they will not be indexed downward.|$|E
