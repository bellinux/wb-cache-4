40|$|Abstract—The use of {{artificial}} neural network (ANN) modeling for prediction and forecasting variables in <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>engineering</b> are being increasing rapidly. Infrastructural applications of ANN in terms of selection of inputs, architecture of networks, training algorithms, and selection of training parameters in different types of neural networks used in <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>engineering</b> have been reported. ANN modeling conducted for <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>engineering</b> variables (river sediment and discharge) published in high impact journals since 2002 to 2011 have been examined and presented in this review. ANN is a vigorous technique to develop immense relationship between the input and output variables, and able to extract complex behavior between the <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> variables such as river sediment and discharge. It can produce robust prediction results {{for many of the}} <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> <b>engineering</b> problems by appropriate learning from a set of examples. It is important to have a good understanding of the input and output variables from a statistical analysis of the data before network modeling, which can facilitate to design an efficient network. An appropriate training based ANN model is able to adopt the physical understanding between the variables and may generate more effective results than conventional prediction techniques.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} an introduction of evolutionary and other nature-inspired computation. The most prominent types of evolutionary computation (EC) are genetic algorithms (GA), genetic programming (GP), evolutionary strategy (ES) and evolutionary programming (EP). Many computational algorithms and problem-solving techniques, {{commonly known as}} swarm intelligence, have been developed by simulating the coordination and teamwork strategies in social insects. Elements comprising GAs are data representation, selection, crossover, mutation, and alternation of generations. GP {{can be used to}} apply evolutionary approaches to automatic code generation and problem solving by artificial intelligence. ES in its early days differed from GAs in the following two ways: mutation is used as the main operator and real number expressions are handled. The chapter also discusses relative advantages/disadvantages and application areas of these algorithms. Numerous applications of EC exist in structural engineering, architectural design, environmental engineering, geotechnical and <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> <b>engineering...</b>|$|E
40|$|An edited {{version of}} this paper was {{published}} by AGU. Copyright 1982 American Geophysical Union. The kinematic model for surface irrigation, reported previously by Sherman and Singh (1978), is extended. Depending upon the duration of irrigation and time variability of infiltration, three cases are distinguished. Explicit solutions are obtained when infiltration is constant. When infiltration is varying in time, a numerical procedure is developed which is stable and has fast convergence. A rigorous theoretical justification is developed for computation of the depth of water at and the time history of the front wall of water advancing down an infiltrating plane or channel. A derivation is given of the continuity and momentum equations when there is lateral inflow and infiltration into the channel bed.

40|$|An edited {{version of}} this paper was {{published}} by AGU. Copyright 1983 American Geophysical Union. A kinematic model for surface irrigation is verified by experimental data obtained for 31 borders. These borders are of varied characteristics. Calculated values of advance times, water surface profiles when water reaches the end of the border, and recession times are compared with their observations. The prediction error in most cases remains below 20 % for the advance time and below 15 % for the recession time. The water surface profiles computed by the model agree with observed profiles reasonably well. For the data analyzed here the kinematic wave model is found to be sufficiently accurate for modeling the entire irrigation cycle except for the vertical recession.
