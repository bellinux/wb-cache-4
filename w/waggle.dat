5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, are {{sensitive}} to the polarisation of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate the position of the sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a <b>waggle</b> dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E
5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can <b>waggle</b> with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can perceive the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E
25|$|Foraging: Some ant species recruit fellow {{workers to}} new food finds by first tapping {{them with their}} {{antennae}} and forelegs, then leading them to the food source while keeping physical contact. Another {{example of this is}} the <b>waggle</b> dance of honey bees.|$|E

25|$|As to a {{sense of}} hearing, Frisch could not {{identify}} this perceptive faculty, but it was assumed that vibrations could be sensed and used for communication during the <b>waggle</b> dance. Confirmation was later provided by Dr. Jürgen Tautz, a bee researcher at Würzburg University’s Biocenter.|$|E
25|$|One {{investigation}} {{of this kind}} was {{the study of the}} <b>waggle</b> dance ("dance language") in bee communication by Karl von Frisch. Lorenz subsequently developed a theory of the evolution of animal communication based on his observations of fixed action patterns and the circumstances in which they are expressed.|$|E
25|$|His work {{centered}} on {{investigations of the}} sensory perceptions of the honey bee {{and he was one}} of the first to translate the meaning of the <b>waggle</b> dance. His theory, described in his 1927 book Aus dem Leben der Bienen (translated into English as The Dancing Bees), was disputed by other scientists and greeted with skepticism at the time. Only much later was it shown to be an accurate theoretical analysis.|$|E

25|$|Another {{advantage}} of group living {{can be an}} increased ability to forage for food. Group members may exchange information about food sources between one another, facilitating the process of resource location. Honeybees are a notable example of this, using the <b>waggle</b> dance to communicate the location of flowers {{to the rest of}} their hive. Predators also receive benefits from hunting in groups, through using better strategies and being able to take down larger prey.|$|E
25|$|Division of labor, large colony sizes, temporally-changing colony needs, and {{the value}} of {{adaptability}} and efficiency under Darwinian competition, all form a theoretical basis favoring the existence of evolved communication in social insects. Beyond the rationale, there is well-documented empirical evidence of communication related to tasks; examples include the <b>waggle</b> dance of honey bee foragers, trail marking by ant foragers such as the red harvester ants, and the propagation via pheromones of an alarm state in Africanized honey bees.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Karl von Frisch {{correlated}} {{the runs}} and turns {{of the dance}} to the distance {{and direction of the}} food source from the hive. The orientation of the dance correlates to the relative position of the sun to the food source, and the length of the <b>waggle</b> portion of the run is correlated to the distance from the hive. Also, the more vigorous the display is, the better the food. There is no evidence that this form of communication depends on individual learning. Honeybees detect the dances of conspecifics by sensing near field sound and electric fields using the Johnston's organ.|$|E

60|$|Archibald was now {{preparing}} to drive {{off from the}} first tee. He did this with great care. Everyone who has seen Archibald Mealing play golf knows that his teeing off {{is one of the}} most impressive sights ever witnessed on the links. He tilted his cap over his eyes, <b>waggled</b> his club a little, shifted his feet, <b>waggled</b> his club some more, gazed keenly towards the horizon for a moment, <b>waggled</b> his club again, and finally, with the air of a Strong Man lifting a bar of iron, raised it slowly above his head. Then, bringing it down with a sweep, he drove the ball with a lofty slice some fifty yards. It was rarely that he failed either to slice or pull his ball. His progress from hole to hole was generally a majestic zigzag.|$|R
25|$|Frisch {{proved that}} {{variations}} {{in the position of}} the sun {{over the course of a}} day provided bees with an orientation tool. They use this capability to obtain information about the progression of the day deep inside a dark beehive comparable to what is known from the position of the sun. This makes it possible for the bees to convey always up-to-date directional information during their <b>waggle</b> dance, without having to make a comparison with the sun during long dance phases. This provides them not only with alternative directional information, but also with additional temporal information.|$|E
25|$|When a {{honey bee}} swarm {{emerges from a}} hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a {{suitable}} new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the <b>waggle</b> dance to indicate direction and distance {{to others in the}} cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as Apis dorsata. This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.|$|E
500|$|The {{ethologist}} Karl von Frisch studied navigation in {{the honey}} bee. He showed that honey bees communicate by the <b>waggle</b> dance, {{in which a}} worker indicates {{the location of a}} food source to other workers in the hive. He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive. Bees navigate using spatial memory with a [...] "rich, map-like organization".|$|E

500|$|Depictions {{of humans}} {{collecting}} honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them {{are shown in}} Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used; jars of honey {{were found in the}} tombs of pharaohs such as Tutankhamun. From the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony. Among Classical Era authors, beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the History of Animals Book 9 (a book not written by Aristotle himself). The account mentions that bees die after stinging; that workers remove corpses from the hive, and guard it; castes including workers and non-working drones, but [...] "kings" [...] rather than queens; predators including toads and bee-eaters; and the <b>waggle</b> dance, with the [...] "irresistible suggestion" [...] of άpοσειονται (aroseiontai, it waggles) and παρακολουθούσιν (parakolouthousin, they watch).|$|E
500|$|The {{clitoris}} of bonobos {{is larger}} and more externalized than in most mammals; Natalie Angier said that a young adolescent [...] "female bonobo is maybe half {{the weight of a}} human teenager, but her clitoris is three times bigger than the human equivalent, and visible enough to <b>waggle</b> unmistakably as she walks". Female bonobos often engage in the practice of genital-genital (GG) rubbing, which is the non-human form of tribadism that human females engage in. Ethologist Jonathan Balcombe stated that female bonobos rub their clitorises together rapidly for ten to twenty seconds, and this behavior, [...] "which may be repeated in rapid succession, is usually accompanied by grinding, shrieking, and clitoral engorgement"; he added that, on average, they engage in this practice [...] "about once every two hours", and as bonobos sometimes mate face-to-face, [...] "evolutionary biologist Marlene Zuk has suggested that the position of the clitoris in bonobos and some other primates has evolved to maximize stimulation during sexual intercourse".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{successfully}} foraging Western honey bees perform a dance on their return to the hive, known as <b>waggle</b> dance, indicating that food is farther away, while the round dance is a short version of the <b>waggle</b> dance, indicating that food is nearby. The laden forager dances on the comb in a circular pattern, occasionally crossing the circle in a zig-zag or <b>waggle</b> pattern. Aristotle described this behaviour in his Historia Animalium. This <b>waggle</b> pattern of movement was thought {{to attract the attention of}} other bees.|$|E

2500|$|Worker bees {{cooperate}} to {{find food}} {{and use a}} pattern of [...] "dancing" [...] (known as the bee dance or <b>waggle</b> dance) to communicate information regarding resources with each other; this dance varies from species to species, but all living species of Apis exhibit some form of the behavior. If the resources {{are very close to}} the hive, they may also exhibit a less specific dance commonly known as the [...] "round dance".|$|E
