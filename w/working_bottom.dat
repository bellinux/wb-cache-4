40|$|The {{development}} of High-Integrity Real-Time Systems {{has a high}} footprint in terms of human, material and schedule costs. Factoring functional, reusable logic in the application favors incremental development and contains costs. Yet, achieving incrementality in the timing behavior is a much harder problem. Complex features {{at all levels of}} the execution stack, aimed to boost average-case performance, exhibit timing behavior highly dependent on execution history, which wrecks time composability and incrementaility with it. Our goal here is to restitute time composability to the execution stack, <b>working</b> <b>bottom</b> up across it. We first characterize time composability without making assumptions on the system architecture or the software deployment to it. Later, we focus on the role played by the real-time operating system in our pursuit. Initially we consider single-core processors and, becoming less permissive on the admissible hardware features, we devise solutions that restore a convincing degree of time composability. To show what can be done for real, we developed TiCOS, an ARINC-compliant kernel, and re-designed ORK+, a kernel for Ada Ravenscar runtimes. In that work, we added support for limited-preemption to ORK+, an absolute premiere in the landscape of real-word kernels. Our implementation allows resource sharing to co-exist with limited-preemptive scheduling, which extends state of the art. We then turn our attention to multicore architectures, first considering partitioned systems, for which we achieve results close to those obtained for single-core processors. Subsequently, we shy away from the over-provision of those systems and consider less restrictive uses of homogeneous multiprocessors, where the scheduling algorithm is key to high schedulable utilization. To that end we single out RUN, a promising baseline, and extend it to SPRINT, which supports sporadic task sets, hence matches real-world industrial needs better. To corroborate our results we present findings from real-world case studies from avionic industry...|$|E

40|$|The {{two major}} stream species of crayfishes in Ohio are Orconectes propinquus sanborni (Faxon, 1884), and Orconectes rusticus rusticus (Girard, 1852). Orconectes rusticus rusticus and its {{subspecies}} are widely distributed over the exposed lime-stones on the flanks of the Cincinnati Anticline and occupy streams {{in the western}} half of the state. On the other hand, 0. p. sanborni seems to have developed in the old Teays River in areas where sandstone and shale predominated. Its present range includes the unglaciated plateau in southern Ohio. Thus, the zone of overlap of these two species forms an irregular north-south band across Ohio. Turner (1926) related this transition zone to the terminal moraine of the Illinoian glacier. In some respects it also closely approximates the easternmost exposures of Niagaran and Devonian limestones. Previous work has not shown just where and how the ranges of these two stream species join or overlap.

40|$|Twenty years ago, the Hong Kong model (a strong law and a {{powerful}} agency, ICAC) was the general model for fighting corruption. However, the Fitzgerald reform process produced {{a new model of}} governance reform and a new model for building integrity and combating corruption. While originally called an 'ethics regime', the terms that have stuck have been 'ethics infrastructure' (OECD then UN) and, especially, 'National Integrity System' (Transparency International and then World Bank). This paper outlines the distinctive nature of the reform process and the distinctive features and advantages of the integrity systems approach. It then describes the process by which this approach gradually came to supplant the 'Hong Kong' model as the preferred method of combating corruption. The paper will briefly outline the different ways in which national integrity systems were mapped and assessed before arguing that the fight against corruption requires a new form of mapping and assessment - of 'corruption systems. It is here that we can come to recognise another great virtue of the Fitzgerald Inquiry - the way that it broke the then corruption system by exposing its <b>working</b> from <b>bottom</b> to top. The paper concludes by identifying a key strategy for corruption busting campaigns of which Fitzgerald is an exemplar - the creation of a form of 'prisoner's dilemma' for those involved in corruption.

40|$|Steel–concrete trussed {{composite}} beams are {{a particular}} types of composite girders constituted by a steel truss {{embedded in a}} concrete core. The truss is typically composed by a steel plate or a precast concrete slab <b>working</b> as <b>bottom</b> chord while coupled rebars are generally used to form the upper chord. Moreover, a system of ribbed or smooth steel rebars welded {{to the plate and}} forming the diagonals of the truss, works as web reinforcement. In the present study, the attention is focused on the evaluation of the shear resistance of the connection between bottom steel plate (the bottom chord) and concrete core through the diagonal bars of the truss developing a mechanical model able to account for the particular issues arising in this beam typology. In particular, the proposed formulation is based on the extension of existing formulations for the prediction of the resistance of steel dowels to the case of inclined steel bars loaded against concrete, accounting for the following effects: lateral and top confinement, mechanical non-linearity of materials, length of the plastic hinge arising in the steel bar and influence of moment-shear-axial force interaction effect. The accuracy of the model is verified with the available experimental data collected from the technical literature and with FE results obtained from a parametric analysis carried out by the same authors in a previous work...|$|R

25|$|In deep marine environments, {{the water}} current <b>working</b> the sea <b>bottom</b> is small. Only fine {{particles}} can be transported to such places. Typically sediments depositing {{on the ocean}} floor are fine clay or small skeletons of micro-organisms. At 4km depth, the solubility of carbonates increases dramatically (the depth zone where this happens is called the lysocline). Calcareous sediment that sinks below the lysocline dissolves, as a result no limestone can be formed below this depth. Skeletons of micro-organisms formed of silica (such as radiolarians) are not as soluble and still deposit. An example of a rock formed of silica skeletons is radiolarite. When {{the bottom of the sea}} has a small inclination, for example at the continental slopes, the sedimentary cover can become unstable, causing turbidity currents. Turbidity currents are sudden disturbances of the normally quite deep marine environment and can cause the geologically speaking instantaneous deposition of large amounts of sediment, such as sand and silt. The rock sequence formed by a turbidity current is called a turbidite.|$|R
