Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold <b>working</b> <b>and</b> exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.

40|$|This paper aims to {{understand}} the moderator effect of the salesforce control system {{in the relationship between}} sales behavior (locomotion, <b>working</b> hard <b>and</b> <b>working</b> smart) <b>and</b> salesperson performance. Two perspectives of the control system are addressed: outcome and behavior. To test the hypotheses, a descriptive survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 140 salespersons of retail stores of construction materials. The results demonstrate that high levels of behavior-based salesforce control systems decrease the performance of salespersons that present high level of locomotion <b>and</b> <b>working</b> smart <b>and</b> high levels of outcome-based salesforce control systems improve the performance of salesperson that present low levels of <b>working</b> hard <b>and</b> <b>working</b> smart. Furthermore, the study showed that the salesperson behavior interferes in performance, specially the working hard. The findings indicate that sales managers must take actions to evaluate the salesperson behavior individually, adopting distinct control system for different salesperson in the same sales team. Finally, the findings also indicate that the high performance salespersons must transmit their expertise to inefficient salesperson, through the creation of informal or formal ties. </p...|$|R
