25|$|I {{remember}} {{going out to}} bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> scored about five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch {{the next day at}} 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents and friends watching.|$|E
25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> more time and things were less frantic, I probably would have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E
25|$|When my father, who {{had been}} {{appointed}} by his country as public notary in the customs at Bugia acting for the Pisan merchants going there, was in charge, he summoned me to him while I was still a child, and having an eye to usefulness and future convenience, desired me to stay there and receive instruction {{in the school of}} accounting. There, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been introduced to the art of the Indians' nine symbols through remarkable teaching, knowledge of the art very soon pleased me above all else and I came to understand it.|$|E

I wanted to play the records and say 'I am not going to destroy you' but they were just so scared. Because they were worried about their political future. They were not thinking about Death in June as Being a Nazi group, they are thinking that I, Jean Pierre Nobody, want to be Mayor of this town and I must win the good citizens over of this town to my cause and, therefore, I will be a knight in shining armour, I will always stand up to those things that everybody hates. So, I will stand up to Nazi, skinhead hordes that are coming to destroy Lausanne.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Cruyff's {{father died}} from a heart attack. His father's death had {{a major impact on}} his mentality. As Cruyff recalled, in celebration of his 50th birthday, “My father died when I was just 12 and he was 45. From that day the feeling crept {{stronger}} over me that I would die at the same age and, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> serious heart problems when I reached 45, I thought: 'This is it.' Only medical science, which was not available to help my father, kept me alive.” Viewing a potential football career as a way of paying tribute to his father, the death inspired the strong-willed Cruyff, who also frequently visited the burial site at Oosterbegraafplaats. His mother began working at Ajax as a cleaner, deciding that she could no longer carry on at the grocer without her husband, and in the future, this made Cruyff near-obsessed with financial security but also gave him an appreciation for player aids. His mother soon met her second husband, Henk Angel, a field hand at Ajax who proved a key influence in Cruyff's life.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E

He compiled his own index for the book, [...] "and swore a mighty oath, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> finished the task, that I would rather die, and in a particularly unpleasant manner, than do it again". He contrived to include in his index an obscene joke {{at the expense of}} the hapless prosecutor in the Chatterley trial, but found the difficulty of indexing so great that he became a champion of the Society of Indexers. [...] He wrote several articles on the subject, and when reviewing books made a point of praising good indexes and condemning bad ones.|$|E
500|$|Shankly's village {{team was}} called the Glenbuck Cherrypickers, a name {{probably}} derived from the 11th Hussars (the [...] "Cherry Pickers"), but Shankly said: [...] "the club was near extinction <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a trial and I never actually played for them". Shankly, aged 18, then played part of the 1931–32 season for Cronberry Eglinton, about 12 miles from Glenbuck. He used to cycle {{to and from the}} ground. Cronberry were in the Cumnock & District League. Although Shankly had less than one full season at Cronberry, he acknowledged his debt to Scottish Junior Football as he [...] "learnt a lot", mainly by listening to older players and especially his brothers.|$|E

500|$|Hamming {{remained}} at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a {{post at the}} [...] Bell Telephone Laboratories (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought Klaus Fuchs's old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the FBI regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming. Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a [...] "computer janitor", he saw computer simulations of experiments {{that would have been}} impossible to perform in a laboratory. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> time to think about it," [...] he later recalled, [...] "I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed".|$|E

According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension at first. We were so nervous being together.

500|$|Development of Gaga's third studio album, Artpop, began {{shortly after}} the release of her second record, Born This Way (2011), and by the {{following}} year, the album's concepts were [...] "beginning to flourish" [...] as Gaga collaborated with producers Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow. In the meantime, the singer also worked with French disc jockey Madeon. This was his first experience collaborating with a vocalist face-to-face. On MTV News he clarified that he had [...] "always wanted to work with pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Having mutual respect for each other's work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. He reminds me of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 1948, the {{president}} submitted {{a civil rights}} agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: [...] "My forebears were Confederates... but my very stomach turned over <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten." [...] Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were {{a major factor in}} his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces. [...] In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated.|$|E
500|$|Cotto's second title defense {{took place}} on February 26, 2005 in the Rubén Rodríguez in Bayamón, Puerto Rico against Demarcus Corley. During the fight Cotto practiced a boxing style that was more {{aggressive}} than usual, trading hits with Corley {{over the course of}} the first round. During the fight both boxers were deducted one point following illegal low blows. Cotto scored three knockdowns before the fight was stopped by the referee at 2:45 of the fifth round following a combination by Miguel. Corley claimed that the referee stopped the fight prematurely stating that [...] "the ref just stopped the fight premature. If he wanted to stop the fight, he could have stopped it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> [...] hurt." [...] Just a few days after retaining the crown versus Corley, Cotto received a personal blow, when his stablemate and friend, former 2004 Olympian Joseph Serrano, was shot in the head upon leaving the Bairoa gym. Serrano survived the shot, but was in critical but stable condition at a local hospital.|$|E

But the slaps were equally well dispatched." [...] Commenting on Reid's exit, Windsor has said, [...] "We fell out when I found out he was leaving because it was a shock for me. I was really upset. I've known him 30 odd years and I really like working with him. We had a great relationship as friends as well as performers. I got my own back <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to slap him after I found out he was fooling around with Pat. I did the slap twice as I didn't think I did it hard enough the first time." ...|$|E

500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times.

[...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it. The song showcases Gaga's fans as being the people with whom she feels at home.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix.
