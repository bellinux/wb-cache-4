5|$|Magnus Haraldsson (Old Norse: Magnús Haraldsson; c. 1048 – 28 April 1069) was King of Norway from 1066 to 1069, {{jointly with}} his brother Olaf Kyrre from 1067. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> {{official}} Norwegian regnal lists until modern times, but has since been counted as Magnus II.|$|E

5|$|The {{other related}} issue {{concerned}} advance-care planning consultation: {{a section of}} the House reform proposal would have reimbursed physicians for providing patient-requested consultations for Medicare recipients on end-of-life health planning (which is covered by many private plans), enabling patients to specify, on request, the kind of care they wished to receive.

5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> other analyses, {{was found to be}} closer to Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Ripley's {{introduction}} in Aliens <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> {{the theatrical}} {{version of the}} film, since 20th Century Fox {{was concerned about the}} film's running time. Sigourney Weaver criticized the cut, seeing Amanda as crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development and her bond with the orphaned Newt. While developing Alien: Isolation, Creative Assembly originally desired a female protagonist and decided to use Amanda as the best way to focus on her mother, Ellen's, traits. The picture model for Ripley in Aliens is Elizabeth Inglis, Sigourney Weaver's mother, and in Alien: Isolation she is voiced by Andrea Deck with motion capture by Kezia Burrows. Amanda's design in Alien: Isolation was based on pictures from Elizabeth Inglis' youth.|$|E
5|$|Costa scored {{his first}} goal for Spain {{with the third}} in a 4–0 UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} win away to Luxembourg on 12 October 2014. He did not feature again for Spain until 5 September 2015, when he was fouled by Slovakia goalkeeper Matúš Kozáčik for a penalty, which Andrés Iniesta converted for a 2–0 qualifying win at the Estadio Carlos Tartiere in Oviedo. He was booed when he was substituted for Paco Alcácer later in the match. Del Bosque defended Costa from criticism, saying that he performed well against the Slovak defence. However, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the final squad for the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Except for its two stations—one at {{each end}} of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The line was built in less than three months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Ilokelesia was {{originally}} {{described as a}} sister group to Abelisauroidea. However, Sereno tentatively places it closer to Abelisaurus than to noasaurids, a result which agrees with several other recent analyses. If a stem-based definition is used, Ilokelesia and Rugops are therefore basal abelisaurids. However, as they are more basal than Abelisaurus, they are outside of Abelisauridae if the node-based definition is adopted. Ekrixinatosaurus was also published in 2004, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> Sereno's analysis. However, an independent analysis, performed by Jorge Calvo and colleagues, shows {{it to be an}} abelisaurid.|$|E

5|$|In Suzuki's songwriting process, {{he would}} first compose on a {{synthesizer}} before working with programmers {{to get it}} in the game. His personal pieces play when the player is walking about the map, out of battle. Suzuki's favorite piece is the music that plays while the player is on a bicycle, which he composed in advance of this job but found appropriate to include. He wrote over 100 pieces, but much of it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the game. The team wrote enough music as to fill eight megabits of the 24 megabit cartridge—about two compact discs.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool fielded a 4–4–1–1 formation, {{with the}} {{surprise}} {{inclusion in the}} squad being Harry Kewell, who played just behind Milan Baroš, who himself had been picked ahead of Djibril Cissé. The inclusion of Kewell meant Dietmar Hamann was left on the substitutes' bench and Xabi Alonso and Steven Gerrard started in the centre of midfield. Milan fielded a 4–4–2 diamond formation, with Hernán Crespo preferred to Jon Dahl Tomasson and Filippo Inzaghi, who <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the match day squad. Liverpool lined up in their red home kit, whilst Milan wore a changed strip of all white. Liverpool won the toss and kicked off.|$|E
5|$|MS 465 first {{appeared}} as a gravel road on the state map in 1956, connecting US 61 near Vicksburg to MS 1 in Fitler. A year later, {{a section of the}} highway became paved in northwest Warren County, and its southern terminus was realigned to north of Vicksburg by 1958. The terminus continued to shift north to parallel the Yazoo River the next two years, ending near Redwood. The southern half of the route was fully paved by 1964, and the northern by 1984. The route has not changed significantly since. The route was proposed {{to be part of the}} Great River Road, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the most recent reiteration of the route.|$|E
