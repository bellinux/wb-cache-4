500|$|On March 30, 2003, {{ten weeks}} before release, an unmastered version of Hail to the Thief {{containing}} unfinished tracks was leaked online. Jonny Greenwood wrote on Radiohead's official forum: [...] "We're kind of pissed off about it, to be honest... Work we've not finished, being released in this sloppy way, ten {{weeks before the}} real version is even available... It's not [...] I'm pissed off about, it's just the situation I guess. It's stolen work, fer fuck's sake." [...] Colin Greenwood said the leak was [...] "like being photographed with one sock on <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> {{of bed in the}} morning," [...] but expressed dismay at the cease-and-desist orders sent by label EMI to radio stations and fan sites playing the leaked tracks, saying: [...] "Don't record companies usually pay thousands of dollars to get stations to play their records? Now they're paying money to stations not to play them." ...|$|E
2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many Nisei {{worked to}} prove {{themselves}} as loyal American citizens. Of the 20,000 Japanese Americans {{who served in the}} Army during World War II, [...] "many Japanese-American soldiers had gone to war to fight racism at home" [...] and they were [...] "proving with their blood, their limbs, and their bodies that they were truly American". It was not only men either, some one hundred Nisei women volunteered for the WAC (Woman's Army Corps), where, after undergoing rigorous basic training, they had assignments as typists, clerks, and drivers. Satoshi Ito, an internment camp survivor, reinforces the idea of the immigrants’ children striving to demonstrate their patriotism to the United States. He notes that his mother would tell him, [...] "‘you’re here in the United States, you need to do well in school, you need to prepare yourself to get a good job <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> into the larger society’". He said she would tell him, [...] "‘don’t be a dumb farmer like me, like us’" [...] to encourage Ito to successfully assimilate into American society. As a result, he worked exceptionally hard to excel in school and later became a professor at the College of William & Mary. His story, along with the countless Japanese Americans willing to risk their lives in war, demonstrate the lengths many in their community went to prove their American patriotism.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{networks}} owners widely use {{the simple}} network management protocol (SNMP), as {{it helps to}} identify varies anomalies and failures of computer networks.

The problem arises <b>when</b> <b>you</b> want <b>get</b> them <b>out</b> from organizations, that manage computer networks. The SNMP monitoring records are not published, as any disclosure of real data would cause real threats to the organization and its security of information. The proposed model allows to anonymise, analize the level of anonymization, valuate it and if the anonymised data enough secure, forward it for public use without the threat to damage own computer network. It can be achieved a level of protection for sensitive information, by using this model, it will protect the suppliers and their networks from the real vulnerabilities analysis and possible attacks through them. On the other hand, it still could be saved a sufficient amount of information that would be useful for scientific and analytical research. Using the different anonymization techniques, depending on the attributes of the information format, it is possible to enhance or reduce the levels of security in order to increase or decrease the data lasting values. It gives the opportunity to network administrators or managers to decide, which data should be anonymized and how deep level of security must be reach before being released for the public use...|$|R
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> in and <b>out</b> of a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause <b>you</b> to <b>get</b> stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not you enjoyed the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|R

But you don't suppose that keeping a summer hotel would mean living in the country the whole time, do you? That's the way mother does, but I shouldn't. It isn't good for the hotel, even. If I had such a place as Lion's Head, I should put a man and his family into it for the winter to look after it, and I should go to town myself--to Boston or New York, or I might go to London or Paris. They're not so far off, and it's so easy to get to them that you can hardly keep away."

60|$|We {{crossed a}} broad bay {{and found the}} water quite rough. A very little wind on these broad lakes raises a sea which will swamp a canoe. Looking off from the shore, the surface {{may appear to be}} almost smooth a mile distant, or if you see a few white crests they appear nearly level {{with the rest of the}} lake, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> so far, you may find quite a sea running, and ere long, before you think of it, a wave will gently creep up the side of the canoe and fill your lap, like a monster {{deliberately}} covering you with its slime before it swallows you, or it will strike the canoe violently and break into it. The same thing may happen when the wind rises suddenly, though it were perfectly calm and smooth there a few minutes before; so that nothing can save you, unless you can swim ashore, for it is impossible to get into a canoe when it is upset. Since you sit flat on the bottom, though the danger should not be imminent, a little water is a great inconvenience, not to mention the wetting of your provisions. We rarely crossed even a bay directly, from point to point, when there was wind, but made a slight curve corresponding somewhat to the shore, that we might the sooner reach it if the wind increased.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} theology, {{as you are}} aware, {{it has been the}} study of the deepest heads that have come into the world--what is the nature of this stupendous universe, and what its {{relations}} to all things, as known to man, and as only known to the awful Author of it. In fact, the members of the Church keep theology in a lively condition (laughter), {{for the benefit of the}} whole population, which is the great object of our Universities. I consider it is the same now intrinsically, though very much forgotten, from many causes, and not so successful as might be wished at all. (A laugh.) It remains, however, a very curious truth, what has been said by observant people, that the main use of the Universities in the present age is that, after you have done with all your classes, the next thing is a collection of books, a great library of good books, which you proceed to study and to read. What the Universities have mainly done--what I have found the University did for me, was that it taught me to read in various languages and various sciences, so that I could go into the books that treated of these things, and try anything I wanted to make myself master of gradually, as I found it suit me. Whatever you may think of all that, the clearest and most imperative duty lies on every one of you to be assiduous in your reading; and learn to be good readers, which is, perhaps, a more difficult thing than you imagine. Learn to be discriminative in your reading--to read all kinds of things that you have an interest in, and that you find to be really fit for what you are engaged in. Of course, at the present time, in a great deal of the reading incumbent on you you must be guided by the books recommended to you by your professors for assistance towards the prelections. And then, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the University, and go into studies of your own, you will find it very important that you have selected a field, a province in which you can study and work.|$|E
