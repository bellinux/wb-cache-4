60|$|And {{this brings}} us to the real and {{relevant}} mistake of Dickens. It was not in thinking his Americans funny, but in thinking them foolish because they were funny. In this sense it will be noticed that Dickens's American sketches are almost avowedly superficial; they are descriptions of public life and not private life. Mr. Jefferson Brick had no private life. But Mr. Jonas Chuzzlewit undoubtedly had a private life; and even kept some parts of it exceeding private. Mr. Pecksniff was also a domestic character; so was Mr. Quilp. Mr. Pecksniff and Mr. Quilp had slightly different ways of surprising their families; Mr. Pecksniff by playfully observing 'Boh!' when he came home; Mr. Quilp by coming home at all. But we can form no picture of how Mr. Hannibal Chollop playfully surprised his family; possibly by shooting at them; possibly by not shooting at them. We can only say that he would rather surprise us by having a family at all. We do not know how the Mother of the Modern Gracchi managed the Modern Gracchi; for her maternity was rather a public than a private office. We have no romantic moonlit scenes of the love-making of Elijah Pogram, to balance against the love story of Seth Pecksniff. These figures are all in a special sense theatrical; all facing one way and lit up by a public limelight. Their ridiculous characters are detachable from their real characters, if they have any real characters. And the author might perfectly <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about what is ridiculous, and wrong about what is real. He might be as right in smiling at the Pograms and the Bricks as in smiling at the Pickwicks and the Boffins. And he might still be as wrong in seeing Mr. Pogram as a hypocrite as the great Buzfuz was wrong in seeing Mr. Pickwick as a monster of revolting heartlessness and systematic villainy. He might still be as wrong in thinking Jefferson Brick a charlatan and a cheat as was that great disciple of Lavater, Mrs. Wilfer, in tracing every wrinkle of evil cunning in the face of Mrs. Boffin. For Mr. Pickwick's spectacles and gaiters and Mrs. Boffin's bonnets and boudoir are after all superficial jokes; and might be equally well seen whatever we saw beneath them. A man may smile and smile and be a villain; but a man may also make us smile and not be a villain. He may make us smile and not even be a fool. He may make us roar with laughter and be an exceedingly wise man.|$|E

Tyler is first to make the journey, and even before setting off he earns a reprimand from Andrew for his admission of repeatedly driving drunk. He subsequently speeds throughout his drive and runs at least one red light. Daniella is petrified {{by the thought of}} driving on the highway, even if only for a brief duration, and subsequently demands that Chantal make all the decisions during their drive, to the point of having Chantal take over for part of it. Diana spends much of her drive reading a spiritual book and looking at [...] "positive thinking cards", leaving Joedy anxious throughout the drive. Mike proves very slow in his drive, and tends to drift between lanes. Cody gets to rehab without any major issues, as does Lou, albeit she proves extremely nervous throughout. Amrinder speeds, texts and runs several stop signs during his drive. Krystal is the final driver to make the journey, and Andrew reveals that due to her dangerous driving when shooting her audition videos, the camera crew have refused to accompany her for her drive. On top of that, it's revealed that her insurance premium is $10,000 per year, second only to Canada's Worst Driver 6 contestant Scott Schurink as the highest in the show's history. She subsequently commits an extreme number of moving violations during the course of her run, and even {{goes so far as to}} tear up the directions that she was given at the start, committing a total of 107 ticketable offences before arriving by using directions from [...] "Siri". Andrew subsequently says that based on what he's seen so far, Krystal looks like the worst driver in the show's history, an assessment which reduces her to tears, but one which she admits may very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E

40|$|Something {{is wrong}} with akrasia, means-end incoherence, and {{intention}} inconsistency. This observation has lead many philosophers to postulate 'wide-scope' requirements against these combinations of attitudes. But some philosophers have argued that this is unwarranted. They claim that we can explain what {{is wrong with}} these combinations of attitudes by appealing only to plausible independent claims about reasons for particular beliefs and intentions. In this paper, I argue that these philosophers may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about akrasia but that they are wrong about means-end incoherence and intention inconsistency. While it is plausibly impossible to be akratic while having no specific attitude (or lack of an attitude) that you should not have, it is possible to be means-end incoherent or to have inconsistent intentions while having no specific attitude you should not have. There is thus a strong motivation for accepting wide-scope requirements against means-end incoherence and intention inconsistency which does not apply to akrasia. This result give some support to the view of means-end coherence developed in 'Explaining the Instrumental Principle' and 'Defending the Wide-Scope Approach to Instrumental Reason...|$|E

40|$|We {{think of}} perceptual {{experience}} {{as a source of}} propositional knowledge of the world around us. So we think of perceptual {{experience as a}} reliable source of true beliefs. Therefore, we must be thinking of perceptual experience as causally dependent on perceived objects. This is a rough sketch of a line of reasoning that plays a significant role in P. F. Strawson’s defence of the causal theory of perception. In Strawson’s words, it provides the ‘rationale ’ for the causal theory of perception. The ‘rationale ’ has been criticized by Paul Snowdon in a series of papers pioneering a ‘disjunctivist ’ account of perceptual experience. Snowdon’s central complaint is that the causal requirement has not been shown to be necessary, given that the causal theory is not without alternatives. For example, one might account for the reliability of perception by invoking a relational view of perceptual experience, on which mind-independent objects are constituents of the experience we enjoy in perceiving them. Some philosophers have argued that the causal theory of perception and the relational view of experience are not in fact in conflict. 1 I think they may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> but the point does not resolve the dispute between Strawson and Snowdon...|$|E
40|$|I compare a ‘realist’ with a ‘social–relational’ {{perspective}} on our judgments {{of the moral}} status of artificial agents (AAs). I develop a realist position according to which the moral status of a being—particularly in relation to moral patiency attribution—is closely bound up with that being’s ability to experience states of conscious satisfaction or suffering (CSS). For a realist, both moral status and experiential capacity are objective properties of agents. A social relationist denies the existence of any such objective properties {{in the case of}} either moral status or consciousness, suggesting that the determination of such properties rests solely upon social attribution or consensus. A wide variety of social interactions between us and various kinds of artificial agent will no doubt proliferate in future generations, and the social–relational view may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> that the appearance of CSS features in such artificial beings will make moral role attribution socially prevalent in human–AA relations. But there is still the question of what actual CSS states a given AA is capable of undergoing, independently of the appearances. This {{is not just a matter}} of changes in the structure of social existence that seem inevitable as human–AA interaction becomes more prevalent. The social world is itself enabled and constrained by the physical world, and by the biological features of living social participants. Properties analogous to certain key features in biological CSS are what need to be present for nonbiological CSS. Working out the details of such features will be an objective scientific inquiry...|$|E
40|$|Levi-Faur and Starobin (2013) have {{recently}} drawn {{our attention to}} the important role of regulatory intermediates in contemporary regulatory regimes. Among others they argue that regulatory intermediaries come {{in a wide variety of}} appearances, and that these can influence the outcomes of regulatory regimes in both positive and negative terms. The current paper seeks to provide empirical knowledge to their arguments. It maps regulatory intermediates in the sustainable construction sector, and aims to better understand how such intermediaries affect sustainable construction practice. In this sector, regulatory intermediates have taken up a range of rulemaking, enforcement, disciplinary, empowering, and bridging roles. They have done so either commissioned by state-actors or on their own voluntary initiative. The current article maps a stratified sample of over 30 regulatory intermediaries from Australia, Germany, India, Malaysia, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States and Singapore that operate on a local, national or international level. The construction sector is of particular interest to study because its long history of regulatory intermediaries, and because of the wide variety of regulatory intermediaries involved in this sector. Also, state actors appear to have accepted that these non-state regulators are needed if meaningful sustainable construction is to be achieved. The paper finds that state actors may very <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> in this assumption, but that too much reliance on regulatory intermediaries may be harmful. Three more in-depth case studies are presented to illustrate some of the potential harmful outcomes. From these studies it becomes clear that: (i) state-actors may become too dependent on regulatory intermediaries, which may make it difficult to discipline regulatory intermediaries when necessary; (ii) the legitimacy of state-regulation may diminish when non-state regulators’ rules are integrated in these; (iii) regulatory intermediaries may create the illusion that the introduction state-actor regulation is unnecessary because they are actively involved in addressing a public problem...|$|E

40|$|Included among President Bush’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform’s {{recommendations}} were three proposals {{related to the}} current home mortgage interest deduction. Instead of a deduction, the panel recommended a flat 15 % credit. Instead of the current $ 1, 100, 000 mortgage caps, the panel recommended a mortgage cap based on the median regional price of housing. Finally, the panel recommended limiting the deduction to interest paid on only one home and eliminating the deduction for interest on home equity indebtedness. The Panel Report praises the Tax Reform Act of 1986, albeit with a caveat: “While the 1986 Act was a historic event, it did not produce a lasting transformation of the tax system. The 1986 Act left in place or added various complicated tax benefits, including such items as exclusions for employer-provided fringe benefits, state and local tax deductions, tax-deferred annuities, new mortgage interest deduction rules, and complicated rules for determining alternative minimum tax liability. Many point to the 1986 Act as {{the high point of}} contemporary tax reform – and they may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> – but its limitations suggest that truly sweeping comprehensive reform faces formidable political obstacles. Both participants in the debate refer to the 1986 Act in discussing the Panel’s proposals relating to the tax treatment of home mortgage interest. Professor Deborah Geier argues for limits, questions the linkage between current tax benefits and homeownership, and explains why the Panel’s recommendations do not sufficiently encourage homeownership by low income taxpayers. Professor Stuart Lazar criticizes the Panel for undervaluing the effect on housing costs in many locales, using the 15 % credit rate as a disguised means of raising taxes, and not explaining how it determined that the current mortgage deduction results in too little business investment...|$|E
40|$|Attention {{needs to}} be drawn to the totally {{inadequate}} dietary controls {{used in the study}} of M. B. Garvey, L. H. Dennis, and M. E. Conrad in the November issue, thus nullifying most, if not all, of the authors ’ conclusions (Labile Factor Depression in Scorbutic Guinea Pigs. Am. I. Clin. Nutr. 22 : 1423, 1969). The authors produced scurvy in 400 - to 500 -g guinea pigs “by feeding them a scorbutogenic diet for 1 month. ” (No further description of the deficient diet is given to allow evaluation of the nutritional adequacy of the diet or repeti-tion of the work, unfortunately.) The deficient animals developed many of the usual symptoms of scurvy plus the new findings of “a moderately severe deficiency of labile factor (V) and fatty metamorphoses of the liver, ” which the authors attribute (without sufficient evidence, I feel) to a lack of vitamin C. Unfortunately, the “control ” animals were not given supplements of pure ascorbic acid, which would have served as the proper control. Rather, the “control animals were fed the same diet supplemented with green leafy vegetables” (amount unspecified and rich in many nutrients other than vitamin C). Thus, a basic tenet of nutritional experimentation was overlooked and the authors do not really prove the reported changes they found were {{due to a lack of}} vita-min C. The study, in order to be acceptable, needs to show results with control animals fed pure ascorbic acid, and only then are the conclusions proved. Of course, the conclusions may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> but the evidence published in this paper is insufficient to prove anything. When such studies are published, complete details of the composition of the basal diet should also be given just as carefully as the details of other procedures (in this case, the blood studies). The guinea pig’s nutritional requirements are very complex and several more essential nutrients than vitamin C-such as folic acid, choline, vitamin K, and iron, to name a few-may well be deficient in the scorbutogenic diet unless proven otherwise...|$|E
40|$|Income {{inequality}} in China is severe; {{measured by the}} Gini-coefficient it amounted to 0. 46 in 2011; wealth distribution is even worse with 0. 61. These disparities led to {{a major shift in}} emphasis of politics in general and of the Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development by the National People´s Congress in particular. While previously the strategy of the Five-Year Plans had been “Making the nation [our emphasis] rich as top priority”, this was changed to “Making people [our emphasis] rich as top priority” in the 12 th Five-Year Plan (2011 - 2015), enacted in March 2011. The strategic change from “nation” to “people” indicates that the political decision-makers in China accepted the aim of a fair income distribution as a political issue of great importance. In this paper, richness is defined in the political-philosophical tradition as the right measure for one’s own needs and wants; only its environmental aspect is focused on in this study. The development of the Chinese environmental conditions is compared with the German ones and the former’s future outlook is judged optimistically because of the achievements in the last five years. However, the complexity and fragility of the environmental system will within a decade confront Chinese politicians with the same problems as it does right now in Germany. In order to provide a solution addressing this development, this paper analyzes what Karl Marx had to say on the long-run dynamics of the economic system. He saw poverty as a necessary yet unintended consequence of the capitalistic system and used this insight as a “precision tool for the study of social change” (Elster 1986), which can also be employed to examine the unintended repercussions of economic activity on nature. Marx, who studied environmental and resource issues in detail, thought that the inventiveness of the capitalistic system would finally overcome all of them in the course of time. In {{view of the fact that}} three billion people on earth still have a backlog demand to satisfy basic needs and in addition a further three billion are expected to be born until 2050, the future of the natural environmental conditions looks somber. If it is not possible to decouple economic growth from ensuing environmental strain, Marx may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> after all in his prediction that the capitalistic system will collapse, although in quite a different manner than he thought. This being the case we take recourse to the thoughts of one of the influential intellectual German figures, to Romano Guardini. He foresaw changes in the self-perception of humankind and in the comprehension of nature. These imply a shift in the ethos of government as well, which would in turn pose three great challenges to politics: (i) understanding nature in a new light, (ii) listening to what drives human hearts, and (iii) governing according to law...|$|E
