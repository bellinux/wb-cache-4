5|$|No one {{familiar}} {{with the history of}} this country can deny that congressional committees are useful. It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E
5|$|The {{greater number}} of naturalists who have taken into {{consideration}} the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under {{the title of the}} Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head. I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline.|$|E

[...] But if an apparent discrepancy should arise, we have no right on principle, to exclude either in favour of the other.

He ran into conflict with the show's producers for an anti-war, anti Blair T-shirt worn by some members of his band.

2500|$|A staunch modernist might scoff {{that with}} the [...] "Night Landings" [...] of 1970 Jane Frank's art begins to [...] "go gentle into that good night" [...] (perhaps even lapsing into [...] "postmodernism"). But if these more literal aerial landscapes - created in 1970 and after - lose some of the tension that gives the earlier {{paintings}} their distinctive power, they nevertheless address, with an intensely intimate delight, a perspective on reality which <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>remember</b> was still quite young in 1970, at least as a painterly subject. In [...] "Aerial Perception" [...] (1985), author Margret Dreikausen sees Jane Frank's aerial landscapes as sharing {{the spirit of the}} work of artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Susan Crile, and others, in creating images which [...] "reflect contemporary interest in reality", experienced from a historically new vantage point. Dreikausen insists that this art [...] "does not merely show landscape from the air" [...] but incorporates the [...] "earthbound vision" [...] into [...] "remembered images from both spaces". Dreikausen also sees Frank's aerial paintings as consisting of two basic types: the [...] "day scenes" [...] (such as [...] "Ledge of Light") and the [...] "night landings" [...] (such as [...] "Night Landing: Sambura"). [...] The day scenes show a fascination with the play of actual shadows and false, painted ones, [...] "inviting the viewer more closely to inspect the textures on the canvas and its 'reality' [...] ". In the night landings, by contrast, the city is the focus, nestled in the canvas's aperture, like a precious jewel in a dark velvet box, with its [...] "enticing twinkling lights", suggesting [...] "the anticipation of the unknown, mysterious city.... The use of beads and glitter, partially covered with paint, conveys a sense of personal landscape".|$|E
