The Last Shout and Gay (which were released in the UK individually) were released as a collection called Absolutely Special in 2003. Another feature-length special <b>White</b> <b>Box</b> was released exclusively to the American market. It was eventually released in the United Kingdom on 15 November 2010 with its inclusion in the Absolutely Everything box set.|$|E

25|$|Eyewitness {{accounts}} of the attacks were mostly confused and spotty. Hotlines {{set up for the}} investigation were flooded with tips. Early tips from eyewitnesses included reports of a <b>white</b> <b>box</b> truck with dark lettering, speeding away from the Leisure World shopping center, with two men inside. Police across the area and the state of Maryland were pulling over white vans and trucks. A gray car was spotted speeding away after the October 4 shooting in Spotsylvania.|$|E
25|$|At {{this same}} time, around 1970, Cursor made other VW models {{in a similar}} style as the Audi. These were also made in plastic. One was the oval-eyed 411 sedan in light blue and also red (#868). It came in a promo looking <b>white</b> <b>box</b> with the car neatly shadowed in black on the sides. How much Wiking was {{involved}} in these models is uncertain, but it appears Wiking only produced {{a few of the}} older cars for the museum at the earlier time.|$|E

25|$|While we {{have not}} shown the Venn {{diagrams}} for the constants 0 and 1, they are trivial, being respectively a <b>white</b> <b>box</b> and a dark box, neither one containing a circle. However we could put a circle for x in those boxes, in which case each would denote a function of one argument, x, which returns the same value independently of x, called a constant function. As far as their outputs are concerned, constants and constant functions are indistinguishable; {{the difference is that}} a constant takes no arguments, called a zeroary or nullary operation, while a constant function takes one argument, which it ignores, and is a unary operation.|$|E
25|$|As such, {{he avoided}} any realist scenery or props. Instead, the set, {{designed}} by Sally Jacobs, {{was a simple}} <b>white</b> <b>box,</b> with no ceiling and two doors. In Stratford, black drapes were hung above the box to hide the stage machinery; on tour, Brook decided to remove them, leaving stagehands and lighting technicians visible. The purpose of this was to return the stage to {{the simplicity of the}} Elizabethan theatre, in which there was little scenery and the sense of location was generated by the poet's words. However, this approach was blended with modern elements: the trees of the forest were represented by giant slinky toys, and Titania's bower was a huge red feather.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, 2009 {{the online}} {{version of the}} Japanese {{newspaper}} Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that two new sequels would be released for the Wii: Wii Fit Plus, the sequel to Wii Fit, and a new Mario game tentatively called New Super Mario Bros. Wii, a sequel to New Super Mario Bros. New Super Mario Bros. Wii was announced at E3 2009 and Gamescom. To highlight {{the uniqueness of the}} title, Nintendo chose to release the game in a red case instead of the traditional <b>white</b> <b>box</b> color that Wii games generally have. At E3 2011, a variation of New Super Mario Bros. Wii, dubbed New Super Mario Bros.

25|$|The {{show has}} had an {{extended}} and sporadic run. The first three series were broadcast on the BBC from 1992 to 1995, followed by a series finale {{in the form of}} a two-part television film entitled The Last Shout in 1996. Creator Jennifer Saunders revived the show for a fourth series in 2001, after having written and submitted a pilot entitled Mirrorball, which recruited nearly all of the original cast in new roles. The pilot was intended to be turned into a series of episodes. However, Saunders felt the characters were far too rich and interesting to put aside, and were far better suited for her new story ideas. Instead of Mirrorball, a new series of Absolutely Fabulous was proposed to the BBC, which later commissioned the fourth series in 2001. From 2001 to 2004, two full series were produced, along with three one-off hour-long specials; Gay (retitled and issued as Absolutely Fabulous in New York for the United States) in 2002, Cold Turkey, a Christmas special in 2003, and <b>White</b> <b>Box</b> (another series finale), which aired in 2004. A Comic Relief sketch was broadcast in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a <b>white</b> <b>box</b> that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E
25|$|Texture mapping is {{a method}} for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a computer-generated graphic or 3D model. Its {{application}} to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr Edwin Catmull in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) {{to the surface of}} a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain <b>white</b> <b>box.</b> Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon. Procedural textures (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and bitmap textures (created in an image editing application or imported from a digital camera) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as UV mapping (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for polygon surfaces, while non-uniform rational B-spline (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic parameterization used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating normal maps and bump maps that correspond to a texture to simulate height and specular maps to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as environment mapping to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.|$|E

Within this habitat, it prefers rocky ridges or gullies, or transitional areas between different habitats, such as between woodland and grassland or fields in cultivated areas.|$|E
500|$|After the war, sales {{went from}} 800,000 {{a year to}} over one million. The French and German editions re-entered production, and new editions for Spain, Greece, Finland and Israel were first produced. By the late 1950s, Parker Brothers printed only game sets with board, pieces and {{materials}} housed in a single <b>white</b> <b>box.</b> Several copies of this edition were exhibited at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959. All of them were stolen from the exhibit. In the early 1960s, [...] "Monopoly happenings" [...] began to occur, mostly marathon game sessions, which were recognized by a Monopoly Marathon Records Documentation Committee in New York City. In addition to marathon sessions, games were played on large indoor and outdoor boards, within backyard pits, on the ceiling in a University of Michigan dormitory room, and underwater. In 1965, a 30th anniversary set was produced in a special plastic case.|$|E

500|$|Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is found}} {{in a range of}} habitats—in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in {{riparian}} woodlands. [...] It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light shrubby understorey, and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or <b>white</b> <b>box</b> (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it {{is found in}} woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.|$|E
500|$|The red wattlebird {{appears to}} be a {{permanent}} resident in much of its range, though its movements are poorly known. It {{appears to be}} partly migratory in Western Australia and the north coast of New South Wales. In southeastern New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, it appears to move to lower altitudes for winter. For instance, birds vacate the Brindabella Range over the cooler months. Overall, little pattern is discernible in the species' movements, though red wattlebirds appear to move to feed on populations of flowering banksias and eucalypts, such as winter-flowering banksias in Perth over the cooler months. Large numbers arrive in [...] time to feed on flowering native apples (Angophora) in Mudgee and Cobbora districts in central-western New South Wales, and on <b>white</b> <b>box</b> (Eucalyptus albens) at Barrington in central-northern New South Wales. A mainly resident population on the Swan Coastal Plain north of Perth is supplemented during winter by more arriving from inland areas. South of Perth, red wattlebirds are more locally nomadic, moving to new patches of blooming wildflowers. East of Perth in areas around Kellerberin, Kwolyin and Nangeenan, the red wattlebird is present from late autumn to spring, breeding in August and September. Around Lake Grace, the red wattlebird is present year-round.|$|E

[...] The video opens with intercalated beauty shots of will.i.am and Spears, until the scene cuts to will.i.am using his iPhone camera add-on and social network iam+. will.i.am says [...] "bring the action", and Spears is seen wearing a skin-tight skirt and a long-sleeved top with bare midriff and cleavage. Spears performs fast movements to the song's beat and sings the lyrics. She is then seen atop a <b>white</b> <b>box</b> and posing to the camera. When the track's chorus begins, will.i.am appears {{in front of an}} empty black background and is joined by Spears, who is now wearing a corseted leotard accented with feathers, standing on a moving walkway, and they sing together. After the first [...] "Britney, bitch" [...] line is heard, dancers perform to [...] "Scream & Shout". The video cuts to intercalated scenes of flaming disco balls, Spears image multiplied, and will.i.am wearing several gold accessories, including a cap with a gold plate that reads 'King'. Mor said that the video has no narrative, and that, [...] "there's no deep meaning to any of it...To me it was just about, you know, every scene is like a photo. I just liked it, I liked seeing the human heads, and I liked seeing the gold chains off of the plaques and then making it scroll. And then it was an awesome way to introduce characters, some friends of will...so that it wasn't just about them." [...] Amy Sciaretto of Pop Crush compared Spears' look on the video to a [...] "sexy, futuristic librarian".|$|E
