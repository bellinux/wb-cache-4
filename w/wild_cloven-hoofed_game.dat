Sarcocystis {{infection}} was determined among 91. 5 % of the 71 <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>game</b> animals (deer, mouflon, chamois, wild boar) : 100 % in 13 roe deer, 10 mouflons, 8 fallow deer, and 6 chamois; 85. 0 % in 20 wild boars, 78. 6 % in 14 red deer. In examined <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>game</b> in Slova-kia a high intensity of infection of Sarcocystis spp., was recorded. The highest intensity of infection was in wild boars (up to 1, 495 microcysts per gram) and roe deer (903 microcysts per gram). Ani-mals under one year of age showed low intensity of infection in comparison with adults: red deer (19 /g), mouflon (19 /g), chamois (19 /g) and wild boar (52 /g).

However, the interacting partners of VP 1 in host cells and the effects of these interactions in FMDV replication remain incompletely elucidated. Here, we identified a porcine cell protein, serine/threonine kinase 3 (STK 3), which interacts with FMDV VP 1 using the yeast two-hybrid system. The VP 1 -STK 3 interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in human embryonic kidney 293 T and porcine kidney 15 (PK- 15) cells. The carboxyl-terminal region (amino acids 180 – 214) of VP 1 was essential for its interaction with STK 3. The effects of overexpression and underexpressing of STK 3 in PK- 15 cells were assessed, and the results indicated that STK 3 significantly inhibited FMDV replication. Our data expand the role of STK 3 during viral infection, provide new information regarding the host cell kinases that are involved in viral replication, and identify potential targets for future antiviral strategies...|$|R
30|$|Southern African rangelands support both {{livestock}} and a rich diversity of wildlife, {{with the latter}} also central to national economies and conservation efforts. One wild animal often mentioned in the same line with FMD outbreaks in livestock {{in the region is}} the African buffalo, though restricted to wildlife areas in Botswana. This is because African buffalo (one of the ‘big five’ and a tourist attraction) are a known natural reservoir for SAT-type FMDV in southern Africa (Condy and Hedger 1974; Mapitse 1998), which makes control of FMDV not only challenging but its eradication untenable in the near future. The role of other <b>wild</b> <b>cloven-hoofed</b> animals apart from the African buffalo in virus maintenance and transmission of FMD has been extensively researched in southern Africa (e.g. Anderson et al. 1993; Letshwenyo et al. 2006; Vosloo et al. 2009; Weaver et al. 2013). Thus, the presence of wild ungulates in the study area such as the greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) and impala (A. melampus), which are known intermediary transmitters of FMDV, makes outbreaks likely. This is even more so due to an increased elephant population (an Appendix I CITES species and one of the ‘big five’, approximately 200, 000 in Botswana) which damages the non-electrified cordon fence, thus enabling smaller ungulates including possibly infected livestock to cross undeterred.|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease that affects domestic and <b>wild</b> <b>cloven-hoofed</b> animals causing very high morbidity that affect animal productivity and trade. Pigs {{are more susceptible to}} foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) via the gastrointestinal route, highlighting the importance of mucosal immunity to avoid initial infection, virus replication and spread. Systemic vaccines are in general poor inducers of mucosal immunity. A subunit vaccine that has the entire FMDV capsid polyprotein-coding region, delivered by replication-defective human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad 5 -A 24) has proven to be very effective against FMDV when inoculated intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC), but very little is known about its efficacy when administered via a mucosal route. We hypothesized that Ad 5 -A 24 could induce mucosal immunity and that immune response could be enhanced when this vaccine is coadministered with Ad 5 -vectored E. coli heat labile enterotoxin as a mucosal adjuvant. Specifically, four different LT-mutants (LTK 63, LTR 72, and LTB) were cloned into Ad 5 -vector and were tested in animals after intranasal (IN) administration. After two IN inoculations of Ad 5 -A 24 + Ad 5 -LTR 72, mice were protected against a lethal challenge of homologous FMDV. Furthermore, pigs inoculated with Ad 5 -A 24 + Ad 5 -LTR 72 IN and boosted IM were better protected than pigs inoculated IN-IN, after an overwhelming challenge of FMDV A 24. Further evaluation of specific immune response as well as the protective efficacy of Ad 5 -LTR 72 should be addressed with the appropriate challenge dose. Overall, this new approach of FMDV vaccination showed promising results and could be an efficient strategy in FMDV control and eradication...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (Fmd) Is an acute, highly {{contagious}} {{viral infection}} {{of domestic and}} <b>wild</b> <b>cloven-hoofed</b> animals. The virus is a single-stranded rna virus that has {{a high rate of}} nucleotide mutation and amino acid substitution. In southern africa the south african territories (Sat) 1 - 3 Sero-types of fmd virus are maintained by large numbers of african buffaloes (Syncerus caffer), Which provide a potential source of infection for domestic livestock and wild animals. During february 2001, an outbreak of sat- 2 was recorded in cattle in the fmd control zone of south africa, adjacent to the kruger national park (Knp). They had not been vaccinated against the disease since they form the buffer between the vaccination and free zones but {{in the face of the}} outbreak, they were vaccinated as part of the control measures to contain the disease. The virus was, however, isolated from some of them on several occasions up to may 2001. These isolates were characterized to determine the rate of genetic change in the main antigenic determinant, the 1 d/ 2 a gene. Nucleotide substitutions at 12 different sites were identified of which five led to amino acid changes. Three of these occurred in known antigenic sites, viz. The gh-loop and c-terminal part of the protein, and two of these have previously been shown to be subject to positive selection. Likelihood models indicated that the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous changes among the outbreak sequences recovered from cattle was four times higher than among comparable sequences isolated from wildlife, suggesting that the virus may be under greater selective pressure during rapid transmission event...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), the causative {{agent of}} foot-and-mouth disease, is an Aphthovirus within the Picornaviri-dae family. During {{infection}} with FMDV, several host cell membrane rearrangements occur to form sites of viral replication. FMDV protein 2 C {{is part of}} the replication complex and thought to have multiple roles during virus replication. To better un-derstand the role of 2 C in the process of virus replication, we have been using a yeast two-hybrid approach to identify host pro-teins that interact with 2 C. We recently reported that cellular Beclin 1 is a natural ligand of 2 C and that it is involved in the au-tophagy pathway, which was shown to be important for FMDV replication. Here, we report that cellular vimentin is also a specific host binding partner for 2 C. The 2 C-vimentin interaction was further confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and immu-nofluorescence staining to occur in FMDV-infected cells. It was shown that upon infection a vimentin structure forms around 2 C and that this structure is later resolved or disappears. Interestingly, overexpression of vimentin had no effect on virus replica-tion; however, overexpression of a truncated dominant-negative form of vimentin resulted in a significant decrease in viral yield. Acrylamide, which causes disruption of vimentin filaments, also inhibited viral yield. Alanine scanning mutagenesis was used to map the specific amino acid residues in 2 C critical for vimentin binding. Using reverse genetics, we identified 2 C residues that are necessary for virus growth, suggesting that the interaction between FMDV 2 C and cellular vimentin is essential for virus replication.

In Taiwan, there was a severe outbreak of FMD after more than 60 years freedom from the disease. The virus strain, O Taiwan 97 from the March 1997 outbreak of FMD in Taiwan, however, has been shown to have a species-specific adaptation to pigs. Although there are 7 distinct serotypes of FMD found in different regions of the world, this study focuses on the pig-adapted type O strain of FMD. After the FMD outbreak commenced in Taiwan, the spread of disease was very rapid and the whole of the western parts of Taiwan was affected within a few days after the diagnosis of FMD was confirmed. In some situations airborne transmission of FMD virus was suspected and it was speculated that this was the explanation for such rapid spread in Taiwan. Therefore, studies were conducted to investigate the transmissibility of O Taiwan/ 97 FMDV to susceptible pigs by direct and indirect spread including airborne spread in an enclosed animal house. This study showed that pigs in direct contact with challenged pigs became infected but none of the close-contact pigs became infected. These experiments clearly demonstrated that the pig adapted strain O Taiwan/ 97 was only efficiently transmitted by direct contact. This indicates that effective control against future outbreaks of pig adapted FMDV strains could be achieved by restriction of pig movement and stamping out if the outbreak has been detected in the early stages and prior to the movements of pigs from the infected premises. The measures used to control the Taiwanese FMD outbreak in 1997 were initially the slaughter of whole herds in the infected premises. However, with the rapid spread and large numbers of cases, the decision was taken to use universal compulsory vaccination of pig herds to control the outbreak when sufficient supply of vaccines was organized. Type O FMD vaccines were imported from a number of major FMD vaccine manufactures from around the world. Initially, vaccine efficacy for the imported vaccines was tested by measurement of neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated pigs. To establish the relationship between serum neutralizing titers and protection from foot and mouth disease in pigs after vaccination, challenge studies were conducted with O/Taiwan/ 97 FMD in vaccinated pigs. Additionally, antibody responses to structural (neutralizing antibody) and non-structural proteins (NSP) were evaluated in vaccinated pig herds after primary and secondary vaccination in herds infected before and after vaccination. In order to be able to monitor the circulation of virus in vaccinated pig populations, valid diagnostic kits based on the detection of antibody against NSP were required. These tests needed to be evaluated against pig sera derived from challenge studies and natural FMD outbreaks. Three commercially available ELISAs (Cedi, UBI and Checkit), which were available to differentiate infected from vaccinated pigs, were tested and results showed that the Cedi test had the optimal sensitivity and specificity for pig adapted type O FMD testing. This test was used to retrospectively evaluate the sera collected from infected and non-infected pig herds collected sequentially in the year after the 1997 FMD outbreak in Taiwan. These studies also showed that the early vaccines used, stimulated NSP antibody production in swine herds that were vaccinated but not infected. This resulted in the requirement for purified FMD vaccines to be used when monitoring programs for FMD infection by NSP testing were in place. In these studies, it was also demonstrated that the purified FMD vaccines used later in the control program did not induce NSP antibody after multiple double dosage to pigs. Although clinical FMD appeared to be successfully controlled with vaccination program in Taiwan it was essential for the eradication plan to maintain active surveillance for NSP reactors in the pig population. The UBI and Cedi NSP kits were applied as screening and confirmatory tests, respectively, to pig sera collected in auction markets distributed around Taiwan to monitor for evidence of the circulation of FMD virus. Herds with positive reactors were followed-up by clinical inspection and 15 sera from suspected herds were further sampled. Negative results were obtained from all these investigation. With the absence of clinical outbreaks and the lack of evidence of FMDV circulation in the field from the NSP reactor surveillance, the Taiwanese government has progressed the eradication plan to a progressive cessation of vaccination, commencing with banning of vaccination on one isolated island in December 2006. The absence of outbreaks on that island, paved the way for further cessation of FMD vaccination in Taiwan from July 2008...|$|R

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} disease of <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>cloven–hoofed</b> animals such as cattle, swine and deer. It is caused {{by one of the}} most contagious animal diseases known; FMD virus (FMDV). Since the disease is endemic in many countries, transmission by international travel/trade presents an on-going potential threat to the UK. Very little is known at the molecular level about how FMDV replicates within host cells. In this study, FMDV replicons have been used to investigate FMDV RNA replication and to improve our understanding of the viral life cycle: a process which will aid in the production {{of a new generation of}} live-attenuated vaccine candidate strains. Sequences encoding the capsid coding region of the genome have been replaced with green fluorescent protein (GFP) such that replication can be monitored in live cells via GFP fluorescence. This provides a rapid, non-invasive screen for replicative fitness that can be used outwith high disease security facilities. Differences between replicating and non-replicating forms could easily be distinguished, highlighting the potential of this system to screen for attenuated genomes. The FMDV replicon system was improved through a series of construct modifications until an optimal system was produced. A range of different methods were used to attenuate the replication of these genomes. Of major significance is the finding that increasing dinucleotide frequencies were shown to decrease growth kinetics of Echovirus 7 – as opposed to altering the codon-pair bias - and the application of this finding to construction of further replicon systems (and RNA viruses in general) is described...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an {{extremely}} contagious viral disease of cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, and many <b>cloven-hoofed</b> <b>wild</b> animals. FMDV serotypes O and Asia 1 have circulated separately in China during the last fifty years, and eliminating infected animals and vaccination are the main policies to prevent and control FMD. Antibodies to NSPs exist in infected animals, and were utilized to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. The reliability of detection of 3 AB or 3 ABC antibodies is {{higher than that of}} other NSPs. The test of 3 AB is still credible because 3 C protein's immunogenicity is the weakest. The 2 C protein, immediately N-terminal of 3 AB, was used to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. The use of the immunochromatographic strip is facile for clinical laboratories lacking specialized equipment and for rapid field diagnosis. Results In this study, an immunochromatographic strip with non-structural protein (NSP) 2 C' 3 AB was developed and validated to differentiate foot-and-mouth disease infected from vaccinated animals. A part of N-terminal of 2 C protein gene and whole 3 AB gene were connected and prokaryotically expressed as the antigens labeled with colloidal gold was used as the detector, the 2 C' 3 AB protein and rabbits anti- 2 C' 3 AB antibodies were blotted on the nitrocellulose(NC) membrane for the test and control lines, respectively. 387 serum samples were collected to evaluate the characteristics of the strip in comparison with existing commercial 3 ABC antibody ELISA kit. The coincidence rate of pigs negative serum, pigs vaccinated serum, pigs infected serum was 100 %, 97. 2 %, 95. 0 %, respectively. The coincidence rate of cattle negative serum, cattle vaccinated serum, cattle infected serum was 100 %, 96. 7 %, 98. 0 %, respectively.

40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) {{causes the}} most {{contagious}} transboundary disease of animals, affecting both <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>cloven-hoofed</b> animals. Similarly to other RNA viruses, FMDV is highly variable {{as a result}} of the inherent low fidelity of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The accumulation of this variability and relatedness between FMDV sequences was used to provide evidence for modes of transmission (fomite) as well as a constant clock rate across two FMDV topotypes (~ 8. 70 x 10 - 3 substitutions/site/year), during the 1967 UK FMD epidemic, using full genome consensus sequencing. However, during an epidemic, virus replicates within multiple animals, where it is also replicating and evolving within different tissues and cells. Each scale of evolution, from a single cell to multiple animals across the globe, involves evolutionary processes that shape the viral diversity generated below the level of the consensus. During this PhD project, next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to dissect the fine scale viral population diversity of FMDV. Collaboration with the Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine at the University of Glasgow provided the specialist bioinformatic and statistical capabilities required for the analysis of NGS datasets. As part of this collaboration, a new systematic approach was developed to process NGS data and distinguish genuine mutations from artefacts. Additionally, evolutionary models were applied to this data to estimate parameters such as the genome-wide mutation rate of FMDV (upper limit of 7. 8 x 10 - 4 per nt). Analysis of the mutation spectra generated from a clonal control study established a mutation frequency threshold of 0. 5 % above which there can be confidence that 95 % of mutations are real in the sense that they are present in the sampled virus population. This threshold, together with an optimized protocol, was used for the more extensive investigation of within and between host viral population dynamics during transmission. Analysis of mutation spectra and site-specific mutations revealed that intra-host bottlenecks are typically more pronounced than inter-host bottlenecks. NGS analysis has distinguished between the population structure of multiple samples taken from a single host, which may provide the means to reconstruct both intra- and inter-host transmission routes in the future. A more sophisticated understanding of viral diversity at its finest scales could hold the key to the better understanding of viral pathogenesis and, therefore development of effective and sustainable disease treatment and control strategies...|$|R
