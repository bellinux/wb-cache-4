5|$|During a December 4, 2005, game at Heinz Field, T. J. Houshmandzadeh of the Cincinnati Bengals <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> {{feet on a}} Towel {{after he}} scored a touchdown. Although the Bengals managed a 7-point victory in that regular season game, the Steelers came back to defeat them 3117 in the playoffs, {{on their way to}} a victory in Super Bowl XL. The Bengals did not reach the playoffs again until the 2009-10 season, after Houshmandzadeh had left the team.|$|E
5|$|Penn's brother {{revealed}} {{two days}} after the bout that the Penn camp would be making a formal complaint to the NSAC. In addition, Penn's head coach, Rudy Valentino alleged that St-Pierre also had an illegal substance on his body during his April 2008 rematch with Matt Serra. NSAC Executive Director Keith Kizer confirmed that improprieties had occurred in St-Pierre's corner. He witnessed St-Pierre's cornerman Phil Nurse apply Vaseline to St-Pierre's face and then immediately rub St-Pierre's shoulders and back before Nurse <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> hands. Kizer had St-Pierre's back wiped down after the second round, and confirmed after the third round that no Vaseline was being applied. Kizer was critical of the cornerman's action, but expressed doubts that the controversy would overturn St-Pierre's victory.|$|E
5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, {{in spite of}} their mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets to remove him from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated by the loss of his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E

25|$|Biographer Wilfrid Sheed {{wrote in}} his book, Muhammad Ali: A Portrait in Words and Photographs, that Ali's protests were heard by ringside members of the Nation of Islam who {{initially}} suspected Dundee had blinded his fighter and that the trainer deliberately <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> own eyes with the corner sponge to demonstrate to Ali's approaching bodyguards {{that he had not}} intentionally blinded him.|$|E
25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E
2500|$|In the Gospel of John, a Mary {{appears in}} {{connection}} to two incidents: the raising {{from the dead}} of her brother Lazarus and the anointing of Jesus. The identification of this being the same Mary in both incidents is given explicitly by the author: [...] "Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha. This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> feet with her hair." [...] The mention of her sister Martha suggests a connection with the aforementioned woman in Luke.|$|E

2500|$|Host Laughton {{introduced}} the singer from New York. [...] Once on camera, Elvis {{cleared his throat}} and said, [...] "Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen. Wow", and <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> brow. [...] "This is probably the greatest honor I've ever had in my life. Ah. There's not much I can say except, it really makes you feel good. We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ..." [...] "Don't Be Cruel", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by [...] "Love Me Tender". According to Elaine Dundy, Presley sang [...] "Love Me Tender" [...] "straight, subdued and tender ... —a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before".|$|E
2500|$|... "Then {{the white}} man who had {{introduced}} Sitting Bull arose again {{and said he would}} interpret what the chief had said. [...] He then started telling the audience all about the Battle of the Little Big Horn, generally spoken as the ‘Custer massacre.’ [...] He [...] mentioned how the Sioux were all prepared for battle, and how they had swooped down on Custer and <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> soldiers all out. [...] He told so many lies that I had to smile. [...] Then {{the white man}} said that all those who wished to shake hands with Sitting Bull would please line up if they cared to meet the man who had killed Custer. [...] It made me wonder what sort of people the whites were, anyway. [...] Perhaps they were glad to have Custer killed, and were really pleased to shake the hand with the man who had killed him!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} when the priest had {{finished}} the sprinkling, he <b>wiped</b> <b>his</b> hand {{on the body of}} the cow, climbed down, and kindled the fire with wood chips. But Rabbi Akiva said that he kindled the fire with dry branches of palm trees. When the cow's carcass burst in the fire, the priest took up a position outside the pit, took hold of the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool, and said to the observers: [...] "Is this cedar wood? Is this hyssop? Is this scarlet wool?" [...] He repeated each question three times, and the observers answered [...] "Yes" [...] three times to each question. The priest then wrapped the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet wool together with the ends of the wool and cast them into the burning pyre. When the fire burned out, they beat the ashes with rods and then sifted them with sieves. They then divided the ashes into three parts: One part was deposited on the rampart, one on the Mount of Olives, and one was divided among the courses of priests who performed the Temple services in turn.|$|E
