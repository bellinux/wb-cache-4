40|$|A {{position}} sensor, {{such as a}} rotary position sensor, {{includes the}} signal-conditioning electronics in the housing. The signal-conditioning electronics are disposed on a printed wiring board, which is assembled with another printed wiring board including the sensor windings to provide a sub-assembly. A mu-metal shield is interposed between the printed wiring boards to prevent magnetic interference. The sub-assembly is disposed in the sensor housing adjacent to an inductor board which turns on a shaft. The inductor board emanates an internally or externally generated excitation signal that induces a signal in the sensor windings. The induced signal represents the rotary position of the inductor board relative to the sensor <b>winding</b> <b>board...</b>|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} unit that {{contains}} a rotary-position or a rotary-speed sensor, plus electronic circuitry necessary for its operation, all enclosed in a single housing with a shaft for coupling to an external rotary machine. This rotation sensor unit is complete: when its shaft is mechanically connected {{to that of the}} rotary machine and it is supplied with electric power, it generates an output signal directly indicative of the rotary position or speed, without need for additional processing by other circuitry. The incorporation of all of the necessary excitatory and readout circuitry into the housing (in contradistinction to using externally located excitatory and/or readout circuitry) in a compact arrangement is the major difference between this unit and prior rotation-sensor units. The sensor assembly inside the housing includes excitatory and readout integrated circuits mounted on a circular printed-circuit board. In a typical case in which the angle or speed transducer(s) utilize electromagnetic induction, the assembly also includes another circular printed-circuit board on which the transducer windings are mounted. A sheet of high-magnetic permeability metal ("mu metal") is placed between the <b>winding</b> <b>board</b> and the electronic-circuit board to prevent spurious coupling of excitatory signals from the transducer windings to the readout circuits. The housing and most of the other mechanical hardware can be common to a variety of different sensor designs. Hence, the unit can be configured to generate any of variety of outputs by changing the interior sensor assembly. For example, the sensor assembly could contain an analog tachometer circuit that generates an output proportional (in both magnitude and sign or in magnitude only) to the speed of rotation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Threshing is an {{integral}} part of postharvest activities for cereal and legume crops. In many developing countries, threshing is carried out manually by farmers that lead to low quality of paddy rice and grain loss. When the rice production increases, consequently the manual threshing becomes arduous. In order to mechanize this process, a throw-in type thresher JEP based on a prototype of a thresher made by IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) was designed and tested. The <b>wind</b> <b>board</b> was modified after testing to enhance threshing quality. Also, in place of welding the whole machine is joined by bolts, nuts and rivets for easy assembling and disassembling. Output capacity from the performance test on the machine was 316 kg/hr at a moisture content of 21 %wb (wet base) for IR 28 rice variety. This could attain 350 - 400 kg/hr when both, the speed and the feeding speed increase. The overall results are impressive and it will help improve drudgery and threshing challenges with small scale farmers...|$|R

In this paper, considering the mutual interactions between gas and particles, and the particle collisions, the Euler two-fluid model is applied to simulate the gas-particle turbulent flow in a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) reactor with SCT that is adopted the combustion technology of mixed lower rank fuel. The solid flow character has studied with the different inlet position of ejecting coal powder in CFB with SCT and the different inlet velocity of the secondary air. With the different inlet velocity of the secondary air and the position of ejecting coal powder apart from horizontal <b>wind</b> distributed <b>board</b> 2600 mm and 2000 mm, the velocity of the particle changes much higher and the flow stability is unstable. For the sparse region segment of CFB with SCT, higher particle-concentration can’t be formed. Ejecting coal powder position apart from horizontal <b>wind</b> distributed <b>board</b> 2300 mm, the flow stability is stable and it can form much higher concentration particle flow in the sparse region segment. And the results have also been shown: to keep the inlet secondary velocity at 2 m/s and the disposed inlet position at 2300 mm, the CFB with SCT, which is adopted the combustion technology of mixed lower rank fuel, will be formed higher concentration particle flow above the dense phase region, and could make the particles be combusted at higher combustion efficiency. The core-annulus flow structure is still formed in the different position of ejecting coal powder of CFB with SCT.
