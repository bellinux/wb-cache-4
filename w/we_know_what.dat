5|$|We {{probably}} have more influences than <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> to do with. We have two main styles {{that have been}} influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set {{if we get a}} chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.|$|E

He provided the narration and script for Powers of Ten in 1977. With his wife, Phylis, they turned the same material into a coffee table book in 1982. He also appeared as himself in the science documentary film Target...Earth? in 1980. In 1987, PBS aired his six part miniseries, The Ring of Truth: An Inquiry into How <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> We Know, which he also hosted. In addition, he was a columnist and reviewer of books on science for Scientific American starting in 1965.|$|E
5|$|You Me at Six {{formed in}} Weybridge, Surrey in 2004. The band's line-up {{consisted}} of vocalist Josh Franceschi, guitarists Max Helyer and Chris Miller, bassist Matt Barnes, and drummer Joe Phillips. The group released an EP, <b>We</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> It Means to Be Alone in 2006, after which, Phillips left the band. Dan Flint, a friend the band {{had gone to}} college with, was initially asked to fill in on drums for a tour. He ended up becoming Phillips' permanent replacement following the band's appearance at Slam Dunk Festival 2007. The band then released another EP later in 2007.|$|E

In December 2012, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed [...] "It's not going to be called that [...] It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the Eurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the goal is and we {{are trying to figure out}} effective ways to slow down or prevent it".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} {{considered}} by most reviewers as a success {{for being able to}} cover a controversial subject in an inoffensive manner. Jonathan Boudreaux for tvdvdreviews.com said, [...] "The Emmy-winning script by Larry David introduced the brilliant euphemism 'master of my domain' to our lexicon and helped the series to truly become must-see TV. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the episode is about, but the script never explicitly says it. 'The Contest' effortlessly takes a potentially incendiary subject and renders it utterly inoffensive yet hilarious." [...] He also said that [...] "The Contest" [...] was [...] "one of the series' most infamous" [...] episodes. Donna Dorsett from audaud.com commented on the refusal to use the word [...] "masturbation," [...] saying, [...] "If the word had been used, even once, the show would not have been nearly as hilarious.

500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{rented a}} room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before {{discarding}} half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are really more rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us." [...] Like Where You Want to Be, the band pushed themselves to write the best songs they could.

500|$|Although in {{more recent}} seasons Flanders has become a {{caricature}} of the Christian right, {{he is still a}} favorite of many Christian viewers. Dr. Rowan Williams, a former Archbishop of Canterbury, is a confessed Simpsons fan, and likes Flanders. Ned's [...] "unbearable piousness" [...] has been described as [...] "The Simpsons sharpest critique of organized religion. The show's implicit argument seems to be that humorless obsessives like Ned have hijacked religious institutions, removing them from the center of society to a place where only those who know their brides of Beth Chedruharazzeb from their wells of Zohassadar can seek solace." [...] Steve Goddard of the website Ship of Fools said, [...] "Ned is an innocent abroad in a world of cynicism and compromise.

500|$|The {{proprietary}} Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for {{the game}} to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities, and the Euphoria and Bullet engines handle further animation and environment rendering tasks. The team found they could render the game world with greater detail than in Grand Theft Auto IV because they had {{become familiar with the}} PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360's hardware. Art director Aaron Garbut said that while the consoles' ageing hardware were tiring to work with, the team could still render detailed lighting and shadows and [...] "maintain a consistent look". Vice president Dan Houser agreed and felt that working on Grand Theft Auto IV with relatively new hardware was a challenge, but added [...] "now <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> the hardware's capable of, so it's become a lot easier to move things along and a lot more fun, too". The PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions fit onto one Blu-Ray Disc; Xbox 360 copies are distributed on two DVD discs and require an 8 GB installation on the HDD or external storage device; while the Microsoft Windows (PC) version takes up seven DVD disks. The team asserted that any differences between the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions would be negligible.|$|E
