500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> on the South Side, holding his own. I {{was scared to death}} of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E
2500|$|The {{prosecution}} presented considerable {{evidence in}} an attempt to bind the Earps and Holliday over for trial. On {{the second day of the}} hearings, William Allen testified for the prosecution that [...] "the firing commenced by the Earp party. I think it was Doc Holliday who fired first." [...] Johnny Behan testified that he tried to prevent the confrontation. I [...] "told them...I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> for the purpose of disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. They wouldn't heed me, paid no attention. And I said, 'Gentleman, I am Sheriff of this County, and I am not going to allow any trouble if I can help it.' They brushed past me." [...] He said Cowboys had put up their hands or thrown open their coats to show they weren't armed, and that Doc Holliday had fired first. He testified that the first five shots had come from the Earps. He clearly blamed the Earps and Doc Holliday for instigating the shootout.|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Korine {{contacted}} rapper Riff Raff about {{appearing in}} an upcoming film of his which {{would turn out to}} be Spring Breakers. Once the trailer was released there was speculation that the character Alien was based around Riff Raff. According to Franco, his character is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. [...] "Of course Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> in the place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie." [...] After much back and forth between both camps about the issue, during July 2013 Riff Raff announced he was suing the creators of Spring Breakers for $10 million for [...] "sampling" [...] his life without his permission or a proper producer credit.|$|E

60|$|Time {{and again}} they called down. But no answer came back. If Tom <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> he was either {{unconscious}} or dead.|$|E
6000|$|... --I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better be. I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> {{the other}} day, and it 'peared like she couldn't talk of {{anything}} else but Mister Norcross, Mister Norcross, till I was sick of his name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} the best thing we can do <b>is</b> to move <b>down</b> to the Big River. I've <b>been</b> <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> and that's all right," [...] said Billy Mink.|$|R
50|$|I {{was playing}} blues on Beale St. when I was {{fifteen years old}} I was invited to play with B.B. King <b>down</b> <b>there</b> when it <b>was</b> too cool for a white boy to <b>be</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> playing.|$|R

6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} company {{now in the}} barracks," [...] said Rectus. [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> There are two men-of-war in the harbor, but one of them's a Spanish vessel, and I'm pretty sure she wouldn't bother us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He got a horrid scare and a right good scraping, for he didn't {{know any}} one <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Couldn't go fishing either, {{he was so}} lame, and I had the {{cherries}} after all. Served him right, didn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{need any}} spurring {{to make me}} go down again, for I was all on fire {{to know what was}} on board the other ship, which I was sure was English, having had a good {{opportunity}} of looking at it while I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
50|$|Newport News and Norfolk, Virginia {{were without}} {{communications}} as {{the telephone and}} telegraph lines <b>were</b> <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> <b>were</b> reports {{of water in the}} James River resembling a tidal wave.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{come from}} the South," [...] he said. [...] "My folks own a large cotton {{plantation}} there. Larry <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> once {{and we had a}} lot of fun. He told me of the sport he had had with you. You must have had great times at Putnam Hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] {{continued}} Lady Harman, [...] "I suppose--I shall join you; but as {{a matter}} of fact you see, what I've done to-day has been to come right away....

6000|$|... "What {{about the}} partridges, though," [...] he {{reminded}} her, [...] "and the hares? I {{talked to a}} farmer when I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> the other day, and he complained bitterly {{that there was only}} one vermin-killer on the whole estate and that the place was swarming with rabbits. I rather enjoy rabbit shooting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly!" [...] Granet agreed, {{glancing at}} his watch. [...] "This is {{absolutely}} ripping! We shall <b>be</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> by one o'clock. Why is {{this to be}} Conyers' last day for entertaining?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She can't <b>be</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> It's {{a mighty}} curious thing {{where she could}} have got to, though. Look here, young man, are you sure you've no idea where your sister is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--poor boy! He meant it. With a word;--with a look, {{he would}} have <b>been</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> kneeling. He asked me whether I liked him well enough. What do you think I did?" ...|$|R

60|$|DONE. Curious thing {{how some}} women carry a Fate with them. There was a Mrs. Deegie in the Central Provinces whose men {{invariably}} fell away and got married. It became a regular proverb with us when I <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> I remember three men desperately devoted to her, and they all, one after another, took wives.|$|E
60|$|FANNY. Worse. I've been lying. [Ernest gives vent {{to a low}} whistle.] Said I didn't {{know what}} had become of that yellow poplin with the black lace flounces, that they've had altered for me.

6000|$|... "Well, what is it? And cut it middlin' short, because it's {{better for}} us to <b>be</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em {{a chance to talk}} us over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] she remarked, [...] "I am not at {{all sure}} that was the case with Captain Graham's invention.

6000|$|... "We <b>are</b> {{not going}} <b>down</b> <b>there</b> {{to get into}} any fights," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "We <b>are</b> going <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to attend strictly to business. If the Mexicans will only leave us alone, we'll leave them alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Sir Lionel, I'll let you off; {{the more}} {{especially}} as I have <b>been</b> <b>down</b> <b>there</b> myself already, and got dreadfully draggled in doing so. Oh! I declare, there is Miss Waddington in the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma and I will <b>be</b> <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> Lord Haverley--he <b>is</b> {{first cousin}} to mamma, you know--has taken a house {{there for the}} month, and {{he is going to}} have a large party, and we <b>are</b> going <b>down</b> for Ryde week." ...|$|R
