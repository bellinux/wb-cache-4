We got along very well and a friendship developed from that point on. Several months later I wrote a song <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{would be good to}} record a duet with Selena."

500|$|The {{story as}} it had {{appeared}} in the London Daily Advertiser had already aroused the public's interest. [...] Fielding had left London believing that he had [...] "ended all the trouble <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it necessary for me to give myself in this affair", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several [...] "Noble Lords" [...] had attempted to contact him. [...] On 15February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. [...] Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, [...] "either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence [...] for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through". [...] A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. [...] George Squires could not be found.|$|E
500|$|After Williams {{completed}} several {{drafts of}} the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood {{to aid in}} further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained [...] "a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was important for Jane." [...] Hood was attracted to the film because he believed [...] "the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for Pride and Prejudice." [...] Calling Austen a [...] "genius" [...] and [...] "one of the top two or three prose writers of all time", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy [...] "was absolutely essential in shaping her work." [...] Hood acknowledged however that Becoming Jane is [...] "based on the facts as they are known {{and the majority of}} characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape." ...|$|E

Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} Conrad would guest star on Family Guy was {{originally}} announced in October 2008.

[...] The staff was impressed with Conrad's performance, saying that she [...] "took it very seriously." [...] Conrad praised her time at the show, calling it [...] "amazing", and said that [...] "they destroy me in it. I'm totally making fun of myself. [...] It was funny, I had to go over historical facts and like, biology and weird formulas I had no idea about." [...] Conrad explained that she is playing a character on The Hills, [...] "because America likes dumb people", and that [...] "The idea in the episode is that they make fun of me for being dumb, and then discover that I'm actually a genius, [...] It's a more exaggerated version of who I am, but fun to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Mitchell and Webb's {{next project}} came in 2003, with {{starring}} {{roles in the}} Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show, as flatmates Mark Corrigan and Jeremy Usbourne respectively. The show originated from writers Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain's failed attempt to complete a team-written sitcom for the BBC; they had an old script {{that they wanted to}} revive and Mitchell and Webb helped out, with it eventually evolving into Peep Show. Despite low viewing figures (which almost got the show cancelled after series three) the show was received to wide critical acclaim. The British Sitcom Guide called it [...] "without a doubt one of the best sitcoms of the decade." [...] Ricky Gervais has been cited as saying [...] "the last thing I got genuinely excited about on British TV was Peep Show, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was the best sitcom since Father Ted". The BBC hailed Mitchell's performance in the series, citing that [...] "As Mark Corrigan, David reached out to all those middle-aged men in a twentysomething's body, who believe drugs are boring and systems are necessary if society is to function at all." [...] Mitchell has stated that he empathises with Mark and enjoys playing him and that he [...] "agrees with many of [...] opinions." [...] Peep Show has aired nine series, making it the longest-running sitcom in Channel 4 history.|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E

500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> were all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I read somewhere that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{began writing}} the scripts, working to a {{delivery}} deadline of February 1973. Much {{of the setting}} for the story was influenced by contemporary political events such as strikes, power cuts, the Oil Crisis and developments in the Space Race, especially the planned Apollo-Soyuz missions and Skylab. Writing in the listings magazine TV Times to promote the serial, Kneale said, [...] "Quatermass {{is a story of}} the future – but perhaps only a few years from now. There are some clues already in the most obvious places: the streets. Pavements littered with rubbish. Walls painted with angry graffiti. Belfast black with smoke and rage. Worst of all, the mindless violence". Concerns about the state of society, especially the [...] "dropout" [...] culture of the youth movement, had been a theme of Kneale's writing for some time. This was seen in such works as The Big, Big Giggle, an unmade play about a teenage suicide cult; The Year of the Sex Olympics, about the consequences of a world with no censorship or inhibitions; and Bam! Pow! Zap! (1969), about teenage delinquents, all of which fed into the world depicted in the new Quatermass serial. Kneale said, [...] "I looked at the alarming aspects of contemporary trends. Since then, we'd seen 'flower power' and hippies, so all I did was bring them into the story. It was written in 1972 and it was about the sixties really". Another theme that had crept into Kneale's writing at this time—as seen in Wine of India, about compulsory euthanasia for the elderly, and later the Beasts episode [...] "During Barty's Party", about an elderly couple terrorised by rats—was the consequences of growing old. Kneale later recalled, [...] "The theme I was trying to get to was the old redressing the balance with the young, saving the young, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> a nice, paradoxical, ironic idea after the youth-oriented 60s".|$|E

2500|$|Greg Graffin {{called his}} {{influences}} [...] "pop-sounding rock tunes {{that were not}} necessarily commercial." [...] Brett Gurewitz acknowledges attempting to emulate Germs singer Darby Crash early on in Bad Religion's lyrical style. [...] "He wrote some intelligent stuff, and didn't {{shy away from the}} vocabulary, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was cool." [...] In addition to their use of unusually sophisticated vocabulary for a punk band, Bad Religion is also known for their frequent use of vocal harmonies. They took their cues from the Adolescents, {{in the way that they}} used three-part harmonies. Bassist Jay Bentley says, [...] "Seeing The Adolescents live, it was so brilliant. So, in a way, the Adolescents influenced us into saying we can do it, too, because look, they're doing it." ...|$|E

Shortly after Sparks' album was released Dobson said, [...] "Jordin Sparks just did , which was on Sunday Love, which was very cool. She did kind of, like, a more R version of it, which I think is really nice, actually. It was really cool that she didn't try and do a rock version of it, and she did what she's more comfortable with, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was awesome."

2500|$|Initially, {{the studio}} wanted Gilliam {{to update the}} book for the 1990s, which he considered, [...] "And then I looked at the film and said, 'No, that's apologizing.

If it's an accurate representation of that book, <b>which</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was an accurate representation of a particular time and place and people." [...] Terry Gilliam, while speaking to Sight & Sound magazine, highlighted if he had updated the movie to the 1990s it would just [...] "be a story about two people going to excess" [...] by keeping it set in the 70's, using {{the backdrop of the}} Vietnam War and a perceived loss of the American dream, offers reasoning to the characters actions.|$|E
