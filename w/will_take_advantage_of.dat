5|$|Aarhus has {{increasingly}} been investing in environmental planning and, {{in accordance with}} national policy, aims to be CO2 neutral and independent of fossil fuels for heating by 2030. The municipal power plants were adapted for this purpose in the 2010s. In 2015, the municipality took over three private straw-fired heating plants and the year after, a new 77 MW {{combined heat and power}} biomass plant at Lisbjerg Power Station was completed while Studstrup Power Station finished a refit to move from coal to wood chips. In conjunction with the development of the Docklands district there are plans for a utility scale seawater heat pump which <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> fluctuating electricity prices to supply the district heating system.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} grid storage to provide peak power {{is reduced by}} demand side time of use pricing, one of the {{benefits}} of smart meters. At the household level, consumers may choose less expensive off-peak times for clothes washer/dryers, dishwashers, showers and cooking. As well commercial and industrial users <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> cost savings by deferring some processes to off-peak times.|$|E

25|$|In {{low-level}} languages, {{the concept}} of macros has become synonymous with textual substitution of source-code due to {{the widespread use of}} the C preprocessor. However, high-level languages such as Lisp pre-dated C in their use of macros that were far more powerful. It is this Lisp-like macro concept that Perl 6 <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of.</b> The power of this sort of macro {{stems from the fact that}} it operates on the program as a high-level data structure, rather than as simple text, and has the full capabilities of the programming language at its disposal.|$|E
25|$|Combined cycle {{plants are}} usually powered by natural gas, {{although}} fuel oil, synthesis gas or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. Biofuels {{can also be}} used. Integrated solar combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look ISCC section). Next generation nuclear power plants {{are also on the}} drawing board which <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the higher temperature range made available by the Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.|$|E
500|$|The nest is most {{commonly}} located [...] {{above the ground}} in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials. A new nest is built for each brood, and in northern areas the first clutch is usually placed in an evergreen tree or shrub while later broods are placed in deciduous trees. The American robin does not shy away from nesting close to human habitation and will frequently construct nests under eaves or awnings on human homes when such locations provide adequate shelter. Robins are not cavity nesters, and so will generally not use a bird house, but <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> artificial nesting platforms.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Improving {{the quality}} of healthcare, {{reducing}} medical errors, guarantying the safety of patients are the most serious duty of the hospital. Electronic Health Record (EHR) was introduced to achieve these goals. HER has a very large data source which can guide and improve the clinical decision making process. In this paper, we will propose a distributed Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) architecture which satisfies the compatibility, interoperability, and scalability objectives of EHR. The proposed framework <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> EHR, data mining techniques, clinical databases, domain experts’ knowledge bases, and available technologies and standards to provide decision making support for the healthcare personnel...|$|R
2500|$|Two70° is {{a lounge}} on decks 5–7 at {{the stern of}} the ship, which {{features}} three-story-high 270-degree panoramic ocean views, a café, and an ice bar. Automatic window shades can cover the windows to limit the amount of sunlight entering, and a 13-projector projection mapping system can project live views from outside the ship and other imagery onto those shades. [...] At night, movable furniture and retractable dividers and chandeliers allow the space to be reconfigured {{to be used as a}} performance venue for a cabaret-style show or as a disco. [...] Both nighttime uses <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the projection system and 6 robotically controlled 100-inch LCD television screens to provide digital backdrops.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{primarily}} Sunni Al Anbar governorate to {{the west}} experiencing increased stability due to the U.S. troop surge and the Sunni rejection of Al Qaeda in Iraq, International Health [...] analysts hope to see improved health care there, as well. It {{remains to be seen}} whether non-governmental organizations and the Shiite-dominated central Iraqi government <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the enhanced security to enact sustainable services and other improvements. Local initiatives in June 2008 included contracting with the International Medical Corps for a comprehensive Anbar continuing medical education program, rights of return for expatriate health professionals, and an overhaul of nursing, with innovative programs paralleling the [...] "diploma" [...] nursing track of the West, and a goal of attracting women to nursing as a career (70% of Iraqi nurses are male).|$|E
2500|$|In {{a purely}} {{capitalist}} mode of production (i.e. where professional and labor organizations cannot {{limit the number}} of workers) the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations, or by the employer, but rather by the market. Wages work {{in the same way as}} prices for any other good. Thus, wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill. And therefore, inequality is driven by this price. Under the law of supply and demand, the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker. [...] "On the other hand, markets can also concentrate wealth, pass environmental costs on to society, and abuse workers and consumers." [...] "Markets, by themselves, even when they are stable, often lead to high levels of inequality, outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair." [...] Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed. Their competitors <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor. For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest, it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} engineers, Wally was {{originally}} a worker trying to get fired to get a severance package. He hates work and avoids it whenever he can. He often carries a cup of coffee, calmly sipping from it {{even in the midst}} of chaos or office-shaking revelations. Wally is extremely cynical. He is even more socially inept than Dilbert (though far less self-aware of the fact), and references to his lack of personal hygiene are not uncommon. Like the Pointy-Haired Boss, Wally is utterly lacking in ethics and <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> any situation to maximize his personal gain while doing the least possible amount of honest work. Squat and balding, Wally is almost invariably portrayed wearing a short sleeved dress shirt and tie. [...] Adams has stated that Wally was based on a Pacific Bell coworker of his who was interested in a generous employee buy-out program—for the company's worst employees. This had the effect of causing this man—whom Adams describes as [...] "one of the more brilliant people I've met"—to work hard at being incompetent, rude, and generally poor at his job to qualify for the buy-out program. Adams has said that this inspired the basic laziness and amorality of Wally's character. Despite these personality traits Wally is accepted as part of Dilbert, Ted, Alice, and Asok's clique. Although his relationship with Alice is often antagonistic and Dilbert occasionally denies being his friend, their actions show at least a certain acceptance of him.|$|E
