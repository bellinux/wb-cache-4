40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to form {{uncompressed}} thermobonded 3 D wool nonwoven shell structures in one continuous process, and to study the controlling factors that govern this process. Lack of bonding between <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> and between <b>wool</b> and thermoplastic <b>fibres</b> was attributed to the <b>wool</b> <b>fibre's</b> low surface energy because of the lipids on the outer surface of <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> (epicuticle). To overcome this problem, three different surface treatments were investigated; chlorination, Hercosett and plasma. The purpose of these treatments was to raise the surface energy of <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> by bond scission and the introduction of new functional polar groups and ablation of the outer lipid layer or membrane. For thermobonding with <b>wool</b> <b>fibres,</b> low melting nylon fibres were chosen because of their high polarity and chemical compatibility with <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> SEM, BSM and ESEM imaging techniques as well as tensile strength testing for single fibres, pair bonded samples and 3 D nonwoven shells were used to assess the samples. Results have shown {{that it is possible to}} thermobond <b>wool</b> and nylon <b>fibres</b> as 3 D shell structures, given that <b>wool</b> <b>fibres</b> are treated appropriately and the bonding temperature is controlled properly. Moreover, it has been found that, for pair bonded samples, the wrapping angle and the bonding angle have significant effects on the tensile strength and number of bonding points.

Natural <b>fibres</b> like <b>wool</b> offer an excellent {{environment for the}} growth of micro-organisms when the conditions like moisture, oxygen and temperature are appropriate. Coating with collagen, a very useful biomaterial with bactericidal and fungicidal properties, could be used to improve the properties of wool-based materials, especially when applied in hygienically sensitive applications like in hospitals. Tyrosinases were shown to catalyse the oxidation of tyrosine residues in wool and wool hydrolysates as model substrates, as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Structural differences of the surface were evident from the increase of the intensity in the NH bending and stretching regions in the spectra of NIR FT Raman analysis of the enzyme treated and grafted <b>wool</b> <b>fibres.</b> The durability of the coating was also shown by using FITC-labelled collagen that was bound to the <b>wool</b> <b>fibres,</b> even after severe washing.

50|$|Wool crimp: The {{number of}} bends per unit length along the <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> {{approximately}} indicates spinning capacity of the wool. Fibres with a fine crimp have many bends and usually have a small diameter. Such fibre can be spun into fine yarns, with great lengths of yarn for a given weight of wool, and greater market value. Fine fibres may be utilised {{in the production of}} fine garments such as men's suits whereas the coarser fibres may be used for the production of carpet and other sturdy products. Crimp is measured in crimps per inch or crimps per centimetre. Average diameter or mean fibre diameter is measured in micrometres (microns).

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) treatment on the dyeing properties of wool were studied. Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types of dyeing systems that are commonly used for wool dyeing, namely: (i) acid dye, (ii) chrome dye and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} dyeing process. For acid dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process. In the case of reactive dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> was greatly increased and also the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased significantly. As a result, it may be concluded that the LTP treatment could improve the dyeing behaviour of <b>wool</b> <b>fibre</b> under different dyeing systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
