5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of transhumance, people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the <b>winter</b> <b>pasture</b> in the valleys.|$|E

500|$|Manuel's {{programme}} of fortification in Byzantine Asia, {{for which}} he was praised by Byzantine historian Niketas Choniates, is largely regarded as an important success. Manuel demanded tribute from the Turkmen of the Anatolian interior for the <b>winter</b> <b>pasture</b> in Imperial territory; he also improved the defenses of many cities and towns, and established new garrisons and fortresses across the region. As a result of the cumulative efforts of all three Komnenian emperors, Manuel's domination of Asia Minor was more effective than that of any emperor since before Manzikert. As historian Paul Magdalino makes clear, [...] "by the end of Manuel's reign, the Byzantines controlled all the rich agricultural lowlands of the peninsula, leaving only the less hospitable mountain and plateau areas to the Turks." ...|$|E

60|$|So {{while the}} {{primitive}} civilizations of the cultivators {{were growing up}} chiefly in the great river valleys, {{a different way of}} living, the nomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from <b>winter</b> <b>pasture</b> to summer pasture, was also growing up. The nomadic peoples were on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists; they were less prolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly organized priesthood; they had less gear; but the reader must not suppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of living on that account. In many ways this free life was a fuller life than that of the tillers of the soil. The individual was more self-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd. The leader was more important; the medicine man perhaps less so.|$|E
60|$|For a {{time there}} were {{simultaneously}} two fairly effective Empires in the world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing forward the frontiers of the imperial peace. The thrust of the Han empire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous. The Chinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall. Behind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse and plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the <b>winter</b> <b>pasture.</b> The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the Chinese punitive expeditions were too much for them. The nomads were faced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming Chinese tax-payers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures. Some took the former course and were absorbed. Some drifted north-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western Turkestan.|$|E
60|$|At present {{cultivation}} {{is confined}} to the Armenian foot-hills--an uncertain arc of green from Aleppo to Mosul. But the railway strikes boldly into the deserted middle of the land, giving the arc a chord, and when Turco-German strategic interests no longer debar it from being linked up, through Aleppo, with a Syrian port, {{it will be the}} really valuable section of the Bagdad system. The railway is the only capital enterprise that Northern Mesopotamia requires, for there is rain sufficient for the crops without artificial irrigation. Reservoirs of population are the need. The Kurds who come for <b>winter</b> <b>pasture</b> may be induced to stay--already they have been settling down in the western districts, and have gained a reputation for industry; the Bedawin, more fickle husbandmen, may settle southward along the Euphrates, and in time there will be a surplus of peasantry from Armenia and Syria. These will add field to field, but unless some stronger stream of immigration is led into the land, it will take many generations to recover its ancient prosperity; for in the ninth century A.D. Northern Mesopotamia paid Harun-al-Rashid as great a revenue as Egypt, and its cotton commanded the market of the world[50].|$|E

30|$|In total, 869 spots (C, n[*]=[*] 359; M, n[*]=[*] 510) were sampled for {{the main}} spring, summer, autumn and <b>winter</b> <b>pastures.</b> Whereas the {{measurements}} on the pastures took place from 2012 to 2014, those along the animals’ itineraries were restricted to 2013 and 2014. Due to logistic constraints, measurements at the <b>winter</b> <b>pastures</b> took place in September, although pastures were not grazed until November/December; all other measurements were made during the utilization period of the respective pasture. At each spot, the vegetation and stone cover, mean vegetation height (n[*]=[*] 3) and occurrence of functional plant groups (grasses, herbs and shrubs) were assessed. However, these parameters are not considered in the current study. In addition, environmental variables (altitude, aspect) and the GPS position were measured.|$|R

Today, these potreros are used in this manner by a large herd of elk. These potreros are natural enclosures, with only one principal exit: the narrow connection to higher land.|$|E

50|$|Historically, raising {{livestock}} {{was part}} of a nomadic or pastoral form of material culture. The herding of camels and reindeer {{in some parts of the}} world remains dissociated from sedentary agriculture. The transhumance form of herding in the California Sierra Nevada still continues, as cattle, sheep, or goats are moved from <b>winter</b> <b>pasture</b> in lower-elevation valleys to spring and summer pasture in the foothills and alpine regions, as the seasons progress. Cattle were raised on the open range in the western United States and Canada, on the Pampas of Argentina, and on other prairie and steppe regions of the world.|$|E
