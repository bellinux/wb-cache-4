500|$|Paul Watson {{said he was}} not {{offended}} by his portrayal in the episode, and was glad [...] "Whale Whores" [...] brought the issue of dolphin and whale slaughter to a large audience, as well as the role of the Japanese in the deaths. Watson said, [...] "It's a tough situation we are in. We can't hurt the whalers and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> within the boundaries of the law in opposing illegal whaling operations. If that makes us pussies, so be it.

5000|$|We {{just made}} it clear that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> focused and not try to humiliate them. <b>We</b> said <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> serious and {{concentrate}} at half-time. That's something you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show on the pitch if you are playing.You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> show the opponent respect and it was very important that we did this and didn't try to show some magic or something like this. It was important we played our game for 90 minutes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very sorry, captain," [...] {{said the}} seaman, [...] "but either you <b>had</b> <b>to</b> come with us, d'ye see, or <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with you. They're {{waiting for me}} over at Boston, and in truth I really couldn't tarry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{had some}} terrible fires here," [...] he said. [...] "One {{threatened}} my barn two years ago, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> out two days an' a night a-fightin' it. It {{would be a}} bad thing a night like this." ...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the show}} aired at 3 a.m. ET, it was {{actually}} taped at around 8 p.m. ET the previous night.

5000|$|The {{pressure}} was tremendous. The popular press was blowing {{up the old}} rivalry. We knew that on the pitch the Dutch were ready and waiting for us. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> focused.

6000|$|We reached Pilatka pretty {{early in}} the evening, and there <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> all night. Mr. Chipperton told me, confidentially, that he thought this whole {{arrangement}} was a scheme to make money out of travellers. The boat we were in ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> kept on and taken us up the Oclawaha; [...] "but," [...] said he, [...] "I suppose that wouldn't suit the hotel-keepers. I expect they divide the profits with the boats." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is lonely {{enough for}} anybody, I guess," [...] he mused, and crawled {{back to his}} corners. [...] "Shouldn't wonder if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> in came tomorrow. But I don't care---it will give us all a chance to rest up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, by my faith," [...] quoth Sir Richard, {{who loved}} good manly sports right well, [...] "this {{will be a}} goodly thing to see. Methinks <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> a little while on our journey, and see this merry sport." [...] So he turned his horse's head aside toward Denby and the fair, and thither {{he and his men}} made their way.|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{ride into}} Nantes as we are, after nightfall, and shall {{put them up}} at a small inn. I know of one near the water. It is kept {{by a man who}} was at one time in my lugger, but he had his leg crushed in a storm, and had to have it taken off. He was a good sailor, so I set him up, and can rely upon him. He will get fishermen's clothes for us and, should <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> there any time, buy a boat and nets. We may want such a thing, badly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good! Now let me {{warn you}} first off, that I may be {{diverting}} at times, but I'm no good. To-morrow I'll {{pretend to be}} a misused and unfortunate victim, but your young and almost trusting eyes make me feel candid for about fifteen minutes. I certainly got a raw deal from my beloved husband--that's all you'll hear from me about him. By the way, I'm typical of about ten thousand married women in business about whose noble spouses nothing is ever said. But I suppose I ought to have bucked up and made good in business (I'm a bum stenog. for Pitcairn, McClure & Stockley, the bond house). But I can't. I'm too lazy, and it doesn't seem worth while.... And, oh, we are exploited, women who are on jobs. The bosses give us a lot of taffy and raise their hats--but they don't raise our wages, and they think that if they keep us till two G.M. taking dictation they make it all right by apologizing. Women are a lot more conscientious on jobs than men are--but that's because we're fools; you don't catch the men staying till six-thirty because the boss has shystered all afternoon and wants to catch up on his correspondence. But we--of course we don't dare to make dates for dinner, lest <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> late. We don't dare!" ...|$|E

60|$|Maubeuge is a {{fortified}} town, with a {{very good}} inn, the Grand Cerf. It seemed to be inhabited principally by soldiers and bagmen; at least, these were all that we saw, except the hotel servants. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> there some time, for the canoes were {{in no hurry to}} follow us, and at last stuck hopelessly in the custom-house until we went back to liberate them.

Anomaly based Intrusion Detection Systems are the type of system with the biggest potential within intrusion detection. An anomaly based Intrusion Detection System {{needs to be able to}} learn users ’ or system behaviour because users and system behaviour changes over time in today’s dynamic environment. In this research we are experimenting with user behaviour as parameters in anomaly intrusion detection. There are several methods to assist an Intrusion Detection System to learn users ’ behaviour.

40|$|Geophilosophy is a {{placeholder}} {{for things}} we cannot yet do, things {{we hope to}} do, and {{things that we have}} failed to do so far. This issue of Angelaki aspires towards ways of doing philosophy, geography and gender studies that stray from the analytical comforts of philosophical reasoning, and from the sociological certainties that dominate the study of masculinity. In particular, it brings a sexed and gendered body to extant Deleuze-Guattarian scholarship, while prompting a thirst for creativity and ambivalence to masculinity research. Each article explores the ways in which lived cultures of masculinity might be read across uneven political formations and aesthetic practices, while calling into question tacit understandings of where “masculinity” begins and ends. In doing so, the collection teases out the ethical and methodological implications of poststructuralist approaches to gender in a range of disciplines, including cultural geography, art criticism, sociology, and disability studies. We do not care about our reputation in towns where we are only passing through. But when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> some time we do care. How much time does it take?
