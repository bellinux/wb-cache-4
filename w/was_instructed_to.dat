Boyes <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> fly to a field in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control. As the helicopter approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E

5|$|As the French fleet was {{preparing}} to depart Brest, France in March 1781, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Rear-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap-Français (present-day Cap-Haïtien, Haiti) to determine what resources {{would be required to}} assist Spanish operations. Because of a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte Jacques-Melchior de Barras Saint-Laurent. He was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Français. The French Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, that de Grasse had discretion to come north).|$|E

During the passage, the vessel {{encountered}} heavy weather in the Bay of Biscay, and after reporting a leakage of oil, <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> head towards Brest, France, at reduced speed. However, {{the origin of the}} leak was discovered and stopped. The vessel proceeded on its original planned course, arriving in Bantry Bay on 4 January 1979.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the line, {{supervised}} by Grainger & Miller, proved challenging, as a large-scale contracting industry {{was not yet}} in place in Scotland; nor was large-scale financing. At the end of 1838 Miller <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> build a branch from Barassie to Troon Harbour, earlier thoughts of taking over the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway and converting it—as it was then still a horse-operated plateway—having been dropped.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Phillips {{received}} {{permission from}} his superiors {{to fly the}} F-4B with an inoperative transponder. As the fighter proceeded to NAS Fallon in Nevada, the oxygen leak worsened until the system was disabled completely, and the pilot <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> fly at low altitude. The Phantom II departed NAS Fallon at 5:16p.m. following a flight plan routing across the Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles air corridors.|$|E

The complete silence from that city puzzled the General Staff; they knew that no large enemy raid had occurred and that no sizable store of explosives was in Hiroshima at that time.

5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> lay a {{minefield}} near {{the port city}} of Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, it sank the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E
5|$|By {{capturing}} Glina, the HV trapped {{the bulk}} of the ARSK Kordun Corps and about 35,000 evacuating civilians in the area of Topusko, prompting its commander to request UNCRO protection. The 1st Guards Brigade, approaching Topusko from Vojnić, received orders to engage the ARSK Kordun Corps, but the orders were cancelled at midnight by the chief of the HV General Staff. Instead, the Zagreb Corps <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> prepare a brigade-strength unit to escort unarmed persons and ARSK officers and non-commissioned officers with side arms to Dvor and allow them to cross into Bosnia and Herzegovina. Based on information obtained from UN troops, it was believed that the ARSK forces in Banovina were about to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralise the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, surrender for internment, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum; the French rejected it, and so the British ships opened fire.|$|E

The {{following}} day III./JG54 <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> relocate. Five month later following a long combat pause, JG 54 {{was moved to}} the south-east to counter the pro-British coup d'état in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He claimed his ninth victory over a Yugoslav Royal Air Force Messerschmitt Bf109E-3, piloted by Karlo Štrebenk who was killed, on 6April 1941 over Belgrade during the Balkans Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Nichols <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> {{write the}} film for Hepburn, {{with whom he}} had worked on John Ford's Mary of Scotland in 1936. Barbara Leaming alleged that Ford had an affair with Hepburn, and claims that many of the {{characteristics}} of Susan and David were based on Hepburn and Ford. Nichols was in touch with Ford during the screenwriting, and the film included such members of the John Ford Stock Company as Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, D'Arcy Corrigan and associate producer Cliff Reid. John Ford was a friend of Hawks, and visited the set. The round glasses Grant wears in the film are reminiscent of Harold Lloyd and of Ford.|$|E
5|$|Resolution 1313 was a {{significant}} shift in attitude for UNAMSIL, away from its previous neutrality to support of the Sierra Leone government, a shift that made the governments of several troop-contributing nations uncomfortable. In particular, the governments of Jordan and India—two of the largest contributors, with nearly 5,000 troops between them serving with UNAMSIL—were moved to withdraw their forces. The withdrawal coincided {{with the end of}} the rainy season, after which there were fears that the RUF would resume its advance towards Freetown, and the UN and British government feared that UNAMSIL would be vulnerable. As a deterrent, the ARG was once more deployed off the coast, and <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> conduct amphibious landing demonstrations as a show of force.|$|E

5|$|Spain thus {{became a}} target for the Anglo-Dutch-Austrian alliance. The confederates' {{campaign}} was pursued by land and by sea. The main land offensive was pursued in the Low Countries by the Duke of Marlborough, while naval forces {{under the command of}} Admiral Sir George Rooke harassed French and Spanish shipping in the Atlantic. In 1703, Marlborough devised a plan under which his forces would launch a surprise attack against the French and their Bavarian allies in the Danube basin while Rooke carried out a diversionary naval offensive in the Mediterranean. Rooke <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> attack French or Spanish coastal towns, though the choice of target was left to his discretion.|$|E
5|$|The B-52 aircraft, callsign Czar 52, {{took off}} at 13:58 and {{completed}} {{most of the}} mission's elements without incident.

Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75m) above ground level (AGL), Holland radioed the control tower and asked for permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.|$|E

To {{put an end to}} these activities, the Junta assembled Cisneros and {{all the members of the}} Royal Audiencia on the pretext that their lives were in danger, and sent them into exile aboard the British ship Dart. Captain Mark Brigut Larrea <b>was</b> <b>instructed</b> <b>to</b> avoid American ports and deliver all of them directly to the Canary Islands.
