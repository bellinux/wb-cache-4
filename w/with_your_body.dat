25|$|Stance width helps {{determine}} the rider's {{balance on the}} board. The size of the rider {{is an important factor}} as well as the style of their riding when determining a proper stance width. A common measurement used for new riders is to position the bindings so that the feet are placed a little wider than shoulder width apart. Another, less orthodox form of measurement may be taken by putting your feet together and place your hands, palm down, on the ground in a straight line <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> by squatting down. This generally gives a good natural measurement for how wide of a base your body uses to properly balance itself when knees are bent. However, personal preference and comfort are important and most experienced riders will adjust the stance width to personal preference. Skateboarders should find that their snowboarding and skateboarding stance widths are relatively similar.|$|E

Lockhart has gone away with the Duke of Wellington, who was in deep consideration how he should manage his funeral on the road.

5000|$|Intuitive eating goes by many names, {{including}} non-dieting or the non-diet approach, normal eating, wisdom eating, and conscious eating. Some {{strategies and}} goals for building intuitive eating skills are discovering {{how to listen}} and reconnect <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>body's</b> hunger and fullness cues, learn to trust yourself to make decisions around what or how much to eat, take back your power around food, reconnect to <b>your</b> <b>body's</b> innate wisdom to determine {{the right amount of}} food for you, develop self-trust around eating challenging or [...] "forbidden" [...] foods, practice being more mindful at meal times in a safe and supportive environment. This approach to eating fights against weight stigma in terms of negative judgement, bias, assumptions, attitudes, and treatment based on a person's size. This stigma inevitably makes people feel worse about themselves and leads to even worse health outcomes for that individual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ages ago," [...] he commenced, [...] "our {{bodies were}} larger and our heads smaller. Our legs were very weak {{and we could}} not travel fast or far. There was a stupid {{creature}} that went upon four legs. It lived in {{a hole in the}} ground, to which it brought its food, so we ran our burrows into this hole and ate the food it brought; but it did not bring enough for all--for itself and all the kaldanes that lived upon it, so we had also to go abroad and get food. This was hard work for our weak legs. Then it was that we commenced to ride upon the backs of these primitive rykors. It took many ages, undoubtedly, but at last came the time when the kaldane had found means to guide the rykor, until presently the latter depended entirely upon the superior brain of his master to guide him to food. The brain of the rykor grew smaller as time went on. His ears went and his eyes, for he no longer had use for them--the kaldane saw and heard for him. By similar steps the rykor came to go upon its hind feet that the kaldane might be able to see farther. As the brain shrank, so did the head. The mouth was the only feature of the head that was used and so the mouth alone remains. Members of the red race fell into the hands of our ancestors from time to time. They saw the beauties and the advantages of the form that nature had given the red race over that which the rykor was developing into. By intelligent crossing the present rykor was achieved. He is really solely the product of the super-intelligence of the kaldane--he is our body, to do with as we see fit, just as you do what you see fit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> only we have the advantage of possessing an unlimited supply of bodies. Do you not wish that you were a kaldane?" ...|$|E
60|$|But, it {{is a very}} terrible, heartrending thought, for a man to {{find out}} that what he will receive is not {{punishment}}, but wages; not punishment but the end of the very road which he is travelling on. That the wages of sin, and the end of sin, to which it must lead, are death; that every time he sins he is earning those wages, deserving them, meriting them, and therefore receiving them by the just laws of the world of God. That does torment him, that does terrify him, if he will look steadfastly at the broad plain fact--You need not dream of being let off, respited, reprieved, pardoned in any way. The thing cannot be done. It is contrary to the laws of God and of God's universe. It is as impossible as that fire should not burn, or water run up hill. It {{is not a question of}} arbitrary punishment, which may be arbitrarily remitted; but of wages, which you needs must take, weekly, daily, and hourly; and those wages are death: a question of travelling on a certain road, whereon, if you travel it long enough, you must come to the end of it; and the end is death. Your sins are killing you by inches; all day long they are sowing in you the seeds of disease and death. Every sin which you commit <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> shortens your bodily life. Every sin you commit with your mind, every act of stupidity, folly, wilful ignorance, helps to destroy your mind, and leave you dull, silly, devoid of right reason. Every sin you commit with your spirit, each sin of passion and temper, envy and malice, pride and vanity, injustice and cruelty, extravagance and self-indulgence, helps to destroy your spiritual life, and leave you bad, more and more unable to do the right and avoid the wrong, more and more unable to discern right from wrong; and that last is spiritual death, the eternal death of your moral being. There are three parts in you--body, mind, and spirit; and every sin you commit helps to kill one of these three, and, in many cases, to kill all three together.|$|E
6000|$|You {{see that}} God's mercy to them {{would not make}} them {{conceited}} or careless. It would increase their shame and confusion {{when they found out}} what sort of a Lord He was against whom they had been rebellious; long-suffering and of tender mercy, returning good for evil to His disobedient children. That feeling would awake in them more shame and more confusion than ever: {{but it would be a}} noble shame, a happy confusion, and tears of joy and gratitude, not of bitterness. Such a shame, such a confusion, such tears, as the blessed Magdalene's when she knelt at the Lord's feet, and found that, instead of bating her and thrusting her away for all her sins, He told her to go in peace, pardoned and happy. Then she knew the Lord; she found out His character--His name; for she found out that His name was love. Oh, my friends, this is the great secret; the only knowledge worth living for, because it is the only knowledge which will enable you to live worthily--to know the Lord. That knowledge will enable you to live a life which will last, and grow, and prosper for ever, beyond the grave, and death, and judgment, and eternities of eternities. As the Lord Himself said, when He was upon earth, [...] "This is eternal life, to know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent." [...] Therefore there is no use my warning you against sin, and telling you, do not do this, and do not do that, unless I tell you at the same time who is the Lord. For till you know that The Good God is the Lord, you will have no real, sound, heartfelt reason for giving up your sins; and what is more, you will not be able to give them up. You may alter your sort of sins from fear of this and that; but the root of sin will be there still; and if it cannot bear one sort of fruit it will bear another. If you dare not drink or riot, you may become covetous and griping; if you dare not give way to young men's sins, you will take to old men's sins instead; if you dare not commit open sins you will commit secret ones in your thoughts. Sin is much too stout a plant to be kept from bearing some sort of fruit. As long as it is not rooted up the root will breed death in you of some sort or other; and the only feeling which can root up sin is to know that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is your Lord, and that your Lord condescended to die upon the cross for you; that you must be the Lord's, and are not your own, but bought with the price of His most precious blood, that you may glorify God <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> and your soul, which are His.|$|E

Live like those who are alive again from the dead; who are not your own, but bought with a price, and bound to work for God <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>bodies</b> and <b>your</b> spirits, which are His--then, and then only, can either God or man believe you.|$|R
