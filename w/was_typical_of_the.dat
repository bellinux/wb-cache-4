5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Chinese {{businesses}} began relocating {{from the}} Loop to Chicago's South Side. Starting this trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson {{to design a}} building large enough to house 15stores, 30apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road). Built in 1912 for $200,000, the building's design <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period; however, it featured white tile trim adorned with Chinese dragons and a third floor balcony. The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy of inmates at Monowitz averaged about three months. This <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E

5|$|The Hokies {{began the}} 2005 regular season ranked {{eighth in the}} country, and played their first game at ACC {{opponent}} North Carolina State. It was a close-fought game, but quarterback Marcus Vick threw a game-winning touchdown {{early in the fourth}} quarter and the defense slowed a late NC State rally as Virginia Tech earned a 2016 win. Following the close call against NC State, the Hokies blew out their next several opponents. Virginia Tech defeated Duke and Ohio by scores of 450 each. The Virginia Tech defense held Duke's offense to just 35total yards, an NCAA record. Following those victories, Tech hosted 15th-ranked Georgia Tech, beating the Yellow Jackets by a score of 517. Tech's defensive success in those games <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season as Virginia Tech won the first eight games of its season.|$|E
5|$|There {{were several}} {{differences}} between Sullivan's adaptation and Stevenson's novella. Stevenson used multiple narrators and a circular narrative (allowing material {{presented at the}} end to explain material presented at the beginning), but Sullivan wrote a linear narrative in chronological order. This linear approach and the onstage action conveyed a stronger impression of realism, eliminating uncertainties in Stevenson's narrative. Although making the story more straightforward and less ambiguous was not necessary for a theatrical adaptation, Sullivan's approach <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> era's stage melodramas and made the material more acceptable to audiences. The stage presentation's realism also allowed Sullivan to drop the novella's scientific aspects. Although Stevenson used science to make the Jekyll-Hyde transformation plausible to readers, Sullivan could rely on the onstage transformation.|$|E

25|$|In {{later life}} Blake began {{to sell a}} great number of his works, {{particularly}} his Bible illustrations, to Thomas Butts, a patron who saw Blake more as a friend than a man whose work held artistic merit; this <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinions held of Blake throughout his life.|$|E
25|$|As <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time, Rudolf II had a {{portrait}} {{painted in the}} studio of the renowned Alonso Sanchez Coello.

25|$|Koch Legacy {{has also}} {{released}} Strauss's recordings of overtures by Gluck, Carl Maria von Weber, Peter Cornelius, and Wagner. The preference for German and Austrian composers in Germany in the 1920s through the 1940s <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German nationalism that existed after World War I.

25|$|Weston {{was born}} in Chicago and moved to California when he was 21.

Within a few years, however, he abandoned that style and went on to be one of the foremost champions of highly detailed photographic images.|$|E

25|$|The {{children}} who arrived at Carlisle {{able to speak}} some English were presented to the other children as translators. The authorities at the School sometimes used the children's traditional respect for elders to require them to inform on other children's misbehavior.

25|$|The Comnenian {{building}} was a church with a main aisle and two deambulatoria, and had three apses, and a narthex to the west.

25|$|Green {{retained}} {{her seat}} in the 1999 European Parliament election with a reduced majority of 26,477.

The European Socialists also did badly in the elections, and lost their dominance of the Parliament, with the European People's Party becoming the largest group in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|Poor {{communications}} {{plagued the}} Austrian commanders throughout the campaign. This was {{a consequence of}} the wide separation between the two wings. Furthermore, many of Alvinczi's men were indifferently equipped raw recruits who straggled badly. The Austrians also suffered from a serious shortage of officers. After Alvinczi sent him a mistaken report that Masséna was reinforcing Vaubois, Davidovich became very cautious. The report was sent on 9 November but only reached its recipient on the 11th, which <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Austrian communications problems. Alvinczi also repeatedly urged Davidovich to speed up his march toward Verona.|$|E
25|$|The {{stones were}} sold off or used to {{reinforce}} the sea defenses along the Elbe; the funerary sculptures and monuments were broken up and used in {{the reconstruction of the}} city's rudimentary sewage system. The Senate was partly motivated by the desire to rid the city of an extraterritorial institution, but it is more than possible that the rise in rents and the high demand for housing at the time also played a role. In any case, the incident <b>was</b> <b>typical</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> celebrated Philistinism of the Hamburg authorities. Five more medieval churches in the city were pulled down between 1807 and 1837.|$|E
