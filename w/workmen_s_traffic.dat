40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we provide}} {{a survey of}} the traffic sign {{detection}} literature, detailing detection systems for traffic sign recognition (TSR) for driver assistance. We separately describe the contributions of recent works to the various stages inherent in traffic sign detection: segmentation, feature extraction, and final sign detection. While TSR is a well-established research area, we highlight open research issues in the literature, including a dearth of use of publicly available image databases and the overrepresentation of European traffic signs. Furthermore, we discuss future directions of TSR research, including the integration of context and localization. We also introduce a new public database containing U. <b>S.</b> <b>traffic</b> signs.

The roughly 3 per cent annual {{growth in the}} ratio of vehicle-miles to lane-miles {{that occurred during the}} 1960 s accelerated to 4 per cent from 1974 to 1985 and 5 per cent after 1985. Moreover, there was comparatively little upgrading of existing lane-miles over this period. As traffic density increased, so did congestion. By 1988, some estimates put the economic cost of congestion to California at $ 16 billion in time lost and $ 1 billion in fuel. Despite a California Division of Highways Plan, developed in 1958, calling for 12 thousand miles of limited access roadways, by 1990 less than 6 thousand had been completed...|$|R

Strain F 199 contained 2 -OH 14 : 0 and 18 : 1 � 7 c as the predominant cellular fatty acids and sphingolipids that are characteristic of the genus Sphingomonas. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16 S rRNA sequence indicated that F 199 was most closely related to Sphingomonas capsulata among the bacteria currently in the Ribosomal Database. Five additional isolates from deep Southeast Coastal Plain sediments were determined by 16 S rRNA sequence analysis to be closely related to F 199. These strains also contained characteristic sphingolipids. Four of these five strains could also grow on {{a broad range of}} aromatic compounds and could mineralize [14 C]toluene and [14 C]naphthalene. S. capsulata (ATCC 14666), Sphingomonas paucimobilis (ATCC 29837), and one of the subsurface isolates were unable to grow on any of the aromatic compounds or mineralize toluene or naphthalene.

The article investigates how car sound, its measurement and the standardization of measurement procedures developed during the first postwar decades, and how this relates to European integration. It shows that the standardization of car noise measurement affected market integration and the harmonization of technical regulation on the European level, thus shaping the political integration process. Furthermore, standardization and harmonization stimulated the circulation of knowledge and the rise of a new field of knowledge organized around the standardized and harmonized issues. Although the standardization and harmonization efforts did not result in the homogenization of European automobile technology, they did contribute to the narrative construction of a European car identity...|$|R

40|$|After World War I, {{automobile}} ownership {{became a}} mass phenomenon in Belgium, {{as in most}} other industrialized countries. Unfortunately, road-casualty figures soon followed. By the mid- 1930 <b>s,</b> <b>traffic</b> accidents had become {{the main cause of}} accidental deaths. There was clearly a need for a renewed road-safety policy. Public authorities in Belgium, however, were suspiciously reluctant to take new measures. While there was a public outcry for more severe regulation of motorized traffic and several MPs backed bills to this effect, motoring associations lobbied against traffic-legislation reforms. In order to understand the Belgian government's hesitation, this article looks at the key strategies of the actors involved in the decision-making process concerning traffic policy. Such strategies included, among others: the creation of detailed traffic-accident statistics, revision of traffic legislation, and support for mass traffic-education campaigns. Eventually, public officials stepped in and created a new technocratic traffic regime in the 1930 s, yet their prime concern was not road-user safety, but the efficiency of traffic streams...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{argues that}} an {{evolving}} {{understanding of the}} concept of livability was integral to the historic development of traffic calming and mini-parks in Vancouver’s West End. Traffic calming was pioneered in the early 1970 s by progressive planners who wanted to improve livability in the newly densified West End by getting rid of unwelcome traffic and creating new park space and pedestrian amenities to combat resident feelings of alienation. In the late 1970 s and early 1980 <b>s,</b> <b>traffic</b> diversion also became a key policy in a civic drive to remove street prostitution from the West End, a struggle that invoked discourses of ‘livability’ which were used to justify exclusion of socially undesirable people from valued space on the streets in this downtown neighbourhood. Although I conclude that traffic calming is a means to create a more walkable, green and sustainable city, I also find that it contributed to heightened social divisions in the neighbourhood and across the city...|$|R
40|$|The paper aims at {{devising a}} control system for dynamic {{resource}} allocation in a packet-oriented satellite network. The traffic to be served is represented by TCP long-lived connections (elephants).

The assignment is effected according to each pair 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>traffic</b> load and fading conditions, {{in order to reach}} a common goal. The latter may consist of maximizing the overall TCP goodput, of equalizing the connections 2 ̆ 7 goodput for global fairness, or a combination thereof. Thus, there is a cross-layer interaction between the physical and data link layers, whereby fading plays a role in the overall bandwidth allocation, through the tradeoff between bandwidth and Bit Error Rate (BER) of TCP connections. Three different allocation strategies are devised, and their respective performance is compared, under a realistic link budget...|$|R

ACS signifies traffic signal control systems that optimize timing plans in real time, based on current traffic conditions and demand.

Recently, we identified a dilysine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval signal and a tyrosine-based endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Here, an infectious cDNA clone of IBV was used to address the importance of the <b>S</b> protein <b>trafficking</b> signals to virus infection. We constructed infectious cDNA clones lacking the ER retrieval signal, the endocytosis signal, or both. The virus lacking the ER retrieval signal was viable.

Further analysis confirmed that the mutant <b>S</b> protein <b>trafficked</b> though the secretory pathway faster than wild-type S protein. A more dramatic phenotype was obtained when the endocytosis signal was mutated.

40|$|Economic {{analysis}} {{is an important}} component for the decision-making involved in highway projects. However, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) lacks a uniform and comprehensive methodology or model to evaluate highway improvement projects. This research project seeks to fill that gap. The preferred methodology is called life-cycle benefit cost analysis. The two key parts in the proposed model, Indiana Life-Cycle Benefit Cost Model (ILCBCM), are agency costs and user benefits. Agency costs include initial costs, routine maintenance costs, rehabilitation costs, and salvage value of the facility. User benefits contain travel time savings, vehicle operating cost savings, and accident reduction savings. By analyzing Indiana 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>traffic</b> data and referring to the existing methods used in other highway agencies, the framework and calculation procedures for each module are developed. The probabilistic analysis model is then incorporated into ILCBCM so that the outputs can be expressed as ranges of values with likelihoods of occurrence, which is more realistic when evaluating projects with high risks. In order to illustrate the overall economic analysis process, a software application, called Indiana Economic Analysis Tool (IEAT), is developed. A case study was performed to reflect the convenience and flexibility of the software. ...|$|R
