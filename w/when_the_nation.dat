Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E
5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} without trial. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the Mozambican Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style totalitarianism, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary fervour. Peace returned only in 1992, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E
5|$|Set in a {{separate}} continuity to any other Fire Emblem title, The Sacred Stones takes place on the continent of Magvel, which is divided into five ancient nations, each with a magical stone said {{to be linked to}} the imprisonment of an ancient demon. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> of Grado begins invading the other nations and destroying the stones, protagonists Eirika and Ephraim of the royal family of Renais set out to gain allies from the other nations and halt Grado's conquest. The gameplay is similar to previous Fire Emblem games, focusing on turn-based, tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield. Core features of the game include permanent death for characters defeated in battle and support conversations that grant advantages to certain units in battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{picture of}} Elizabeth painted by her Protestant admirers {{of the early}} 17th century has proved lasting and influential. Her memory was also revived during the Napoleonic Wars, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> again found itself {{on the brink of}} invasion. In the Victorian era, the Elizabethan legend was adapted to the {{imperial}} ideology of the day, and in the mid-20th century, Elizabeth was a romantic symbol of the national resistance to foreign threat. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. Neale and Rowse also idealised the Queen personally: she always did everything right; her more unpleasant traits were ignored or explained as signs of stress.|$|E

25|$|While the {{negative}} effects of that phenomenon may have been exaggerated, Parliament passed legislation in 1736 to discourage consumption by prohibiting the sale of gin in quantities of less than two gallons and raising the tax on it dramatically.

25|$|Archaeological {{exploration}} of the pre-Islamic period of Afghanistan began in Afghanistan in earnest after World War II and proceeded until the late 1970s <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> was invaded by the Soviet Union.

25|$|Bornholm formed {{part of the}} {{historical}} Lands of Denmark <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> united out {{of a series of}} petty chiefdoms. It was originally administratively part of the province of Scania and was administered by the Scanian Law after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the See of Lund and the Danish crown culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was Gamleborg which was replaced by Lilleborg, built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four herreder (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, Hammershus. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.|$|E

25|$|Crime has {{continued}} an overall downward trend in New York City since the 1990s. In 2012, the NYPD came under scrutiny {{for its use}} of a stop-and-frisk program, which has undergone several policy revisions since then. In 2014, New York City had the third lowest murder rate among the largest U.S. cities, having become significantly safer after a spike in crime in the 1970s through 1990s. Violent crime in New York City decreased more than 75% from 1993 to 2005, and continued decreasing during periods <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> as a whole saw increases.

In 2005, the homicide rate was at its lowest level since 1966, and in 2007, the city recorded fewer than 500 homicides {{for the first time ever}} since crime statistics were first published in 1963. In 2015, 50.5% of New York City misdemeanor assault suspects were black, 33.3% Hispanic, 11.1% white, 4.8% Asian/Pacific Islander and 0.3% Native American.
