The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching {{under the cover of}} the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up the river as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Here the Japanese {{held the}} high ground in well-concealed {{positions}} that had clear fields of fire into the narrow gorge below. With no other options, the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences frontally, advancing straight up the gorge. Amidst torrential rain and stiff defence, progress was slow as each defensive position had {{to be dealt with}} individually. As the water level in the creek rose steadily, the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades lobbed from the heights above. The supply situation grew desperate too, but by 28 October the 2/3rd Battalion had managed to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack. In the afternoon, the battalion launched its attack, breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position. The defenders were overwhelmed and many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled. That night, the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position. The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{realised}} {{that the}} direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed. Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but {{he was forced to}} burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet. Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates. By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.|$|E

5|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993. The IIHF {{recognized}} the Czech Republic as {{the successor to}} Czechoslovakia, allowing the team to retain {{its position in the}} top World Championship division, while Slovakia started in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up. Both nations competed in the tournament at the 1994 Winter Olympics, as did Russia. Slovakia and Finland both finished the preliminary round undefeated. Slovakia lost their medal round quarter-final game to Russia, who later lost to Finland in the bronze medal game. In the gold medal game between Sweden and Canada, both teams finished regulation and overtime play with a 2–2 tie. In the resulting shootout, the first in Olympic competition, both nations scored two goals, which resulted in a sudden death shootout. Peter Forsberg of Sweden scored {{one of the most famous}} goals in Olympic history by faking a forehand shot, then sliding a one-handed backhand shot past goaltender Corey Hirsch. Canada's final shooter Paul Kariya's shot was saved by Tommy Salo and Sweden won the game and its first gold medal.|$|E

U-46 {{was ordered to}} patrol the coast of Sunderland, which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and U-47 was diverted to this task. On 13 May, U-72 was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth; on the 23rd, U-74 departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth; and on the 24th, U-75 was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney Islands. UB-21 and UB-22 were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. U-22, U-46 and U-67 were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.|$|E

An {{apparently}} auspicious start, {{during a}} short players' strike, turned sour when it was discovered teams gave away many tickets, and soon the teams and their league were experiencing serious financial problems. After a season and a half it folded. The only two teams to have remained solvent applied to join the NFL as expansion teams but were rejected. One of the teams, the Memphis Grizzlies, sued the NFL in its own lawsuit, Mid-South Grizzlies v. National Football League. It took several years for the case to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> through the federal court system; the Grizzlies ultimately lost their case. The Grizzlies case centered around the league's rejection of the Grizzlies' application {{making it impossible to}} maintain operations, which the courts claimed would instead open up opportunities for competing leagues.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{guidance}} of new coach Winfried Schäfer, KSC's return to the top flight was marked with some success as {{for the first time}} the team managed to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> out of the bottom half of the league table. In the 1993–94 season, the club had a successful run in the UEFA Cup, going out in the semi-finals on away goals to Austria Salzburg after beating, in turn, PSV, Valencia, Bordeaux and Boavista. Their stunning 7–0 second-round victory over Valencia, a top team in the Spanish La Liga at the time and in historical terms as well, might be considered the high point of the club's history in its centennial year. Between 1992 and 1997, the club was ranked in the single digits in six consecutive Bundesliga seasons and also participated in two more UEFA Cups, reaching the third round both in the 1996–97 and 1997–98 seasons, being eliminated from the competition after losing their second-leg matches to Brøndby and Spartak Moscow respectively. In 1995, KSC won the DFB-Hallenpokal, an indoor football tournament that was traditionally held during winter breaks of the Bundesliga seasons. They also played in the final of the DFB-Pokal in 1996, but lost 0–1 to 1. FC Kaiserslautern.|$|E

500|$|The first {{station in}} Harriman, New York, {{then known as}} Turner, was first {{constructed}} around 1838 by Peter Turner, {{as one of the}} many stretches of the New York and Lake Erie Railroad was constructed through town. The station itself was a [...] long brick depot, three stories tall and topped with a French roof. The station sat alongside the railroad tracks and was called the Orange Hotel. [...] The dining room of the new structure was able to hold 500 people at a time and accommodate them with good food. During planning of the Erie, there was some concern {{to whether or not the}} railroad would <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> through Harriman at all, instead [...] bypassing nearby Goshen and Middletown in favor of a terminus at Newburgh, also on the Hudson River. Train service to Harriman began in 1841, when the New York and Lake Erie ran its first trains on June 30, 1841 from Piermont-on-Hudson, the determined eastern terminus, to Goshen, the western end.|$|E

The League and FA contributions were summarised in the commission report as concerns that a relocated club would, in effect, [...] "drive a coach and horses through the pyramid structure", [...] "herald, or risk heralding, a franchise system for football whereby the investors in football could relocate clubs at will" [...] and [...] "dramatically change the defining characteristics of the English domestic game where clubs are identified with the locality or community built up over time". [...] "English football is not organised {{on the basis of a}} franchise system in which different communities may bid for clubs competing in competitions," [...] the FA statement concluded. [...] "If a move effectively involved a break of the links with the community with which the club is traditionally associated, and a move to an entirely new community, with an intent to put down new roots and reinvent the club with a new identity and a new set of allegiances, and yet the club did not want to relinquish its place in the pyramid, go down to a lower level and <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> back up, the FA believes that allowing such a move would have a fundamental impact on the organisational framework of the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Czechoslovakia {{split into}} the Czech Republic and Slovakia in January 1993.

Slovakia's team began in the lowest division (Pool C) in 1994 and was forced to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> up. Following this, the next decade was dominated by the so-called [...] "Big Six"–Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia, Sweden and the United States. From 1992 to 1996, five different teams won the World Championship. At the 1993 World Championships, Russia won its first title as an independent nation and the Czech Republic won its first medal (bronze). In 1994, the Canadian team finished the preliminary round undefeated and defeated Finland in the final to win their first World Championship since 1961. The following year in Sweden, the Finnish team won its first ever World Championship. Led by their top line of Saku Koivu, Ville Peltonen and Jere Lehtinen, the Finns defeated rival Sweden in the gold medal game. At the 1995 Pool B championships, Slovakia, led by Peter Šťastný won Pool B and was promoted to the top division, where it has remained ever since. In 1996, the Czech Republic won its first World Championship as a separate country. During this period, the United States {{was the only one of}} the [...] "Big Six" [...] not to win the World Championship, although they did win the 1996 World Cup of Hockey. In the mid-1990s, several new teams such as Latvia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine were quickly improving and older nations such as Austria, Italy and Switzerland were at risk of being relegated to Pool B. The IIHF feared that it would lose advertising revenue if that happened, so the number of teams was increased to 16 starting in 1998.|$|E

500|$|McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", {{released}} in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording. In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, Room to Breathe, marked her first release of new material in four years. Writing for The Boston Globe, Steve Morse found the album's material {{to have a}} variety of musical stylings, saying the track [...] "Love Revival" [...] sounded like Tanya Tucker and calling [...] "If I Had Any Sense at All" [...] "a mournful country ballad". Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave Room to Breathe a less-received review, reporting that [...] "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" [...] for sounding like a Bluegrass-inspired song such as music by Ricky Skaggs or Patty Loveless. The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No.25 on the Billboard 200, staying at the position for only one week. The second single, [...] "Somebody", also recorded by Mark Wills on his [...] "Loving Every Minute" [...] release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and first since [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall. It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, [...] "Yeah, that had us concerned.

But this one had a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out. MCA is really kicking butt with it."

500|$|Monitor {{was soon}} in trouble {{as the storm}} {{increased}} in ferocity. Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by helmsman Francis Butts. Water continued flooding into the vents and ports and the ship began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon Monitor {{was hit by a}} squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to <b>work</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> into the vessel. Right when the Worthington pump could no longer keep pace with the flooding a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then ordered the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching with little effect making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. He then ordered the towline cut and called for volunteers, Acting Master Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that {{as soon as they were}} on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the [...] towline with a hatchet. At 11:30p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump; but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water. After all steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade, but to no avail.|$|E
