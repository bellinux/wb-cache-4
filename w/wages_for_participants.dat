[...] Campos also criticized the study for not addressing the fact that the number of law graduates far exceeds the number of legal jobs available. In recent years the ratio of new law graduates to available legal jobs has been about two to one. Campos argues as a labor market becomes more saturated, <b>wages</b> <b>for</b> <b>participants</b> in that market will decline, all other things being equal.|$|E

Scott Francis Beveridge, Doctor of Philosophy, 2003 Dissertation {{directed}} by: Associate Proffessor Ellen S. Fabian Department of Counseling and Personnel Services The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the relationship between vocational rehabilitation clients' Individualized Plan for Employment (IPE) rehabilitation goals and employment outcomes. The study examined the relationship between participants' demographic and disability variables to determine the effect on employment outcomes. The study also explored whether attaining a job congruent with the (IPE) vocational rehabilitation goal increased the participant's vocational satisfaction and wages. Study participants were 171 vocational rehabilitation clients served by the Maryland State Department of Education Division of Rehabilitation Services (DORS) who were successfully rehabilitated and closed (Status 26) in 2002. Participants research data was obtained from the DORS computerized database Results generally supported the relationship between Holland's person-environment congruence constructs to employment outcomes for this population. The IPE goal and employment outcome congruency was found to have a significant effect on participants' wages (at the. 01 level). The mean weekly <b>wage</b> <b>for</b> <b>participants</b> who obtained an employment outcome congruent to the IPE goal earned $ 529. 88. Participants who obtained a related employment outcome earned $ 343. 85, and participants who obtained an employment outcome not related to the IPE goal earned $ 286. 22. In addition, educational attainment and disability category were also found to effect vocational rehabilitation outcomes. However, person-environment congruence did not increase participants' vocational satisfaction. This study adds to the literature on vocational rehabilitation employment outcomes by confirming the relationship between Holland's person-environment congruency to successful outcomes among this population. This study was the first to demonstrate a link between person-environment congruency and <b>wages</b> <b>for</b> the vocational rehabilitation population. Theorectical, applied, research implications, limitations of the study and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

As outcome data were collected on the 464 offenders {{through the end of}} June 2010, the average follow-up period was 28 months. Observable selection bias was minimized by using propensity score match-ing to create a comparison group of 232 nonparticipants who were not significantly different from the 232 EMPLOY offenders. Results from the Cox regression analyses revealed that participating in EMPLOY reduced the hazard ratio for recidivism by 32 % to 63 %. The findings further showed that EMPLOY increased the odds of gaining postrelease employment by 72 %. Although EMPLOY did not {{have a significant impact on}} hourly wage, the overall postrelease <b>wages</b> <b>for</b> program <b>participants</b> were significantly higher because they worked a greater number of hours. The study concludes by discussing the implications of these findings. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 17, 2016 cad. sagepub. comDownloaded fro...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{graduates}} {{who would be}} productive citizens able to contribute significantly to the Nigerian economy led to the overhaul of the old education system 6 - 5 - 4 and {{the implementation of the}} 6 - 3 - 3 - 4 system, with its first set of graduates from secondary schools in 1988. The main objective of the 6 - 3 - 3 - 4 system was to produce self-reliant graduates with better labor market skills and earning potential. In this paper, we investigate to what extent this goal was achieved. Using a Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, we examine if graduates from the 6 - 3 - 3 - 4 system experienced an improvement in welfare compared to those from the old system. We measure welfare improvement using several indicators such as a decline in poverty likelihood and poverty gap, an increase in the probability of employment and an increase in wages. Our results provide some evidence that the new system led to a decrease in the likelihood of being poor compared to those who passed through the old system. We also provide evidence of higher <b>wages</b> <b>for</b> select <b>participants.</b> We do not find any consistent evidence that the 6 - 3 - 3 - 4 system increased the probability of being employed when we compare participants from both systems. Our results suggest that while the system change may not have met some of its critical objectives, it cannot be viewed as totally ineffective...|$|R
