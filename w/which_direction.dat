5|$|Travel {{time from}} Nydalen and Storo {{stations}} {{to the city}} centre stations is about the same, independent of <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> on the Ring Line travellers choose. Passengers heading for the city centre can therefore take the first train that comes, independent of <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> it is heading, thus giving Nydalen and Storo a five-minute headway service to the city centre. The trains are operated by Sporveien T-banen, a subsidiary of Sporveien, on contract with the public transport authority Ruter.|$|E

5|$|Although lesbian-feminism was a {{significant}} shift, not all lesbians agreed with it. Lesbian-feminism was a youth-oriented movement: its members were primarily college educated, with experience in New Left and radical causes, but they had not seen any success in persuading radical organizations to take up women's issues. Many older lesbians who had acknowledged their sexuality in more conservative times felt maintaining their ways of coping in a homophobic world was more appropriate. The Daughters of Bilitis folded in 1970 over <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> to focus on: feminism or gay rights issues.|$|E

Usually one is interested in understanding <b>which</b> <b>directions</b> in Y-space that can be predicted by <b>which</b> <b>directions</b> in X-space. Several methods exist for this, for instance PLS regression and canonical correlation. The present paper presents a new plot for visualising the relationship between X and Y.

5|$|In a study {{published}} in 2008, Nina Rønsted and colleagues analysed the DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal internal and external transcribed spacers, and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase region, in the first molecular analysis of the section Malvanthera. They found F.rubiginosa to be most closely related to the rainforest species F.watkinsiana and two rock-growing (lithophytic) species of arid northern Australia (F.atricha and F.brachypoda). They classified these species in a new series Rubiginosae in the subsection Platypodeae. Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> the group radiated (into rainforest or into arid Australia).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{each school}} day, the player will be given the option to {{navigate}} to various locations within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

5|$|The use {{of black}} and white line art for the game's {{graphics}} was an attempt to differentiate it from other games and catch the interest of gamers. Implementing it presented some challenges for the design staff. The design of Qbby, the player character, came after the idea of creating boxes was established; he was designed from a functional perspective. At one point in development, while brainstorming BoxBoy!s visual style, the team had considered making Kirby the main character. It become difficult trying to make Kirby, a round character, look natural in the box-producing action, so they settled with a character that had a square-shaped body, the same as the boxes. Feet were added to Qbby so he could move and jump, and eyes were added so the player could recognise <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> he was facing. Since Qbby had a simple design, the team focussed on making his animations expressive to ensure the character was engaging and had a personality.|$|E
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure <b>which</b> <b>direction</b> was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E

Considering two {{eccentric}} directions (Fig.  1), respectively, and different eccentricity values of 0, 10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120  mm, twenty groups of specimens, {{with the same}} cross section of 100  mm ×  100  mm and the same length of 1200  mm, were constructed. Each group consisted of four identical specimens, and the total number is 80 for all the specimens. In addition, the specimen groups are named by ‘LBCC + eccentricity’. One example was given in the following to differentiate the specimens <b>which</b> <b>directions</b> they are. The number suffixed following ‘LBCC + eccentricity’ tells <b>which</b> eccentric <b>direction</b> they are. For example, the specimen from LBCC 10 - 1 to LBCC 10 - 4 is under radial eccentric direction, while the specimen from LBCC 10 - 5 to LBCC 10 - 8 is under tangential eccentric direction.|$|R
