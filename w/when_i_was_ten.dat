6000|$|... "The {{localisation}} of numerals, {{peculiar to}} certain persons, is foreign to me. In my mind's eye the figures appear {{in front of}} me, within a limited space. My peculiarity, however, consists {{in the fact that}} the numerals from 1 to 9 are differently coloured; (1) black, (2) yellow, (3) pale brick red, (4) brown, (5) blackish gray, (6) reddish brown, (7) green, (8) bluish, (9) reddish brown, somewhat like 6. These colours appear very distinctly when I think of these figures separately; in compound figures they become less apparent. But the most remarkable manifestation of these colours appears in my recollections of chronology. When I think of the events of a given century they invariably appear to me on a background coloured like the principal figure in the dates of that century; thus events of the eighteenth century invariably appear to me on a greenish ground, from the colour of the figure 7. This habit clings to me most tenaciously, and the only hypothesis I can form about its origin is the following:--My tutor, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> to twelve years old, taught me chronology by means of a diagram on which the centuries were represented by squares, subdivided in 100 smaller squares; the squares representing centuries had narrow coloured borders; it may be that in this way the recollection of certain figures became associated with certain colours. I venture this explanation without attaching too much importance to it, because it seems to me that if it was true, my direct recollection of those coloured borders would have been stronger than it is; still, the strong association of my chronology with colour seems to plead in favour of that explanation." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes my {{grandmother}} would bring {{me to see}} some old Sligo gentlewoman whose garden ran down to the river, ending there in a low wall full of wallflowers, and I would sit up upon my chair, very bored, while my elders ate their seed-cake and drank their sherry. My walks with the servants were more interesting; sometimes we would pass a little fat girl and a servant persuaded me to write her a love-letter, {{and the next time}} she passed she put her tongue out. But it was the servant's stories that interested me. At such and such a corner a man had got a shilling from a drill sergeant by standing in a barrel and had then rolled out of it and shown his crippled legs. And in such and such a house an old woman had hid herself under the bed of her guests, an officer and his wife, and on hearing them abuse her, beaten them with a broomstick. All the well-known families had their grotesque or tragic or romantic legends, and I often said to myself how terrible it would be to go away and die where nobody would know my story. Years afterwards, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>ten</b> or twelve years old and in London, I would remember Sligo with tears, and when I began to write, it was there I hoped to find my audience. Next to Merville where I lived, was another tree-surrounded house where I sometimes went to see a little boy who stayed there occasionally with his grandmother, whose name I forget and who seemed to me kind and friendly, though when I went to see her in my thirteenth or fourteenth year I discovered that she only cared for very little boys. When the visitors called I hid in the hay-loft and lay hidden behind the great heap of hay while a servant was calling my name in the yard.|$|E

Fortunately for me, I spent the remainder of the night in my father 2 ̆ 7 s office. Yet, I recall wondering what the men and women had done to end up in this miserable place. The events of that night sparked an interest in prisons that has lasted until the present. This paper is the culmination of the fascination I have had with penal institutions since my youth. Writing on the Utah prison as partial fulfillment of my Masters degree was a natural topical choice. Once I began to research the prison, and study what other scholars had produced on the subject, I noticed a gap in the historiography. Several historians had written about Utah 2 ̆ 7 s penal history, but, there was little if any mention of prison conditions, programs and services, or facilities designed specifically for women inmates. To tell the saga of female prisoners in Utah, the development of penal institutions for men and women on a national level, the philosophical and religious ideology behind the settlement of the Salt Lake valley, and the establishment of prison facilities in Utah must first be told. Once the grassroots have been discussed, the unique history concerning women inmates in Utah can be presented. This work is an attempt to bring to light the long struggle for penological equality women have endured in the Utah territory and subsequent state...|$|R
