5|$|Count Hippolyte rediscovered the Unicorn {{tapestries}} of the château in the 1850s, {{being used}} by a peasant to cover vegetables in his barn. After being restored they <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> in a salon of the château in 1856.|$|E
5|$|Fildes' children's {{bedrooms}} <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> with wallpapers {{designed by}} Morris & Co. and Walter Crane. Under Fildes' the hallway was encrusted with crimson and gold, and after passing through crimson curtains a visitor ascended stairs lined with brass plates, paintings from the Italian Renaissance and tapestries.|$|E
5|$|Defence from thermal {{weapons and}} fire attacks was usually water or other liquids such as urine; hides were soaked and draped over {{vulnerable}} wooden hoardings and siege engines, and vats and barrels of liquid were collected and stored by defenders and attackers. Hides <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> in an overlapping manner {{so that any}} water would run down the whole structure to extinguish flames.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, Ploeg's {{painting}} of actress Deborah Mailman painted on wool bales <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> in the Archibald Prize, {{and won the}} People's Choice Award. In 2000, his {{painting of}} athlete Louise Sauvage <b>was</b> <b>hung</b> in the Archibald Prize.|$|R

5|$|A {{feature of}} central York is the Snickelways, narrow {{pedestrian}} routes, {{many of which}} led towards the former market-places in Pavement and St Sampson's Square. The Shambles is a narrow medieval street, lined with shops, boutiques and tea rooms. Most of these premises were once butchers' shops, and the hooks from which carcasses <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> and the shelves on which meat was laid out can still be seen outside some of them. The street also contains the Shrine of Margaret Clitherow, {{although it is not}} located in the house where she lived. Goodramgate has many medieval houses including the early 14thcentury Lady Row built to finance a Chantry, {{at the edge of the}} churchyard of Holy Trinity church.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} in line at the movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

5|$|Sir Walter Hungerford died in 1516, leaving Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his son, Sir Edward. Edward was a {{successful}} member of Henry VIII's court and died in 1522, leaving the castle to his second wife, Agnes. After Edward's death, however, it emerged that Agnes had {{been responsible for the}} murder of her former, first husband, John Cotell: two of her servants had strangled him at Farleigh Hungerford Castle, before burning his body in the castle oven to destroy any evidence. Agnes appears to have been motivated by a desire for the wealth that would follow her second marriage to Sir Edward, but in 1523 Agnes and the two servants <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> for murder in London.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers {{lived and worked}} in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E
5|$|The Houston riot of 1917 {{disturbed}} Du Bois {{and was a}} major setback {{to efforts}} to permit African Americans to become military officers. The riot began after Houston police arrested and beat two black soldiers; in response, over 100 black soldiers {{took to the streets}} of Houston and killed 16 whites. A military court martial was held, and 19 of the soldiers <b>were</b> <b>hung,</b> and 67 others were imprisoned. In spite of the Houston riot, Du Bois and others successfully pressed the Army to accept the officers trained at Spingarn's camp, resulting in over 600 black officers joining the Army in October 1917.|$|E
2500|$|Although the fly {{system and}} grid are {{designed}} for loads to <b>be</b> <b>hung</b> parallel to the proscenium, smaller loads can <b>be</b> <b>hung</b> perpendicular using cables independent of the actual arbor system. [...] These have to be flown in and out manually from the grid, so perpendicularly <b>hung</b> loads <b>are</b> generally stationary during performances.|$|R

5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Hockey Stick Fight with Kip James as Special Guest Referee between 3Live Kru (B.G. James, Konnan, and Ron Killings) and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, and Eric Young) followed. In this match, {{hockey sticks}} <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> above {{each of the}} {{turnbuckles}} in the ring, with only the legal men allowed to use them. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Killings pinned Young after a top rope leg drop onto a hockey stick that laid across Young's groin to win the match for his team at 10 minutes and 23 seconds. After this bout, Christian Cage made his debut, announcing he wanted to become NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode came out and offered Cage a spot in Team Canada, which Cage said he would consider.|$|E
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert the gun crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was the gun emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope <b>were</b> <b>hung.</b> These protected the gun crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of the gun. These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August, the Governor Murray {{constituted}} a general court-martial, {{presided over by}} Lt.-Col. Stephen Arthur Goodman. Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave masters locked in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety of sentences were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial {{at the time of}} publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved. Quamina was among those executed; their bodies <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> up in chains by the side of a public road in front of their respective plantations and left to rot for months afterwards. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to St Lucia; Da Costa suggests that a letter Sir John had sent on his behalf resulted in clemency.|$|E

5|$|On their {{donation}} to the South Kensington Museum, the nine works donated by Watts <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> on the staircase leading to the library, but Hope proved a popular loan to other institutions {{as a symbol of}} current British art. At the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887 in Manchester, an entire wall was dedicated to the works of Watts. Hope, only recently completed but already the most famous of Watts's works, was placed at the centre of this display. It was then exhibited at the 1888 Melbourne Centennial Exhibition and the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, before being moved to Munich for display at the Glaspalast. In 1897 {{it was one of the}} 17 Watts works transferred to the newly created National Gallery of British Art (commonly known as the Tate Gallery, now Tate Britain); at the time, Watts was so highly regarded that an entire room of the new museum was dedicated to his works. The Tate Gallery considered Hope one of the highlights of their collection and did not continue the South Kensington Museum's practice of lending the piece to overseas exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Linda Syddick was {{painting}} by 1991, when her works <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> {{in a private}} gallery—Gallery Gondwana—in Alice Springs. Her works, such as A nest of crosses, gladly borne painted for an exhibition titled Mary Mackillop: a tribute, combine traditional Indigenous painting techniques and motifs with Christian imagery and themes. Linda Syddick had two paintings included in an exhibition, From Appreciation to Appropriation, at the Flinders University Art Museum City Gallery in 2000. One—Eucharist—again looked at Christian influences in Indigenous culture; the other dealt with Hollywood influences, and was titled ET: the bicycle ride. Linda's interest in Christian iconography {{is reflected in the}} inclusion of her work The Eucharist in another Flinders University Art Museum exhibition, Holy, Holy, Holy in 2004, which examined the advent of Christianity in Australia. Other works represent her traditional country, such as her painting Tingari Men at Wilkingkarra (Lake Mackay), which was a finalist at the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. Artists of the Western Desert region, such as Linda Syddick, frequently portray figures from the Tingari cycle of 'songlines', particularly the Tingari Men. These are ancestral elders who − in the Dreaming − travelled over vast areas, performing rituals and creating the country.|$|E

25|$|King Pedro II died in {{his sleep}} on 9 December 1706. Following his death, Ribeira Palace was redecorated as a {{reflection}} of the mourning. On the façade towards the Terreiro do Paço, large black banners <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> from the windows for this purpose. A month later, the time was declared to be appropriate for John to be acclaimed king. Preparations for John's acclamation had already been started and once allowed, the royal palace was redecorated; the black banners were replaced with red ones, and fruit wreaths <b>were</b> <b>hung</b> throughout all of the palace.|$|E
