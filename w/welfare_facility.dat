In 1890 capacity reached 800 inmates although actual headcount fluctuated with economic conditions and unemployment. A women's wing {{was set up in}} 1909. The workhouse operated through the years of the Weimar Republic although the number of inmates shrank to around one hundred and the workhouse itself gradually became a social <b>welfare</b> <b>facility</b> rather than a prison.

40|$|Land use at {{contaminated}} sites, following remediation, {{is often}} needed for regional redevelopment. However, there exist few methods of developing economically and socially feasible land-use plans based on regional needs {{because of the}} wide variety of land-use requirements. This study proposes a new needs analysis method for the conceptual land-use planning of contaminated sites and illustrates this method with a case study of an illegal dumping site for hazardous waste. In this method, planning factors consisting of the land-use attributes and related facilities are extracted from the potential needs of the residents through a preliminary questionnaire. Using the extracted attributes of land use and the related facilities, land-use cases are designed for selection-based conjoint analysis. A second questionnaire for respondents to the first one who indicated an interest in participating in the second questionnaire is conducted for the conjoint analysis to determine the utility function and marginal cost of each attribute in order to prioritize the planning factors to develop a quantitative and economically and socially feasible land-use plan. Based on the results, site-specific land-use alternatives are developed and evaluated by the utility function obtained from the conjoint analysis. In this case study of an illegal dumping site for hazardous waste, the uses preferred as part of a conceptual land-use plan following remediation of the site were (1) agricultural land and a biogas plant designed to recover energy from biomass or (2) a park with a <b>welfare</b> <b>facility</b> and an athletic field.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the characteristics and satisfactions related with facility foodservice for the elderly in the Northern Gyeonggi-do area (Republic of Korea). To accomplish this, a survey was conducted to investigate the general characteristics of the elderly, health information, and satisfaction with the foodservice of a <b>welfare</b> <b>facility</b> in the area. The main sources of health information for both the male and female elderly included ‘health professionals ’ (49. 0, 45. 7 %) and the ‘mass media ’ (34. 4, 33. 5 %), and they were revealed to trust the information from ‘health professionals ’ (65. 6, 59. 5 %), more so than the ‘mass media ’ (19. 8, 20. 8 %). The principal diseases of the elderly were ‘hypertension ’ (27. 1 %), ‘diabetes’ (21. 9 %), ‘palsy ’ (19. 8 %) in males, and ‘hypertension ’ (32. 4 %), ‘diabetes ’ (24. 9 %), ‘arthritis ’ (15. 0 %) in females. Most male and female elderly indicated the main reasons for skipping a meal to be ‘no appetite ’ (37. 5, 53. 8 %) and ‘indigestion’(19. 1, 17. 3 %), respectively. The facility foodservice was used by the male elderly for the reasons of ‘irritating to cook ’ (28. 1 %), ‘to meet a friend ’ (26. 0 %), and ‘economic ’ (14. 6 %), while the female elderly used it for the reasons of ‘economic ’ (25. 4 %), ‘to meet a friend ’ (23. 1 %), and ‘irritating to cook ’ (23. 1 %). The reasons for satisfaction with the facility were subject to ‘meal supply ’ (28. 0, 37. 2 %), ‘social exchanges ’ (20. 0, 22. 3 %), and ‘good facilities ’ (18. 7, 18. 2 %). Regarding the officers and nurses of the facility, 13. 3 % and 9. 3 % of males and 8. 3 % and 12. 4 % of females indicated satisfaction, respectively.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. The studies {{included}} in this dissertation {{examine the relationship between}} casual walking and nighttime sleep quality among older adults. Previous research shows that sleep would be influenced from walking briskly or for long periods of time. This research tested whether casual walking a few days per week improved sleep. Sleep quality was assessed prior to and following one month of walking with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989), an instrument proven to be valid and reliable with numerous different populations. In a preliminary study, a volunteer convenience sample of 30 older adults was recruited in 2002 from an Assisted Living Facility (ALF) in Tallahassee, Florida. After hearing a presentation about the benefits of walking on sleep, residents were {{invited to participate in the}} study. Everyone attending two presentations agreed to walk and walks took place either in the morning or afternoon in the halls of the ALF, in two groups of 15. Half (50 %) of the residents that participated for one month experienced an improvement in the quality of their sleep, 30 % experienced no change, and 19 % experienced a decrease in the quality of their sleep. The improvement, however, was not statistically significant. Subsequently, while a research student in the Graduate School of Medicine, Department of Social Gerontology at Tokyo University, a Nepalese colleague offered to conduct comparative research with older adults in Kathmandu. In 2009, 43 older Nepalese adults were recruited in a volunteer convenience sample at Pashupati Briddaashram, a social <b>welfare</b> <b>facility</b> in Kathmandu, to walk there with Hom Nath Chalise, Ph. D., one of the directors of Geriatric Center Nepal, and several volunteers. Every attempt was made to recreate the research conducted in Tallahassee; however, walks took place early in the morning and occurred outside. Since the studies in Kathmandu and Tallahassee are not comparable, the Nepalese research became a second preliminary study. To increase the ability to make generalizations from this research, arrangements were made to conduct another study with older adults on Oahu walking outside utilizing a control group. The results of the study on Oahu, as well as the two preliminary studies are contained in this dissertation. The evidence presented shows that, while walking is a beneficial activity and has numerous other benefits for an older adult, casually walking is not sufficient to significantly improve older adults' nighttime sleep quality...|$|E

This research added the new point of view, {{the improvement of the}} comfort, to the maintenance of safety and sanitation. Chapter 1 is the result of investigation of laws, regulations and administrative direction after large break of Legionnaires 2 ̆ 7 disease at public bathing facilities. In addition to this, it studied the difference of standard between Europe and the United States and Japan, and the backgrounds and main points of 2 ̆ 2 Guideline for the Countermeasure to Legionella in the Bath Facilities 2 ̆ 2 by The Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Sanitary Engineering of Japan. Chapter 2 presented the result of actual condition survey at social <b>welfare</b> <b>facility</b> bath, its analysis and problems to be solved. Additionally, it was examined in detail the official survey which led to change Minister for Health and Welfare criteria as to the length of time to maintain concentration of free chlorine in the bath water from 2 ̆ 2 two hours a day 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 all the time 2 ̆ 2. Chapter 3 is the scientific statement about the accurate on-site absorptiometric method to measure the concentration level of free chlorine and chlorine dioxide in bath water. And, Chapter 3 included field survey of water contamination, changes of free chlorine concentration, time series variation and distribution of bacteria like Lesionella at social welfare facilities, and its analysis. This survey was done because the management of residual disinfectant concentration in circulation type bath is very important as countermeasure against Legionnaires 2 ̆ 7 disease. Chapter 4 described the changes of water quality and free residual chlorine concentration after bathing at laboratory experiment. It also considered necessary quantity of exchange water to maintain the bathwater quality. Chapter 5 described the disinfection of hot spring water and comfort. And, it examined the characteristic of disinfection consumption and the inactivation of Legionella by the difference of a hot spring water quality. Since the spring water contains much dissolved matter and various components, it is necessary to examine the disinfection method appropriate to each nature of spring as sanitary management technique when spring water is utilized as bath water...|$|E
