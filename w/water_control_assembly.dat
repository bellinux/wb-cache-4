40|$|AbstractBecause of the {{diversity}} of geological characteristics and the complexity of percolation rules, many problems are found ineffective <b>water</b> influx <b>control</b> in gas reservoir development. The problems mainly focus on how to understand water influx rules, to establish appropriate countermeasures, and to ensure the effectiveness of technical measures. It is hard to obtain a complete applicable understanding through the isolated analysis of an individual gas reservoir due to many factors such as actual gas reservoir development phase, research work, pertinence and timeliness of measures, and so on. Over the past four decades, the exploration, practicing and tracking research have been conducted on <b>water</b> <b>control</b> in gas reservoir development in the Sichuan Basin, and a series of comprehensive <b>water</b> <b>control</b> technologies were developed integrating advanced concepts, successful experiences, specific theories and mature technologies. Though the development of most water-drive gas reservoirs was significantly improved, <b>water</b> <b>control</b> effects were quite different. Based on this background, {{from the perspective of the}} early-phase requirements of <b>water</b> influx <b>control,</b> the influencing factors of a water influx activity, the dynamic analysis method of water influx performance, the optimizing strategy of a <b>water</b> <b>control,</b> and the <b>water</b> <b>control</b> experience of typical gas reservoirs, this paper analyzed the key problems of <b>water</b> <b>control,</b> evaluated the influencing factors of <b>water</b> <b>control</b> effect, explored the practical <b>water</b> <b>control</b> strategies, and proposed that it should be inappropriate to apply the previous <b>water</b> <b>control</b> technological model to actual work but the pertinence should be improved according to actual circumstances.

Young and fresh flowers were harvested from 4 years bougainvillea trees randomly. Flower stems (petiole) were placed individually in an open solution containing different concentrations of ethanol immediately after harvesting and were placed at 28 0 C of room temperature. The treatments were <b>water</b> <b>control,</b> 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 70 % ethanol. Positive response was found in case of 8 and 10 % ethanol after 5 days of treatment. Dry weight was higher in lower concentration of ethanol and lower in higher concentration. Flower longevity was 2 days more in 8 and 10 % ethanol than <b>water</b> <b>control</b> and other concentrations of ethanol.

Therefore, the drop {{performance of the}} <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly</b> {{is important for the}} safety of a nuclear reactor. In this study, the drop performance of the conceptually designed <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly</b> for the prototype generation IV sodium-cooled fast reactor that is being developed at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute as a next-generation nuclear reactor was experimentally investigated.

Moreover, performance tests under several types and magnitudes of seismic loading conditions were also conducted to investigate the effects of seismic loading on the drop performance of the <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly.</b> The drop time of the conceptually designed <b>control</b> rod <b>assembly</b> for 0 % of the tentatively designed flow rate was measured to be 1. 527 seconds, and this agrees well with the analytically calculated drop time.

30|$|The {{soil and}} <b>water</b> <b>control</b> curse in Baiquan County could {{be divided into}} two stages. Before 1986, the soil and <b>water</b> <b>control</b> actions are {{scattered}} in small scales. The analysis of the historical data implies the failure of the scattered control actions during this period. For example, in the end of 1970 s, the forest coverage was even under 3.7 % with various natural disasters [16]. Poverty was exacerbated with the deterioration of the ecological system in that period in Baiquan County. The Baiquan county government has changed soil and <b>water</b> loss <b>control</b> polices since 1986. Comprehensive demonstration actions are taken in large scales. The area proportion of soil and <b>water</b> <b>control</b> is increased with the year. Based on the theory of ecology, comprehensive countermeasures not only bring ecological benefits but also bring economic benefits to the local areas. Thus the comprehensive soil and <b>water</b> loss <b>control</b> demonstration actions have made great contribution to improvement of the ecological status.|$|R
