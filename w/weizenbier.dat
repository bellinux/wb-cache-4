5000|$|<b>Weizenbier,</b> short Weizen: [...] "Weizen" [...] is German for [...] "wheat". These {{terms are}} used in the western (Baden-Württemberg) and {{northern}} German regions for Weißbier.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Weizenbier</b> and Weißbier are the {{standard}} German names for wheat beer - [...] "Weizen" [...] is German for [...] "wheat", and [...] "weiß" [...] is German for [...] "white".|$|E
5000|$|The Bavaria, Goaßmaß (goat stein) is a 50%/50% or 60%/40% {{mixture of}} dark <b>Weizenbier</b> and cola, {{with a shot}} of Kirsch. It is served in a one-liter stein called a [...] "Maß". There is also a Goaßhalbe ("half goat"), which is served in a 0.5-liter glass.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Weizenbier</b> or Hefeweizen, in the {{southern}} parts of Bavaria usually called Weißbier (literally [...] "white beer", but the name probably derives from <b>Weizenbier,</b> [...] "wheat beer"), is a beer, traditionally from Bavaria, in which {{a significant proportion of}} malted barley is replaced with malted wheat. By German law, Weißbiers brewed in Germany must be top-fermented. Specialized strains of yeast are used which produce overtones of banana and clove as by-products of fermentation. Weißbier is so called because it was, {{at the time of its}} inception, paler in color than Munichs traditional brown beer. It is well known throughout Germany, though better known as Weizen ("Wheat") outside Bavaria. The terms Hefeweizen ("yeast wheat") or Hefeweißbier refer to wheat beer in its traditional, unfiltered form. The term Kristallweizen (crystal wheat), or kristall Weiß (crystal white beer), refers to a wheat beer that is filtered to remove the yeast and wheat proteins which contribute to its cloudy appearance.|$|E
50|$|Kristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American {{styles of}} wheat beer are {{sometimes}} {{served with a}} slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there. The modern American custom appears to have originated in Portland, Oregon in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served Widmer Brothers Brewery's <b>Weizenbier</b> {{with a slice of}} lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the Cascade hops.|$|E
5000|$|In {{northern}} Bavaria, it {{is common}} to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam. A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is cola-weizen, which is a mix of cola and <b>Weizenbier.</b> Another mixture popular during the summer is a radler variant with a 50-50 mix of Weißbier with lemonade called [...] "Russ", which is the German term for Russian.|$|E
50|$|Although German wine is {{becoming}} more popular {{in many parts of}} Germany, the national alcoholic drink is beer. German beer consumption per person is declining but—at 116 litres annually—it is still {{among the highest in the}} world. Beer varieties include Alt, Bock, Dunkel, Kölsch, Lager, Malzbier, Pils, and <b>Weizenbier.</b> Among 18 surveyed western countries, Germany ranked 14th in the list of per capita consumption of soft drinks in general, while it ranked third in the consumption of fruit juices. Furthermore, carbonated mineral water and Schorle (its mixture with fruit juice) are very popular in Germany.|$|E
50|$|From {{the more}} {{westerly}} parts of Austria come Kaiser, Zipfer and Kapsreiter in Upper Austria. Upper Austria {{is also home}} to famous Freistadt beer (Freistädter Bier). The brewery's organization is unique in that the brewery is a commune-owned and operated by those individuals who own a house within the city walls, thus the name of the town Freistadt (free-city). Continuing West, Salzburg is home to Stiegl, as well as Augustiner Bräu (not related to the German one) and Edelweiss. <b>Weizenbier</b> (wheat beer) is the most popular type of beer in this region. From Tyrol and Vorarlberg come Falkenstein, Frastanzer, Mohrenbräu, Starkenberger, Zillertaler, Fohrenburger and Der Wilde (Wildschönau Brewery).|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the Widmer Brothers {{introduced}} their [...] "Hefeweizen" [...] to America. Rather {{than being}} a traditional Hefeweizen, which is characterized by distinctive yeast flavors, this was simply an unfiltered version of their existing wheat beer (<b>Weizenbier),</b> and uses Cascade hops, a modern West Coast hops. These were both served at the local Dublin Pub {{with a slice of}} lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavors of the Cascade hops. Subsequently, both this style of [...] "American Hefeweizen" [...] (meaning [...] "unfiltered wheat beer, with American hops, and without special yeast"), and the custom of serving wheat beer with a slice of lemon have both spread widely.|$|E
50|$|Munich {{is famous}} for its breweries and the Weissbier (or Weißbier / <b>Weizenbier,</b> wheat beer) is a {{speciality}} from Bavaria. Helles, a pale lager with a translucent gold colour is the most popular Munich beer today, although it's not old (only introduced in 1895) and {{is the result of a}} change in beer tastes. Helles has largely replaced Munich's dark beer, Dunkles, which gets its colour from burnt malt. It was the typical beer in Munich in the 19th century, but today it is more of a speciality. Starkbier is the strongest Munich beer, containing 6-9 per cent alcohol. It is dark amber in colour and has a heavy malty taste. It is available and popular during the Lenten Starkbierzeit (strong beer season), which begins on or before St. Joseph's Day (19 March). The beer served at Oktoberfest is a special type of Märzen beer with a higher alcohol content than regular Helles.|$|E
