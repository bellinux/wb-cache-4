That was how I got exposed to jazz music... {{basically}} listening to Dinah Washington, Billie Holiday, and Frank Sinatra. But {{also a lot}} of piano players, such as Bill Evans, Oscar Peterson and Erroll Garner, those were my mother's favorites.|$|E

[...] He asked me what it was, and I told him it was the white man’s religion which was discussed in that room. [...] He came in and sat with us boys. [...] During the preaching he sat very reverently and listened attentively to all that was said, although he could not understand a single word. [...] His attention to the service pleased Captain Pratt exceedingly. [...] <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> ready to depart, he was presented with a well-made top-buggy and a set of harness, all of which were made at the school. I was delighted at seeing my father so well treated and recognized. [...] Other chiefs had visited us, but my father was the first Indian to receive such courteous recognition and agreeable presents.|$|E
2500|$|Bowles {{could read}} at age 3 and was writing stories by age 4. Soon, he wrote surrealistic poetry and music. In 1922, at age 11, {{he bought his}} first book of poetry, Arthur Waley's A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems. At age 17, he had a poem, [...] "Spire Song", {{accepted}} for publication in Transition. This Paris-based literary journal served as a forum for leading proponents of modernism— Djuna Barnes, James Joyce, Paul Éluard, Gertrude Stein [...] and others. Bowles' interest in music also dated from his childhood, when his father bought a phonograph and classical records. (Bowles was interested in jazz, but such records were forbidden by his father.) His family bought a piano, and the young Bowles studied musical theory, singing, and piano. When he was 15, he attended a performance of Stravinsky's The Firebird at Carnegie Hall, which made a profound impression: [...] "Hearing The Firebird made me determined to continue improvising on the piano <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> out of the house, and to notate my own music with an increasing degree of knowing that I had happened upon a new and exciting mode of expression." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus 6s. 4-1/2d. is {{the exact}} sum. The best plan will be for you not to buy {{anything}} for me till I get <b>my</b> holidays, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> to bring me to London. Tell William John I am coming.|$|R
6000|$|Hetty laughed mockingly. [...] "You and I {{are going}} to drive over to the Newcombes and stay the night. You get nervous <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> away. But {{we are not going}} there quite straight; and you had better put your warmest things on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Be silent!' said Janki. 'Long ago, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> here, water came to Ten--no, Eleven--cutting, {{and there}} was great trouble. Let us get away to where the air is better.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rich!" [...] exclaimed Lewis, with a smile, {{in which}} there was a touch of contempt. [...] "Well, yes, we were rich enough once, but <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> away these wretched mines became--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; even <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> gone'--and {{his voice}} was less clear--'there was the less time to feel the change, when the boys and their mother had nothing but me between them and want.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not going}} to repeat it, Charlie. I only want to say that I do not think <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and yours <b>are</b> very {{friendly}} together, which <b>is</b> natural, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> all for King William, and your father for King James. He makes no secret of that, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so {{accustomed}} to the disguise," [...] she said, [...] "that I feel more comfortable in it than dressed as I now am, and {{it is much more}} amusing {{to be able to go}} about as I like than to remain all day cooped up here <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> abroad." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> had <b>been</b> {{married a}} little while, {{he took his}} {{youngest}} brother {{to live with him}} as his assistant.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am no fit mate for you," [...] she said. [...] "Even <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> {{alive and}} the tribe unbroken, {{what were we}} that I should wed a great Carthaginian noble? Now the tribe is broken, I am only a Roman slave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true I {{have read}} them, Piero," [...] said Romola. [...] "Some {{of them a}} great many times over, when I was a little girl. I used to get the book down <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> asleep, so that I could read to myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of five years,' said Bedford. 'That face--that cough--have {{brought all}} back--ay, the yearning look <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> absent, and the pure rosy {{fairness}} that Harry and Tom cited so fiercely against {{one who would}} have told them how sick to death she was. I mind me too, that when our grandame of Hereford made us motherless children over to our grandsire of Lancaster, {{it was with a}} warning that Harry had the tender lungs of the Bohuns, and needed care. One deadly sickness he had at Kenilworth, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> ridden for post-haste. My mind misgave me throughout this weary siege; but his service held me fast at home, and I trusted that you would watch over him.' ...|$|E
60|$|MISS P.--I was {{a dancer}} once, for three months, four years ago, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>father</b> <b>was</b> in prison.|$|R
60|$|D'you think I {{can go to}} Oxford again <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> has <b>been</b> {{tried for}} forgery? No, no! No, no! I'd rather shoot myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jack is at Oxford, as you know, and I wish to {{give him}} any chance that a good {{education}} may afford. It did not do much for me, but he may <b>be</b> more lucky. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> dead, I think I shall sell this place; but I have not quite {{made up my mind}} about that;--it must depend on circumstances. As for the girls, you see that I do what I can to educate them." ...|$|R
60|$|I do not {{remember}} anything of my father's earlier and more energetic time. I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw only the last decadent phase of his educational career.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wrayburn. Mr Eugene Wrayburn. He is {{what they}} call a barrister, with nothing to do. The first time he came to our old place was <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> alive. He came on business; not that it was HIS business--HE never had any business--he was brought by a friend of his.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know I {{always had}} wondered, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> telling {{any of the}} {{circumstances}} of the fire to me, how it could be that a woman could sleep so soundly as to be unaware of her horrid position till it was too late even to give shout or sound of any kind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not expectin' you an' Noel {{will run}} your heads into too much danger," [...] Jacob said, passionately. [...] "I {{know you would}} help father if the chance came your way; but it's my duty to take every risk, an' I count on doin' so even though we part company within the hour! Do you suppose I can loiter at a safe {{distance}} from the painted devils <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> expectin' to see some sign that I'm doin' all I may to help him?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Of course I {{believe that}} Jews perished in Germany, and (those) same Jews perished in Germany while the Pope Pius XII {{looked the other}} way and the {{government}} of America {{looked the other way}}. Now there is reconciliation between Jews and Catholics and the government of the United States. What is wrong with reconciliation between those who looked the other way <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>were</b> being brought into America as slaves, and to this very moment have not received justice? I think atonement, reconciliation, and responsibility should be the watch word for this time, and I am willing to sit down with any who wish to discuss atonement, reconciliation, and responsibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have lost}} all {{interest}} in my {{success on the}} stage," [...] she answered, [...] "now I know the penalty I must pay for it. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> memory <b>is</b> clear of reproach, I shall leave the theater never to return to it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Similarly, it {{was through}} Mr Lightwood that you ever saw her again, for you were {{with him on the}} night <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> found, and so I found you with her on the next day. Since then, you have seen my sister often. You have seen my sister oftener and oftener. And I want to know why?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{but some}} of our people were there years ago, <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> yet a young man. One of the parties that searched farther for a {{location}} for the tribe when first they settled here came upon a strange people who wore many ornaments of yellow metal. Their spears were tipped with it, as were their arrows, and they cooked in vessels made all of solid metal like my armlet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{facts of}} bill-sticking,' pursued His Majesty, in a benignant manner, 'as known to myself, air as following. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> Engineer, Beadle, and Bill-Sticker to the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn, he {{employed}} women to post bills for him. He employed women to post bills {{at the time}} of the riots of London. He died at the age of seventy-five year, and was buried by the murdered Eliza Grimwood, over in the Waterloo Road.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} devote that streak to Lake," [...] she said. [...] "I {{did my best}} for him. But Lake was much {{too much of a}} gentleman or an idealist about women, or what you will, to know his {{business}} as a lover. And that side of me fell in love, the rest of me protesting, with a man named Caston. It was a notorious affair. Everybody in New York couples my name with Caston. Except <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> about. His jealousy has blasted an area of silence--in that matter--all round him. He will not know of that story. And they dare not tell him. I should pity anyone who tried to tell it him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forty {{thousand}} pounds' {{worth of}} shares," [...] Letitia continued, [...] "which are worth as much now as <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> bought them, <b>are,</b> I suppose, nothing to you. I wondered whether you would object {{to have them}} back again? I {{think that it would}} relieve <b>my</b> <b>father's</b> mind." ...|$|R
60|$|El-Soo laughed. “It {{is a new}} custom,” she said. “It {{began this}} spring. Last year, and the years before, it was sixteen dollars an ounce. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father’s</b> debt <b>was</b> made, it was sixteen dollars. When he spent at the store the money he got from you, for one ounce he was given sixteen dollars’ worth of flour, not seventeen. Wherefore, shall you pay for me at sixteen, and not at seventeen.” Porportuk grunted and allowed the {{weighing}} to proceed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us hope," [...] {{cried the}} king, [...] "that {{the luck of}} the reigning house of Lutha has been at last restored. Not since my aunt, the Princess Victoria, ran away with a {{foreigner}} has good fortune shone upon my house. It was <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> still a young man--before he had yet come to the throne--and though his reign was marked with great peace and prosperity for the people of Lutha, his own private fortunes were most unhappy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} {{why there}} should be any rancor between us," [...] I answered. [...] "It is true that I hated you at Temple Bow. <b>When</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> killed and I was left a {{homeless}} orphan you had no pity for me, though your husband was my mother's brother. But you did me a good turn after all, for you drove me out into a world where I learned to rely upon myself. Furthermore, {{it was not in}} your nature to treat me well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>was</b> very ill. The parcel was not {{opened at}} first. I have been always sorry he {{never heard of}} it; but after all there was no asking of forgiveness, nor {{anything}} that could be answered. The boys got it with the tidings of our dear father's death. John came home to see about things, George stayed to look after his Stokesley. They were well over their troubles by that time, and they gave the restored money to David for his churches." ...|$|E
5000|$|Born Madeleine Gebelin, {{she told}} in the Medical Chronicle on 1 April 1895 how her medical career was born - [...] "I was barely eight years old <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> who <b>was</b> a wheelwright by trade - {{it is not a}} silly job - drove me to the sisters' home where he carried out his work..." [...] In the {{hospital}} of Nîmes, one nun took an affection to her and taught her some small procedures, such as the preparation of herbal teas and poultices.|$|R
60|$|One night <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> and I <b>were</b> {{alone in}} the little room where he slept with me, and he had {{finished}} reading his evening portion of Scripture aloud, I plucked up my courage {{to tell him that}} I loved Marie and wished to marry her, and that we had plighted our troth during the attack of the Kaffirs on the stead.|$|R
60|$|Q. Is {{not this}} just as <b>when</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> bids me <b>be</b> naught if I will: but if I be naught he will beat me for it?--A.
