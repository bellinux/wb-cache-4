5|$|Stereotypical and {{historically}} inaccurate images of Indians in general interfere with learning about them by creating, supporting and maintaining oversimplified and inaccurate views {{of indigenous peoples}} and their cultures. When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they {{contribute to the development}} of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.) In the same vein, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> continuation of the use of Indians as symbols and mascots is incongruous with the philosophy espoused by many Americans as promoting inclusivity and diversity.|$|E
5|$|<b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{it is the}} {{inalienable}} right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy {{the fruits of their}} toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain Purna Swaraji or complete sovereignty and self-rule.|$|E

40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967, several of us at System Development Corporation (SDC) {{undertook}} the development of LISTS (Library Information System Time-Sharing) a system that would allow library processing tasks to be performed on-line, utilizing general-purpose computer equipment. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> three developments {{in the field of}} computer technology had converged {{to the extent that it}} had become technically feasible to design such a system. These three developments included the development at SDC of sophisticated time-sharing and data-management systems, the advances being made by the Library of Congress and others in formatting large data bases for storage on magnetic tape, and the advent of third-generation computer equipment, which <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> could accommodate the large files that would be required. <b>We</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> together, these developments would make it possible for all types and sizes of libraries to use a large computer for their processing and housekeeping functions without changing their traditional patterns of operation or giving up the autonomy they now enjoy. More importantly, <b>we</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> they could use such a computer without having to undertake their own system design and development efforts, procure programmers, or either acquire a computer for their own use or rent computer time from a service bureau. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

25|$|This thought {{experiment}} has two purposes. First, it {{is intended}} to show that qualia exist. If one agrees with the thought experiment, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Mary gains something after she leaves the room—that she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before. That knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the quale that corresponds to the experience of seeing red, and it must thus be conceded that qualia are real properties, since {{there is a difference between}} a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.|$|E
25|$|Christ Is Truly Ascended Into Heaven. <b>We</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> our Lord Jesus Christ, in his same flesh, ascended {{above all}} visible heavens into the highest heaven, that is, the dwelling-place of God and the blessed ones, {{at the right}} hand of God the Father. Although it signifies an equal {{participation}} in glory and majesty, it is also taken {{to be a certain}} place about which the Lord, speaking in the Gospel, says: 'I go to prepare a place for you' (John 14:2). The apostle Peter also says: 'Heaven must receive Christ until the time of restoring all things' (Acts 3:21).|$|E
25|$|Any {{explanation}} {{of what goes on}} in a specific individual observation of one photon has {{to take into account the}} whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded.

Because this would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity, <b>we</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such a viewpoint should be given up entirely.|$|E
