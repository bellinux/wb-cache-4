3000|$|... 3 nanofluid {{is shown}} in Fig.  5. It is clear from this figure that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of φ {{velocity}} of nanofluids is decreased. This {{is due to the}} reason that the fluid becomes more viscous <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of φ which leads to decrease the velocity of nanofluids. The thermal conductivity of nanofluids also <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of φ. Experimentally by Colla et al. [32] also reported this behaviour. Results for different values of radiation parameter N are presented in Fig.  6. It is found that velocity <b>increases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of N. This result agrees well <b>with</b> <b>the</b> result obtained by Makinde and Mhone [31]. Physically, this means that <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of N, <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> amount of heat energy transfers to the fluid.|$|R
30|$|In fact, {{sorption}} is an {{exothermic process}} [[22]]. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in {{temperature of the}} adsorbate-adsorbent system, the sorption decreases. In other words, the adsorption equilibrium constant will decrease <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in temperature. However, when the diffusion process (intra-particle or transport-pore diffusion) mainly controls the adsorption process, the sorption capacity will <b>increase</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> in temperature. This is basically {{due to the fact}} that the diffusion process is an endothermic process, which leads to <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> sorptive capacity of the adsorbent. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of sorption capacity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increase</b> of temperature maybe attributed to the diffusion process.|$|R

5|$|Although no {{documentary}} {{account of}} Gibraltar {{is available for}} the period following the Madinat al-Fath project, {{there are reasons to}} believe that a small fortified town existed in Gibraltar, and that its existence was the direct consequence of the fall of Tarifa in 1292. After the capture of the city, it was expected that Sancho would lay siege to Algeciras (it did not eventually happen) in order to sever the most direct links of the Marinids with the Iberian peninsula. The threatening presence of a Christian stronghold to the west would have led to the establishment of a garrison to the east of Algeciras. That way, Gibraltar would have protected the rearguard of Algeciras and provide a fallback position should Algeciras have fallen. At the same time, and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> presence of the Christian fleets in the Straits, Gibraltar provided an excellent lookout post.|$|E

Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E

5|$|By 1857 the Perpetual Emigration Fund was exhausted; {{almost all}} of the {{handcart}} emigrants that year and in subsequent years had to pay their own way. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> cost, the number of handcart emigrants dropped from nearly 2,000 in 1856 to about 480 in 1857. Nevertheless, in 1857 two companies made the trek, both arriving in Salt Lake City by September 13. Perhaps the most notable incident was when a captain of the U.S. Army's Utah Expedition, on its way to Utah to confront Young and the Mormons, donated an ox to the hungry emigrants.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} a post-war economic and population boom after World War II. Oscar Mayer, Ralston Purina, {{and other companies}} all built plants in west Davenport. 1956 brought the Interstate highway network to Davenport. Local transportation planning took on a new design after World War II. Paved state and federal highways built to and through Davenport in the 1930s were expanded to handle new truck shipping patterns. In 1960 a second span was constructed to help <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> traffic on the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge, while the first segment of Interstate 80, between Iowa Highway 38 and U.S. Highway 61, opened later that year. A segment connecting U.S. 61 to U.S. 67 was completed in 1964, while other Interstate highways – 74 on the east and 280 on the west – also opened to traffic during the 1960s and early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Brisbane was {{established}} as a penal settlement. In spite of the hazards, the preferred access to Moreton Bay and Brisbane was through the southern entrance, between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island, mainly due to shorter shipping route and better shipping conditions. The southern entrance was therefore marked in 1825 and a pilot station {{was established}} at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island in 1827. Although the northern entrance was considered in the 1830s, it was only <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> shipping activity due to proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842 that vessels began to use the northern entrance. Buoys marking the entrance were laid in 1846–1847, and in 1848 the Pilot Station was moved to Bulwer on Moreton island. By then the northern entry was regarded as the main entry.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>increased</b> numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity.

The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation.
