5|$|Despite these {{problems}} England <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> the better team, with Cowdrey’s leadership, Geoffrey Boycott’s batting and a weakened West Indian attack being {{the difference between}} the sides.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} they <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> {{involved in}} , {{where most of}} the wrestlers in the game were members of JCW.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.|$|E
50|$|The music <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{in form of}} a {{background}} score and <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> used to enhance the various moods and scenes within the film.|$|R
50|$|The Scotto family's palace <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{destroyed}} {{during the}} Second World War {{and the garden}} grew ever more degraded until 2008 when it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> reconstructed and refitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{constituency}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> rural, {{and particularly}} the coastal areas around the city of Vaasa <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> Swedish-speaking. The largest party in the 2007 election was the Centre Party.|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution. Also, coalition troops in Belgium <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, {{and most of the}} British veterans of the Peninsular War had been sent to North America to fight in the War of 1812.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Christian {{feeling was}} at its height in Mosul, and the Christians of the city <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> {{confined}} to their homes during the whole month in fear of further action by the frenzied mob.|$|E
5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known about their behavior. Before then, most information about the marsh shrew was from notes about the mammal's habitat and information about trapping it. Its descriptions in the literature <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> derived from the examination of museum specimens.|$|E
50|$|The Krüper's nuthatch, a rare nuthatch, <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{restricted}} to forests of Turkish pine and depends heavily {{on it for}} feeding; the ranges of the two species <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> coincident.|$|R
50|$|Family law <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{a matter}} of custom, however {{customary}} family practices <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> supplemented and superseded by the Marriage Act of 1980, placing marriage largely within the jurisdiction of courts.|$|R
50|$|Such {{theories}} were proposed before tectonic theory <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> understood, {{and therefore}} <b>are</b> now <b>largely</b> discredited.|$|R
5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, {{there were}} a number of uprisings against the Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained with the aid of local tribes. To guard against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871. By that time Brooke's control of Sarawak was such that defences <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Biko {{endorsed}} {{the unification of}} South Africa's black liberationist groups—among them the BCM, PAC, and African National Congress (ANC)—in order to concentrate their anti-apartheid efforts. To this end, {{he reached out to}} leading members of the ANC, PAC, and Unity Movement. His communications with the ANC <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> via Griffiths Mxenge, and plans were being made to smuggle him out of the country to meet Oliver Tambo, a leading ANC figure. Biko's negotiations with the PAC were primarily through intermediaries who exchanged messages between him and Sobukwe; those with the Unity Movement <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> via Fikile Bam.|$|E
5|$|Company towns {{were once}} common in British Columbia. Many were large, but never had {{municipal}} government and <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> located on company-owned land. A few such as Granisle, Tumbler Ridge and Wells became municipalities, {{while others have}} become ghost towns. Among the largest were Anyox, Bralorne, Ocean Falls, Cassiar, Gold Harbour (Tasu) and Kitsault.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: One of Darrach's more {{prominent}} designs. The {{current design of}} the Elgin County Courthouse <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> due to {{his work in the}} late 19th century after the building <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed by fire ...|$|R
50|$|Wayne Enterprises and the Wayne Foundation <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> run by Bruce Wayne's {{business}} manager Lucius Fox. Fox makes most company decisions on Bruce Wayne's behalf, since Wayne's time <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> occupied as the vigilante Batman.|$|R
50|$|The west of {{the borough}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> flat in nature, {{dominated}} by the River Sence flood plain. This area of the borough <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> rural, consisting {{of a number of}} very small villages and hamlets.|$|R
5|$|Critical reviews <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> positive. The film {{currently}} has a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The Canadian network Space awarded it the 2005 Spacey Award for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Film.|$|E
5|$|DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy, {{the chief}} medical officer aboard the Enterprise. Kelley had {{reservations}} with the script, feeling that the characters and relationships from the series were not in place. Along with Shatner and Nimoy, Kelley lobbied for greater characterization, but their opinions <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> ignored.|$|E
5|$|His son, William, {{stayed behind}} {{with others to}} protect the family home, but they were {{overcome}} and the property was eventually looted and razed to the ground. Priestley's valuable library, scientific laboratory, and manuscripts <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> lost in the flames.|$|E
5000|$|Falaba is {{a former}} town in the Solima area, Koinadugu District of the Northern Province of Sierra Leone. The {{population}} of Falaba <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> from the Mandingo and Kuranko ethnic groups. The village <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> Muslim.|$|R
50|$|Secret {{societies}} in Singapore have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> eradicated {{as a security}} issue in the city-state. However many smaller groups remain today which attempt to mimic societies of the past. The membership of these societies <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> adolescent.|$|R
50|$|Shiva <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unknown {{outside of}} German-speaking countries. Although she speaks English, her acting roles have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> {{confined}} to German language films and television productions. She also starred in an Irish film called Short Order (2005).|$|R
5|$|Hoover {{directed}} the FBI to track King in 1957, and the SCLC {{as it was}} established (it {{did not have a}} full-time executive director until 1960). The investigations <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> superficial until 1962, when the FBI learned that one of King's most trusted advisers was New York City lawyer Stanley Levison.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton categorised animal colours {{by their}} uses, which cover both camouflage and mimicry. Poulton's categories <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> followed by Hugh Cott in 1940. Relevant Poulton categories {{are listed in}} the table. Where Poulton's definition covers a method but does not name it explicitly, the category is named in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|In April, the Bosnian Serbs {{were able}} to deploy 200,000 troops, {{hundreds}} of tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and artillery pieces. The Bosnian Croats could field approximately 25,000 soldiers {{and a handful of}} heavy weapons, while the Bosniaks <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> unprepared for combat with nearly 100,000 troops, but small arms for less than half of their number and virtually no heavy weapons.|$|E
5000|$|The {{light of}} the inner portion of the solar corona <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> inherent, whereas the {{light of the}} outer portion <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{reflected}} sunlight, as proven at the Sumatra eclipse by means of spectroscopic and polariscopic observations.|$|R
50|$|Despite her {{fame and}} {{recognition}} during her lifetime, Beach <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> neglected {{after her death}} in 1944 until the late 20th century. Efforts to revive interest in Beach's works have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> successful {{during the last few}} decades.|$|R
50|$|The land {{being used}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{marshland}} and reclaimed from the sea: in particular, it <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unoccupied. As a result, {{the social and}} fiscal costs of development are less than are usual for Chinese urban and industrial development.|$|R
5|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, republicanism would regain {{lost ground}} {{with the rise of}} liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The Revolutions of 1848 <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, and the remaining monarchies were transformed into constitutional monarchies.|$|E
5|$|Internment camps {{were once}} again set up in Banff during World War II, with camps located at Lake Louise, Stoney Creek, and Healy Creek. Prison camps <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> {{composed}} of Mennonites from Saskatchewan.|$|E
5|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that a '12th century renaissance' occurred in Byzantium. Although the term does not enjoy widespread usage, it is beyond doubt that 12th century Byzantium witnessed major cultural developments, which <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> underpinned by rapid economic expansion.|$|E
50|$|Orchestration {{is often}} {{discussed}} {{as having an}} inherent intelligence or even implicitly autonomic control, but those <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> aspirations or analogies rather than technical descriptions. In reality, orchestration <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> the effect of automation or systems deploying elements of control theory.|$|R
50|$|Until 1947, {{the second}} track <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{dismantled}} for reparations to the Soviet Union, but it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> restored from Halle to Sangerhausen by 1954. In 1965, the line near Berga-Kelbra was relocated {{for the new}} Kelbra Dam on the Helme.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum has}} a wide and varied events {{programme}} that changes every year. Events <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> family-focussed, with some events aimed at an older adult audience. Because of the family-focus, events <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> centred on bank holiday weekends and school holidays.|$|R
