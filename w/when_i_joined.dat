5|$|Being like Lofty was {{something}} I aspired to without realising it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> the Regiment I {{was told that}} the best way to survive those first years in the Sabre squadron was to pick out someone who you thought you would like to be. Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E

Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single.

500|$|During {{her time}} on Coronation Street, the {{character}} has {{become synonymous with}} her signature dish at the Rovers Return Inn, Betty's hotpot. ITV have described the dish as [...] "the stuff of legends", and in 1995, pie manufacturer Holland's Pies launched a real-life range of hotpots and pies based on the dish, called [...] "Betty's Kitchen". The idea for the range originated with the firm's marketing director, Dilys Day, who explained: [...] "I was brought up on hotpot and Coronation Street. So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> Holland's a year ago, it seemed right to put the two together with Betty's hotpot." [...] Day added that: [...] "We are all very excited about Betty's Kitchen products. Holland's is a strong northern brand, with mass market appeal and wholesome, honest values - {{the same can be}} said for The Street." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} suggested I come in with these songs. [...] <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined,</b> I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill O'Reilly, {{not an easy}} man to impress, said it was {{the best}} Test innings he had ever seen and aged only 22 Cowdrey was the {{youngest}} Englishman to make an Ashes century since Jack Hearne on the same ground in [...] Although Cowdrey would make 22 Test centuries they would all be measured against the yardstick of his Melbourne hundred; [...] "his driving, concentration and command were all faultless ... a tribute to his wonderful ability". As Frank Tyson recalled, [...] "Runs did not flow; they were grafted from a pitch which kept the batsman hopping around as delivery after delivery tickled their ribs. Colin was icily superb. For four hours his concentration never wavered...he stroked the ball through the cover and mid-wicket gaps in the field. Shooters became more frequent, but Colin dug them out. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> him at the wicket he was a run short of his maiden Test century: a goal he achieved with a scampered single. If he ever scored a better hundred I hope that I am there to see it". Cowdrey made 102 of England's first innings of 191 and once again this was enough for Tyson to bowl his team to victory as the tourists took a 2–1 lead in the series.|$|E
2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and {{you have to learn to}} deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have to make it clear that from the beginning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined,</b> I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, she {{approached}} Harry James, offering {{to work for}} him under one condition: that she be permitted to sing more than one chorus. Although James was looking for a more jazz-oriented singer, he allowed Forrest to audition. The band voted her in and she was hired. Several decades later, Forrest explained in an interview, [...] "Harry James was wonderful. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> him, I said, 'There's only one condition: I don't care how much you pay me, I don't care about arrangements. The one thing I want is to start a chorus and finish it. I want to do verses, so don't put me up for a chorus {{in the middle of an}} instrumental.' He said, 'You got it,' and that was it." [...] She also told writer George T. Simon, [...] "I'll always remain grateful to Artie and Benny. But they had been featuring me more like they did a member of the band, almost like another instrumental soloist. Harry, though, gave me just the right sort of arrangement and setting that fit a singer. It wasn't just a matter of my getting up, singing a chorus, and sitting down again." [...] In his book, The Big Bands, Simon explained that Harry James constructed [...] "the arrangements around his horn and Helen's voice, establishing warmer moods by slowing down the tempo so that two, instead of the usual three or more choruses, would fill a record ...many an arrangement would build to a closing climax during Helen's vocal, so that she would emerge as its star." [...] It was with the Harry James Orchestra that Helen recorded what are arguably her most popular numbers, including [...] "I Had the Craziest Dream" [...] in 1942, and 1941's [...] "I Don't Want to Walk Without You." [...] In 1942, Helen also appeared with the Harry James Band in the Hollywood film Springtime in the Rockies, starring Betty Grable.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to everyone. You can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>joined</b> the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E

In the meanwhile your part's quite easy. No trooper could ride you down unless you wanted him to, and you'll ride straight on to Montana--I've a route marked out for you.

6000|$|On {{the fourth}} evening {{he said to}} Pete Hoskings: [...] "I see that your advice was good, {{and that it would}} be madness for me to attempt to go by myself, but I don't see why I should not ride to Fort Bridger; not of course by myself, but with one of the caravans going west. It would be a great deal better for me to do that and to learn {{something}} of the plains and camping than to stay here for perhaps three months. At Fort Bridger I shall be able to learn more about the country, and might join some hunting party and gain experience that way. I might find other prospectors going up among the hills, and even if it were not near where my uncle is to be found, I should gain by learning something, and should not be quite a greenhorn <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>join</b> him." ...|$|R
