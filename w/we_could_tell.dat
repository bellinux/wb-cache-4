25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and we were allowed to be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands that lesson to our children's children. Had we space <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released}} their seventh studio album Violence Begets Violence. It is {{the first}} JMT album without the production help of Stoupe The Enemy Of Mankind because Vinnie Paz and Jus Allah grew tired of waiting. Paz stated; [...] "By now you have heard that this {{is the first}} Jedi Mind Tricks album we've made without Stoupe handling the production. The bottom line is that at some point after making our last album, A History of Violence, Stoupe lost his passion for making Hip Hop and wanted to try new things. Through our career, we've always waited on him to get inspired to make a new album, but this time around we got tired of waiting out his creative drought. He tried to produce some things for this new album, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> early on that his heart wasn't in making JMT records anymore. He's moved on as a producer to work in other genres with his side-projects, Dutch and Vespertina, and we've moved on with a new crop of talented producers to make the hardcore Hip Hop we've always been known for." ...|$|E

60|$|We need hardly {{say that}} the Prince, who is a consummate master of ten languages, speaks English quite as fluently as he does Chinese. Indeed, for a moment, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>tell</b> which he was talking.|$|R
60|$|It was a man's voice, and by its sound <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> {{that he was}} well-nigh exhausted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't, William," [...] Katharine interposed; [...] "Cassandra {{has heard}} us; she can judge what we are; she {{knows better than}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> her." ...|$|E

60|$|This was a {{difficult}} point to decide. If {{we went to see}} them, we might as well break up our camp, for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> when <b>we</b> should be able to come back to it.|$|R
6000|$|Somewhere about midnight {{we reached}} the {{neighbourhood}} of this place. How near or how far we were from it, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> since the moon was invisible, as of course the smoke was in the dark. Now the question was, what should we do? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{cause of}} this change was burglars. Not {{that any of these}} {{unpleasant}} persons had visited us, but we much feared they would. Several houses in the vicinity had been entered during the past month, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never <b>tell</b> when our turn would come.|$|R
60|$|He was {{not overly}} well supplied, having been on board {{only a few}} hours, but we {{contrived}} to make a hearty meal, and while eating Jim heard all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him regarding the occupation of Benedict by the British forces.|$|E
60|$|We had {{accomplished}} nothing of importance by going home. Colonel Campbell knew even more regarding Brant's movements than <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> him, {{and it was}} by no means necessary he should be informed immediately as to the result of General Herkimer's interview with the Mohawk sachem.|$|E
60|$|You {{think this}} a far-fetched coincidence, good reader! Well, {{all we can}} say is that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> you of another--a double-coincidence, which was far more {{extraordinary}} than this one, but as {{it has nothing to do}} with our tale we refrain from inflicting it on you.|$|E
6000|$|Cousin Sophia {{answered}} for Miss Oliver. [...] "Oh, indeed, Rilla, I {{remember that}} evening only too well, and you a-prancing {{down here to}} show off your party clothes. Didn't I warn you that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what was before us? Little {{did you think that}} night what was before you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jake nodded. [...] "They're smart. They {{knew the}} boys were coming to make a row and Stuyvesant wouldn't have them on the veranda. Then the wine was on the table, and anybody who'd noticed where <b>we</b> sat <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> your glass. It {{would have been easy}} to creep up to the shack before the moon rose." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were much}} amused at the {{termination}} of this affair, and I became, if possible, a still greater admirer of Euphemia's talents for management. But we both agreed {{that it would not}} do to keep up the sign any longer. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> when the irate driver might not pounce down upon us with a customer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be angry, dear Hans," [...] {{interrupted}} Simon in a pleading voice. [...] "You {{know how}} many bad characters are abroad in these rough times; why, for aught <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> {{you might have been}} one of these desperate Lutherans, who stick at nothing. But about the business?" ...|$|E
60|$|Aloysius. [Taking {{up some of}} the osiers and {{beginning}} to twist them.] That might {{be a good way to}} come at them; they could work through the day, and at evening <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> them how to repeat the words till the light comes inside their heads. But would Paul think well of it? He is more for pulling down than building up.|$|E
60|$|It {{was early}} morning--that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> by {{the feel of}} the sweet air and the look of the blessed sky, which we had never hoped to see again. It was, so near as we knew, an hour after sunset when we entered the tunnel, so it {{followed}} that it had taken us the entire night to crawl through that dreadful place.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{who have}} come here to Washington have come here because we feel {{we have to be}} winter {{soldiers}} now. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> come back to this country; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> be quiet; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hold our silence; <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, and not redcoats but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you begin}} to tell us your story, young sir, we should be glad {{to know how it}} is that you speak our {{language}} so well; for indeed <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> by your accent that you are not a native of these parts, which is of course impossible, seeing that your father is an Englishman and captain of the ship lying off there." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> from {{minute to}} minute {{whether we were}} {{planning}} for a world of solid reality, or telling ourselves fairy tales about this prospect of life. So much seemed possible, and everything <b>we</b> <b>could</b> think of so improbable. There were lapses when {{it seemed to me}} I could never be anything but just the entirely unimportant and undistinguished young man I was for ever and ever. I couldn't even think of myself as five and thirty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Much better, much better, thank you. I hope to {{find her}} on the sofa when I go back on Thursday. I could only run down for a few days, just to settle things, and see the children, before I join the Ramilies. Admiral Penrose very good-naturedly kept it open for me, till <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> how SHE was," [...] said the Captain, with rather a {{trembling}} voice.|$|E
60|$|Or <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> of that cake {{the pirates}} cooked {{so that the}} boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy {{snatched}} it {{from the hands of}} her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.|$|E
60|$|We {{must leave}} {{the scene that}} ensued to the reader’s imagination. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> how Mrs. Tibbs {{forthwith}} fainted away, and how it required the united strength of Mr. Wisbottle and Mr. Alfred Tomkins to hold her in her chair; how Mr. Evenson explained, and how his explanation was evidently disbelieved; how Agnes repelled the accusations of Mrs. Tibbs by proving that she was negotiating with Mr. O’Bleary to influence her mistress’s affections in his behalf; and how Mr. Gobler threw a damp counterpane on the hopes of Mr. O’Bleary by avowing that he (Gobler) had already proposed to, and been accepted by, Mrs. Bloss; how Agnes was discharged from that lady’s service; how Mr. O’Bleary discharged himself from Mrs. Tibbs’s house, without going through the form of previously discharging his bill; and how that disappointed young gentleman rails against England and the English, and vows there is no virtue or fine feeling extant, ‘except in Ireland.’ We repeat that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> all this, but we love to exercise our self-denial, and we therefore prefer leaving it to be imagined.|$|E
5000|$|Empress Dowager Cixi once {{complained about}} Lady Alute:"We {{made a mistake}} in {{selecting}} a wife for him. How <b>could</b> <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> that her beauty was false? She was very beautiful, but she hated us." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{made good}} time to within {{a few miles of}} the shore. Then the wind died {{suddenly}} out. We were all of us keyed up to such a pitch of anticipation that the blow was doubly hard to bear. And it was a blow, too, since <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell</b> in what quarter the wind might rise again; but Juag and I set to work to paddle the remaining distance.|$|R
60|$|We set sail, I say, from hence {{in seven}} days, and, finding the coast lie fairly on our {{starboard}} side, kept the land on board all the way, distance about three leagues; and it held us thus, {{about a hundred}} and twenty leagues due east, when on a sudden we {{lost sight of the}} land; whether it broke off, or whether it only drew off farther south, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b>|$|R
60|$|The sun set, the {{darkness}} fell, {{and it began}} to rain and blow. We started quite unobserved, so far as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> and, travelling downward from the overgrown, ruined town, gained the old road, and in complete silence, for the feet of camels make no noise, passed along it toward the lights of Harmac, which now and again, when the storm-clouds lifted, we saw glimmering {{in front of us}} and somewhat to our left.|$|E
60|$|There was one {{of those}} balls that knocked five men into a bloody mash, and I saw it lying on the ground {{afterwards}} like a crimson football. Another went through the adjutant's horse with a plop like a stone in the mud, broke its back and left it lying like a burst gooseberry. Three more fell further to the right, and by the stir and cries <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> that they had all told.|$|E
60|$|We crossed it in safety. On {{the other}} side {{extended}} a long flat of upheaved crusts of salt and mud, full of holes and pitfalls, an exceedingly toilsome and painful place to travel, and for all <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>tell,</b> dangerous too. I had all I could do to watch my feet and find surfaces to hold my steps. Eventually we crossed this broken field, reaching {{the edge of the}} gravel slope, where we were very glad indeed to rest.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the nice}} things about the Cold War was that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> nearlyalways <b>tell</b> who were our friends and who were our enemies. Therewere certain {{countries}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> more or less count on to take our side,and others that regularly opposed us. It is, however, more complicatednow. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> previously take the opposition of countries in theCommunist bloc for granted, we {{are now able to}} look to those samecountries for occasional support.

6000|$|... "There was a mystery," [...] said I. [...] "We were twins, and one {{day when}} we were two weeks old--that is, he was one week old, and I was one week old--we got mixed up in the bath-tub, and one of us drowned. <b>We</b> never <b>could</b> <b>tell</b> which.

60|$|Suddenly our {{attention}} was {{attracted by the}} sound of distant shouting, as of many people raising their voices at once, but whether in anger or rejoicing, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>tell.</b> Nearer and nearer came the tumult.

A second burst upon the heels of the first alternately laughing and shrieking as a madman.|$|R
