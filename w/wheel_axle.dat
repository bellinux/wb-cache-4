Standard unicycles don't have a chain, which limits the seat height based on how long the rider's legs are, because there the crank is attached directly to the <b>wheel</b> <b>axle.</b> Giraffe unicycles can range in heights from 3 feet to over 10 feet high.|$|E

He {{finished}} 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late race caution caused by Casey Mears' broken <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> cost him, and he was passed by Kyle Busch with five laps to go, and slipped back to sixth place.|$|E

2500|$|This {{may be a}} Domesday site, Haslow (Hadlow) being {{assessed}} {{as having}} 2 mills. The mill still stands, and had a large external high breast shot waterwheel. The millpond was about [...] by , or [...] in area. Apart from the cast iron <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> and wooden upright shaft, The cast iron pit wheel survives. [...] The crown wheel was of compass arm construction. The mill was working until 1947, millers in the latter days being John Thirsk (there in 1931) and Thomas Lambert before him. A Mr. Carr took over the mill in 1947 and established a small clothing factory, still trading today as Carr & Westley Ltd. The mill was also known as Hope Mill, being part of Hope Farm.|$|E
2500|$|The Caudron-Fabre had an {{undercarriage}} {{composed of}} both wheels and floats, {{though it was}} possible to remove the former; photographs show the aircraft in both configurations. [...] There was no cross-axle, each wheel being mounted individually on two pairs of outwardly splayed V-struts from the feet of the inner interplane struts and another to the feet of the nearest centre-section struts. Its floats were mounted immediately ahead of the wheels, articulated at a forward point on their centreline by a strut from the outrigger, a strut from the wing leading edge over the wheels and another from the <b>wheel</b> <b>axle.</b> A rear strut had a pneumatic shock absorber. [...] A third float, similar in size and shape, was mounted on a vertical strut attached to the girder cross-member ahead of the tailplane, braced at its lower end by a pair of struts angled up {{to the ends of the}} vertical girders. [...] The floats were flat bottomed with segmental section and an almost square plan, with a width about 70% of their length. As on Fabre's original aircraft, they were mounted with a pronounced angle of attack.|$|E

25|$|The trams were {{equipped}} with two Hägglund-built H-bogies. They had an outer frame with the motor axles {{parallel with the}} <b>wheel</b> <b>axles.</b> Each axle had four rubber suspensions as its primary suspension. The carriage rested on the bogie on rubber plates. Later the bogies were supplemented with a shock absorber. The motors were connected to the <b>wheel</b> <b>axles</b> via a universal joint and a gear. The wheels were rubber suspended, but were later replaced with steel-suspended axle boxes which required less maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The cylinders, with rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear, were {{identical}} {{to those of the}} Class 19C but with the stroke reduced from 26 in to 24 in. The modified cylinder covers had deep spigots to suit the reduction in stroke. The main drive and valve gear drive was from the third pair of coupled wheels. Grease lubrication was provided for all coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> boxes. The ten-coupled wheel arrangement, in conjunction with the sharp curvature of the lines in South West, necessitated special side play for the leading coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>axle</b> boxes and spherical bearings for the leading crank pins.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>wheel</b> and <b>axle</b> can {{be viewed}} as a version of the lever, with a drive force applied {{tangentially}} to the perimeter of the wheel and a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum.
