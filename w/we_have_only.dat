25|$|Among {{the first}} generations of Plato's students, {{there was a}} living memory of Plato's oral teaching, which was written up by many of them and {{influenced}} {{the literature of the}} period (much of which no longer survives today). The unwritten doctrines were vigorously criticized by Aristotle, who examined them in two treatises named 'On the Good' and 'On Philosophy' (of which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> a few fragments) and in other works such as his Metaphysics and Physics. Aristotle's student Theophrastus also discussed them in his Metaphysics.|$|E

At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E
25|$|Hasheesh {{is indeed}} an accursed drug, {{and the soul}} at last pays a most bitter price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of {{it is not the}} proper means of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation I did not know things as they are more truly than ever in the {{ordinary}} state?....

25|$|There {{are several}} {{approaches}} to this issue. One {{approach is to}} argue that all real forces drop off with distance from their sources in a known manner, so <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> {{to be sure that}} a body is far enough away from all sources to ensure that no force is present. A possible issue with this approach is the historically long-lived view that the distant universe might affect matters (Mach's principle). Another approach is to identify all real sources for real forces and account for them. A possible issue with this approach is that we might miss something, or account inappropriately for their influence, perhaps, again, due to Mach's principle and an incomplete understanding of the universe. A third approach {{is to look at the}} way the forces transform when we shift reference frames. Fictitious forces, those that arise due to the acceleration of a frame, disappear in inertial frames, and have complicated rules of transformation in general cases. On the basis of universality of physical law and the request for frames where the laws are most simply expressed, inertial frames are distinguished by the absence of such fictitious forces.|$|E

25|$|The Notre Dame review {{also noted}} that {{benefits}} from the restrictions weren’t enough to address the deep-rooted issues associated with alcohol abuse, and communities in the Valley needed continuing support. In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain of living with grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about. And within their stories about us is an acceptance that the paternal hand of government will determine the nature of our welfare and even the nature of our rights.… I want to tell a different story. It is about how Aboriginal people can be the authors of our stories and not passive and powerless subjects in stories told and written by others.… I want to talk about how the leaders of the Fitzroy Valley in the Kimberley are working together to create a pathway of hope and community vitality and resilience… if our journey of social reconstruction could be measured as a one kilometre track, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> travelled the first metre.The start of the journey has depended on the leadership of the Aboriginal community but the journey from this point on will largely be shaped by a partnership that we can create and build with governments.|$|E

500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{painting}} were positive; one review called it [...] "beyond question {{one of the finest}} landscapes ever painted in this country", adding, [...] "Its artistic merits are in some respects unrivalled: and added to these it has the advantage of being a representative painting of a portion of the most sublime and beautiful scenery on the American Continent." [...] The painting won a prize at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. At the same time, there were also critical voices; in particular, some American Pre-Raphaelites found his brushwork wanting. One such critic complained {{that it would have been}} better [...] "if the marks of the brush had, by dexterous handling, been made to stand for scrap and fissure, crag and cranny, but as it is, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> too little geology and too much bristle." ...|$|E
500|$|On November 19, 1951, Zhou {{called a}} conference in Shenyang to discuss {{improvements}} to China's logistical network, but these did little to directly resolve China's supply problems. Peng visited Beijing several times {{over the next several}} months to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities. By the winter of 1951–52, Peng became convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the foreseeable future. On February 24, 1952, the Central Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort. After the government representatives emphasized their inability to meet the demands of the war, Peng, in an angry outburst, shouted: [...] "You have this and that problem... You should go to the front and see with your own eyes what food and clothing the soldiers have! Not to speak of the casualties! For what are they giving their lives? We have no aircraft. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>only</b> a few guns. Transports are not protected. More and more soldiers are dying of starvation. Can't you overcome some of your difficulties?" [...] The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference. Zhou subsequently called a series of meetings, where it was agreed that the PVA would be divided into three groups, to be dispatched to Korea in shifts; to accelerate the training of Chinese pilots; to provide more anti-aircraft guns to the front lines; to purchase more military equipment and ammunition from the Soviet Union; to provide the army with more food and clothing; and, to transfer the responsibility of logistics to the central government. Peng also became a zealous supporter of the Three-anti Campaign due to his belief that corruption and waste were the main causes of the PVA's hardship.|$|E
