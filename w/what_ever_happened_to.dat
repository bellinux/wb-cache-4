30|$|At {{the same}} time, however, {{the culture of}} urban {{planning}} continues to display certain patterns of involution. The ambitions declared on its foundation {{at the start of}} modernity, often realised in unsustainable ways, even {{in the second half of}} the 1900 ’s (Boyer 1983) were followed by appeasing visions lacking a solid basis and real effectiveness, such as the strand of “collaborative planning” which saw its heyday in the 1990 ’s (Healey 1997), as well as some purely intellectual reveries involving unjustifiable and inconsequential themes and visions (Gunder and Hillier 2009). In many cases, the real effect was that of abandoning reforming aspirations in favour of the adaptive spirit of Postmodernity, that sort of “adaptive realism” of which Koolhaas himself became the exemplary figurehead (Koolhaas 2000). I have dedicated two books to these themes in recent years (Palermo and Ponzini 2010, 2014 forthcoming). <b>What</b> <b>ever</b> is <b>happening</b> <b>to</b> the culture of planning and design in this period, and what can be foreseen for the forthcoming decades?

The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, [...] "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly." ...|$|E

She also changed her public appearance as she removed her piercings, and dyed her hair platinum blonde, inspired by classic Hollywood movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe, Marlene Dietrich, Carole Lombard and Greta Garbo. The album's photography was taken by German photographer Ellen von Unwerth during three days; on {{the first and second}} days, the photos were shot at the Hollywood Dell hotel. Aguilera and von Unwerth moved to Forty Deuce in Hollywood to take images inspired by 1920s burlesque clubs {{on the last day of}} the session. The album's cover artwork was revealed in late-June 2006, featuring Aguilera with bright red lipstick and curly blonde hair dressed in white and lounging on a bed. Greg Kot from The Baltimore Sun labelled the cover as [...] "a classy retro look, a sign that [...] is ready for her close-up as the leading lady of the teen brat pack that emerged in the late '90s".|$|E

For, my Lords, if any circumstance of weakness, if any feebleness of nerve, if any yielding to weak and popular opinions and delusions were to shake us, consider what the situation of this country would be.

500|$|In 2015, Chastain took on {{the part}} of a {{commander}} in Ridley Scott's science fiction film The Martian. Starring Matt Damon as a botanist who is stranded on Mars by a team of astronauts commanded by Chastain's character, the film was based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name. Chastain met with astronauts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Johnson Space Center, and based her role on Tracy Caldwell Dyson, with whom she spent time in Houston. The Martian became her second film to earn over $600 million in two consecutive years. Also in 2015, Chastain played a countess who plots with her brother (played by Tom Hiddleston) to terrorize his new bride (played by Mia Wasikowska) in Guillermo del Toro's gothic romance Crimson Peak. Chastain approached the villainous part with empathy, and in preparation read graveyard poetry and watched the films Rebecca (1940) and <b>What</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> Baby Jane? (1962). Del Toro cast her in the film to lend accessibility to a part he considered [...] "psychopathic", but critic Peter Debruge of Variety found her [...] "alarmingly miscast" [...] and criticized her for failing to effectively convey her character's insecurity and ruthlessness. Conversely, David Sims of Slate magazine praised her for portraying her character's [...] "jealous intensity to the hilt".|$|E

2500|$|As {{their show}} progressed and ratings skyrocketed, French and Saunders {{received}} {{higher and higher}} budgets with which to create elaborate parodies of mainstream culture. These ranged anywhere from recreations of films (Thelma & Louise, Misery, Titanic, and <b>What</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> Baby Jane?) to spoofs on popular music artists (Madonna, Bananarama, ABBA and The Corrs being favourites). Certain spoken phrases and sight gags that referenced previously performed sketches (often from years before) were incorporated for loyal fans. In particular there is a running gag suggesting that French and Saunders are unable to accurately affect accents; this first appeared in their spoof of Gone with the Wind when they break their character {{in the middle of}} an elaborate and expensive parody to argue about the authenticity of their Southern accent. Saunders goads French to try the accent by saying: [...] "How are you?", and French responds with an interpretation sounding more like a strong Northern Irish accent. Since then, the duo often break character in the middle of elaborate sketches to do an [...] "accent check" [...] and repeat these lines.|$|E

[...] In a 2000 review for All About Eve (1950), Roger Ebert noted, [...] "Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style, so even her excesses are realistic."
