5|$|In the 19th century, Bridgwater {{was also}} home {{to a number of}} iron foundries. George Hennet's Bridgwater Iron Works worked on bridges, {{railways}} and machinery for Brunel and Robert Stephenson. This location allowed the import by boat of raw materials from Wales and the dispatch of finished work to south Devon using the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The carriage <b>workshops</b> <b>for</b> the latter were on an adjacent site. The works passed to his son and then traded as Hennet, Spink & Else. Some of the ironwork was produced for the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash, Cornwall. In 1873 it became the Bridgwater Engineering Company Limited but this failed in 1878. W Wills Ltd produced steam locomotives and fingerposts.|$|E
