5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has also}} been criticized within Islamic circles and the major {{opposition}} in the Indian subcontinent comes from the Barelvi movement. One of the main criticisms against them is that the men neglect and ignore their families, especially by going out on da'wa tours. Tablighi Jamaat participants, in response, argue that both genders should be equally engaged in Tabligh. They further say that <b>women,</b> <b>like</b> men, are also urged to carry the responsibility of Tabligh and that men should facilitate women's participation by providing childcare.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Homer {{goes home}} to {{apologize}} to Marge. To his surprise, he learns that what upset her most was not what he did, but that Bart saw it and will one day misconstrue {{it as a sign}} that it is okay to treat <b>women</b> <b>like</b> sex objects. She insists that he take Bart to meet Princess Kashmir so that Bart can see for himself that she {{is more than just a}} stripper. Left with no alternative, Homer and Bart scour the strip clubs of Springfield to find Princess Kashmir. Eventually, they track her down at the Sapphire Lounge.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{she wrote}} Je Me Souviens (I Remember), an {{intensely}} personal prose poem {{about their relationship}} which was presented as a single handwritten copy to Vivien {{in an attempt to}} win her back. They reconciled and traveled together to Lesbos, where they lived happily together for a short time and talked about starting a school of poetry for <b>women</b> <b>like</b> the one which Sappho, according to tradition, had founded on Lesbos some 2,500 years before. However, Vivien soon got a letter from her lover Baroness Hélène van Zuylen and went to Constantinople thinking she would break up with her in person. Vivien planned to meet Barney in Paris afterward but instead stayed with the Baroness and this time, the breakup was permanent.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} nonverbal {{communication}} on how men 'converse' in bars shows that <b>women</b> <b>like</b> men to touch, {{but it is}} their touching of other men that intrigues them.

25|$|The {{meaning of}} antifeminism has varied {{across time and}} cultures, and antifeminism attracts both men and women.

25|$|Among {{the women}} who engaged in {{activism}} for labor rights, traditional and non traditional patterns of activism existed. Mexican-American <b>women</b> <b>like</b> Dolores Huerta used their education and resources arrange programs at the grassroots level, sustaining and leading members it into the labor movement. As the sister-in-law of César Chávez, Huerta co-founded the National Farmworkers Association which would become the United Farm Workers and she had immense influence over the direction that it took, breaking stereotypes of the Mexican woman in the 1960s. However, it was most common for Chicana activists and female labor union members {{to be involved in}} administrative tasks for the early stages of UFW; <b>women</b> <b>like</b> Helen Chávez were essential in these responsibilities, such as credit union bookkeeping, behind the scenes and advising her husband. Still, both women along with other Chicana activists participated in picketing with their families in the face of police intimidation and racial abuse. Keeping track of union services and membership were traditionally responsibilities given to female organizers and it was integral to the institutional survival of the UFW, but it has gone much less recognized throughout history due to the male led strikes receiving majority public attention.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{communication}} theorists {{are also}} concerned with attempting {{to explain the}} methods used by those with power to prohibit <b>women</b> <b>like</b> Maria W.

Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women {{and others like them}} to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.|$|E
25|$|Cornell was wary of strangers. This led him {{to isolate}} himself and become a self-taught artist. Although he {{expressed}} attraction to unattainable <b>women</b> <b>like</b> Lauren Bacall, his shyness made romantic relationships almost impossible. In later life his bashfulness verged toward reclusiveness, and he rarely left the state of New York. However, he preferred talking with women, and often made their husbands wait {{in the next room}} when he discussed business with them. He also had numerous friendships with ballerinas, who found him unique, but too eccentric to be a romantic partner.|$|E

25|$|As {{inanimate objects}} cover the classes II, III and IV, it's not {{transparent}} into which class an inanimate object belongs. However, {{there are certain}} tendencies based on the semantic field of the nouns. Nouns {{that are able to}} move (like sun, moon, star, lightning, car, train) usually belong to class III, while products that traditionally {{have to do with the}} work of <b>women</b> (<b>like</b> clothes or berries and also milk) often belong to class II. Clothes made from leather are—as the word for leather itself—usually assigned to class III, due to their relation to animals.|$|E
25|$|One day, while Santhumala {{was away}} hunting, the twelve sisters met {{an old man}} who told them that Santhumala was not a human, but an ogress who liked to eat young <b>women</b> <b>like</b> them. So they fled from the ogre kingdom and wandered for days until they arrived to a clear river where they took a bath to refresh themselves. The local king saw the twelve ladies playing in the water {{and fell in love with}} them. So he brought them to his palace and married the twelve sisters.|$|E
25|$|The {{education}} reform efforts of <b>women</b> <b>like</b> Davies and the Langham group slowly made inroads. Queen's College (1848) and Bedford College (1849) in London began {{to offer some}} education to women from 1848. By 1862, Davies established a committee to persuade the universities to allow women to sit for the recently established Local Examinations, and achieved partial success in 1865. She published The Higher Education of Women a year later. Davies and Leigh Smith founded the first higher educational institution for women and enrolled five students. The school later became Girton College, Cambridge in 1869, Newnham College, Cambridge in 1871, and Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford in 1879. Bedford began to award degrees the previous year. Despite these measurable advances, few {{could take advantage of}} them and life for female students was still difficult.|$|E

In his visit to the University of the West Indies in Kingston, United States president Barack Obama stated about Jackson, Instead of remaining silent, she chose to speak out and started her own organisation to advocate for <b>women</b> <b>like</b> her, and get them treatment and get them justice, and push back against stereotypes, and give them some sense of their own power.|$|E
25|$|The New York blues was a type {{of blues}} music {{characterized}} by significant jazz influences and a more modernized, urban feel than the country blues. Prominent musicians from this field include Lionel Hampton and Big Joe Turner. In New York, jazz became fused with stride (an advanced form of ragtime) and became highly evolved. Among the first major New York jazz musicians was Fletcher Henderson, whose jazz orchestra, first appearing in 1923, helped invent swing music. The swing style that developed from New York's big jazz bands was catchy and very danceable, and was originally played largely by black orchestras. Later, white bands led by musicians like Jimmy Dorsey and Benny Goodman began to dominate and produced a number of instrumentalists that {{had a profound effect}} on the later evolution of jazz. Star vocalists also emerged, mainly <b>women</b> <b>like</b> the bluesy Billie Holiday and the scat singer Ella Fitzgerald.|$|E
25|$|In a cafe, Ferrando and Guglielmo (two officers) express {{certainty}} that their fiancées (Dorabella and Fiordiligi, respectively) will be eternally faithful. Don Alfonso expresses skepticism and claims {{that there is}} no such thing as a faithful woman. He lays a wager with the two officers, claiming he can prove in a day's time that those two, like all women, are fickle. The wager is accepted: the two officers will pretend to have been called off to war; soon thereafter they will return in disguise and each attempt to seduce the other's lover. The scene shifts to the two women, who are praising their men (duet: Ah guarda sorella—"Ah look sister"). Alfonso arrives to announce the bad news: the officers have been called off to war. Ferrando and Guglielmo arrive, brokenhearted, and bid farewell (quintet: Sento, o Dio, che questo piede è restio—"I feel, oh God, that my foot is reluctant"). As the boat with the men sails off to sea, Alfonso and the sisters wish them safe travel (trio: Soave sia il vento—"May the wind be gentle"). Alfonso, left alone, gloatingly predicts that the <b>women</b> (<b>like</b> all women) will prove unfaithful (arioso: Oh, poverini, per femmina giocare cento zecchini?—"Oh, poor little ones, to wager 100 sequins on a woman").|$|E
