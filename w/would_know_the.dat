5|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Power of Four were {{circulated}} {{to all of}} the members of the British and Irish Lions tour squad and the song was pre-added to the playlists on their tour iPods. The song was not released as a single however it was permitted to be broadcast by radio stations and it was made available to download on the Internet. The British and Irish Lions players were shown the words of The Power of Four on the Saturday before their first game and it was expected that they <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> words by the time they had arrived in New Zealand. However it was mentioned by a British and Irish Lions spokesman that the players were under no obligation to sing it.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. The caller had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

25|$|Chief Flying Hawk {{appreciated}} that youth education {{was essential to}} preserve Lakota culture. During his travels, he frequently visited public schools for presentations, and {{wanted to talk about}} making over the white man’s history so that the young people <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth. Flying Hawk wanted school history programs to tell the stories of Native American warriors and statesmen who fought to protect their families, defend the invasion of their lands and preserve their culture. He selected Native American warriors and statesmen from different tribes: Red Jacket, Seneca; Little Turtle, Miami; Logan, Oneida; Cornplanter, Seneca; Osceola, Seminole; Red Bird, Winnebago; Pontiac, Ottawa; Tecumseh, Shawnee; Black Hawk, Sauk; Red Cloud, Lakota; and Sitting Bull, Lakota. Flying Hawk was impressed with the oratory of Red Jacket, Logan, Black Hawk, Tecumseh, Sitting Bull and Red Cloud, and requested that their speeches be included in his commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Riccardo Eugenio Drigo {{was born}} in Padua, Italy on 30 June 1846. His father Silvio Drigo was a {{barrister}} and his mother, a noble Lupati, was active in politics. None of Drigo's family was distinguished in music, but {{at the age of}} five he began taking his first piano lessons from a family friend, the Hungarian Antonio Jorich. Drigo excelled quickly, and by his early teens he attained some local celebrity as a pianist. His father eventually agreed to allow Drigo to attend the prestigious Venice Conservatory, where he studied under Antonio Buzzolla, a student of Gaetano Donizetti. Drigo scored his first compositions in his early teens, which were primarily romances and waltzes. In 1862 he was allowed to perform some of his pieces with the local amateur orchestra in Padua. Through this performance, the young Drigo began to show interest in conducting. Drigo's first major opportunity as a conductor occurred in 1868 when the Garibaldi Theatre's kapellmeister fell ill {{on the eve of the}} first performance of Costantino Dall'Argine's 1867 comic opera I Due Orsi (The Two Bears). When the concertmaster refused to conduct the performance, he recommended Drigo, if only because the rehearsal pianist <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> score intimately. Drigo's conducting was successful, and soon he was named second kapellmeister.|$|E

500|$|Despite its popularity, a few music critics {{including}} Robert Copsey from Digital Spy {{criticized the}} song for being monotonous. Cospey wrote that [...] "you could slap an LMFAO tag {{on the cover}} and few <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference" [...] and Paul Lester of The Guardian similarly labelled it as [...] "generic ravey Euro dance with guitars". Lester described the song as [...] "Pump Up the Jam meets the Macarena {{with a dash of}} Cotton Eye Joe" [...] while Robert Myers of The Village Voice dismissed [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] as an [...] "inspired piece of silliness".|$|E

Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, [...] "I really thought you could basically tell a third grader {{to sit down at}} a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference."

500|$|With {{the film}} languishing in {{development}} hell, producer Bill Gerber from Warner Bros. decided James Dean would work best {{as a television}} movie for Turner Network Television (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by Time Warner. Gerber explained the format choice, [...] "It was just hard to find bankable names that the studio would finance a $20 million movie with. And there were marketing problems. He died in a highway accident in 1955 so almost everyone <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> outcome of the movie. James Dean also isn't that well known by the general movie-going public these days." [...] Actor James Franco was cast into the lead role, and principal photography for James Dean started in June 2000. Filming took place around the Los Angeles area and at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City.|$|E

500|$|The show's animal trainer, Debbie Cove, used {{around three}} hundred {{cockroaches}} for this episode. Cove later noted {{that only one}} of the cockroaches died during the filming, due to old age. Director Kim Manners was very pleased with the way the cockroaches behaved, noting that [...] "every shot I wanted to get, they got." [...] Cast and crew members later recalled that Manners began giving orders to the roaches. Cinematographer John Bartley explained, [...] "when I saw Kim Manners talking to a bucket of cockroaches, that was a highlight for me." [...] Several [...] "incredibly detailed" [...] rubber cockroaches were created for the episode. These props were extremely detailed: prop master Ken Hawryliw explained that, [...] "you could put one next to a real roach and no one <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> difference."

500|$|Michael delegates {{the hiring}} of the {{strippers}} to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim. While Dwight locates a stripper named Elizabeth (Jackie Debatin) for Bob Vance's party, Jim orders an educational Benjamin Franklin impersonator (Andrew Daly) as a joke. Pam and Karen have fun gently heckling the impersonator. Jim tells Dwight that the impersonator is the real Ben Franklin. Dwight says he's [...] "99% sure" [...] {{this is not so}} but asks questions to the impersonator that he believes only the real Ben Franklin <b>would</b> <b>know.</b> <b>The</b> well-practiced impersonator answers each question correctly without hesitation, much to Dwight's anger and disbelief. In the break room, Karen confronts Pam about Jim and Pam's kiss and asks if she is still interested in Jim. Made nervous by the questioning, Pam uses misleading wording, babbles uncontrollably, {{and at the end of}} the conversation blurts out [...] "I'm sorry." [...] Karen finds her behavior baffling but not suspicious.|$|E
500|$|The Klingon Bird of Prey's {{cloaking}} device {{required a}} new effect. The original concept featured {{the layers of}} the ship forming up from the inside out, requiring a series of overlaid elements filmed with an Oxberry animation camera. ILM decided the effect appeared too [...] "animated-looking", and defied common sense: [...] "if there was a fanfare to decloaking, everyone <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Klingons were coming and blow {{them out of the}} sky before they could even finish materializing," [...] Ralston said. The supervisor decided on subtlety, throwing color separations out of sync to create a blurry ripple effect. While simple, the sequence was more effective than the elaborate planned scene. Effects such as the destruction of the merchant ship were created using projected explosions, a technique perfected during the production of Return of the Jedi. Simulated zero-gravity explosions were filmed and reflected onto a card using the same motion control program used for the models. The result was an explosion that moved with the model.|$|E

500|$|A British army invaded Buenos Aires in 1806, {{starting}} the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Although Moreno was not actively {{involved with the}} military counter-offensive which drove them out, he opposed the British presence in Buenos Aires. He wrote a diary that noted all the events, so that, in the future, his countrymen <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> circumstances that allowed such an invasion. The British made a new attack in 1807, this time invading Montevideo. They published a bilingual English–Spanish newspaper known as [...] "The Southern Star" [...] or [...] "La estrella del sur" [...] (the newspaper used both names in conjunction). It advocated free trade, a British goal, and promoted American independence under British protection. The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires banned the newspaper and requested Moreno to write articles refuting those of the British publication. Moreno refused because, {{although he did not}} accept British rule, he agreed with some of their criticisms of the Spanish government. Fearing a new attack to Buenos Aires, Moreno left the city with his whole family and relocated in the countryside. His house in Buenos Aires, left unoccupied, was used to keep prisoner William Carr Beresford, the British commander of the first invasion. Several friends of Moreno helped Beresford to escape and move to Montevideo, but it is unknown if Moreno was aware of the plan.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God told the Israelites that during all the 40 years that they {{spent in the}} wilderness, God {{did not make it}} {{necessary}} for them to escape. Rather, God cast their enemies down before them. As [...] reports, there were numerous snakes, fiery serpents, and scorpions in the wilderness, but God did not allow them to harm the Israelites.

2500|$|Some {{intelligent}} behaviour is inhuman: The Turing test {{does not}} test for highly intelligent behaviours, {{such as the}} ability to solve difficult problems or come up with original insights.

If it were to solve a computational problem that is practically impossible for a human to solve, then the interrogator <b>would</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> program is not human, and the machine would fail the test.|$|E
