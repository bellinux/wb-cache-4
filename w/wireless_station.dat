5|$|After an unopposed landing, a mixed {{force of}} German reservists and half-trained Melanesian police mounted a stout {{resistance}} {{and forced the}} Australians to fight {{their way to the}} objective. After a day of fighting during which both sides suffered casualties, Australian forces captured the <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> at Bita Paka. The battle was Australia's first major military engagement of the war and the only significant action of the campaign; in its aftermath the remaining German forces on New Britain fled inland to Toma. Following a brief siege there the German garrison capitulated, ending resistance to the Australian occupation of the island.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} the British steamer, Emden turned south to Simalur, {{where she met}} the captured collier Buresk. Müller then decided to attack the British coaling station in the Cocos Islands; he intended to destroy the <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> there and draw away British forces searching {{for him in the}} Indian Ocean. While en route to the Cocos, Emden spent two days combing the Sunda Strait for merchant shipping without success. She thereafter proceeded to the Cocos, arriving off Direction Island at 06:00 on the morning of 9 November. Since there were no British vessels in the area, Müller sent ashore a landing party led by Kapitänleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hellmuth von Mücke, Emdens executive officer. The party consisted of another two officers, six non-commissioned officers, and thirty-eight sailors.|$|E
30|$|In the simulations, the <b>wireless</b> <b>stations</b> (denoted as STA_ 1, STA_ 3, etc.) are {{distributed}} in a Basic Service Set. These <b>wireless</b> <b>stations</b> communicate with an access point, AP_ 1. The AP_ 1 {{is connected to}} an Ethernet switch, Switch_ 1. The Switch_ 1 communicates with the wired stations, which are denoted as CN_E_ 2, CN_E_ 4, etc. The wired stations are acting as the correspondent nodes to the <b>wireless</b> <b>stations.</b> For example, CN_E_ 2 is the correspondent node to STA_ 1. For conversational services, such as VoIP and video call, both the <b>wireless</b> and wired <b>stations</b> are acting as packet transmitters and receivers. For streaming services, such as video streaming and audio streaming, only the downlink is simulated and the wired stations act as the packet transmitters and the <b>wireless</b> <b>stations</b> act as the packet receivers.|$|R

5|$|Despite {{concerns}} that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers {{would interfere with}} proceedings, the SEF arrived at the capital of Samoa, Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the town {{as well as the}} <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of Samoa with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of Samoa.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar es Salaam {{and destroyed}} the German <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately the Australian {{operation}} on New Britain achieved its objectives, with the AN destroying the <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> before seizing the colony, reducing a strategic German possession in the Pacific and thereby denying its use {{to support their}} naval forces in the region. Yet although successful, {{it had not been}} well-managed, and the Australians had been effectively delayed by a few reserve officers and a half-trained Melanesian police force. They finally prevailed because of their unexpected ability to fight in close terrain, while their outflanking of the German positions had unnerved their opponents. The Battle of Bita Paka was Australia's first major military engagement of the war, yet it soon became little more than a sideshow in a conflict which grew to assume much greater proportions. Later, many men of the AN volunteered for the AIF and served in Egypt, Gallipoli, Sinai and Palestine and on the Western Front. A large number became casualties, including Holmes, who was killed in action in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Australian ships {{first saw}} action Asian and Pacific theatre; {{assisting}} {{in the attack}} on German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN). Germany had colonised the northeastern part of New Guinea and several nearby island groups in 1884, and the colony was currently used as a wireless radio base, Britain required the wireless installations to be destroyed because they were used by the German East Asia Squadron which threatened merchant shipping in the region. The objectives of the force were the German stations at Yap in the Caroline Islands, Nauru, and Rabaul in New Britain. On 30 August 1914, the AN left Sydney {{under the protection of}} Australia and Melbourne for Port Moresby, where the force met the Queensland contingent, aboard the transport HMAHS Kanowna. The force then sailed for German New Guinea on 7 September, leaving Kanowna behind when her stokers refused to work. Sydney and her escorting destroyers met the AN off the eastern tip of New Guinea. Melbourne was detached to destroy the <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> on Nauru, while on 14 September, Encounter bombarded a ridge near Rabaul, while half a battalion advanced towards the town. The only major loss of the campaign was the disappearance of the submarine AE1 during a patrol off Rabaul on 14 September 1914.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new <b>wireless</b> <b>station</b> was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
