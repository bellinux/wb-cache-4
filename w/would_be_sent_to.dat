5|$|As a final {{attempt to}} stop the Allied advances, the Japanese Imperial High Command planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū codenamed Operation Ketsugō. This {{was to be a}} radical {{departure}} from the defense in depth plans used in the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. Instead, everything was staked on the beachhead; more than 3,000 kamikazes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> attack the amphibious transports before troops and cargo were disembarked on the beach.|$|E

The Social Welfare Ministry estimated that $1.5million would be needed for civilian relief.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of air}} {{transport}} meant that the division's two available brigades had to be transported by sea. They would cross the Mediterranean in four Royal Navy cruisers with their escorts. If the landing was successful, the British 78th Infantry Division in Sicily and the 8th Indian Infantry Division in the Middle East, {{under the command of}} British V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Walter Allfrey, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the landings.|$|E

Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.|$|E
5|$|In 1609, the Spanish Manila galleon San Francisco {{encountered}} {{bad weather}} {{on its way}} from Manila to Acapulco, and was wrecked on the Japanese coast in Chiba, near Tokyo. The sailors were rescued and welcomed, and the ship's captain, Rodrigo de Vivero, former interim governor of the Philippines, met with the retired shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Rodrigo de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships {{would be allowed to}} visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Spanish court.|$|E
5|$|Initially it {{had been}} planned that the Australians <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom, where they would {{undertake}} further training prior to {{being sent to the}} Western Front in France and Belgium. However, the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war on Germany's side on 29 October meant that the strategically vital Suez Canal was threatened, {{and as a result of}} this and overcrowding in training grounds in the United Kingdom, upon the convoy reaching the Suez at the end of November, plans for the use of the Australian force were changed and they were disembarked in Egypt instead.|$|E

5|$|Sea {{trials for}} Petropavlovsk were {{scheduled}} to begin sometime in late 1941, {{and according to the}} training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and technical manuals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Soviet Navy, albeit in German only.|$|E

Dave Thomas recalled that every game they produced was met with little interference from Ultimate; once a game was complete, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> quality assessment and subsequently published for release.|$|E
5|$|When Charles II {{returned}} to the throne in 1660, he demobilised most of the existing army and the following year the garrison at Yarmouth was given four days notice to leave the castle. The King announced that the castle's artillery <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Cowes, unless the town of Yarmouth agreed {{to take over the}} financial responsibility of running the site themselves. The town declined to do so, but Charles repeated the offer in 1666; this time Yarmouth seems to have taken action, appointing four soldiers for a garrison, although the town did not assign an officer to command them, or apparently make any repairs to the now dilapidated castle.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the bullpen for good.|$|E
5|$|During this time, rumors swirled {{that the}} Regiment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> live combat, while {{officers}} {{had already been}} moved to act as observers. On 22 September 1944, the 65th Infantry landed in France. The Regiment was then moved to Peira Cava in the Maritime Alps, where it entered in action on December 13, 1944, {{the first time a}} Puerto Rican unit saw action in Europe. The first offensive attack came the following day in response to enemy fire, with Col. Cordero allowing Capt. Efraín Sánchez and Company L to return fire. The first casualty lost by the Regiment were Sgt. Ángel Martínez and Sergio Sánchez. In total, in the border between France and Italy, the battalion lost 47 men, including its commander, Col. George Ford.|$|E
5|$|Following Japan's {{entry into}} the war in December 1941 the {{decision}} was made to bring the 6th Division back to bolster the Allied defences in the Pacific, and the 2/3rd Battalion left the Middle East on 10 March 1942, aboard the steamer Orontes. The original intention was that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> reinforce Java; however, while they were at sea concerns about a Japanese attack on Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) prompted the diversion of the 16th and 17th Brigades to Colombo, and they arrived there on 21 March. The freighter Ben Rennies, carrying the battalion's vehicles, arrived shortly afterwards and the 2/3rd took up defensive positions in the southeast part of the island, which was considered to be the most likely location for a Japanese invasion force to land.|$|E

5|$|The 2/10th Battalion ("The Adelaide Rifles") was an {{infantry}} {{battalion of}} the Australian Army that was raised for overseas service {{as part of}} the all volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) during World War II. Formed in October 1939, it was the first 2nd AIF unit raised from the state of South Australia during the war; after completing a period of training in Australia, the battalion embarked for overseas. Initially, it had been intended that the 2/10th and its parent brigade– the 18th Brigade– <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the Middle East to join the other brigades of the 6th Division, but instead the 18th Brigade was sent to the United Kingdom, to help strengthen the garrison there after France capitulated in mid-1940. Reassigned to the 9th Division, the 2/10th remained in the United Kingdom undertaking defensive duties until late 1940 when it finally arrived in the Middle East, where the 18th Brigade became part of the 7th Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{currencies}} of Puerto Rico closely {{follow the}} historic development of Puerto Rico. As {{a colony of}} Spain and the United States, Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies. Following the Spanish colonization in 1502, Puerto Rico became an important port, with its own supply of gold. However, as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century, the archipelago's economy suffered. The Spanish Crown issued the Situado Mexicano, which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> the island, {{as a way to}} provide economic support. Between 1636 and 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a revenue stamp. Inspired by this, Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766, becoming the first colony to print 8-real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government's approval of subsequent issues.|$|E

A stone staircase leads up from the main entrance hall and a cloister encloses a courtyard. A design of five windows is repeated throughout the house, in tribute to Chanel's perfume, Chanel No. 5. Chanel ordered more than 20,000 curved handmade tiles to be handmade for the roof, and furnished the house sparsely in shades of white and beige. Each bathroom has a servants entrance. Chanel would take Le Train Bleu from Paris every month to inspect the progress of the building. If Chanel was unable to make the trip, local craftsmen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>sent</b> <b>to</b> Paris to meet her.|$|E
