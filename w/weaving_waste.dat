40|$|The {{activated}} carbon production from waste cotton fibers from weaving plants {{was investigated in}} this paper. They are waste airborne fibers that arise as a by-product {{in the process of}} <b>weaving.</b> <b>Waste</b> cotton material is used for the production of {{activated carbon}}, which is then can used for the reduction of textile dyes coloration in the solution, for example. The activated carbon used is relatively fine bulk material with heterogeneous porous particles of diverse shapes and forms. Qualitative and quantitative characterization of activated carbon shows that carbon is predominant in its chemical composition with the presence of several other elements. Textural properties of activated carbon show different parameters, which by their numeric values characterize the specific surface area, pore volume, pore diameter, etc. Pore volume according to Gurvich for p/p 0 of 0. 98 was 0. 0051 cm 3 /g. By the BET method, we are calculated volume of gas adsorbed in the monolayer (Vm, 0. 49 cm 3 g- 1) and the constant (CBET, 5. 22). Specific surface area of the sample, SBET, was calculated and amounted to 2. 14 m 2 /g. Dubinin and Radushkevich method with its equation was used to calculate the micropore volume based on adsorption isotherms. Based on the results, {{it can be said that}} the activated carbon produced from waste cotton fibers has potential as an adsorbent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Mechanically ground {{recycled}} {{carbon fibers}} (rCFs) reinforced polymer composites were investigated in this paper. The rCFs {{were collected from}} the <b>woven</b> prepreg <b>waste.</b> The as-received (rCFs-AR) and cyclic cryogenic treated (rCFs-T) carbon fibers were incorporated separately in the epoxy matrix composite. The objective {{of this study is}} to study the wear behaviour of the epoxy composites with respect to the as-received and treated rCFs. Prior to the composite fabrication, the surface morphologies of rCFs-AR and rCFs-T were examined with the scanning electron microscope (SEM). It is found that the cryogenic treatment is effective in removing the epoxy resin from the carbon fiber due to the mismatches in the thermal expansion at the interface of rCFs and epoxy. The rCFs-AR and rCFs-T were homogeneously distributed in epoxy resin through ultrasonication. The void-free samples were then fabricated using vacuum casting technique. Micro Pin-on-disc Tribotester (CM- 9109) was used to test the tribological behaviour of the polymer composites. The coefficient of friction (CoF) and wear rate of epoxy composites revealed that the reinforcement effect of rCFs-T is better than that of the rCFs-AR as the incorporation of rCFs-T decreases the CoF and improves the wear resistance of epoxy composites in comparison with rCFs-AR. The tribological results clearly showed that the rCFs was a valuable product worth to be reused as reinforcement in the new composite, as the incorporation of treated rCFs was effective in improving the tribological properties of the epoxy composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of more sustainable behaviors, particularly in what concerns to {{the reduction of}} energy consumption and the emissions of greenhouse gases, is nowadays a priority. The construction sector {{is one of the}} key areas of intervention, which carries a high consumption of resources such as materials, energy, and water. Thus, it is essential to adopt more efficient actions during all stages of the construction process, including the use of more sustainable materials. The reuse of different types of waste in the construction or rehabilitation of buildings can contribute significantly to sustainability. In this research work, the potential applicability of <b>woven</b> fabric <b>waste</b> (WFW) and a waste of this residue, named woven fabric subwaste (WFS), as thermal insulation building material was studied. Experimental work was conducted using an external double wall, with the air-box filled with these two types of waste, to determine their thermal characteristics. Two heat flowmeters and four surface temperatures sensors were placed on the wall surface to determine the thermal conductivity of the wastes. The obtained results show that the application of the WFW and WFS in the external double wall increases its thermal behavior in 56 % and 30 %, respectively. The thermal conductivity value of the WFW is similar to the values obtain for expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) and mineral wool (MW). The value of this parameter for the WFS is approximately equal to the values for granules of clay, vermiculite or expanded perlite. Therefore, applying these wastes as a possible thermal insulation material seems to be an adequate solution. Environmental, sustainable and economical advantages may result from this practice...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} provides compositions {{and processes}} wherein recycling of waste carpets and textiles {{is achieved by}} coating the individual yarn fibers with a low viscosity adhesive that is dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent to affect coverage of the fine fibers, and arranging the coated fibers in layers to affect the most desirable physical properties and then cured to provide a high modulus matrix for the coated fibers in the laminate structure. The fibers may be from unshredded or shredded waste carpets, shredded <b>waste</b> <b>woven</b> or non woven fabrics, fabric bits, and knitted fabrics. When the carpet is used in an as received condition, the face yarns, which may contain one or more components yarns, are coated and the carpets are arranged in a sandwich construction wherein the backings of the two carpets are placed back-to-back, e. g., (F-B-(B-F) n -B-F, (n= 0 or an integer value, F=face yarn and B=backing) and then heated under applied pressure to affect a cure of the resin coating and the adhesion between carpet backing layers. The resulting laminate consists of two outer fibrous layers that contains the unmelted yarns bundles from the carpet in a high modulus matrix. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Journal of Textile Design Research and Practice on 2016 - 05 - 31, available online: [URL] research/industry partnerships have recently gained momentum in New Zealand. This paper makes a preliminary account {{by focusing on the}} benefits of the collaboration to Massey University Master of Design postgraduates, companies, and the academics. The students work on a significant problem faced by a company to rejuvenate business or to produce solutions for a particular or a set of problems. The company gains access to new university research and discoveries and faculty members complement their own academic research by securing funds for graduate students. During a one-year period, the students receive a government-funded scholarship and industry mentoring. The aim is to steer success across the textile value chain from economic and environmental perspectives while balancing academic requirements. Typically, the industry-centered design is developed using iterative processes with a strong emphasis on the role of technology, often requiring the acquirement of new software skills to design with industry equipment. The model establishes best practice to share resources and experiences within the thrust of daily industrial life and the demands of a Master of Design degree. This paper aims to gage the benefits of, and challenges in a range of wool-centered collaborative projects from yarn development to sustainable dye to bedding product development to the revitalization of a <b>weaving</b> mill innovative <b>waste</b> to blue sky solutions for a tannery. The research of novel ideas and process innovation leads to enhanced job placement opportunity and new exports. fals...|$|R
