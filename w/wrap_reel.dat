50|$|The Science Museum in London has an 18th-century <b>wrap</b> <b>reel</b> in its {{collection}} {{which was made}} for Richard Arkwright's first cotton mill in Derbyshire. It is kept in their storage archive at Blythe House.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wrap</b> <b>reel</b> or skein winder is {{a device}} for {{measuring}} yarn {{and making it}} into hanks of a standard size.. The reel is of a standard size and its revolutions are counted as the yarn is wrapped around it. Typically, a set number of revolutions will be used so that the hank is of a standard size — a skein or lea. For example, a skein of cotton would be 80 turns on a reel of 54 inches circumference, making 120 yards, while the standard length for wool worsted would be 80 yards.|$|E
50|$|This thread {{can also}} be twisted with gold threads {{in order to make}} zari. The zari fibre is doubled with the yarn to prepare it. The zari fibre is <b>wrapped</b> on <b>reels</b> and is doubled with the yarn {{with the help of a}} machine, on cones. These fibres are then <b>wrapped</b> on <b>reels</b> with the help of a {{doubling}} machine. The threads are then steamed and wrapped on the final spools. The required threads (silk, zari, etc.) are then taken to the charkha, which is a machine used to make the warp for the weaving process.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{article is}} based on the {{analysis}} of locomotive springs packaging existing situation, combining with spring packaging requirements, giving a spring packaging technology program. The program is by using 0. 6 mm PE shrink film on the new U type coating machine to achieve <b>reel</b> <b>wrapping</b> package for locomotives inner and outer springs respectively, and then passing the BM- 500 thermostatic shrink packaging machine to complete coating process technical solutions. In addition this paper gives a detailed description for the new U type coating machine structure design and working principle to make early program planning for the locomotive springs packaging production line...|$|R
40|$|Two Brisco Scour Monitors were {{installed}} on pier MS 1 of the Mississippi River at Burlington in August 1991. No problems were encountered during the installation. The monitors {{consist of a}} probe resting on the river bottom fastened to a cable that <b>wraps</b> around a <b>reel.</b> An electrical system monitors {{the movement of the}} reel which transmits to a digital readout which shows whether scour has occurred. The intent was to monitor the digital readout twice a year during a four-year evaluation period. The scour monitor digital readouts malfunctioned frequently due to electrical storms. The scour monitor performance was completely unacceptable...|$|R
30|$|To measure linear density, 100  m {{length of}} yarns have been wound on a <b>wrap</b> <b>reel</b> with a 1  m {{circumference}} and were weighed on an electronic analytical balance, {{which had a}} sensitivity of 0.1  mg. Linear density in tex was calculated. Average linear density was taken from five samples.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, the site where the textile mill will be built was a {{countryside}} meadow owned by Count Giovanni Battista Durini, who held large estates in Cassina Baraggia. Less than a century later, during the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, in that place there was a rectangular court, which planimetry corresponds to the one has come down to present day: almost completely closed, with a single entrance from Municipal Road that from Cassina Baraggia goes to Carugate. The spinning mill was built in the second half of the nineteenth century and it was used for the first phase of silk processing, the reeling, in which the filament was extracted from the cocoon to <b>wrap</b> on <b>reels.</b> Between 1873 and 1894, the court was completely closed: the portion facing the street was elevated and, to the east of the building, it was built a group of houses intended for laborers employed in the factory. In the second half of the twentieth century, Baraggia underwent a slow decline. The Marquis Brivio, owners of most of the assets and land located in the hamlet, paid scant and manufacturing, with the textile industry crisis, were gradually abandoned. Remained empty, some houses and cottages in the courtyard collapsed from neglect. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the municipality made a recovery plan of the entire historical center of the neighborhood. In this context, even the old textile mill has been restructured: at present it is a building that has partially retained the original architecture, adapted to new functions, even housing.|$|R
5000|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, Kim Newman {{wrote in}} the Monthly Film Bulletin that Deep Red was a transitional work for Argento between his earlier whodunit plots and the more supernatural themed films. Newman concluded that Deep Red is [...] "nothing if not an elaborate mechanism, with the camera crawling among objets trouvés" [...] and [...] "what sets Argento apart from imitators like Lucio Fulci is his combination of genuine pain (the murders are as nasty as one could wish, but the camera flinches where Fulci's would linger) and self-mocking humour" [...] Total Film gave the film four stars out of five, noting that Argento's films [...] "can be an acquired taste; it’s necessary to attune yourself with the horror director’s style {{in order to get}} the most from his movies." [...] The review stated that the film [...] "presents some striking visual compositions that raise it above the level of the usual subgenre offerings." [...] and that the film was [...] "A great introduction to Dario Argento’s evolving style of horror". The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Operating under the principle that a moving camera is always better than a static one - and not above throwing in a terrifying evil doll - Deep Red showcases the technical bravado and loopy shock tactics that made Argento famous." [...] AllMovie compared the film to other in Argento's work, noting that the film script was [...] "significantly stronger and the actors much better" [...] AllMovie noted that [...] "Each of the murders is perfectly choreographed with particular praise going to Glauco Mauri's killing" [...] and that [...] "The final <b>reel</b> <b>wraps</b> the film up in a thrilling manner and features two extremely graphic deaths that leave the viewer stunned as the credits roll" ...|$|R
