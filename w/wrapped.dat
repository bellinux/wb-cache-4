5000|$|Vehicle vinyl <b>wrap</b> {{and color}} change <b>wraps</b> grew in {{popularity}} {{out of the}} <b>wrap</b> advertisingbusiness. <b>Wrap</b> installers that performed advertising vinyls, began to offer accent and full vinyl <b>wraps</b> as a cosmetic enhancement. Vehicle owners, correspondingly drove demand and requested vinyl <b>wraps</b> that suited their desires. Rather than advertise a company or brand, vehicle owners wanted to change the color and finish of their vehicle for cosmetic or protective purposes. Manufacturers of vinyl <b>wrap</b> followed this trend by producing more colors and easier to install, durable materials.|$|R

5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry, either in the sun or through smoking. Finally, the deceased was <b>wrapped</b> in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being <b>wrapped</b> with up to 15 skins.|$|E

5|$|The second-ever Barbed Wire Massacre was {{the sixth}} match {{on the card}} between Abyss and Judas Mesias, who was {{accompanied}} by Father James Mitchell. Its duration was fourteen minutes and fifty-one seconds. It was featured from the TNA Impact! Zone in Orlando, Florida, because the city of Greenville, SC refused to allow a match that violent to take place live. In Barbed Wire Massacre, the ring ropes are switched with strands of barbed-wire and several weapons are featured <b>wrapped</b> in barbed-wire. The match falls under no disqualifications rules and is won by either a pinfall or submission. Mesias bashed Abyss {{over the head with}} a barbed-wire <b>wrapped</b> chair, which caused Abyss to bleed from the forehead. Abyss performed his signature Black Hole Slam maneuver on Mitchell after he interfered in the bout. Abyss won the contest after using the Black Hole Slam to drop Mesias onto a barbed-wire <b>wrapped</b> board.|$|E

[...] This draws {{on the theory that}} popping the bubbles on standard Bubble <b>Wrap</b> will relieve stress.

50|$|A <b>wrap</b> {{dress is}} a {{dress with a}} front closure formed by <b>wrapping</b> one side across the other, and {{knotting}} the attached ties that <b>wrap</b> around the back at the waist or fastening buttons. This forms a V-shaped neckline and hugs the wearer's curves. A faux <b>wrap</b> dress resembles this design, except that it comes already fastened together with no opening in front, but instead is slipped on over the head. A <b>wrap</b> top is a top cut and constructed {{in the same way}} as a <b>wrap</b> dress, but without a skirt.|$|R
40|$|Esophageal {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive cancer whose underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. The natural antisense transcript (NAT) <b>WRAP</b> 53 regulates p 53 expression and <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein is a component of telomerase. NATs play key roles in carcinogenesis, and although <b>WRAP</b> 53 is known to increase cancer cell survival, its role in ESCC clinicopathology is unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate <b>WRAP</b> 53 expression in ESCC and to correlate it with clinicopathological characteristics. <b>WRAP</b> 53 mRNA and protein expression was measured by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, respectively, in 4 ESSC cells lines and in 45 paired ESCC and non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. To correlate <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein expression with clinicopathological characteristics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 134 ESCC and 85 non-neoplastic esophageal mucosa tissues. Expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was detected in all ESCC cell lines and was upregulated in the ESCC tissues compared with the corresponding non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). More cells expressed <b>WRAP</b> 53 protein in the ESCC tissues than in the non-neoplastic tissues (P< 0. 01). Overexpression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 was significantly correlated with tumor infiltration depth (P =  0. 000), clinical stage (P =  0. 001), and lymph node metastasis (P =  0. 025). <b>Wrap</b> 53 expression was not correlated with age, gender, or tumor differentiation. This report indicates increased expression of <b>WRAP</b> 53 in ESCC and that <b>WRAP</b> 53 overexpression is correlated with tumor progression. <b>WRAP</b> 53 may play a significant role in ESCC; accordingly, <b>WRAP</b> 53 could be a useful biomarker for ESCC...|$|R

5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and <b>wrapped</b> the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, <b>wrapped</b> in the flag, everyone gazed in wonder at the child and the garb <b>wrapped</b> around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E
