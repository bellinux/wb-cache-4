40|$|The Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF), {{located in}} the Z-Area of the Savannah River Site (SRS), {{is used for the}} {{disposal}} of low-level radioactive salt solution. The SDF currently contains two vaults: Vault 1 (6 cells) and Vault 4 (12 cells). Additional disposal cells are currently in the design phase. The individual cells of the saltstone facility are filled with saltstone. Saltstone is produced by mixing the low-level radioactive salt solution, with blast furnace slag, fly ash, and cement (dry premix) to form a dense, micro-porous, monolithic, low-level radioactive waste form. The saltstone is pumped into the disposal cells where it subsequently solidifies. Significant effort has been undertaken to accurately model the movement of water and contaminants through the facility. Key to this effort is an accurate understanding of the hydraulic and physical properties of the solidified saltstone. To date, limited testing has been conducted to characterize the saltstone. The primary focus of this task was to estimate the hydraulic and physical properties of three types of saltstone and two vault concretes. The saltstone formulations included saltstone premix batched with (1) Deliquification, Dissolution, and Adjustment (DDA) salt simulant (w/pm 0. 60), (2) Actinide Removal Process (ARP) /Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) salt simulant (w/pm 0. 60), and (3) Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF) salt simulant (w/pm 0. 60). The vault concrete formulations tested included the Vault 1 / 4 concrete and two variations of the Vault 2 concrete (Mix 1 and Mix 2). Wet properties measured for the saltstone formulations included yield stress, plastic viscosity, <b>wet</b> <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> bleed water volume, gel time, set time, and heat of hydration. Hydraulic and physical properties measured on the cured saltstone and concrete samples included saturated hydraulic conductivity, moisture retention, compressive strength, porosity, particle density, and dry bulk density. These properties were determined following a minimum 28 day curing period. Additional testing of the three saltstone formulations was conducted following a minimum 90 day curing period. The compressive strength of each saltstone and concrete material was measured at approximately 14, 28, 56, and 90 days. Recommended hydraulic property values for each saltstone grout and the vault concretes are provided. The hydraulic properties provided for each material include the saturated hydraulic conductivity, dry bulk density, particle density, and porosity.

Both procedures resulted in similar localization patterns of final reaction product in a granular form in epithelial cells of proximal tubules in rat kidney. The granules were peroxisomes.

A new tool for understanding the catabolic fates of lipoproteins in vivo {{is the use of}} noncatabolizable ligands for labeling proteins. These ligands are incorporated into cells with the labeled protein. The protein is catabolized but the ligand remains intact and trapped at the sites of hydrolysis as a cumulative marker of the extent of protein uptake. This tool was first applied to LDL in pigs, rats, and rabbits. In all three, hepatic catabolism predominated. Adrenal gland was the most active per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight.</b> The trapped label methodology was also applied to the apoA-I component of HDL in rats. [SH]Cholesteryl ethcrs were also incorporated as noncatabolized, intracellularly trapped tracers of cholesteryl esters. Liver was the predominant site of HDL cholesteryl ether uptake, consistent with a role for HDL in reverse cholesterol transport; adrenal was the most active per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight.</b> In adrenal, ovary, and liver, the cholesteryl ether tracer was taken up at a much greater rate than apoA-I, suggesting a mechanism for cholesteryl ester uptake independent of holo-particle uptake.

After 7 days, the cross-sectional {{area of the}} vessel wall and the maximal active force of the longitudinal muscle layer had increased twofold. Electron microscopy showed that the cell cross-sectional area was increased, suggesting cellular hypertrophy. Increased amounts of intermediate (10 nm) filaments were observed in the hypertrophied cells. The hypertrophied vessels had decreased DNA content per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> compared with the control vessels (hypertrophied, 1. 5 +/- 0. 1; control, 1. 9 +/- 0. 1 micrograms/mg; p less than 0. 01). Protein composition was studied with electrophoretic methods. Compared with control preparations the hypertrophied veins had similar myosin and actin contents per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight</b> (myosin: hypertrophied, 4. 4 +/- 0. 8; control, 5. 9 +/- 0. 9; actin: hypertrophied 12. 2 +/- 0. 6; control, 11. 8 +/- 1. 0 mg/g). Two different forms of the myosin heavy chain were detected with 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The proportion of the lower molecular weight heavy chain relative to total heavy chain content was about 30 % and similar in both preparations. The relation filamin/myosin was increased in the hypertrophied vessels. Pyrophosphate gel electrophoresis revealed two protein bands, {{with an increase in}} the slower migrating band in the hypertrophied vessels possibly reflecting an increase in filamin content in the extracts. In the control portal vein alpha-actin is the dominating isoform constituting about 55 % of total actin. In hypertrophied vessels, alpha-actin decreased (by 15 %) and gamma-actin increased (by 20 %). The portal vein contained desmin and vimentin in a ratio of about 6 : 1. The hypertrophied vessels showed a marked increase in the amount of these proteins (desmin/actin: hypertrophied, 0. 32; control, 0. 14). In conclusion, during pressure-induced growth of the portal vein, contractile protein contents increase in proportion to the increase in weight. A change in isoforms of actin occurs but no evidence for a change in myosin isoforms was found.

40|$|The {{growth of}} one smooth and three {{individual}} striated muscles was studied {{from birth to}} old age (105 weeks), and where possible during the later stages of foetal life also. Developmental changes in protein turnover (measured in vivo) {{were related to the}} changing patterns of growth within each muscle, and the body as a whole. Developmental growth (i. e. protein accumulation) in all muscles involved an increasing proportion of protein per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight,</b> as well as cellular hypertrophy. The contribution of the heart towards whole-body protein and nucleic acid contents progressively decreased from 18 days of gestation to senility. In contrast, post-natal changes in both slow-twitch (soleus) and fast-twitch (tibialis anterior) skeletal muscles remained reasonably constant with respect to whole-body values. Such age-related growth in all four muscle types was accompanied by a progressive decline in both the fractional rates of protein synthesis and breakdown, the changes in synthesis being more pronounced. Age for age, the fractional rates of synthesis were highest in the oesophageal smooth muscle, similar in both cardiac and the slow-twitch muscles, and lowest in the fast-twitch tibialis muscle. Despite these differences, the developmental fall in synthetic rates was remarkably similar in all four muscles, e. g. the rates at 105 weeks were 30 - 35 % of their values at weaning. Such developmental changes in synthesis were largely related to diminishing ribosomal capacities within each muscle. When measured under near-steady-state conditions (i. e. 105 weeks of age), the half-lives of mixed muscle proteins were 5. 1, 10. 4, 12. 1 and 18. 3 days for the smooth, cardiac, soleus and tibialis muscles respectively. Old-age atrophy was evident in the senile animals, this being more marked {{in each of the four}} muscle types than in the animal as a whole. In each muscle of the senile rats the protein content and composition per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight,</b> and both the fractional and total rates of synthesis, were significantly lower than in the muscles of younger, mature, animals (i. e. 44 weeks). In the soleus the decreased synthesis rate appeared to be related to a further fall in the ribosomal capacity. In contrast, the changes in synthesis in the three remaining muscles correlated with significant decreases in the synthetic rate per ribosome. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

When expressed per <b>unit</b> <b>wet</b> <b>weight,</b> the rate of metabolism ofethanol by these cells is comparable to that by hepatocytes (2). Studies of human and murine macrophages derived from various tissues have revealed that ethanol oxidation by these cells differs markedly from that by hepatocytes in being only slightly inhibited by pyrazole, and therefore, in being largely independent of alcohol dehydrogenase (2 - 4). Ethanol oxidation by macrophages was also only slightly impaired by 4 -iodopyrazole and 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4,-triazole, indicating that it was independent of 7 r-ADH and catalase. On the other hand, several inhibitors of cytochrome P 450 (carbon monoxide, (3 -diethylaminoethyl diphenylpropyl acetate, metyrapone, and tetrahydrofurane) markedly suppressed ethanol oxidation, suggesting that macrophages metabolize this alcohol via a cytochrome P 450 -dependent pathway (2 - 4).

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} (MSW) {{landfills}} are permanent repositories of society’s non-hazardous wastes. Landfill facilities are becoming harder to site, resulting in increasing pressure {{to maximize the}} use of available airspace. Increasingly, this results in developing additional airspace by way of vertical expansion. This expansion imparts greater stress on the landfill mass and the containment infrastructure. ^ The engineer’s understanding of the geotechnical properties of MSW has been limited to sampling of relatively shallow test pits and reconstitution of disturbed MSW samples in the laboratory. Deeper assessment using small diameter borings is difficult and produces poor low volume samples for ex-situ testing. Some researchers have synthesized MSW with obvious limitations. Landfill failures have provided opportunities for back calculation of MSW properties including shear strength, but these estimates are based on limited understanding of <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and moisture content with depth. ^ The recent trend for the harvesting of methane produced by the anaerobic degradation of MSW {{has resulted in the}} need for nearly full-depth, large-diameter, landfill gas collection wells. Prior to completion, these boreholes provide excellent opportunities for directly observing and measuring the condition of MSW in its buried, variably degraded state at depths that are far greater than previously accessible. ^ The large diameter MSW gas well borehole assessment methodology presented in this paper is shown to be an efficient and valuable means for characterizing MSW. This means that the cost of the assessment is relatively low as the drilling costs are negligible and therefore limited to the cost of labor to sample and perform field observation and laboratory testing. The assessment methodology, which includes scaled full coverage photography and videography, allows precise analysis of a number of geotechnical properties such as <b>wet</b> and dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> moisture content, specific gravity, void ratio, % saturation of MSW and buried soil layers throughout the depth of the borehole.

The CBR value of a specific soil {{is directly related to}} the relative dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (the ratio of dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> to maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight,</b> γd/γd,max). The field compaction result of a fine-grained soil at the optimum water content, OWC, shows that initially the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> increases rapidly with the number of roller passes and the relationship between dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> and number of roller passes is represented by the logarithm function. Finally, the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> reaches a constant value, which is close to the laboratory maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> Even with a large number of roller passes (compaction energy), the dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> cannot be enhanced further because the soil state approaches the zero air void state. In practice, the excess roller pass is thus not economic. Based on the analysis of the test data, the field compaction procedure for road embankment and pavement constructions, which includes the material selection and the construction control, is suggested. It is useful in terms of both engineering and economic viewpoints...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between pore characteristics and <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of clayey soils. This relationship was particularly important in case of expansive soils, as the pore characteristics determine moisture flux boundaries, which in turn represent volume change behavior. Current research tried to evaluate the effect of compaction <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> on the pore size and pore volume along with consolidation and swell characteristics on two expansive clays from semi-arid environment. The two selected clays represent soils with different degrees of expansion, particle size and mineralogy. Pore size characterization for these two soils was performed using Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry, while swell and consolidation characteristics were determined using a conventional oedometer test. Samples for both tests were compacted at different <b>unit</b> <b>weights</b> including, 100, 95, 90, 80, 75, and 70 % of maximum dry <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> (MDUW) obtained from standard proctor. The compaction water content was kept constant for all <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> levels. Both pore volume and pore size distribution was analyzed with varying <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> characteristics and particle sizes. In addition, swell strains and compression indices were studied with varying <b>unit</b> <b>weight</b> of compacted specimens. It was observed that, {{in the case of}} samples compacted at 100 % MDUW, about 50 % of the pores were larger than 0. 1 µm, and this value increased with reduction in <b>unit</b> <b>weight.</b> Current research is of practical importance, especially in the wake of microbial treatments for clayey soils where the passage of microbes depends on the pore size and more specifically pore throat size...|$|R
