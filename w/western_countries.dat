5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} {{ideas in the}} Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's Transcendental idealism, {{as well as his}} celebration of the romantic, exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in <b>Western</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Indonesia used fear of {{communism}} to garner {{varying degrees of}} support among <b>western</b> <b>countries,</b> including the United States and Australia, for its East Timor invasion and occupation. The invasion and suppression of East Timor's independence movement caused great harm to Indonesia's reputation and international credibility. Criticism from the developing world undermined efforts in the 1980s to secure the Non-Aligned Movement chair which Suharto strongly desired for Indonesia and condemnation of Indonesia continued through the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's {{appeal for}} Soviet support split the {{government}} and led to mounting pressure from <b>Western</b> <b>countries</b> to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.|$|E

40|$|The European Union (EU) {{trade policy}} towards <b>Western</b> Balkan's <b>countries</b> (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia) {{is one of}} the {{important}} tools of EU's integration strategy. The exports from the <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> to the European Union(15) are preferred within special autonomous trade measures for the <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> which were introduced by the EU in September 2000 (the 2000 TM). The 2000 TM are a far-ranging set of preferences which provide the <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> with unparalleled market access to the EU, and hence with the potential both to develop the existing exports and to generate new exports. However, the <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> exports to the EU are far below the level which could reasonably be expected. In all <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> a number of supply-side and domestic policy reasons are identified for this under-performance, which suggests that the 2000 TM are likely in part to rectify the situation. The economic regeneration of the <b>Western</b> Balkan’s <b>countries</b> will depend on the success of internal economic reform and on the adoption of economic and trade policies which specifically identify and address some serious supply-side constraints...|$|R

5|$|As {{with other}} <b>Western</b> <b>countries,</b> the U.S. is {{becoming}} less religious. Irreligion is growing rapidly among Americans under 30. Polls show that overall American confidence in organized religion {{has been declining}} since {{the mid to late}} 1980s, and that younger Americans in particular are becoming increasingly irreligious. According to a 2012 study, the Protestant share of the U.S. population had dropped to 48%, thus ending its status as religious category of the majority for the first time. Americans with no religion have 1.7 children compared to 2.2 among Christians. The unaffiliated are less likely to get married with 37% marrying compared to 52% of Christians.|$|E

5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in <b>Western</b> <b>countries,</b> {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest was commercially {{successful}} in Japan, {{with more than}} 2 million copies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other <b>Western</b> <b>countries,</b> was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its original pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised {{in many of these}} reviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game. The game's sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited with establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that followed.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, silk {{supplies}} from Japan were cut off, so <b>western</b> <b>countries</b> {{were forced to}} find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk {{was not able to}} regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{also found}} {{evidence}} that Mandela had been {{an active member of}} the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee. His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from <b>Western</b> <b>countries.</b> Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.|$|E
