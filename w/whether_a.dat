5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|File {{artifacts}} and meta-data {{can be used}} to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of Microsoft Word embedded a Global Unique Identifer into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet) can be very important.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, we do attempt {{to examine whether}} the degree of {{discrimination}} against ex-offenders varies with type of occupation. Specifically, we evaluate if the degree of discrimination against applicants with a criminal background depends on <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> occupation requires low-skilled or high-skilled labor, <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> occupation is typically female-dominated or male-dominated, and <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> occupation {{is located in a}} big city or a small city.|$|R
50|$|In the Newtonian {{description}} {{these changes}} are such that time is absolute: {{the movements of the}} observer do not influence <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> event occurs in the 'now' (i.e., <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> event passes the horizontal line through the observer).|$|R
5|$|In {{directed}} graphs, {{the maximum}} spanning tree solution cannot be used. Instead, several different algorithms are known; {{the choice of}} which algorithm to use depends on <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> start or destination vertex for the path is fixed, or whether paths for many start or destination vertices must be found simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to check <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> given directed graph is a DAG in linear time, either by attempting to find a topological ordering and then testing for each edge whether the resulting ordering is valid or alternatively, for some topological sorting algorithms, by verifying that the algorithm successfully orders all the vertices without meeting an error condition.|$|E

5|$|Species {{identification}} using scales {{requires a}} fair {{degree of knowledge}} about snakes, their taxonomy, snake-scale nomenclature as well as familiarity with and access to scientific literature. Distinguishing by using scale diagrams <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> snake is venomous or not in the field cannot {{be done in the}} case of uncaught specimens. It is not advisable to catch a snake to check whether it is venomous or not using scale diagrams.

50|$|In Wolof, tenses like present tense, past tense, {{and future}} tense are just of {{secondary}} importance, they play almost no role. Of crucial importance is {{the aspect of}} an action from the speaker's point of view. The most important distinction is <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> action is perfective, i.e., finished, or imperfective, i.e., still going on, from the speaker's point of view, regardless whether the action itself {{takes place in the}} past, present, or future. Other aspects indicate <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> action takes place regularly, <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> action will take place for sure, and <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> action wants to emphasize the role of the subject, predicate, or object of the sentence. As a result, conjugation is not done by tenses, but by aspects. Nevertheless, the term temporal pronoun became usual for these conjugated pronouns, although aspect pronoun might be a better term.|$|R
40|$|The paper explores <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> organic {{control system}} could include {{elements}} of an improvement standard {{as compared to}} the current minimum requirement standards. It is based on a review of rules of organic certification and of literature.

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. <b>Whether</b> <b>a</b> particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
