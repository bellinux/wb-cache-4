5|$|A major dilemma {{faced by}} Morales' {{administration}} <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> desire to expand extractive industries {{in order to}} fund social programs and provide employment, {{and to protect the}} country's environment from the pollution caused by those industries. Although his government professed an environmentalist ethos, expanding environmental monitoring and becoming a leader in the voluntary Forest Stewardship Council, Bolivia continued to witness rapid deforestation for agriculture and illegal logging.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} times when players and even entire teams carry on {{personal}} rivalries that {{have little to}} do with individual games; fights frequently occur for no other reason. A rivalry that produced many fights <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Red Wings and the Colorado Avalanche during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Another rivalry {{leading up}} to the event <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble in January, The Undertaker won the 2007 Royal Rumble match. As a result, he was given the right to a title match at WrestleMania for any of WWE's three major championships (ECW World, World Heavyweight, or WWE). On the February 5 episode of Raw, Undertaker teased all three World Champions (Bobby Lashley, Batista, and John Cena). Undertaker then chose World Heavyweight Champion Batista as his {{opponent}} to face at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, The Undertaker defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship to extend his WrestleMania undefeated streak to 15-0. Their rivalry, however, did not end, as General Manager Theodore Long booked a Last Man Standing match—a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost—between The Undertaker and Batista at Backlash.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average in Major League Baseball {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Ty Cobb and Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits against the St. Louis Browns. American League President Ban Johnson said a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway, and Chalmers ended up awarding cars to both players.|$|E

5|$|Ceredigion {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since prehistoric times: 170 hill forts and enclosures {{have been identified}} across the county {{and there are many}} standing stones dating back to the Bronze Age. Around the time of the Roman invasion of Britain, the area <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> realms of the Demetae and Ordovices. The Sarn Helen road ran through the territory, with forts at Bremia and Loventium protecting gold mines near present-day Llelio. Following the Roman withdrawal, Irish raids and invasions were repulsed, supposedly by the forces under a northerner named Cunedda. The 9th-century History of the Britons attributed to Nennius records that Cunedda's son Ceredig settled the area around the Teifi in the 5th century. The territory supposedly remained a minor kingdom under his dynasty until its extinction upon the drowning of Gwgon ap Meurig , after which it was administered by Rhodri Mawr of Gwynedd before passing to his son Cadell, whose son Hywel Dda inherited its neighbouring kingdom Dyfed and established the realm of Deheubarth. Records are highly obscure; some historians believe that Hyfaidd ap Bledrig, the Dyfed ruler, may have annexed Ceredigion before his heirs lost it to Hywel through war.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his service}} in the House, Brown resumed his law {{practice}} in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1891, he was {{a candidate for the}} Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The other candidates included Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr., son of former Congressman Brutus J. Clay and nephew of abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay; Dr. John Daniel Clardy, later to be elected a U.S. Representative; and Attorney General Parker Watkins Hardin. The party was split between supporters of corporations, such as the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, and supporters of agrarian interests. Another split <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> more conservative Bourbon Democrats, who supported maintaining the gold standard, and more progressive Democrats, who called for the free coinage of silver. Agrarian voters were about equally split between Clay and Clardy, while Free Silver Democrats were about equally split between Hardin and Clardy. Having lived in the agrarian western part of the state for most of his life, and never having alienated the powerful Farmers' Alliance, Brown was acceptable to most agrarian interests, while the Louisville and Nashville Railroad felt he was a moderate on the issue of corporate regulation. Bourbon Democrats were also pleased with his sound money stand.|$|E
5|$|For three hours, Experiment battled the barges, sinking two {{and killing}} {{a great many}} of the picaroons. During this time two of the barges left the warship and {{attacked}} the merchant ships. These barges managed to protect themselves from Experiment by sailing behind the schooner Mary, which <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two barges and the warship. The Haitians boarded Mary and killed her captain. Many of the crew jumped into the sea, and the rest hid in the hold. The second barge attempted to take Daniel and Mary but was sunk by fire from Experiment. Once the Haitians had boarded Mary, Experiment opened fire upon her with grapeshot, driving the picaroons off.|$|E

5|$|Harvey’s other Test {{match was}} between Australia and the West Indies at the MCG during the Christmas-New Year period of 197980. It was {{won by the}} {{visitors}} by 10 wickets, with a bowling attack of Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, Colin Croft, and Joel Garner proving too powerful for their hosts. Harvey’s colleague was Tony Crafter. Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season, which involved England, Australia and the West Indies. He presided {{in three of the}} round-robin matches, the third of which <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> two visiting teams at the Gabba. It was the only time that Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground. He later presided over the first match of the finals series, between the West Indies and England at the MCG. This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level. Harvey also officiated three Shield matches, Queensland’s tour match against England and one of their domestic one-dayers during the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Queen's University was {{the first}} {{official}} challenger for the Cup, although it was controversial. The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup, but the challenge match <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> previous year's champion, Montreal HC, and the university squad. The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC won the match 5–1 and their cross-town rivals were crowned the champions. The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League. On February 14, 1896, the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2–0 {{and became the first}} team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top floor beside the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>The</b> Undertaker and Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, the Undertaker defeated Edge {{to retain the}} title by forcing him {{to submit to the}} gogoplata, a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood (scripted) from their mouths. On the May 2 episode of SmackDown, authority figure Vickie Guerrero stripped the title from the Undertaker, after claiming the gogoplata was an illegal submission hold and she did it to protect the other wrestlers. The following week, Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge, who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal, an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner, to become the number one contender.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates opened PNC Park {{with two}} {{exhibition}} {{games against the}} New York Mets—the first of which was played on March 31, 2001. The first official baseball game played in PNC Park <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Cincinnati Reds and the Pirates, on April 9, 2001. The Reds won the game by the final score of 8–2. The first pitch—a ball—was thrown from Pittsburgh's Todd Ritchie to Barry Larkin. In {{the top of the}} first inning, Pittsburgh native Sean Casey's two-run home run was the first hit in the park.

Pittsburgh won the stadium's unofficial opening game 20–7, with 57,829 spectators in attendance. The first official football game played in the stadium <b>was</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh Panthers and East Tennessee State, on September 1. The Panthers won the game 31–0, with quarterback David Priestley scoring the first touchdown on an 85-yard run. The Steelers were scheduled to open the regular season play at Heinz Field on September 16 against the Cleveland Browns; however, due to the September 11 attacks, all NFL games of the week were postponed, thus moving the stadium's premiere to October 7, against the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to the game, a speech from US President George W. Bush, ordering attacks on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, was shown live on the stadium's JumboTron. The speech was met with much applause and support from the spectators in attendance. Pittsburgh defeated the Bengals, 16–7. Steelers kicker Kris Brown scored the first NFL points in the stadium on a 26-yard field goal, and quarterback Kordell Stewart scored the first touchdown on an eight-yard run.|$|E
