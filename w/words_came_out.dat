Benjamin Martin's Lingua Britannica Reformata (1749) and Ainsworth's Thesaurus Linguae Latinae (1737) {{are both}} significant, {{in that they}} define entries in separate senses, or aspects, of the word. In English (among others), John Cowell's Interpreter, a law dictionary, was published in 1607, Edward Phillips' The new world of English <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> in 1658 and a dictionary of 40,000 words had been prepared in 1721 by Nathan Bailey, though none was as comprehensive in breadth or style as Johnson's.|$|E
500|$|Because of Grossman's {{hostility to}} Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, Tom Wilson. Wilson recalled: [...] "I didn't even {{particularly}} like folk music. I'd been recording Sun Ra and Coltrane ... I thought folk music {{was for the}} dumb guys. [...] played like the dumb guys, but then these <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> I was flabbergasted." [...] At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Talkin' World War III Blues", [...] "Bob Dylan's Dream", and [...] "Walls of Red Wing". [...] "Walls of Red Wing" [...] was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.|$|E
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if the <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, {{some of which were}} picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E

2500|$|Luckinbill's musical ability was {{utilized}} in J.T. and Colleen's storyline. He {{stated that the}} writers and producers felt {{like it would be}} a good idea. He added: [...] "They wanted me to sing a song by Alison Krauss called, [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". I liked it, was sitting at home one night working on that song and this new song just came about." [...] The new song Luckinbill wrote was entitled [...] "Feel". In writing the song, Luckinbill said he was [...] "thinking of the character's viewpoint, from J.T. to Colleen. If he were going to write her a song, what would he write? And these <b>words</b> <b>came</b> <b>out.</b> I ended up writing a song that night, which I took to our producers and said, 'I know you want me to sing this song, but how do you feel about this one? It's character driven.'" [...] Smith decided Luckinbill would sing both [...] "Feel" [...] and [...] "When You Say Nothing at All". Luckinbill sang Krauss' song on the episode dated December 26, 2002, where J.T. serenades Colleen on her sixteenth birthday. Smith wrote a scene specifically for the song Luckinbill wrote, featuring J.T. playing his guitar at Colleen's Valentine's Day dance where he performed [...] "Feel". After J.T. cheats on Colleen with Anita, Luckinbill wrote an untitled song in character for the show and performed it in character on the episode dated July 24, 2003.|$|E
