5|$|A {{collision}} <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> enemies is {{fatal to}} the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs {{on either side of}} the pyramid serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top of the pyramid. If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear almost black, tinged <b>with</b> <b>purple.</b> The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5µm. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell) through the sterigma. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other Agaricus species, the spores of A.deserticola are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.|$|E
5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various shades of green, yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E
50|$|Allium ledebourianum has {{a cluster}} of narrow bulbs {{up to 20 mm}} across. Scapes are up to 100 cm tall. Leaves are tubular, shorter than the scape. Umbel is hemispheric, densely crowded <b>with</b> many <b>purple</b> flowers; tepals pale <b>purple</b> <b>with</b> darker <b>purple</b> midvein.|$|R

5|$|The visual {{opens with}} a small {{microscopic}} organism-like figure, eventually zooming out on an animated woman. Dancing in the wind, the opening chorus has the woman gliding through a vast field of clouds, often flying {{in front of the}} sun. A strong force field follows her as she is about to land onto buildings, but intercuts into Utada walking through digitized clouds. The camera then changes positions, aimed towards the singer, and showcases her walking through a large grand hall <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> colored Kachina's in cloaks, hitting drums to the songs beat. She walks into a large cathedral-like infrastructure and summons numerous pink kachina's dancing to the tune.|$|E
5|$|Four magical {{disciplines}} are acquired, {{including the}} Fire of Ares, the Ice of Poseidon, the Lightning of Zeus, and the Soul of Hades, which, {{depending on the}} magic equipped, imbues the Blades of Chaos with that elemental property. For example, the Soul of Hades imbues the Blades <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> flames and can unleash souls of the Underworld to briefly attack enemies. The Ice of Poseidon also enables Kratos to breathe underwater, a necessary ability as substantial time is spent there. The Rage ability called Rage of the Gods that was featured in previous games is included, but in this game, its meter is filled by landing attacks on enemies and the ability is automatically activated once the meter has reached maximum capacity. It remains activated until Kratos is attacked or stops attacking {{for an extended period}} of time, after which the meter must be refilled. The Rage ability is also affected by the magic equipped, allowing Kratos to use different Rage attacks, such as the lightning-based Rage of Zeus.|$|E

25|$|Until 2011 the Fremantle Football Club {{used the}} anchor symbol {{as the basis}} for all of their {{guernsey}}s. The home guernsey was <b>purple,</b> <b>with</b> a white anchor on the front separating the chest area into two panels, which were coloured red and green to represent the traditional maritime port and starboard colours. The away or clash guernsey was all white <b>with</b> a <b>purple</b> anchor. Since the end of the 2010 home and away season the home jumper is <b>purple</b> <b>with</b> 3 white chevrons and the away jumper is white <b>with</b> 3 <b>purple</b> chevrons.|$|R
25|$|The away kit {{has always}} been {{predominantly}} white, sometimes <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first worn in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> borders and two lilies on the shoulders. The red shirt {{has been the most}} worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the Coppa Italia, in 2000–01.|$|E

25|$|Docimian marble {{was highly}} admired and valued for its unique colors and fine grained quality, by ancients such as Romans. When the Romans took control over Docimian quarries, they were blown away about the {{beautiful}} color combinations of Docimian Pavonazzetto, {{which is a}} type of white marble <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> veins. A trend started about it right away. Emperors Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, all made extensive use of Docimian marble to all their major building projects.|$|E
25|$|The third jerseys of the Ducks {{were created}} in 1995, 1997, 2003, 2010 and 2015. The 1995 jersey was jade green <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> and white stripes on the collar and {{on the end of}} the sleeves. The logo was of team mascot Wildwing wearing a Mighty Ducks jersey while {{breaking}} through a sheet of ice. The jersey was short-lived; as severe criticism encouraged management to retire the jersey at the end of the 1995–96 season.|$|E
25|$|When the Class 180 Adelante {{units were}} delivered, they were {{painted in the}} {{intercity}} version of FirstGroup's corporate livery.

25|$|Digraphs {{with orange}} {{backgrounds}} are the general ones used for loanwords or foreign places or names, {{and those with}} blue backgrounds are used for more accurate transliterations of foreign sounds, both suggested by the Cabinet of Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Katakana combinations with beige backgrounds are suggested by the American National Standards Institute and the British Standards Institution as possible uses. Ones <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> backgrounds appear on the 1974 version of the Hyōjun-shiki formatting.|$|E
25|$|Williams's school {{colors are}} purple and gold, <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> {{as the primary}} school color. A story {{explaining}} the origin of purple as a school color says that at the Williams-Harvard baseball game in 1869, spectators watching from carriages had trouble telling the teams apart {{because there were no}} uniforms. One of the onlookers bought ribbons from a nearby millinery store to pin on Williams' players, and the only color available was purple. The buyer was Jennie Jerome (later Winston Churchill's mother) whose family summered in Williamstown.|$|E
25|$|At an {{undetermined}} date, a great clearance {{of temple}} offerings {{had been made}} and a modern discovery of a chamber into which they were gathered yielded the fine ivory carvings and the glazed figures and tiles that show the splendid work of the first dynasty. A vase of Menes <b>with</b> <b>purple</b> hieroglyphs inlaid into a green glaze and tiles with relief figures {{are the most important}} pieces found. The noble statuette of Cheops in ivory, found in the stone chamber of the temple, gives the only portrait of this great pharaoh.|$|E
