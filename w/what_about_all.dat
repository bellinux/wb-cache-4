60|$|I {{shall be}} asked, <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> this foreign {{investment}} {{that is going}} on? Is not British credit now being diverted abroad to foreign countries, {{to the detriment of}} our own country? Is not British capital fleeing from The Socialistic speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the President of the Board of Trade, and taking refuge in Germany, where of course there are no Socialists, or in other countries, where there is never any disturbance, like France, or Spain, or Russia, or Turkey? Now let us look into that. There are only two ways in which capital can leave this country for foreign investments. It is no good sending bits of paper to the foreigner and expecting him to pay a dividend in return. There are only two ways--one is by exports made by British labour, and the other by bullion. Now, if the exports were to increase, surely that should be a cause of rejoicing, especially to our Tariff Reformers, who regard the increase in exports as the index of national prosperity. As for the second--the export of bullion--would you believe it, it is only a coincidence, but it is an amusing coincidence, there are actually six million pounds' worth more gold in the country now, than there were {{at the beginning of the}} year before the Budget was introduced. The active and profitable investment abroad which has marked the last two or three years, which is bound to swell the exports of the next few years, has not been attended by any starvation of home industry. On the contrary, the amount of money forthcoming for the development of new industries and now enterprises in this country during the last two or three years has compared very favourably with the years which immediately preceded them, when the Conservative Government was in power.|$|E

40|$|Abstract At {{the heart}} of {{distributed}} computing lies the fundamental result {{that the level of}} agreement that can be obtained in an asynchronous shared memory model where t processes can crash is exactly t + 1.

But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the other 22 n− 1 − (n + 1) adversaries that are not uniform in this sense and might crash certain combination of processes and not others?

We show how to compute the disagreement power of an adversary and derive n equivalence classes of adversaries. ...|$|E

In this paper we show that as a measure of last resort the bit tax can be implemented. Although the exact implementation of such a tax is not yet clear, the general idea of a tax on information from the point of view of an eroding tax base and the changing society is certainly worth considering. Furthermore, the tax revenues could be directed towards improving access to the Internet, educating individuals to become acquainted with the Internet and providing additional needed bandwidth. ...|$|E

40|$|Can {{we teach}} ethics, {{and if we}} can how should we do it? Do we want our {{students}} to know moral theory or act morally? This paper assumes that the objective of 'teaching ethics' is to cultivate the possibility for moral conduct in the everyday world of institutional life. As teachers we know how to teach moral theory but how do we encourage our students to act morally. To attempt an answer I will present some ideas from the work of Levinas and Derrida. With Levinas I will argue that ethics happens in the singularity of the face of the Other before me 'here and now'. Ethics matter in my everyday contact with the Other that confronts me and claims my response. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> other Others simultaneously present? What about justice for all other Others? With Levinas and Derrida I will attempt to articulate the notion of 'caring justice'. In caring justice I want to show how the demands of ethics (the singular) and the demands of justice (all other Others) can become the impossible possibility for a "justice where there is no distinction between those close and those far off, but in which there also remains the impossibility of passing by the closest. " Furthermore, I want to argue for the need of Aristotle's notion of ethics as a habit-caring justice as the cultivation of moral character by doing. Finally, to demonstrate what I mean I discuss a singular case of intellectual property right. In this 'case' I try to show how caring justice can help us not to teach ethics, but do it [...] almos...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to study}} moral {{motivation}} in economic {{decision making and}} to increase understanding of how we treat the element of choice {{when it comes to}} economic inequality and distribution of income. Most people agree that inequality caused by differences in choice and effort is acceptable. We also accept inequality caused by luck if we take the risk by choice. On the other hand, we feel that inequalities caused by factors beyond our control should be redistributed to a considerable extent. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the grey zones in between, all the different combinations of luck and choices? The starting point for this thesis is that there exist choice situations that are mere illusions – situations involving choice where the decision maker have little or no control over the outcome despite the freedom to choose. From psychological literature we also know that people have a tendency to exaggerate the control that choices provide. Combining these features, we are interested in to what extent people assign responsibility to more or less meaningless choices. This thesis analyses an economic experiment. In the experiment, a spectating dictator is asked to redistribute the total earnings of a two-person winner-takes-it-all lottery, where the detailed rules of the lottery vary across three different treatments. The results reveal that a choice illusion – luck that is covered up as a choice – in fact undermines the willingness to redistribute. Using a pure luck lottery as a baseline, we find that people transfer less from the lucky to the unlucky when an “empty” choice is introduced. We find that inequality is reduced substantially across all treatments, but that people redistribute less in the choice treatments...|$|E

40|$|AbstractConvincing {{people to}} try {{something}} new, strange and expensive is not easy. Convincing them to embrace something that they fear and struggle to understand is almost impossible. Many people seem to fear CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS) and remain skeptical that it will evolve into a huge opportunity to control global CO 2 emissions. It needs to be explained in terms normal people understand. Not everyone speaks the same language or starts from the same point of reference. This effort is by a high school junior using common language and images familiar {{to me and my}} friends to visualize basic science relationships related to the storage part of CCS: soccer balls and playing fields. It considers key components of well systems and makes comparisons with the behavior of natural phenomena like ant hills enduring in a light rain storm, and compares that with their fate when attacked by a little brother with a water hose. It asks questions about the dimensions of the systems, and how key components might work. It’s about putting CO 2 underground, but {{how do you explain that}} with soccer balls?Instinctively, the big question is will the CO 2 stay underground? What will happen to it with time? Why won’t it just come right back out a well like a straw? <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> those wells anyway? Should people get hyped-up about them? Aren’t they filled with cement? Think, CO 2 in water makes an acid. What will that acid do? Is it about pumping and sucking fluids thru barriers as strong as steel instead of allowing them to flow freely in a hose? Stay tuned and read on. Full disclosure: This paper is not exactly cutting edge science; it offers no new data, and tests no hypothesis although it makes some original calculations. It’s about communication and visualization, so it deliberately dodges some important details about well construction techniques, reaction rates, kinetics and the multiphase behavior of supercritical CO 2, even in the same reservoir. It touches on fundamentals of reservoir porosity and permeability, and even subsurface fluid flow but just barely. Just enough to be cool, stressed, over pressured and dense phased, more or less like the injected gas we care so much about...|$|E
40|$|Electronic theses and {{dissertation}} are {{the topic}} of the ETD, but <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> the theses, which are not yet electronically published and only available on paper or even worse on microfilm? As the manufacturer of the Bookeye® family of scanners we {{have had a lot of}} discussions with libraries and their needs. One topic was the gap between the increasing demand for electronic availability of documents like dissertations and theses and their real availability on paper or microfilm. To close this gap - besides others like electronic document delivery via ILL and/or an alternative to ARIEL - we were asked to develop an open WEB-based system together with librarians. The development guidelines were a browser-based user interface, usage of PHP, Apache, MySQL, and the system should run on Windows and Linux. The result was Mybib, a platform to cover: * electronic document delivery * scan on demand applications, as an alternative to scanning entire stocks * back file conversion to supply extended OPAC´s Requests for documents to be scanned and delivered can be issued to Mybib by any library system, OPAC or free style WEB-form via ILL, XML or E-Mail. The whole process from the incoming request, through scanning to the delivery is cov-ered by Mybib. Modules for tracking, billing, claim handling, statistics and others support the management and supervisor of the library. MyBib is scalable from one to many scanning, operation and management workplaces. It covers the needs of big libraries located in one place, as well as libraries with departments located in different places. And all of them can be supervised from one place anywhere in the world via Internet or VPN with a Browser To get theses and documents from paper/microfilm to a digital form, they have to be scanned, which is realized by the My-Bib Scan-client. It covers overhead-, flatbed-, autofeed- and microfilm- scanners as well as digital copier systems from RICOH, CANON and others, which can be used as scanner and printer. And if the scanner supports color or formats up to A 1 (34 " by 22 "), Mybib supports it too. Last, but not least there is the question of intellectual property rights. To help protect these rights, the electronic endorser in Mybib imprints a digital watermark as proof of information supplier or copyright remarks with time stamp in the delivered documents...|$|E
40|$|It {{has become}} {{accepted}} orthodoxy in Literature and Science studies that {{relations between the}} two domains are a “two way street,” and that literature and culture do not meekly reflect the new findings of their dominant partner, science, but are actively engaged in a dynamic, reciprocal set of relations with scientific practice and the development of scientific ideas. It is an attractive position (and one to which I have always subscribed), but such reciprocity is decidedly easier to track in historical context, before the consolidation of structures of institutional and professional science, than in the current period. The call for the AHRC “Science in Culture” large grants scheme was thus challenging: applicants were asked not merely to analyse reciprocal relations between science and culture, but to work directly with scientists, and to develop new insights and new methodologies for both sides. A tall order! Over the years I have participated in numerous workshops and conferences with scientists, trying to discover common ground, but never engaged directly in collaborative research. Originally Gowan Dawson and I had been envisaging a strictly historical project, addressing all those thousands of scientific and medical journals which lie mouldering in library basements (and are still largely untouched by digitisation). As historians we are familiar with the “big names”, those journals like the Lancet, the BMJ or Nature which have survived into the present day, and whose dominance in the historical record is now reaffirmed by the digitisation of back numbers, making it easier for scholars to work with them. But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> those local natural history journals, or medical or public health journals which have faded from historical memory? Our aim, in working with these journals, was to uncover the networks which operated within Victorian science and medicine, and to rewrite in the process the metropolitan and professional focus of much historiography. Yet, such work would not involve any interaction with contemporary science. I had become aware, however, of the emerging phenomenon of “citizen science,” particularly as supported by Zooniverse, the online citizen science platform run by Chris Lintott in the Dept of Astro-Physics at the University of Oxford. It was clear that there were interesting parallels between, for example, the armies of people who participated in the development of natural history in the nineteenth century, and the “citizens” who now go online to help analyse scientific data, whether of astronomical phenomena, cancer cells, or the behaviour of wildlife. In the resulting AHRC project, “Constructing Scientific Communities: Citizen Science in the 19 th and 21 st Centuries,” based at the Universities of Oxford and Leicester, and run in conjunction with our partners the Natural History Museum, London, the Royal Society, and the Royal College of Surgeons, England, we uncover forgotten histories of large-scale participation in science, and the role of journals in helping to create and consolidate these communities. We also bring such historical knowledge to bear on current practice, exploring ways in which earlier models of scientific communication and community building can help to inform the rapidly changing world of science in the digital age. In addition, the project has also created its own citizen science projects: Science Gossip and Orchid Observers...|$|E
