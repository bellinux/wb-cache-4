50|$|Real-world {{components}} exhibit non-ideal characteristics which are, in reality, distributed elements but {{are often}} represented to a first-order approximation by lumped elements. To account for leakage in capacitors for example, we can model the non-ideal capacitor {{as having a}} large lumped resistor connected in parallel even though the leakage is, in reality distributed throughout the dielectric. Similarly a <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistor</b> has significant inductance as well as resistance distributed along its length but we can model this as a lumped inductor in series with the ideal resistor.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thermal dynamic model of <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors.</b> In {{order to identify}} the thermal model an active bridge circuit is discussed. The power step response of the <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors</b> can be measured with the resolution of 1 ppm using the detailed circuit. Experimental results are also presented...|$|R

50|$|The bifilar coil (more {{often called}} the bifilar winding) is used in modern {{electrical}} engineering {{as a means of}} constructing <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors</b> with negligible parasitic self-inductance.|$|R
5000|$|Resistance wire is wire {{with higher}} than normal resistivity, often used for heating {{elements}} or for making <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors.</b> Nichrome wire {{is the most common}} type.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{noise and}} 1 /f noise are {{investigated}} at room conditions in {{three kinds of}} basic off-the-shelf resistors. Samples of carbon film, metal oxide, and cement fixed <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors</b> are evaluated. Measurement setup is created to acquire their noise spectral density. Their Noise Index and Hooge's constant are calculated and their useability in low-noise measurement setup is assessed...|$|R
50|$|Flicker {{noise is}} found in carbon-composition {{resistors}} and in thick-film resistors, where it {{is referred to as}} excess noise, since it increases the overall noise level above the thermal noise level, which is present in all <b>resistors.</b> In contrast, <b>wire-wound</b> <b>resistors</b> have the least amount of flicker noise. Since flicker noise is related to the level of DC, if the current is kept low, thermal noise will be the predominant effect in the resistor, and the type of resistor used may not affect noise levels, depending on the frequency window.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{development}} and characterization of a packaged pressure sensor system suitable for jet engine health monitoring is demonstrated. The sensing system operates from 97 to 117 MHz over a pressure range from 0 to 350 psi and a temperature range from 25 to 500 deg. The sensing system consists of a Clapp-type oscillator that is fabricated on an alumina substrate and is comprised of a Cree SiC MESFET, MIM capacitors, a <b>wire-wound</b> inductor, chip <b>resistors</b> and a SiCN capacitive pressure sensor. The pressure sensor {{is located in the}} LC tank circuit of the oscillator so that a change in pressure causes a change in capacitance, thus changing the resonant frequency of the sensing system. The chip <b>resistors,</b> <b>wire-wound</b> inductors and MIM capacitors have all been characterized at temperature and operational frequency, and perform with less than 5 % variance in electrical performance. The measured capacitive pressure sensing system agrees very well with simulated results. The packaged pressure sensing system is specifically designed to measure the pressure on a jet turbofan engine. The packaged system can be installed by way of borescope plug adaptor fitted to a borescope port exposed to the gas path of a turbofan engine...|$|R
50|$|This Design {{takes the}} concept of normal Field {{barriers}} that has been successfully used in the analog signal world(4-20 mA). These barriers use an infallible <b>resistor</b> (<b>wire-wound),</b> Zener diodes and a fuse, and require a good intrinsically safe ground. While this barrier limited energy sufficient for Zone 0/1 all Gas Groups (Class I Div 1 all Gas Groups), it only provides 80 mA for the Fieldbus segment.This optimistically could only power four Fieldbus devices which typically take 15-26 mA each. The Entity barrier concept is safe, but its low power limitations and engineering requirements effectively eliminate many {{of the benefits of}} using bus technology.|$|R
2500|$|The {{thermal noise}} of a {{practical}} resistor {{may also be}} larger than the theoretical prediction and that increase is typically frequency-dependent. Excess noise of a practical resistor is observed only when current flows through it. This is specified in unit of μV/V/decade – μV of noise per volt applied across the resistor per decade of frequency. [...] The μV/V/decade value is frequently given in dB so that a resistor with a noise index of 0dB exhibits 1 μV (rms) of excess noise for each volt across the resistor in each frequency decade. [...] Excess noise is thus an example of 1/f noise. [...] Thick-film and carbon composition resistors generate more excess noise than other types at low frequencies. <b>Wire-wound</b> and thin-film <b>resistors</b> are often used for their better noise characteristics. [...] Carbon composition resistors can exhibit a noise index of 0dB while bulk metal foil resistors may have a noise index of −40dB, usually making the excess noise of metal foil resistors insignificant. Thin film surface mount resistors typically have lower noise and better thermal stability than thick film surface mount resistors. Excess noise is also size-dependent: in general excess noise is reduced as the physical size of a resistor is increased (or multiple resistors are used in parallel), as the independently fluctuating resistances of smaller components tend to average out.|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been written at SAAB Bofors Dynamics (SBD) AB in Gothenburg at the {{department}} of optronic systems. In military observation operations, a target to hit is chosen by illumination of a laser designator. From the targetpoint laser radiation is reflected on a detector that helps identify the target. The detector is a semiconductor PIN-type that has been investigated in a laboratory environment together with a specially designed laser source. The detector is a photodiode and using purchased components, circuits for both the photodiode and the laserdiode has been designed and fabricated. The bandwidth of the op-amp should be about 30 MHz, in the experiments a bandwidth of 42 MHz was used. Initially the feedback network, which consists of a 5. 6 pF capacitor in parallel with a 1 -kohm resistor determined the bandwidth. To avoid the op-amp saturate under strong illuminated laser radiation the feedback network will use a 56 -pF capacitor and a 100 -ohm resistor respectively. The laser should be pulsed with 10 - 20 ns width, 10 Hz repetition frequency, about 800 nm wavelength and a maximum output power of 80 mW. To avoid electrical reflection signals at measurement equipment connections, the laser circuit includes a resistor of about 50 ohm, that together with the resistance in the laserdiode forms the right termination that eliminate the reflection signals. The <b>wire-wound</b> type of <b>resistor</b> shall be avoided in this application and instead a surface mounted type was beneficial with much lower inductance. The detector showed a linear behaviour up to 40 -mW optical power. Further investigation was hindered by the breakdown of the laserdiodes. The function generator limits the tests to achieve 80 mW in light power. In different experiments the responsivity of the photodiode is different from the nominal value, however it would have required more time to investigate the causes...|$|R
