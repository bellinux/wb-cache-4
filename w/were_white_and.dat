5|$|All Supreme Court justices <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> of European {{heritage}} {{until the}} appointment of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American Justice, in 1967. Since then, only two other non-white Justices have been appointed, Marshall's African-American successor, Clarence Thomas in 1991, and Sonia Sotomayor in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Most {{perpetrators}} <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> {{the victims}} black.

5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many slaves in the colony as there <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> mixed-race people put together. In 1789 the French were importing 30,000 slaves a year and there were half a million slaves in the French part of the island alone, compared to about 30,000 whites.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 2.3-3 mm. The forewings are brown, the dorsum dark brownish grey basally. The longitudinal fascia <b>is</b> <b>white,</b> extending from the base to the basal one-third of the forewing. The costal fascia <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> found at the distal two-fifths of the costa. It is oblique and adjacent to a slender dark brown line on the anterior side. The subapical <b>and</b> apical spots <b>are</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> the tornal patch <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> triangular. The dorsal bar <b>is</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> oblique. The hindwings are grey.|$|R

5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a white coat was recessive, then white horses {{would have to be}} {{homozygous}} for the condition and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that homozygous dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the homozygous state: ww horses were non-white, Ww <b>were</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> WW died.|$|E
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents <b>were</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E
25|$|As {{of the end}} of 2010, 53% of {{the entire}} 34,526-member police force <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 47% were members of {{minority}} groups. Of 22,199 officers on patrol, 53% (11,717) were black, Latino (of any race), or Asian or Asian-American, and 47% (10,482) were non-Hispanic white. Of 5,177 detectives, 57% (2,953) <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 43% (2,224) were people of color. Of 4,639 sergeants, 61% (2,841) <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 39% (1,798) were minorities. Of 1,742 lieutenants, 76% (1,323) <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 24% (419) were people of color. Of 432 captains, 82% (356) <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 18% (76) were minorities. Of 10 chiefs, 7 <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> 3 were people of color. In 2002, whites accounted for 60% of members in the rank of police officer. Between 2002 and 2010, the number of minorities in top-tier positions in the force increased by about 4.5%.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} years of the institution, the colors adopted <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> light blue, seeking to {{highlight}} the fact that it was an Argentine club. The first vest used by the team had vertical white and light blue stripes.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{colors of}} the school <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> gold. When the junior college {{was added to the}} campus in 1921, its colors of blue and gold were merged, {{resulting}} in a blue, gold, and white color scheme. New colors were later chosen as gold and purple, until being replaced by scarlet and black on January 28, 1928.|$|E

25|$|Designation of routes was by a {{lettered}} {{destination board}} {{on each side}} of the car above the windows, and the cars were painted various colours denoting the routes on which they worked.

25|$|In 2016 {{residents}} in the Love Elementary attendance area proposed adding a magnet program to Love Elementary so it could attract {{a wider variety of}} students and additional financial support from the community. As of that year it had fewer than 500 students; 88% of its students were Hispanic or Latino, 7% <b>were</b> <b>white,</b> <b>and</b> 89% were considered low income. Its demographics and level of financial support strongly contrast with other Heights area elementary schools.|$|E

25|$|Most {{young women}} took jobs before marriage, then quit. Before {{the growth of}} high schools after 1900, most women left school after the 8th grade at about age 15. Ciani (2005) shows that type of work they did {{reflected}} their ethnicity and marital status. Black mothers were often day labors, usually as domestic servants, because other opportunities were limited. Most mothers receiving pensions <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> sought work only when necessary.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) {{report by}} the Texas Education Agency (TEA), Boling ISD {{received}} a Recognized rating.

The proportion of economically disadvantaged students was 50% and the special education program served 9% of all students. While the {{junior high and high}} schools received Recognized ratings, the elementary school earned a coveted Exemplary rating in 2010. There were approximately 500 students in district schools.|$|E
25|$|The Saga of Eric the Red further relates {{that around}} her neck she wore a {{necklace}} of glass pearls, and on her head she wore a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white cat skin. Around her waist she wore a belt of amadou from which hung a large pouch, where she hid the tools that she used during the seiðr. On her feet she wore shoes of calfskin and the shoelaces had brass knobs in the ends, and on her hands she wore gloves of cat skin, which <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> fluffy inside.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, March 21, {{close to}} 8,000 people {{assembled}} at Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church to commence the trek to Montgomery. Most {{of the participants}} were black, but some <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> some were Asian and Latino. Spiritual leaders of multiple races, religions, and creeds marched abreast with Dr. King, including Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos, Rabbis Abraham Joshua Heschel and Maurice Davis, and at least one nun, all of whom were depicted in a photo that has become famous. The Dutch priest Henri Nouwen joined the march on March 24.|$|E
25|$|The barge Lady of the Lea {{was built}} of wood in Rotherhithe in 1931 by boat-builders Hyam & Oliver (who {{operated}} {{well into the}} 1960s) for the War Department, following the original plans of canal barges from a century earlier. She was built small enough to pass under the low bridges of the River Lea and Bow Creek in London and was originally tiller steered and stumpy rigged, without top mast or topsail. The bottom was built of pine (doubled up) and the sides of oak and elm with copper fastenings and brass knees. Unusually, the sails <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> not the normal russet colour (of other Thames barges). Her original tonnage and dimensions are not known.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} paints were red ochre, red lead, soot, calcium carbonate, and other earth colours, which were bound with fat and water. It also {{appears that the}} Vikings {{imported}} white lead, green malachite and blue azurite from Continental Europe. By using an electron microscope, chemists {{have been able to}} analyse traces of colours on runestones, and in one case, they discovered bright red vermilion, which was an imported luxury colour. However, the dominating colours <b>were</b> <b>white</b> <b>and</b> red lead. There are even accounts where runes were reddened with blood as in Grettis saga, where the Völva Þuríðr cut runes on a tree root and coloured them with her own blood to kill Grettir, and in Egils saga where Egill Skallagrímsson cut ale runes on a drinking horn and painted them with his own blood to see if the drink was poisoned.|$|E
