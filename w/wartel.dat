40|$|One {{electron}} oxidation of DNA {{has been}} studied extensively over the years. When a charge is injected into a DNA duplex, it migrates through the DNA until it reaches a trap. Upon further reactions, damage occurs {{in this area and}} strand cleavage can occur. Many works have been performed to see what can affect this damage to DNA. Netropsin is a minor groove binder that can bind to tracts of four to five A:T base pairs. It has been used in the studies within to determine if it can protect DNA against oxidative damage, caused by one-electron oxidation, when it is bound within the minor groove of the DNA. By using a naphthacenedione derivative as a photosensitizer, several DNA duplexes containing netropsin binding sites as well as those without binding sites, were irradiated at 420 nm, analyzed, and visualized to determine its effect on oxidative damage. It has been determined netropsin creates a quenching sphere of an average of 5. 8 * 108 Šwhether bound to the DNA or not.

40|$|DNA condensates have {{attracted}} the attention of biophysicists, biochemists and polymer physicists for more than thirty years. In the biological community, the quest to understand DNA toroid formation has been motivated by its relevance to gene packing in certain viruses and by the potential use of DNA toroids in artificial gene delivery (e. g. gene therapy). In the physical sciences, DNA toroids are appreciated as a superb model system for studying particle formation by the collapse of a semiflexible, polyelectrolyte polymer. The thesis includes an analysis of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors governing DNA condensate morphology in solution, and discusses implications for future applications of DNA condensation in vitro as a model system for testing theories of polyelectrolyte collapse. In addition, DNA condensation by folded bovine protamine, a naturally occurring multivalent oligopeptide responsible for packing genomic DNA in bovine sperm cells, has been studied as well. The analysis of morphology, size, DNA strand packing density, and the stability of structural integrity of DNA condensates obtained with folded bovine protamines suggests that we have reconstituted native sperm cell chromatin. The results of this study were used to model the local structure of bovine sperm cell chromatin. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Nicholas V. Hud; Committee Member: Donald F. Doyle; Committee Member: Loren D.

40|$|The {{presented}} work is {{the application}} of recent methodologies on modeling and simulation of single stranded RNA viruses. We first present the methods of modeling RNA molecules using the coarse-grained modeling package, YUP. Coarse-grained models simplify complex structures such as viruses and let us study general behavior of the complex biological systems that otherwise cannot be studied with all-atom details. Second, we modeled the first all-atom T= 3, icosahedral, single stranded RNA virus, Pariacoto virus (PaV). The x-ray structure of PaV shows only 35 % of the total RNA genome and 88 % of the capsid. We modeled both missing portions of RNA and protein. The final model of the PaV demonstrated that the positively charged protein N- terminus was located deep inside the RNA. We propose that the positively charged N- terminal tails {{make contact with the}} RNA genome and neutralize the negative charges in RNA and subsequently collapse the RNA/protein complex into an icosahedral virus. Third, we simulated T= 1 empty capsids using a coarse-grained model of three capsid proteins as a wedge-shaped triangular capsid unit. We varied the edge angle and the potentials of the capsid units to perform empty capsid assembly simulations. The final model and the potential are further improved for the whole virus assembly simulations. Finally, we performed stability and assembly simulations of the whole virus using coarse-grained models. We tested various strengths of RNA-protein tail and capsid protein-capsid protein attractions in our stability simulations and narrowed our search for optimal potentials for assembly. The assembly simulations were carried out with two different protocols: co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional. The co-transcriptional assembly protocol mimics the assembly occurring during the replication of the new RNA. Proteins bind the partly transcribed RNA in this protocol. The post-transcriptional assembly protocol assumes that the RNA is completely transcribed in the absence of proteins. Proteins later bind to the fully transcribed RNA. We found that both protocols can assemble viruses, when the RNA structure is compact enough to yield a successful virus particle. The post-transcriptional protocol depends more on the compactness of the RNA structure compared to the co-transcriptional assembly protocol. Viruses can exploit both assembly protocols based on the location of RNA replication and the compactness of the final structure of the RNA. PhDCommittee Chair: Stephen C.

40|$|Research {{efforts to}} {{determine}} the causes, effects and locations of mutations within the human genome have been widely pursued due to {{their role in the}} development of various diseases. The main cause of mutations in vivo is oxidative damage to DNA via oxidants and free radical species. Numerous studies have been performed in vitro to determine how oxidative damage is induced in DNA. Most of these in vitro studies require photosensitizers to initiate the oxidative damage through various mechanisms. For the purposes of this research, all the photosensitizers that were used initiated oxidative damage in DNA through the electron transfer mechanism. In the charge transport studies, an anthraquinone photosensitizer was covalently linked to the 5 end of DNA by a short carbon tether in order {{to determine the}} pattern of damage induced along the length of the DNA. Anthraquinone preferentially damages guanine bases. Our first work sought to determine the effects of charge transport through guanine rich quadruplex DNA dimers. The dimers were formed by the combination of two hairpins with duplex overhangs extending beyond the quadruplex region. This enabled the optimal comparison of the effects of charge transport between duplex and quadruplex DNA structures. Another area of research we pursued in this area was to determine the effects of charge transport in M-DNA (a novel DNA conformation that was reported to form in the presence of zinc ions at a pH above 8). Earlier work on M-DNA suggested that it behaved like a molecular wire. Our research attempted to determine the effects of charge transport on this structure in order to show the behavior of a DNA molecular wire as compared to the standard studies performed in this area on normal B-DNA structures. Lastly, in collaboration with Dr. Ramaiah and colleagues we designed some viologen linked acridine photosensitizers which were tested for any ability to cleave GGG bulges. In preliminary studies, these viologen linked acridine derivatives showed preferential cleavage for guanine bases. They were not covalently bound to DNA, although they could potentially form non covalent interactions with DNA such as intercalation and/or groove binding. Our overall research goal was to determine the extent and overall effect of oxidative damage (using different photosensitizers) on the various DNA structures mentioned above. Ph. D.

40|$|Microbial metal {{reduction}} {{contributes to}} biogeochemical cycling, and reductive precipitation provides {{the basis for}} bioremediation strategies designed to immobilize radionuclide contaminants present in the subsurface. Facultatively anaerobic ×-proteobacteria of the genus Shewanella are present in many aquatic and terrestrial environments and are capable of respiration {{on a wide range}} of compounds as terminal electron acceptor including transition metals, uranium and transuranics. S. putrefaciens is readily cultivated in the laboratory and a genetic system was recently developed to study U(VI) reduction in this organism. U(VI) reduction-deficient S. putrefaciens point mutant Urr 14 (hereafter referred to as CCMB 1) was found to retain the ability to respire several alternate electron acceptors. In the present study, CCMB 1 was tested on a suite of electron acceptors and found to retain growth on electron acceptors with high reduction potential (E¡¬ 0) [O 2, Fe(III) -citrate, Mn(IV), Mn(III) -pyrophosphate, NO 3 -] but was impaired for anaerobic growth on electron acceptors with low E¡¬ 0 [NO 2 -, U(VI), dimethyl sulfoxide, trimethylamine N-oxide, fumarate, ×-FeOOH, SO 32 -, S 2 O 32 -]. Genetic complementation and sequencing analysis revealed that CCMB 1 contained a point mutation (H 108 Y) in a CcmB homolog, an ABC transporter permease subunit required for c-type cytochrome maturation in E. coli. The periplasmic space of CCMB 1 contained low levels of cytochrome c and elevated levels of free thiol equivalents (-SH), an indication that redox homeostasis was disrupted. Anaerobic growth ability, but not cytochrome c maturation activity, was restored to CCMB 1 by adding exogenous disulfide bond-containing compounds (e. g., cystine) to the growth medium. To test the possibility that CcmB transports heme from the cytoplasm to the periplasm in S. putrefaciens, H 108 was replaced with alanine, leucine, methionine and lysine residues via site-directed mutagenesis. Anaerobic growth, cytochrome c biosynthesis or redox homeostasis was disrupted in each of the site-directed mutants except H 108 M. The results of this study demonstrate, for the first time, that S. putrefaciens requires CcmB to produce c-type cytochromes under U(VI) -reducing conditions and maintain redox homeostasis during growth on electron acceptors with low E¡¬ 0. The present study is the first to examine CcmB activity during growth on electron acceptors with widely-ranging E¡¬ 0, and the results suggest that cytochrome c or free heme maintains periplasmic redox poise during growth on electron acceptors with E¡¬ 0 < 0. 36 V such as in the subsurface engineered for rapid U(VI) reduction or anoxic environments dominated by sulfate-reducing bacteria. A mechanism for CcmB heme translocation across the S. putrefaciens cytoplasmic membrane via heme coordination by H 108 is proposed. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Thomas J.

40|$|The {{inherited}} form {{of primary}} open angle glaucoma, a disorder characterized by increased intraocular pressure and retina degeneration, {{is linked to}} mutations in the olfactomedin (OLF) domain of the myocilin gene. Disease-causing myocilin variants accumulate within trabecular meshwork cells instead of being secreted to the trabecular extracellular matrix thought to regulate aqueous humor flow and control intraocular pressure. Like other diseases of protein misfolding, we hypothesize myocilin toxicity originates from defects in protein biophysical properties. In this thesis, the first preparative recombinant high-yield expression and purification system for the C-terminal OLF domain of myocilin (myoc-OLF) is described. To determine the relative stability of wild-type (WT) and mutant OLF domains, a fluorescence thermal stability assay was adapted to provide the first direct evidence that mutated OLF is folded but less thermally stable than WT. In addition, mutant myocilin can be stabilized by chemical chaperones. Together, this work provides the first quantitative demonstration of compromised stability among identified OLF variants and placing myocilin glaucoma {{in the context of}} other complex diseases of protein misfolding. Subsequent investigations into the biophysical properties of WT myoc-OLF provide insight into its structure and function. In particular, myoc-OLF is stable in the presence of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), as well as over a wide pH range in buffers with functional groups reminiscent of such GAGs. Myoc-OLF contains significant â-sheet and â-turn secondary structure as revealed by circular dichroism analysis. At neutral pH, thermal melts indicate a highly cooperative transition with a melting temperature of ~ 55 °C. A compact core structural domain of OLF was identified by limited proteolysis and consists of approximately residues 238 - 461, which retains the single disulfide bond and is as stable as the full myoc-OLF construct. This construct also is capable of generating 3 D crystals for structure determination. This data, presented in Chapter 3, inform new testable hypotheses for interactions with specific trabecular extracellular matrix components. 	To gain further insight into the biological function of myoc-OLF, a facile fluorescence chemical stability assay was designed to identify possible ligands and drug candidates. In the assay described in Chapter 4, the target protein is initially destabilized with a chemical denaturant and is tested for re-stabilization upon the addition of small molecules. The assay requires no prior knowledge of the structure and/or function of the target protein, and it is amendable to high-throughput screening. Application of the assay using a library of 1, 280 compounds revealed 14 possible ligands and drug candidates for myoc-OLF that may also generate insights into myoc-OLF function. Due to the high â-sheet content of monomeric myoc-OLF and presence of an aggregated species upon myoc-OLF purification, the ability of myoc-OLF to form amyloid fibrils was suspected and verified. The fibril forming region was confirmed to reside in the OLF domain of myocilin. Kinetic analyses of fibril formation reveal a self-propagating process common to amyloid. The presence of an aggregated species was confirmed in cells transfected with WT myocilin, but to a greater extent in cells transfected with P 370 L mutant myocilin. Both cell lines stained positive for amyloid. Taken together, these results provide further insights into the structure of myocilin and suggest a new hypothesis for glaucoma pathogenesis. Finally, in a related study, small molecule drug candidates were investigated to treat acid â-glucosidase (GCase), the deficient lysosomal enzyme in Gaucher disease, another protein conformational disorder. Three new GCase active-site directed 3, 4, 5, 6 -tetrahydroxylazepane inhibitors were synthesized that exhibit half inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) in the low millimolar to low micromolar range. Although the compounds thermally stabilize GCase at pH 7. 4, only one of the synthesized analogs exhibits chaperoning activity under typical assay conditions. This successful pharmacological chaperone is also one in which GCase is in its proposed active conformation as revealed by X-ray crystallography. Probing the plasticity of the active-site of GCase offers additional insight into possible molecular determinants for an effective small molecule therapy for GD.
