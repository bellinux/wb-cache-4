50|$|The PLGen module {{stands for}} the virtual model {{generator}} or the pre-processor of the PLPAK. It mainly changes any structural drawing to {{what is called the}} “virtual model”. Modeller can import structural drawings from DXF CAD files or can draw then directly using the CAD capabilities of the PLGen. The virtual model looks very similar to the original structural drawing. The PLGen mainly define the structure using series of objects. These objects are classified into one of three categories: the geometrical objects (single slab and openings), the loading objects (column load, <b>wall</b> <b>load,</b> load patch, load assembly) and the supporting objects (column, wall, wall assembly, soil support, beam). Using such objects the modeler can define all elements in the building slab. It has to be noted that the virtual model represents the actual slab shape (not like the centre-line model of the finite element method). Columns and walls are represented by the actual cross section shape. The PLGen can also input the numerical models of each object such as the number of boundary elements for each segments, the discretization of the beam-slab contact areas, etc. Load cases only (i.e. no load combinations) are defined in the PLGen module. Material properties are also defined herein. The below Figure demonstrates the graphical user interface of the PLGen module.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} for an {{advanced}} fusion first wall and blanket has been identified. The key {{feature of the}} concept {{is the use of}} the heat of vaporization of lithium (about 10 times higher than water) as the primary means for capturing and removing the fusion power. A reasonable range of boiling temperatures of this alkali metal is 1200 to 1400 C, corresponding with a saturation pressure of 0. 035 to 0. 2 MPa.

40|$|The typical {{housing type}} {{of the rural}} {{population}} of Turkey is load-bearing masonry units. Masonry buildings are as vulnerable to seismic failure as reinforced concrete buildings. However, the majority of research eorts are directed towards reinforced concrete buildings. Masonry walls that constitute masonry structures are subject to in-plane and out-of-plane seismic forces during an earthquake. It is shown in this paper that out-of-plane acceleration can exceed in-plane acceler-ations. Therefore, it is very possible that masonry buildings begin to fail by collapse of upper story walls subject to out-of-plane accelerations. My masonry <b>wall</b> <b>loaded</b> out-of-plane fails by forming fracture lines similar to the yield lines of a 2 way reinforced concrete slab.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the neutron <b>wall</b> <b>load</b> {{as well as the}} {{lifetime}} and operating temperature of the structural material on tokamak reactor economics was investigated and a comparative study of stainless steel and vanadium alloys was performed. In order to limit the fractional increase in the cost of energy due to the plant downtime, t, for replacement of the structural material to 6, the structure lifetime, T, must be greater than t/ 6 where T and t are in years. Economically attractive tokamak reactors produce a neutron <b>wall</b> <b>load</b> of 3 - 4 MW/m * for 3000 MW thermal power. The cost of energy is optimized by an operating temperature of the structural material in the wall/blanket in the range 475 - 500 °C for stainless steel and 620 - 66 O'C for vanadium alloys. The gain in electric power due to higher operating temperatures is not sufficient to offset the penalty in the capital cost {{associated with the use of}} vanadium alloys as compared to stainless steel. Therefore, the vanadium alloy must exhibit a significant lifetime advantage over stain-less steel to be economically competitive. The magnitude of this advantage is particularly sensitive to the plant downtime and the reference lifetime of stainless steel as well as the extent to which the refractory alloy has to be used in the heat transport system. 1...|$|E

40|$|Wall flumes are {{vertical}} conduits {{attached to}} the walls of grain bins through which grain can flow. Flumes are thought to encourage funnel flow throughout {{the height of the}} bin while reducing the dynamic loads and moments associated with plug flow and side unloading. Discharge outlets from the flume can be placed at any location along the vertical line of the flume. Tests were performed with soft red winter wheat in a smooth-walled, model grain bin 2. 44 m in diameter and 7. 44 m tall, constructed of galvanized steel. Tests were conducted both with and without the flume. During unloading, the wall flume created an Ã¢Â€ÂœartificialÃ¢Â€Â funnel flow regime within all parts of the bin which produced <b>wall</b> <b>loads</b> smaller than those measured during filling, other than at the onset of discharge in which a small load spike was observed. However, in unloading through the flume unbalanced <b>wall</b> <b>loads</b> were observed around the circumference of the bin, which produced overturning moments in the plug flow zone. Tests were conducted in which flow was transferred from the wall flume to the center discharge gate.

40|$|Abstract Background Total contact casting is {{regarded}} as the gold standard treatment for plantar foot ulcers. Load transfer from the plantar surface of the foot to the walls of the total contact cast has previously been assessed indirectly. The aim of this proof of concept {{study was to determine the}} feasibility of a new method to directly measure the load between the cast wall and the lower leg interface using capacitance sensors. Methods Plantar load was measured with pedar® sensor insoles and cast <b>wall</b> <b>load</b> with pliance® sensor strips as participants (n= 2) walked along a 9 m walkway at 0. 4 ± 0. 04 m/sec. The relative force (%) on the cast wall was calculated by dividing the mean cast wall force (N) per step by the mean plantar force (N) per step in the shoe-cast condition. Results The combined average measured load per step upon the walls of the TCC equated to 23 - 34 % of the average plantar load on the opposite foot. The highest areas of load on the lower leg were located at the posterior margin of the lateral malleolus and at the anterior ankle/extensor retinaculum. Conclusions These direct measurements of cast <b>wall</b> <b>load</b> are similar to previous indirect assessment of load transfer (30 - 36 %) to the cast walls. This new methodology may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of load transfer from the plantar surface of the foot to the cast walls of the total contact cast. </p...|$|E

A large improvement in the fusion reactor cost follows from the following features of the CT: • CT power plants balance reactor engineering attractiveness against physics/technical risk. • Radial build of integrated blanket-coolant-shield-coil modules determines the minimum practical radius of the first wall, and leads to a compact reactor size. • Higher engineering β: lower cost coils for a given plasma pressure • Simply-connected first wall with no toroidal field coil leads to simplified and modular blanket-coolant-shield-coil designs.
