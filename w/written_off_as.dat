5|$|On {{the right}} wing of the Republican party, some of Goldwater's {{political}} positions included anti-communism, an emphasis on total victory in war and opposition to high taxes and government spending. He often criticized the politics of some of his more moderate contemporaries, including President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He criticized some aspects of Eisenhower's economic policy, citing his failure to balance the federal budget. After being <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> too right-wing to successfully wage a presidential campaign, Goldwater actively supported Richard Nixon's campaign against John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{designer}} named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, {{claiming he}} developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him {{to move into the}} society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a cybernetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei. Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port to be handed over to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E

5|$|A third ship, the Manantico also {{crashed into}} shore {{due to a}} {{combination}} of the storm and human error in which the captain confused Cape Henry with Cape Charles after spotting another schooner. The Manantico was also where the two deaths associated with the storm occurred. The first was when a cook on the ship was crushed to death by the cargo of lumber being hauled by the ship. The ship was then pushed towards a sand bar. The captain, who had stayed high on the starboard side for safety, began climbing down to slip the ship cables, but the ship made a sudden stop. This flung the captain into the water, and he drowned. Both bodies were found after the storm and were very disfigured. The captain was sent to Middletown, Connecticut for interment while the body of the cook was buried on the beach. The final ship was the Harriet Thomas, which was the schooner spotted by the Manantico. After beaching, the crew managed to get a rope to shore where fishermen had tied the other end. The crew were able to climb ashore, although the captain had to be rescued via alternate means due to being too heavy for this method. The ship was <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a $7000 (1887 USD) loss. Although all four ships were beached, due to the loss of communications, only one wreck – that of the Mary D. Cranmer – was reported in the Norfolk Virginian newspaper. As a result, news of the two deaths from the Manantico were initially unreported.|$|E
25|$|The Norton Bridge rail {{crash in}} 2003, saw an {{intermodal}} train hauled by nos. 86631 and 86611, collide with {{the rear of}} another stationary freight train. The force of the impact broke the leading locomotive in half, although the driver was not killed. Both locomotives were <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> uneconomical to repair.|$|E
25|$|Asturias was <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a {{constructive}} total loss. On 30 May 1944 her ownership {{was transferred to}} the Ministry of War Transport. She was towed to Gibraltar where she received temporary repairs. By the time these were completed the war had ended. Asturias was towed to Belfast for permanent repairs and conversion back into a civilian passenger liner.|$|E

In 2001, Avon adopted new provisions and as a result, all prior periods were restated to reflect shipping and handling fees.|$|R
5000|$|The issues {{leading to}} {{the removal of the}} Dockers stemmed from the extravagant {{expenses}} they presented to the company, including the show cars made available for Lady Docker's personal use, a £5,000 gold and mink ensemble that Lady Docker wore at the 1956 Paris Motor Show that she tried to <b>write</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a business expense as she [...] "was only acting as a model" [...] at the show, and Glandyfi Castle, bought with £12,500 of BSA's money and refurbished for £25,000, again with company money.|$|R

Four more died en route. Finally arriving in New Orleans late in 1848, the Texas pioneers were met by several hundred colonization enthusiasts from France, who had been slowly congregating in that city. Their mood was grim.|$|E
25|$|With one {{battalion}} <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> ineffective, and {{two others}} having fled battle, somehow the Royalists clung to PS 22. In mid-December, they reinforced the site with a RLA battalion that arrived just as the communists launched a three-battalion attack. Despite being subjected to a vicious crossfire, the communists managed to overrun one outpost before withdrawing under heavy tactical air and artillery bombardment. Their casualties were estimated at 200 killed. Royalist casualties were 25 dead, 126 wounded or missing in action.|$|E
25|$|Despite being <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> underdogs {{before the}} Australian tour began, England drew the one-day {{international}} series against Australia, two all, and retained the Ashes with a six wicket {{victory in the}} one-off test match at Bowral. Isa Guha took nine wickets in the test match, and won the player of the match award, while long serving middle order batsman, Claire Taylor scored two gritty fifties. Captain Charlotte Edwards hit the winning runs, as she had at the Sydney Cricket Ground in her 100th one day international.|$|E

Will you allow me to hand you Sir Junius's subscription--to be entered in his name, if you please?" [...] And I passed him the cheque, which was drawn to myself or bearer.|$|R
25|$|Hillary Clinton managed {{an upset}} win over Barack Obama in New Hampshire, despite polls showing {{her as much}} as 13 points behind {{in the run-up to the}} vote. The win helped Clinton get back some of the {{momentum}} she lost the week before when Obama carried the Iowa caucuses—though Obama did eventually win the Democratic nomination. John McCain won the Republican primary, sparking an unexpected comeback for the senator whose long-shot campaign had been <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a lost cause months before. He went on to win the GOP nomination.|$|E
25|$|Martin later {{announced}} that he would leave the show for the second and last time near the end of Season 18 to pursue other endeavors, and Detective Green was <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> resigning from the force due to burnout. He was replaced by Anthony Anderson as Detective Kevin Bernard. In 2010, Merkerson {{announced that}} she would leave the show at the end of Season 20, with Lieutenant Van Buren given a season-long story arc involving her battling cervical cancer. However, the cancellation of the show rendered this moot.|$|E
25|$|All {{guests and}} the six crew members were safe.

During the next several weeks, the grounded vessel was an amusement for the local residents who drove north of downtown of Santa Monica to observe the wreckage.|$|E

Downstairs, Elizabeth and Tristan Duffy (Finn Wittrock) head out costumed for the evening. They pass on a message for Will Drake (Cheyenne Jackson) that he is invited to join them for a party. Tristan and Elizabeth notice that Iris is nervous and smells different, which she <b>writes</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> Halloween stress.|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} year, Harmon {{left the}} show after three seasons (with Abbie Carmichael <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> being {{called on to}} serve the U.S. Attorney's office) {{and was replaced by}} Elisabeth Röhm as Assistant District Attorney Serena Southerlyn. The year after that, Wiest left the show after two seasons and was replaced by retiring U.S. Senator Fred Thompson as District Attorney Arthur Branch, whose character was conceived of as being much more right-leaning than his predecessors in the DA's office, and was a direct reaction to the September 11 attacks. No mention was made on the show of what happened to Nora Lewin, though producers said her character was only supposed to be an interim DA.|$|E
25|$|RCA marketed a Spectra 70 {{computer}} {{line that}} was hardware, but not software, compatible with IBM's System/360 series. It also produced the RCA Series, which competed against the IBM System/370. This technology was leased to the English Electric company, which {{used it for}} their System 4 series, which were essentially RCA Spectra 70 clones. RCA's TSOS operating system was the first mainframe, demand paging, virtual memory operating system on the market. Despite significant investment, in 1971 RCA only had a 4% market share, and {{it was estimated that}} it would cost $500 million {{over the next five years}} to remain competitive with the IBM/370 series. On September 17, 1971 the RCA Board of Directors announced its decision to close its computer systems division (RCA-CSD), which would be <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a $490 million company loss. Sperry Rand's UNIVAC division took over the RCA base in January 1972.|$|E

5000|$|The Prime Minister responded on 16 August that he {{was always}} willing {{to talk with the}} Leader of the Opposition, but that all {{preconditions}} must be dropped. Chaudhry's demands that the bill be withdrawn until a consensus version could be produced, and that it should be negotiated through the venue of the Tanaloa talks - which he <b>wrote</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "failure" [...] - were unacceptable to him. [...] "Now this is not a trade union.

5000|$|Reuben and Polly begin dating, {{with her}} {{introducing}} him to activities he once <b>wrote</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> [...] "too risky", such as eating at a Moroccan restaurant and salsa dancing, which culminates with the pair enthusiastically having sex together, with Reuben shouting [...] "50" [...] as he orgasms. The contrast between their two personalities {{is a source}} of comedy throughout the film until Lisa returns and tells him she wants to reconcile their relationship. Meanwhile, Sandy, a self-centered, former teen idol, is trying to make a comeback by having a documentary filmed about his starring role as Judas in an amateur production of Jesus Christ Superstar.|$|R
50|$|Ajami {{retained}} a positive {{view of the}} war three years later. In a 2006 book on the invasion and its aftermath, he {{described it as a}} noble effort, and argued that despite many unhappy consequences, it was too soon to <b>write</b> it <b>off</b> <b>as</b> a failure.|$|R
500|$|When {{ending the}} second season, the {{producers}} and crew {{thought it would}} be the last; Fox executives admitted that the decision to renew the series was [...] "down to the wire". However, to their surprise Millennium was renewed for a third season. Many of the cliffhanger plot threads from the season finale were <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> the hallucinations of Frank Black. When creating the third season, the writers {{wanted to go back to}} the standalone storytelling format used in the first season; to do so they had Frank join the FBI and receive a new [...] "skeptical" [...] partner with whom he could work.|$|E
500|$|The French {{destroyer}} Jaguar was a [...] (contre-torpilleur) {{built for}} the French Navy during the 1920s.

The ship was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of the World War II in September 1939 until she was badly damaged during a collision in January 1940. Five months later, after her repairs were completed, she was committed to the English Channel after the Battle of France began in May 1940. Jaguar was torpedoed by German E-boats on 23 May and had to beach herself; her wreck was <b>written</b> <b>off</b> <b>as</b> unrepairable.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Patrick Duffy {{announced}} his intentions {{to leave the}} show which left Pamela and Bobby permanently disconnected from each other. When Duffy initially left Dallas in 1985, {{it was assumed that}} Pamela and Bobby's relationship had finally ended after a brief reconciliation during that season. However, the actor returned to the show the following season after the ratings began to fall. Leonard Katzman said, [...] "Without Bobby we lost the white knight to J.R. and the Romeo to Victoria Principal's Juliet. With Patrick back we can return to the family drama that made the show."
