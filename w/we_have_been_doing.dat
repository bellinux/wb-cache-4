I am fiscally conservative: I {{think we need}} to reduce the deficit and get entitlement spending under control. I am pro-environment: I think that climate change is a major threat that we need to address. I am pro-free trade: I think we should be concluding new trade treaties rather than pulling out of old ones. I am strong on defense: I {{think we need to}} beef up our military to cope with multiple enemies. And I am very much in favor of America acting as a world leader: I believe it is in our own self-interest to promote and defend freedom and free markets as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> {{in one form or another}} since at least 1898." ...|$|E

She {{reported}} that {{institutions of higher}} learning are taking a fresh look at religion and spirituality and argued that it provides Adventist Education [...] "with multiple opportunities to showcase what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> so very well for so many years." [...] She introduced her theoretical framework to meet these opportunities, titled the Adventist Advantage. The framework consists of seven main points: meaning and purpose found by a connection with Christ as our personal savior; health, wellness, and a wholesome lifestyle; education, caring about {{the life of the mind}} and lifelong learning; ethics and morals; generous service; diversity; and stewardship of the earth, which is tied to the Sabbath.|$|E

2500|$|Massachusetts has {{included}} sexual orientation in its anti-discrimination statute since 1989, and it legalized same-sex marriage beginning May 17, 2004. Between about 1985 and 1995, Catholic Charities of Boston, which accepted state funds {{in support of}} its adoption services program, placed 13 children with gay couples out of 720 adoptions. Catholic Charities President Rev. J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: [...] "If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't. We have to balance various goods." [...] In December 2005, the lay-dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions. On March 10, 2006, after unsuccessfully seeking help from Governor Mitt Romney in obtaining an exemption from the state's anti-discrimination statute, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexual couples. Hehir said [...] "This is a difficult and sad day for Catholic Charities. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> adoptions for more than 100 years." ...|$|E

Human Robot Interaction is the research field that aims at studying how robots can interact with humans in the most natural way. In this work we will present preliminary studies that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in this direction, focusing on Natural Language based interaction, with {{particular attention to the}} grounding problem. In particular, we will study how Statistical Machine Learning techniques can be applied to Natural Language as it is used to interact with robots. Moreover, we will also investigate how this approach can be integrated in such complex systems. ...|$|R
