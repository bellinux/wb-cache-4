Two of its remaining possessions were Puerto Rico and Cuba, {{both of which were}} demanding more autonomy and had pro-independence movements.

5|$|Green {{today is}} not {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States with love and sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> yet married.|$|E

50|$|Milne {{created the}} story to contain believable, {{three-dimensional}} characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children.
