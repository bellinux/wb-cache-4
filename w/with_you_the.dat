Instead, the game was released in North America and Europe under the name The World Ends <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>The</b> game was officially announced on September 13, 2006 by Square Enix, and premiered at the 2006 Tokyo Game Show two weeks later. On December 5, 2007, Square Enix announced that the game would be released for Europe and Australia in April 2008, while a similar announcement was made for a North American release on December 17, 2007.|$|E

500|$|Kingdom Hearts χ was co-directed by Tetsuya Nomura, {{one of the}} series' creators, and Tatsuya Kando, who had {{previous}} directed Nintendo DS game The World Ends <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>The</b> game's {{music was}} composed by Yoko Shimomura, {{a regular contributor to}} the series' music. The game was co-developed by Square Enix and Japanese studio Success Corporation. Square Enix originally handled the planning and design itself, but due to their developers inexperience with creating browser games, development was transferred to the Success Corporation, who were familiar with the process. Despite multiplayer elements being included, the game was [...] "fundamentally single-player", as with most other entries in the series. Chirithy, the player characters' companion, was designed around the concept of a supportive yet unobtrusive guide. Nomura based the characters design on the Scottish Fold domestic cat.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>the</b> three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It was like that when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E
500|$|London-based studio Union {{created the}} film's visual effects. According to editor Elliot Graham, {{extensive}} film editing took place even before principal photography was completed. During the one-week rehearsal {{that took place}} in between production {{for each of the three}} acts (shot in chronological order), Graham would work on the existing footage and receive ongoing feedback from Boyle in the editing room. In an interview with Variety, Graham said a particular challenge for him was balancing the shot frequency and providing enough [...] "visual interventions" [...] to control for Sorkin's dialogue-heavy screenplay. He described approaching each scene as [...] "a series of fight sequences". Michael Fassbender provided multiple versions of his performance as Jobs, which Graham and Boyle would then choose from during post-production. Graham also said: [...] "Danny would be involved a lot but also take time away. He would say 'if I'm <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>the</b> whole time, we'll always have the same opinions because we're on the exact same journey.'" ...|$|E

500|$|A Moment <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> <b>the</b> group's first feature-length film, premiered on June 3, 2006, {{at their}} alma mater.

The film revolves around two neighbors who share similar romantic situations, {{in which one}} person in each relationship cannot {{let go of his}} or her past. [...] "A Moment with You" [...] was promoted through a screening tour at high schools and universities around the United States and Canada. In a review for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's student newspaper The Tech, Tina Ro wrote, [...] "Despite its large Asian fan base, Wongfu's [...] movie has a cast of equal numbers of Asians and Caucasians. Furthermore, all the characters were shaped by their own characteristics rather than by their race, a refreshing concept for a movie." [...] According to The Daily Texans Katherine Fan, A Moment with You featured a [...] "more mature, introspective mood than their previous work." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s, Reubens kept a low profile, {{dedicating}} {{himself to}} writing and collecting {{a variety of}} things, [...] "everything from fake food, to lamps", although he did do some dubbing and took small parts in films such as 1992's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Tim Burton's Batman Returns (Reubens portrayed the Penguin's father) and 1996's Matilda and Dunston Checks In. In 1993, he voiced for a character in another one of Burton's productions, The Nightmare Before Christmas. (Reubens would later voice Lock for the video game [...] in 2004.) During the mid-1990s, Reubens played a recurring role on the TV series Murphy Brown. The role earned him positive reviews and his first and only non-Pee-wee Emmy nomination, for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. He appeared six times on the show between 1995 and 1997. Afterward, Reubens began working on an NBC pilot entitled Meet the Muckles, a show that {{would be based on}} You Can't Take It <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>The</b> project got stuck in development hell, and was later dropped when Reubens' ideas grew too elaborate and expensive, although Philip Rosenthal blamed NBC's negative response on Reubens being on a [...] "blacklist".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} soundtrack for Type-0 by Takeharu Ishimoto, {{who also}} composed {{the music for}} , [...] and The World Ends with You. Ishimoto rearranged, remixed and re-recorded the soundtrack for Type-0 HD. This {{was due to the}} original soundtrack was composed within the limits of PSP hardware, making it unsuitable for the new console release. Because of a restricted budget, he did the bulk of the work himself. One of the changes he made was making the choral sound more prominent. In addition, he composed a new battle theme and recorded an English version of [...] "Colorful - Falling in Love", the track for Type-0s alternate ending. The lyrics were translated by SAWA, a singer who had worked on The World Ends <b>with</b> <b>You.</b> <b>The</b> English version was made for the overseas version of the game, but was included in the remastered soundtrack's commercial release. Type-0s original theme song, [...] "Zero" [...] by Japanese rock band Bump of Chicken, was used again for Type-0 HD. While a translated version was considered for the localization, the team, with permission from the band, decided to use the original song and add subtitles for the song lyrics.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} created by the same {{development}} team that worked on Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, then part of Square Enix's 1st Production Department. Since it contained members who worked for The World Ends <b>with</b> <b>You,</b> <b>the</b> group decided to use characters from said game in replacement of Final Fantasy characters. The decision to make a Kingdom Hearts game for the Nintendo 3DS was due to the positive impression the Square Enix staff had when viewing the console's quality. The console inspired Nomura to make the Dive Mode function where the character moves to different worlds without the use of a vehicle, while the Flowmotion was thought prior to deciding which console use. The game's title was used to reference its various themes, with [...] "Dream" [...] referencing the storyline, [...] "Drop" [...] for the gameplay style, and [...] "Distance" [...] referring to the main characters' interaction, and, while unintentionally, the system's autostereoscopic 3D effect. Although Tetsuya Nomura admitted the English used was not grammatically correct, the team still decided to use it based on the way it sounded. Development was notably shorter than the ones from previous Kingdom Hearts games. However, co-director Tai Yasue emphasized how the finished product resembled Kingdom Hearts II and Birth by Sleep but improved.|$|E
500|$|Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots added {{four new}} [...] "Conquer the World" [...] {{campaign}}s: Alexander the Great, Napoleon, the New World, and the Cold War. The Alexander the Great campaign allows the player to choose {{whether or not}} to raze or incorporate conquered territories. A player's decision to raze may cause the rest of the enemies to either fight harder, or question their casus belli and ally <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> Napoleon campaign challenges the player to conquer Europe in a limited amount of time, with diplomacy, alliances, conquest, and bribing with land. Players must have intuitive leadership in this campaign because faulty decisions by the player can force themselves, that is to say, Napoleon, into exile. The New World campaign allows the player to choose either the Americans, a European power, or a Native American tribe. If the player chooses to lead the Americans, they must pay taxes to Great Britain, until they declare independence. The map of a battle incorporates the region's environment, for example large forests in the Pacific Northwest. The Cold War introduces the ability to fire nuclear missiles in the main map and initiate espionage missions. Armies can also move anywhere in their nation's territory without using up a turn. Rise of Nations: Thrones and Patriots campaigns now offer more turn-based strategy into the game rather than real-time strategy being the only gameplay aspect.|$|E
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side <b>with</b> <b>you.</b> <b>The</b> deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
