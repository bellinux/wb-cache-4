5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good ending {{and a bad}} ending. The good ending can only be {{achieved}} by completing secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a sorrowful child's soul. This ending is thought {{to imply that the}} souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} seemingly cannibalistic murders in New Jersey. The two later come across <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an evolutionary relict which may have inspired tales of the Jersey Devil.|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly from the trees. The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat. Additionally, American alligators engage in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cooperative hunting.|$|E

5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|Only {{one species}} of Coelurus, the type species C. fragilis, is still {{recognized}} as valid today, although six other {{species have been}} named over the years. C. agilis, as discussed, was named by Marsh in 1884 for {{what turned out to}} be additional parts of the skeleton of C. fragilis. Cope's C. bauri and C. longicollis, named in 1887 from Late Triassic fossils from New Mexico, were transferred by Cope in 1889 to his new genus Coelophysis. C. daviesi was named by Richard Lydekker in 1888 for Harry Seeley's Thecospondylus daviesi, a neck vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of England, but this species was later transferred to its own genus, Thecocoelurus. C. gracilis, another Early Cretaceous species, was also named in 1888. It was coined by Marsh for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an assortment of limb remains, but Gilmore could only find a single claw when he reviewed the species in 1920. This species has been proposed as outside Coelurus since the 1920s (when Gilmore assigned it to Chirostenotes), and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of Coelurus in recent reviews. Finally, during the period when Ornitholestes was thought to be the same as Coelurus, its type species was recognized as distinct by Steel, as C. hermanni.|$|E
5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving {{within sight of the}} Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E

5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a normal high school, but in fact all {{took place in the}} school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by {{the other members of the}} Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E

25|$|The Gandharan Buddhist {{texts are}} both the {{earliest}} Buddhist {{as well as}} Asian manuscripts discovered so far. Most are written on birch bark and were found in labelled clay pots.

25|$|Most of the seen Southern Lands {{seem to be}} mountainous, rocky and barren, though <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a more {{tropical}} forested {{nation and}} a colder region have briefly been seen. The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as China and India, {{the most prominent of}} which was Azure City, which greatly resembled feudal Japan (though a few Chinese elements were present). Four separate areas in the South besides Azure city are briefly shown.|$|E
25|$|In {{a sudden}} return to <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Lee's reality, two police officers, Hauser and O'Brien, {{catch up with}} Lee, who kills both of them. Lee then goes out to a street phone booth and calls the Narcotics Squad, saying he wants to speak to O'Brien. A Lieutenant Gonzales {{on the other end}} of the line claims there's no one in their records called O'Brien. When Lee asks for Hauser instead, the reply is identical; Lee hangs up, and goes on the run once again. The book then becomes {{increasingly}} disjointed and impressionistic, and finally simply stops.|$|E
25|$|The main {{respiratory}} {{organs of}} Eurypterus were <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> book gills, located in branchial chambers within the {{segments of the}} mesosoma. They {{may have been used}} for underwater respiration. They are composed of several layers of thin tissue stacked {{in such a way as}} to resemble the pages of a book, hence the name. In addition, they also possessed five pairs of oval-shaped areas covered with microscopic projections on the ceiling of the second branchial chambers within the mesosoma, immediately below the gill tracts. These areas are known as Kiemenplatten (or gill-tracts, though the former term is preferred). They are unique to eurypterids.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Agathocles issued an {{intriguing}} range of bilingual coinage, displaying <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Buddhist {{as well as}} Hindu symbolism. The coins, manufactured according to the Indian standard, using either Brahmi, Greek or Kharoshthi (a first in the Greek world), and displaying symbols of the various faiths in India, tend to indicate a considerable willingness to accommodate local languages and beliefs, to an extent unseen in subsequent Indo-Greek kings. They may be indicative of the considerable efforts of the first Indo-Greek kings to secure support from Indian populations and avoid being perceived as invaders, efforts which may have subsided once the Indo-Greek kingdoms were more securely in place.|$|E
25|$|Énée then rushes {{on to tell}} of the devouring of {{the priest}} Laocoön by a sea serpent, after he had warned the Trojans to burn the horse. Énée {{interpret}}s this {{as a sign of}} the goddess Athene's anger at the sacrilege. Against Cassandre's futile protests, Priam orders the horse to be brought within the city of Troy and placed next to the temple of Pallas Athene. There is a sound of <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the clashing of arms from within the horse, but the Trojans, in their delusion, interpret it as a happy omen. Cassandre has watched the procession in despair, and as the act ends, resigns herself to death beneath the walls of Troy.|$|E
25|$|As stated before, most of {{the story}} is {{reported}} by direct speech of the women and Solomon, with a few sentences and utterance verbs by the narrator. The dialogues move the plot forward. The women's contradictory testimonies create the initial conflict necessary to build up the dramatic tension. The king's request to bring him a sword enhances the tension, as the reader wonders why it is needed. The story comes to its climax with the shocking royal order to cut the boy, which for a moment casts doubt on the king's judgment. But <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the verdict {{turns out to be a}} clever trick which achieves its goal, and results in the recognition of the true mother and the resolution.|$|E
