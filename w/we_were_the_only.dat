500|$|By 1944 {{the threat}} of {{invasion}} had abated and the fort was {{handed over to the}} Home Guard's No. 356 Coast Battery detachment. Its complement at this time was a captain, two lieutenants and 103 other ranks. They were supplemented by a detachment of Wrens who operated a degaussing range established at Coalhouse Fort in 1943 under the name of HMS St Clement. Outbound ships passed over submerged sensors which detected whether the steel in their hulls had been demagnetised to a sufficient extent to make them undetectable by German magnetic mines. If they were detected, they would be recalled for further degaussing. As one of the Wrens later recalled, they found themselves [...] "surrounded by a wonderful array of young men, soldiers and marines of all ranks – and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> girls in sight." ...|$|E

Dash remembered they would [...] "be {{in a room full of}} people talking to each other and it felt like everyone was listening but it would be just us. It would be like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> ones in the room". Dash always felt their time together was essential and Aaliyah was the person he was interested in being with, which is why, as he claimed, they had begun speaking about engagement. The relationship was mentioned in the lyrics of Jay-Z's remix to her song [...] "Miss You", released after her death.|$|E

They {{are one of the few}} pair teams in history to successfully complete a quadruple twist lift in international competition. [...] They landed the difficult element with ease at the 1987 World Championships. They also completed the element at the 1987 European Championships, but due to a problem with Grinkov's boot strap and a misunderstanding about the rules (the referee signaled them to stop, going so far as to turn off their music but they continued skating), they were disqualified from that event. They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, [...] making the added physical stress unnecessary. [...] Katia states in her book, [...] "My Sergei: A Love Story" [...] that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team's Doctors: [...] "That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist, in which Sergei threw me in the air, I did a split, then closed my legs and made four turns before he caught me. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> pair to do this quadruple element, and it was very exhausting—more exhausting than difficult, really.

40|$|A London brewery {{has started}} {{producing}} beer brewed from Rwandan coffee beans.

Meantime the Brewery uses fair trade Arabica coffee beans grown by the Abuhuzamugambi Cooperative in Butare Province. Brewery owner Alastair Hook also tried beans from other coffee-producing countries before settling on Rwandan coffee for his unusual brew. The brewer blind-tested coffee from Brazil and Colombia, but was not convinced that their taste was right for his coffee beer. It was not until he tried the chocolate and vanilla flavour of the Rwandan coffee that he found the silky, velvety character that he wanted.
