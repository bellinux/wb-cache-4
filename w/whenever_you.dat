500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] is {{a country}} pop song with a length of four minutes and 22 seconds. The song, written solely by Swift, is in the key of D minor with Swift's vocals {{spanning}} two octaves, from F3 to C5. Johnathan Keefe claimed that [...] "the a capella [...] "Drop everything now" [...] exclamation simply commands attention, with the desperation in Swift’s call-to-action answering the common criticisms that her work is sexless and chaste." [...] Bobby Peacock stated that [...] "I wouldn't mind if the banjo from the 2007 version were left in, but its omission is [...] hardly make-or-break. Perhaps my biggest {{problem is that the}} song's chorus undermines itself in the second half – it starts out emphatic [...] and anthemic as usual, but there's just no [...] "oomph" [...] on the hook. It almost feels as if she's trailing off mid-sentence." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 stated [...] ""Sparks Fly" [...] centers around a simple but effective hook—"I see sparks fly <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> smile"—that further cements Swift’s reputation as one the craftiest songwriters in popular music." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country commented on the chorus of the song stating, [...] "Though Swift implies that this particular crush is a [...] "bad idea," [...] she still insists that they should try to make it work in the chorus: [...] "Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain / Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain / ‘Cause I see sparks fly / <b>Whenever</b> <b>you</b> smile," [...] she sings insistently." ...|$|E

He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character."

500|$|For an offer, such as [...] "you may use my car <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> like", the {{consequence}} of compliance [...] "represents a situation which is preferred to the norm". Noncompliance, that is, not taking up the offer {{of the use of}} the car, is identical to the norm, and so neither more nor less preferable. Threats, on the other hand, are characterised by compliance that leads to an outcome less preferable to the norm, with noncompliance leading to an outcome less desirable still. For instance, if someone is threatened with [...] "your money or your life", compliance would lead to them losing their money, while noncompliance would lead to them losing their life. Both are less desirable than the norm (that is, not being threatened at all), but, for the subject of the threat, losing money is more desirable than being killed. A throffer is a third kind of intervention. It differs from both a threat and an offer, as compliance is preferable to the norm, while noncompliance is less preferable than the norm.|$|E

Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief recording time lent the record [...] "a feeling that, <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> get these guys in the same room, this music [...] just comes tearing out".|$|E

500|$|Animal rights {{organization}} PETA accused the film's producers of using animals {{that had previously}} been abused. Two chimpanzees who appear in the movie, Cody and Sable, were surrendered by their owner to settle a lawsuit that documented allegations of beatings and mistreatment. The film's director, Tom Shadyac, said of PETA's criticisms [...] "They're not wrong. There's a certain amount of hypocrisy <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> work with animals, even to show, which we hope we're showing, that respect of all of God's creation...I don't know. I respect their criticism." [...] PETA was also critical of Birds & Animals Unlimited, the primary animal supplier to the film, for alleged serious and continuing violations of the U.S. Animal Welfare Act, including failure to comply with veterinary care requirements and failure to provide shelter from heat and sunlight, which PETA details and claims it can document. A Universal Studios spokesperson declared: [...] "The live animals used in the filming of Evan Almighty were supplemented by a great number of computer-generated animals, {{but it would have been}} impossible to depend on CGI exclusively as some key scenes in the film demonstrate the need for peaceful and productive co-existence between man and animals. One of the most prominent, inescapable messages of the film is the responsibility that humans have to protect and care for animals." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} [...] "Airbag" [...] was {{inspired}} by the music of DJ Shadow and is underpinned by an electronic drum beat programmed from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a digital sampler and edited it with a Macintosh computer, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline in [...] "Airbag" [...] stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s dub. The song's references to automobile accidents and reincarnation were inspired by a magazine article titled [...] "An Airbag Saved My Life" [...] and The Tibetan Book of the Dead. Yorke wrote [...] "Airbag" [...] about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and [...] "the idea that <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> go out on the road you could be killed." [...] The BBC wrote of the influence of J. G. Ballard, especially his 1973 novel Crash on the song's lyrical content. Music journalist Tim Footman notes the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate the [...] "key paradox" [...] of the album: [...] "the musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact.... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{critical}} acclaim, Homicide: Life on the Street {{suffered from}} poor ratings throughout its , prompting NBC to consider taking {{it off the}} air. After a nine-episode , the network approved four more episodes for the show's [...] as a trial run to determine whether to continue or cancel the show. The script for [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was completed before the first season ended, but NBC executives asked for several refinements [...] including less involved plots and fewer camera movements [...] before approving a second season. In an attempt to appease the network and improve ratings, executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana sought to make subtle changes to give the show a stronger mainstream appeal, while aiming not to compromise its integrity or originality. With [...] "Bop Gun", the producers slightly toned down the bleak visual style and hand-held photography motif. It is also the first episode {{to focus on a}} single story, rather than multiple subplots, which Fontana felt allowed the writers to tell the main story better. Fontana said of the changes to the series, [...] "We were experimenting with our first nine episodes. <b>Whenever</b> <b>you</b> try something new, you tend {{to err on the side}} of breaking ground. But we'd rather have more people watching, so the colors and lighting are slightly brighter, and the camera movements are not as jarring." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] marked the first episode with Jean de Segonzac as director of photography. The first scene, which depicts the moments immediately before the shooting, juxtaposes shots of the Ellison family admiring the tourist attractions of Baltimore with shots of their shooters playing basketball before following the family. The photography depicts the different sides of Baltimore by presenting the Ellison family shots like a cheerful tourist advertisement, with the other shots presenting a grittier image of the city.|$|E

Disney bought the rights to the novel in April 2007. Rossio stated that he and Elliot had considered using Blackbeard and the Fountain of Youth in the story before reading the book, [...] "but <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> say those words, Powers' novel comes to mind. There was no way we could work in that field without going into territory Tim had explored." [...] However, they denied {{that it would be a}} straight version of the novel: [...] "Blackbeard came from the book, and in the book there is a daughter character, too. But Jack Sparrow is not in the book, nor is Barbossa. So I wouldn't call this an adaptation." [...] Rossio declared the script was written to be a standalone film, [...] "kind of a James Bond sort of thing", instead of the [...] "designed to be a trilogy" [...] structure of the previous installments. They hoped to [...] "design a story that would support new characters," [...] as characters such as Will Turner would not return. Bruckheimer added that there was a decision to [...] "streamline the story a little bit, make it a little simpler and not have as many characters to follow", as the number of characters and subplots in At World's End caused the film to have an unwieldy length. The duo decided to employ another sea myth alluded in the previous episodes: mermaids, which are briefly referenced in the book. The mermaids' role expanded in the script, which included a vast attack sequence.|$|E
500|$|When bowling, Trumble {{made the}} most of his height, {{bringing}} the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as [...] "sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird". He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as Stanley Jackson, who said, [...] "You old devil. You get me caught-and-bowled <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later." [...] He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer [...] away five times out of six. Johnnie Moyes named him as an [...] "immortal of the art" [...] who succeeded by [...] "attacking the batsman's strength". W. G. Grace called him [...] "the best bowler Australia has sent us". While Trumble was able to score 1,183runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, [...] fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and {{he was the first to}} take 20catches in an Australian season. English cricketer Johnny Douglas said, [...] "Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush." [...] He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to [...] "snatch" [...] at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.|$|E
500|$|Real estate magnate Donald Trump, head of The Trump Organization since 1971, first {{dabbled in}} presidential {{politics}} in the early summer of 1987. [...] Republican political organizer Mike Dunbar, unimpressed with the candidates for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, founded the [...] "Draft Trump for President" [...] organization. [...] Believing Trump had {{the makings of a}} president, Dunbar pitched Trump the idea of speaking at an event for Republican candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire. [...] According to Dunbar in a later interview, Trump was receptive to this idea. [...] Then a registered Democrat, Trump officially changed his registration to Republican in July 1987. [...] Speculation that he would actually run for president intensified two months later, when he purchased $94,801 worth of full-page advertisements in The New York Times, Boston Globe, and The Washington Post with the heading [...] "There’s nothing wrong with America’s Foreign Defense Policy that a little backbone can’t cure." [...] The advertisements reflected Trump's concerns that Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait were taking advantage of American money and protection without providing any benefit to the United States. [...] The next month, as Dunbar had proposed, Trump appeared at a Rotary Club luncheon in New Hampshire. [...] There, he delivered what The New York Times described as an [...] "impassioned speech," [...] in which he expressed concern about the United States being [...] "pushed around" [...] by its allies and proposed that [...] "these countries that are ripping us off pay off the $200 billion deficit." [...] In the audience, college students held placards reading [...] "Trump for President." [...] Nevertheless, Trump proclaimed, [...] "I'm not here because I'm running for President. I'm here because I'm tired of our country being kicked around and I want to get my ideas across." [...] Later, Trump appeared on the Phil Donahue Show. [...] After the appearance, he received a letter from former President Richard Nixon in which Nixon explained that his wife Pat, [...] "an expert on politics," [...] had seen Trump on the show and [...] "predicts that <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> decide to run for office you will be a winner!"
