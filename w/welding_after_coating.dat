The magnetic properties, particle size <b>after</b> <b>coating,</b> Curie temperature and its biocompatibility are important parameters for the synthesis of materials. In the present communication cobalt ferrite nanoparticles have been synthesized using co-precipitation method and coated with sodium alginate.

The SEM micrographs have been used to confirm the particle size which is found to be 45 nm before coating and 78 nm <b>after</b> <b>coating.</b> The saturation magnetization obtained using the hysteresis data for the uncoated cobalt ferrite sample is 19. 8 emu/gm while for the coated sample it reduces to 10. 2 emu/gm.

40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{relieving}} residual stresses is {{post weld heat}} treatment (PWHT). PWHT is used in cases where machining of welded components and castings with high residual stresses may result in undesired distortions. The beneficial influence of PWHT on fatigue is significant at negative R- values and low stress ranges. Compared to PWHT, vibrational stress relief (VSF) has the potention for significant advantages: reduction of cost, absence of scale, no metallurgical consequences etc. The aim of the present research was to determine the effectiveness of VSR compared to PWHT, especially for welded structures with repaired welds. In the investigations, several test series were carried out, where welded components indifferent fabrication states (as <b>welded,</b> vibrated <b>after</b> <b>welding,</b> heat treated <b>after</b> <b>welding</b> and preloaded <b>after</b> <b>welding),</b> were submitted to fatigue loading. It is found that due to the absence of sound and common accepted guidelines and quality criteria, the success of vibrational stress relief is quite uncertain. Furthermore, it is found that in fatigue loading, VSR probably has no significant beneficial effect. During the first load cycles, about the same "stress relief" occurs as during VSR. Only in case of very low stresses and low R-ratios, VSR may have any positive effect on the fatigue life of welded structures...|$|R
