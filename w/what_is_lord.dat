50|$|It is {{possible}} that the first Newcomen engine was in Cornwall. Its location is uncertain, but it is known that one was in operation at Wheal Vor mine in 1715. The earliest examples for which reliable records exist were two engines in the Black Country, of which the more famous was that erected in 1712 at the Conygree Coalworks near Dudley, This is generally accepted as the first successful Newcomen engine, but it may have been preceded by one built {{a mile and a half}} east of Wolverhampton. Both these were used by Newcomen and his partner John Calley to pump out water-filled coal mines. A working replica can today be seen at the nearby Black Country Living Museum, which stands on another part of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>Lord</b> Dudley's Conygree Park.|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} QRC {{goes back to}} the Stuart Grammar School, at the corner of Duke and Edward Street, whose Principal was Edward Stuart.

5000|$|The Westminster Shorter Catechism {{summarizes}} the teaching: Q. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> the <b>Lord's</b> supper?A.

50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the stairs}} leading from the courtyard, any medieval visitor would have found {{themselves}} in a passageway that, on the left, led into the Great Hall behind a wooden screen with arched openings. This room was the formal heart of the castle, where the whole household would meet for feasts and special occasions. The walls were covered in rich fabrics that concealed machinery that controlled the two portcullises. Matthew Arundell refurbished the Great Hall in the 1570s. A new musicians' gallery was built above the wooden entrance screen. The fireplace was reshaped and new wooden panels were put in place of the wall hangings and banners. The doorway leading from the Great Hall into the Lobby was also redesigned at this point of time. However, he left untouched the tall windows and the old wooden roof, and it is thought that he did this to preserve <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>Lord</b> Lovell's great castle.|$|R

2500|$|Todd is {{probably}} correct {{in saying that}} Aphra Behn did not set out to protest slavery, but however tepid her feelings about slavery, {{there is no doubt}} about her feelings on the subject of natural kingship. The final words of the novel are a slight expiation of the narrator's guilt, but it is for the individual man she mourns and for the individual that she writes a tribute, and she lodges no protest over slavery itself. A natural king could not be enslaved, and, as in the play Behn wrote while in Surinam, The Young King, no land could prosper without a king. Her fictional Surinam is a headless body. Without a true and natural leader (a king) the feeble and corrupt men of position abuse their power. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> missing <b>was</b> <b>Lord</b> Willoughby, or the narrator's father: [...] a true lord. In the absence of such leadership, a true king, Oroonoko, is misjudged, mistreated, and killed.|$|R
5000|$|The site of <b>Lord's</b> Middle Ground <b>was</b> requisitioned by Parliament for the {{building}} of the Regent's Canal. Thomas Lord contacted the Eyre family, erstwhile owners of the ground, and persuaded them to lease to him another parcel of land in St John's Wood, about half a mile further north at a place called North Bank. This site had previously been a duckpond. In the winter of 1813-14, Lord again had his turf literally dug up and removed. He built a high perimeter fence, a tavern and a pavilion at <b>what</b> <b>is</b> now <b>Lord's</b> Cricket Ground (Lord's).|$|R
60|$|When in society, we {{are further}} {{informed}} by a lady quoted by Mr. Moore, {{he was in}} the habit of speaking of his wife with much respect and affection, as an illustrious lady, distinguished for her qualities of heart and understanding; saying that all the fault of their cruel separation lay with himself. Mr. Moore seems at times to be somewhat puzzled by these contradictory statements of his idol, and speculates not a little on <b>what</b> could <b>be</b> <b>Lord</b> Byron's object in using such language in public; mentally comparing it, we suppose, with the free handling which he gave to the same subject in his private correspondence.|$|R
