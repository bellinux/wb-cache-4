5|$|The Reckoning (1991) {{chronicles the}} reign of England's King Henry III in Penman's final volume of the series that began <b>with</b> <b>Here</b> Be Dragons. The {{conflict}} between the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd who is the grandson of Llewelyn the Great of Here Be Dragons, and England's King Henry III is one subplot. Additionally, Penman chronicles the life and character of Ellen, daughter of Simon de Montfort and niece to Henry III; her betrothal to Llewellyn (negotiated prior to de Montfort's death); and the conflict between Ellen and her cousin Edward, soon to become King Edward, who opposes the betrothal.|$|E

There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work attributed to Nestor the Chronicler, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, remind us of Herodotus, dry details alternating <b>with</b> <b>here</b> and there a picturesque incident; {{and many of these}} annals abound with the quaintest stories.|$|E

25|$|There is a {{tendency}} for inter-paradigm critiques {{to focus on a}} number of assumptions that are commonly associated with P, but which actually are common to Chomskyan generative linguistics as a whole. These include innateness, modularity, the poverty of the stimulus, language universals, binarity, etc. See for example, Connectionist, Functionalist and Cognitivist critiques. As another example, the linguist Larry Trask argues that the ergative case system of the Basque language is not a simple binary parameter, and that different languages can have different levels of ergativity. Also, some have argued using evidence from historical linguistics that grammar is an emergent property of language use. Language evolution theorist, Terrence Deacon notes that it is problematic to consider language structure as innate - that is, as having been subject to the forces of natural selection, because languages change much too quickly for natural selection to act upon them. There are many more critiques. There is debate about the validity of these arguments, but since these are not specific to P they will not be dealt <b>with</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

[...] Gravel said, [...] "Something is monitoring the planet, and they are monitoring it very cautiously, because we are a very warlike planet," [...] and, [...] "What we're faced <b>with</b> <b>here</b> is, in areas of the media, and the government too, an effort to marginalize and ridicule people who have specific knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{preliminary}} autopsy was performed, District of Columbia police announced {{that there was}} sufficient evidence to open a homicide investigation.

It's possible {{we will never know}} specifically how she died." [...] Arden found damage to her hyoid bone, suggesting possible strangulation, but did not deem it to be conclusive evidence of such a cause of death. On June 6, after the police completed their search, private investigators hired by the Levys found her shin bone with some twisted wire about [...] from the other remains.

[...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh <b>with</b> <b>here</b> and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding those you favor and those you don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from working}} on Veronica Mars, Bell starred in , reprising the role she {{played in the}} {{short-lived}} 2001 off-broadway musical. The musical was a spoof of the 1936 exploitation film of the same name. Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical debuted on the Showtime network on April 16, 2005. Also in April, Bell starred as Gracie in Fifty Pills, an entry for the Tribeca Film Festival. She appeared in a short independent film called The Receipt and the horror film Roman, which was directed by her The Crucible co-star Angela Bettis. Released on August 11, 2006, Pulse starred Bell as the lead Mattie. A remake of the Japanese horror film Kairo, the film grossed US$27.9 million worldwide,; however it garnered negative response from critics. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter commented, [...] "despite the starring presence of Kristen Bell, [...] young actress has far less interesting material to work <b>with</b> <b>here</b> than she does as [...] `Veronica Mars.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Similarly, The Illustrated London News {{concluded}} that the production was a success and that the plot, though slight, served as a good vehicle for Gilbert's [...] "caustic humour and quaint satire". It {{found that there was}} [...] "much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits.... Dr. Sullivan's music is as lively as the text to which it is set, <b>with</b> <b>here</b> and there a touch of sentimental expression... The piece is well performed throughout." [...] The Daily News, The Globe, The Times (which particularly praised Grossmith, Barrington and Everard) and The Standard concurred, the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting, which, it said, [...] "adds to the reality of the illusion". The Times also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a [...] "national musical stage" [...] with a libretto free from risqué French [...] "improprieties" [...] and without the [...] "aid" [...] of Italian and German musical models.|$|E

500|$|The music {{atmosphere}} of the 1970s was heavily influenced by its success and sexual content, as its sexual-explicitness bent creative barriers {{in the music industry}} and led to an increased popularity of sexual themes in music at the time. Music writer Rob Bowman later cited Let's Get It On as [...] "one of the most erotic recordings known to mankind." [...] The album's success helped spark a series of similarly styled releases by such smooth soul artists as Barry White (Can't Get Enough), Smokey Robinson (A Quiet Storm) and Earth, Wind & Fire (That's the Way of the World). The commercial success of such recording artists led to a change of trend from socially conscious aesthetics to more mainstream, sensually themed music. Gaye himself experienced subsequent success with his follow-up release I Want You (1976), featuring more sexually explicit lyrics and expanded use of vocal multi-tracking, and <b>with</b> <b>Here,</b> My Dear (1978), which he based entirely on his tumultuous marriage to Anna Gordy. In an interview with music author Michael Eric Dyson, hip hop artist Q-Tip discussed the album's influence and significance to its time period, stating: ...|$|E

Consequently, he should estimate the number of black ravens at 50, the number of black non-ravens at 25 and the number of non-black non-ravens at 25. By specifying these changes, this argument explicitly restricts the domain of [...] "All ravens are black" [...] to ravens.|$|E
