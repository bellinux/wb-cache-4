5|$|Kriosian {{ambassador}} Briam (Tim O'Connor) {{comes on}} board the Enterprise with some cargo, ready for a peace ceremony with the Valtian. As the ship heads to the rendezvous, they save two Ferengi from a failing ship. Despite security being assigned, the Ferengi enter the cargo bay and deactivate the stasis field on Briam's cargo, revealing a young Kriosian woman named Kamala (Famke Janssen). With the Ferengi secured, it is revealed that she is an empathic metamorph who can sense what males around her desire and react appropriately. She was being brought as an arranged marriage to the Valtian representative. Kamala is generating pheromones that can affect males around her, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was kept in stasis until the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|While at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Cruz {{represented}} Pfizer in {{a lawsuit}} brought {{by a group of}} public hospitals and community health centers who accused the drug manufacturer of overcharging. The Supreme Court eventually threw the case out. Shandong Linglong Rubber Company was found guilty of marketing versions of tires that were based on blueprints stolen by a former employee of a Florida businessman and ordered to pay $26 million to the Floridian. Cruz worked on the Chinese company's appellant brief. The appeals court denied the appeal and affirmed the jury's award. Cruz represented drug manufacturer B. Braun Medical Inc. in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit after the company was found guilty of wrongfully discharging a former employee. Cruz asserted that she had failed to prove that B. Braun had directed her to violate the law and that she had not presented sufficient evidence that her refusal to violate the law <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> had been fired. The appeals court rejected Cruz's argument and affirmed the $880,000 award. Cruz represented Toyota in an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court in a statute of limitations case, where a judge wanted to investigate Toyota for contempt after a former Toyota in-house lawyer accused Toyota of unlawfully withholding documents in a product liability case. Cruz unsuccessfully argued the judge's jurisdiction expired thirty days after the case was dismissed following an out-of-court settlement, but later won on a second appeal using the same argument.|$|E
25|$|Robin, however, {{sensed the}} truth and killed her before leaving for the play. Then he planted the {{evidence}} and made the three calls {{to make it appear}} that a woman had committed the crime. At this point he still had the photo, but rather than destroy it, he kept it and planted it at Mrs Summerhayes' house to incriminate her. But Poirot had gone through the drawer earlier and did not see the photo, so he knew it had been planted subsequently. Further revelations are also made. Eve Carpenter wanted to conceal her past for reasons of her own, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> didn't co-operate in the investigation. Poirot discovers that Dr Rendell may have killed his first wife, which led Mrs Rendell to talk about anonymous letters she'd received warning her of the fact. Poirot now suspects it was Dr Rendell, convinced that Poirot was in Broadhinny to investigate the death of his first wife, and not that of Mrs McGinty, who tried to push him under the oncoming train, not Robin. Maude Williams {{turns out to be the}} daughter of Eva Kane's lover, and has always believed that her mother was murdered by Eva and that her father took the blame. She came to see Mrs Upward, who she thought was Eva Kane, intending to confront her, but found her dead and left quietly. She admits this to Poirot, who agrees to keep it a secret and wishes her good luck in her life.|$|E

50|$|The Judges were {{impressed}} by Yeon-hee's performance and dedication that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> earned the best photo. So-hyun and Na-hyun underperformed and castigated by their photos and sent home.|$|R

2500|$|In {{a review}} of Meglos (1980), in which Hill was cast as the villain, Radio Times Mark Braxton wrote that Barbara [...] "will always {{be one of the}} great companions", speculating that her [...] "magnificently haughty turn" [...] as Yataxa in The Aztecs <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was cast in Meglos. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph named Barbara the sixth best female Doctor Who companion. Will Salmon of SFX listed the {{departure}} of Ian and Barbara as the eighth best companion departure. In 2010, readers of Radio Times voted Barbara as the 26th greatest companion, out of 48 options.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{argument}} Coffey considered was due process. The Mt. Healthy defense {{raised by}} the hospital was that Churchill had not demonstrated that her speech <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> was fired. In response she had argued that the hospital violated her due process rights by not investigating the actual content of her speech. [...] "We disagree" [...] wrote Coffey, [...] "that {{it is necessary to}} create a First Amendment due process right {{in order to protect the}} rights of public employees to speak out on matters of public concern, for we believe that Mt. Healthy provides adequate safeguards regardless of whether the employer actually knew the precise content of the statements for which it fired the employee." ...|$|E

25|$|The third {{explanation}} {{is in the}} Fifth Doctor audio story The Chaos Pool by Peter Anghelides, which states that the creators of the Key to Time re-disguised its final segment as Romana, which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> changed and <b>why</b> <b>she</b> chose Astra's form.|$|R

6000|$|... "Did he drink?" [...] asked Charlotte gravely. [...] "The matron's husband {{drank and}} that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> left {{him and took}} to running an orphan asylum. I think I'd rather {{put up with a}} drunken husband than live in an orphan asylum." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know she}} has used {{him as a}} vehicle for her {{particular}} form of insanity, but that's not the point. What I <b>am</b> asking <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> introduced at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, my dear boy, that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> {{thinks you}} interesting. To her {{you are a}} mine of splendid possibilities. But I {{understand}} that you don't like either of them." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{appeared}} to live alone, and was, as such, probably wrinkled and a [...] "little odd", which <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{considered to be}} a witch by many of the local country-folk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, {{and they}} will quite {{understand}} why you say it. My mistress was getting uneasy already, and that <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> drove us from the room. You will tell them that the treasure is buried but that the secret of its hiding-place was lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad I {{brought you}} across. You {{have a way}} of getting hold of people--making them believe in you.

60|$|His little friend Lilybell {{was very}} different, {{for she was}} so kind and good every one loved her.

50|$|Choro-Hajji's wife, Suyumkan Malay kyzy, was a {{daughter}} of a wealthy person from a neighboring Ming-Bulak village. She was educated before the Soviet regime, that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> could read the Koran in Arabic.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He little {{knew that}} he was {{bringing}} her here to destroy his daughter's happiness.

6000|$|... "But how glad {{his mother}} must have been," [...] said Una softly. [...] "I {{think she had}} been sorry all her life that he was lame. Perhaps she even used to cry about it.

60|$|Whatever Tess's reasoning, some spirit had induced her {{to dress}} herself up neatly {{as she had}} {{formerly}} done, and come out into the fields, harvest-hands being greatly in demand just then.

60|$|And {{after all}} {{what was it}} that Mary and her painter had come out to do? To buy two pork chops. On my honour.
