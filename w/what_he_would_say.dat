5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
500|$|A {{photographic}} exhibition in the Netherlands by longtime band photographer Anton Corbijn {{served as a}} thematic inspiration for the song. Lead vocalist Bono saw an image of himself boarding a helicopter, taken in 1982 during filming of the music video for [...] "New Year's Day." [...] A journalist asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to his younger self if given the chance; Bono replied, [...] "I'd tell him he's absolutely right and stop second guessing himself." [...] He explained his comments later, saying, [...] "I realized how much I'd lost... that {{way of looking at}} the world. There was such a clarity to it, but it was so defiant in a way." ...|$|E
500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to me. There's a part that goes, 'I {{have learned that}} beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I {{was going to go}} back to the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

60|$|His first {{proceeding}} would be, I suppose, {{to make a}} list of that collection. <b>What</b> books, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> {{have all}} my libraries to possess anyhow? And <b>he</b> <b>would</b> begin to jot down--with the assistance of a few friends, perhaps--this essential list.|$|R
50|$|I {{believe that}} no one should write as a {{journalist}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> as a gentleman; that bribery by one’s own pocketbook is as much to be avoided as bribery by the pocketbook of another; that individual responsibility may not be escaped by pleading another’s instructions or another’s dividends.|$|R

500|$|Jenna Fischer {{stated that}} [...] "Health Care" [...] was her {{favorite}} episode of season one. Fischer {{went on to say}} that [...] "We laughed a lot while making this episode. Particularly during the scene where Dwight confronts everyone in the office about who has been writing fake diseases on their health forms. Rainn Wilson kept improvising new fake diseases, and we didn't know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> next." [...] Fischer notes that several of the scenes that involved laughing were not scripted and were in fact the casts genuine reaction to Wilson's fake diseases. The episode was rebroadcast on March 29, 2007 as part of a [...] "Human resources Nightmares" [...] marathon hosted by Paul Lieberstein. Lieberstein's character Toby Flenderson is the Human Resources Representative for the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, where The Office is set. [...] "Health Care" [...] was one of two first season episodes, the other being [...] "Hot Girl", to not contain commentary by members of the cast and crew on the season DVD.|$|E

60|$|Pondering {{over the}} affair, the young oarsman thought of Mr. Randolph Islen {{and of his}} kindness. He {{resolved}} to tell that gentleman his story and see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to <b>say.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On The Dick Cavett Show in 1981, {{the novelist}} and short-story writer John Cheever was {{asked why he}} did not write book reviews and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> if {{given the chance to}} review Rabbit Is Rich. He replied: ...|$|E
2500|$|When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> when facing God on {{judgment}} day, Bertrand Russell famously {{replied that}} he would say [...] "Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence!" [...] Some nonbelievers may have hidden from themselves what seems to them to be possible evidence of the divine, but {{the view of the}} hiddenness argument is that others have tried hard to believe in God. Schellenberg addresses this difference with his distinction between culpable and inculpable nonbelief, with the latter defined as [...] "non-belief that exists through no fault of the non-believer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Napoleon the Wonder Dog {{became a}} wildly popular act in London from his debut at the Pavilion Theatre on April 4, 1862, and onward until his {{untimely}} death {{many years later}} when he slipped and fell during a circus practice session. At {{the peak of his}} fame, his performance was described in London's Illustrated Sporting News and Theatrical and Musical Review as follows: [...] "Synopsis of his entertainment:-- He spells his own name with letters' also that of the Prince of Wales; and when he is asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> of her Most Gracious Majesty, he puts down letters to form [...] "God save the Queen." [...] He plays any gentleman a game of cards, and performs the celebrated three-card trick upon which his master backs him at 100 to 1. Also [...] "The Disappearance," [...] a la Robin. He performs in a circus the same as a trick horse, en liberté, giving the Spanish trot to music, also leaping over bars, through balloons, with numerous other tricks of a most interesting character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{if he came}} face-to-face with God. Fry said: [...] "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite {{a few things that}} were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} drew sharp rebuttals from Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam. In {{a speech}} at a forum organized by the Institute of Policy Studies, he argued that voters elect the President {{for the purpose of}} enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, [...] "in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position {{is similar to that of}} the British Monarch, quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII in which it was stated that [...] "Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve". Shanmugam posed the question: [...] "If the purpose is to influence the Government, would the best approach be to go public, or would it be to speak to the Prime Minister– as is generally done?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Shiyu {{recorded}} {{an incident}} about how Zhong Hui {{came to the}} attention of the Wei regent Sima Shi. Sima Shi instructed Yu Song (虞松), the Prefect of the Palace Writers (中書令), to draft a memorandum. He was not satisfied after reading Yu Song's draft and ordered him to rewrite. Yu Song was unable to think of a better way to write the memorandum after racking his brains and felt gloomy. Zhong Hui noticed Yu Song looked troubled, so he offered to help him and changed five words in the memorandum. Yu Song was pleased after looking through Zhong Hui's edits and he presented the revised draft to Sima Shi later. After reading it, Sima Shi asked him, [...] "You didn't make these changes. Who edited it?" [...] Yu Song replied, [...] "Zhong Hui. I've been wanting to recommend him to you, my lord. Now that you asked, I shan't keep him to myself anymore." [...] Sima Shi said, [...] "He's capable of shouldering greater responsibilities. Summon him." [...] When Yu Song informed Zhong Hui that Sima Shi wanted to meet him, Zhong asked him about Sima's abilities, to which Yu replied, [...] "He's learned, wise and multi-talented." [...] Zhong Hui stayed at home for about ten days, during which he refused to meet any visitors and carefully thought about <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to Sima Shi. On the day he met Sima Shi, he entered Sima's residence early in the morning and left only at midnight. After Zhong Hui left, Sima Shi remarked, [...] "He's truly a great talent capable of assisting rulers." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{felt too}} no longer {{that he thought}} {{straight}} {{into the mind of}} God. He thought now of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> presently <b>say</b> to God. He turned over and rehearsed phrases. With that came a desire to try them first on some other hearer. And from that to the attentive head of Lady Sunderbund, prettily bent towards him, was no great leap. She would understand, if any one could understand, the great change that had happened in his mind.|$|R
60|$|The whole party {{began to}} talk in German with great animation. They told each other of the quaint ways of this or the other; they joked loudly over 'Billy'--this being a {{nickname}} discovered for the German Emperor--and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>saying</b> of the Czar's trip; they questioned each other, and answered each other concerning the places {{they were going to}} see, with great interest, displaying admirable knowledge. They were pleased with everything; they extolled things English.|$|R
60|$|Lucy {{dismounted}} reluctantly. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say</b> {{about the}} riding-habit that she wore? She felt very curious to learn, and shyer than ever before, and altogether different. The skirt made her {{more of a}} girl, it seemed.|$|R

And how can I help you to do it?" ...|$|R
60|$|On the {{appointed}} day Logan and Merton awaited Lord Embleton. He entered {{with an air}} unwontedly buoyant, and was introduced to Merton. The first result was an access of shyness. The Earl hummed, began sentences, dropped them, and looked pathetically at Logan. Merton understood. The Earl had taken to Logan (on account of their hereditary partnership in an ancient iniquity), and {{it was obvious that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> to his partner. Merton therefore withdrew to the outer room (they had met in the inner), and the Earl delivered himself to Logan in a little speech.|$|R

60|$|Ever dearest Miss Mitford,--It's great {{comfort to}} have your letter; for as it came more lingeringly than usual, I had {{time to be a}} little anxious, and even my husband has confessed since that <b>he</b> thought <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> aloud for fear of paining me, as to the {{probability}} of your being less well than usual. Your letters come so regularly to the hour, you see, that when it strikes without them, we ask why. Thank God, you are better after all, and reviving in spirits, as I saw at the first glance before the words said it clearly....|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>say?</b> Should {{she tell}} him? She was {{surprised}} to find that the idea of doing so was painful to her. But she was aroused from these reflections by a step on the path, and raised her head to perceive the Vicomte. His face wore an expression of triumph.|$|R
