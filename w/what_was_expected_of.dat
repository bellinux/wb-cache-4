5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians {{were determined to}} hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E

Ledlie's men entered the huge crater instead of going around it, becoming trapped, and were subjected to heavy fire from Confederates around the rim, resulting in high casualties.|$|E

This allowed him to keep his personal appearance inline with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> prominent citizens. In contravention to his earlier stances during the Oregon Constitutional Convention, Deady later denounced violence against Chinese Americans during the 1870s and 1880s, even convening a grand jury to examine charging anti-Chinese crowds with criminal acts. These crowds were threatening violence against these minorities in an attempt to expel the immigrants from the state.|$|E

In 1904, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she acted as her father's hostess during his time as {{chaplain}} for the U.S. Senate. As an unmarried woman, Hale did <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> her and devoted herself to the need of her parents.

25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as {{this was the kind of}} cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E

His sons had been [...] "at sea" [...] in California, he said, not knowing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> them, {{and he had}} been unable to help. He regretted having made his departure from England so public; he had been persuaded to do so to highlight Britain's relatively low academic salaries.

500|$|Writing a 1947 {{critique}} of Stanley Matthews, Meredith criticised {{the lack of}} direct play on show in the 1940s and stated {{that when he was}} playing that [...] "I knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> me– to beat the wing-half and the full-back, take the ball down to the corner flag and centre". His ball control skills were unparalleled, leaving opposition players unable to tackle him. He also was an extremely accurate passer and crosser of the ball. His dribbling and crossing gave him a large advantage over rival wingers, who relied solely on speed to beat opposition full-backs. In addition to wing-play, he was also highly skilled at sending in long-range shots across the face of the goal, and could be relied upon to meet crosses from his left-winger with a powerful volley.|$|E

[...] The actor complained about what he saw as a lack of support and guidance from the Voyager team, saying he felt adrift and unsure as to <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> his performance, especially since his portrayal reflected two of the starring characters. [...] However, he also conceded that it may have been intentional in an effort to evoke a genuine sense of off-balancedness in the character. [...] Either way, though he was unaccustomed to the environment, Wright expressed his willingness to revisit Tuvix or even work on any Star Trek again if the opportunity arose. [...] In interviews, Wright specifically fondly recalled his time working with Jennifer Lien (Kes), Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway), and director Cliff Bole.|$|E

[...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, but they said that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{noted for its}} [...] "dry, sterile" [...] production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the {{previous}} two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix {{and none of the}} room microphones, thus causing the [...] "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that because of the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded [...] "strangled mechanistic". He saw the [...] "synthetic" [...] percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound. The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that [...] "Jason Newsted, [...] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass, stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix. In their defense, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines {{to the point of being}} indiscernible from each other. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: [...] "The Justice album wasn't something that really felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{constantly}} and openly taking extensive {{notes on the}} behavior of the staff and other patients, none of the pseudopatients were identified as impostors by the hospital staff, although many of the other psychiatric patients seemed to be able to correctly identify them as impostors. In the first three hospitalizations, 35 of the total of 118 patients expressed a suspicion that the pseudopatients were sane, with some suggesting that the patients were researchers or journalists investigating the hospital. Hospital notes indicated that staff interpreted much of the pseudopatients' behavior in terms of mental illness. For example, one nurse labeled the note-taking of one pseudopatient as [...] "writing behavior" [...] and considered it pathological. The patients' normal biographies were recast in hospital records along the lines of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> schizophrenics by the then-dominant theories of its cause.|$|E

Meade may have also ordered the change of plans because he lacked confidence in black soldiers' abilities in combat. Burnside protested to General Grant, who sided with Meade. When volunteers were not forthcoming, Burnside selected a replacement white division by having the three commanders draw lots. Brig. Gen. James H. Ledlie's 1st Division was selected, but he failed to brief the men on <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> them and was reported during the battle to be drunk, well behind the lines, and providing no leadership.

Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection — between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade.
