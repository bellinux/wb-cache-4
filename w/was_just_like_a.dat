500|$|Csupó {{said that}} they cast Bailee Madison as May Belle Aarons after weeks of searching for an actress to play the part. He {{went on to say}} that [...] "she had such a charm, even before the camera, she <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> little sweetheart. She was very confident, she showed up, shook hands with everybody, totally sweet and perky. I said 'WOW!'— she was just {{stealing}} everybody's heart on the spot." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the hardest thing I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, [...] "Most of Becky’s storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere, but with this one it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cloud was hanging over me for six weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|During his career, Jack won {{the respect}} of both {{teammates}} and opponents. Dan Dierdorf, a Hall of Fame tackle, said that Youngblood was [...] "by far the toughest opponent I faced in my career", a thought echoed by Viking Hall of Fame tackle Ron Yary who said, [...] "There wasn't anybody who was tougher to block than Jack". Other NFL greats such as Hall of Fame tackles Bob Brown and Rayfield Wright, rank Jack among the top players they faced. Opposing quarterbacks ranked Youngblood highly, with two of them, Fran Tarkenton and Roger Staubach, stating that Jack was the top defensive lineman they faced in their careers. [...] Hall of Fame defensive tackle Merlin Olsen paid Youngblood the highest compliment by stating that Jack was the [...] "perfect defensive end". [...] Running backs also entered the chorus, [...] "I remember bouncing off Jack Youngblood and it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pillar of strength over there on the defense," [...] Rocky Bleier recalled. [...] "Jack played hurt, he played tough, {{and he was a}} great opponent." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bennington {{reflected}} on joining Stone Temple Pilots, stating, [...] "Every band {{has its own}} kind of vibe. Stone Temple Pilots has this sexier, more classic rock feel to it. Linkin Park is a very modern, very tech-heavy type of band. I {{grew up listening to}} these guys. When this opportunity came up, it <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> no-brainer." [...] Bennington stated in interviews that singing lead vocals in Stone Temple Pilots was his lifelong dream. He left the band on good terms due to his commitments with Linkin Park in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Che Guevara's {{unlikely}} {{transformation into}} a [...] "sanctified" [...] figure began immediately after his execution. Susana Osinaga, the nurse who cleaned Guevara's corpse after his execution reminisced that locals saw an uncanny physical {{resemblance to the}} popularized artistic portrayals of Jesus. According to Osinaga, [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Christ, with his strong eyes, his beard, his long hair", adding that in her view he was [...] "very miraculous." [...] Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life, notes how among the hospital's nuns, {{and a number of}} Vallegrande women, the impression that Guevara bore an extraordinary resemblance to Jesus Christ quickly spread; leading them to surreptitiously clip off clumps of his long hair and keep them for good luck. Jorge G. Castañeda, author of Compañero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara, discerns that [...] "the Christ-like image prevailed" [...] stating [...] "it's as if the dead Guevara looks on his killers and forgives them, and upon the world, proclaiming that he who dies for an idea is beyond suffering." ...|$|E

2500|$|George Martin, the Beatles' producer, {{questioned}} {{the validity of}} the major sixth chord that ends the song, an idea suggested by George Harrison. [...] "They sort of finished on this curious singing chord which was a major sixth, with George [...] doing the sixth and the others doing the third and fifth in the chord. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Glenn Miller arrangement." [...] The device had also been used by country music-influenced artists in the 1950s. McCartney later reflected: [...] "We took it to George Martin and sang 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeeeeeaah ...' and that tight little sixth cluster we had at the end. George [...] said: 'It's very corny, I would never end on a sixth'. But we said 'It's such a great sound, it doesn't matter'". The Beatles: Complete Scores shows only the notes D (the fifth) and E (the sixth) sung for the final chord, while on the recording McCartney sang G (the root) as Harrison sang E and Lennon sang D.|$|E

[...] In an interview with the New York Post, he elaborated, [...] "I got hired as a day player and it turned into a week, and then a month and so on. I was just rolling with it—I mean, who would say no to that?" [...] Mike performed in the glee club's production numbers, but was given very little dialogue, staying mostly [...] "in the background, doing some facial expressions." [...] Shum noted, [...] "It wasn’t until I came on the [...] tour and had this crazy reaction from the audience, and the producers were like, 'Wow, how do they know him? Mike is a senior in the third season of the show. Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy has stated that, due to graduation, [...] "more characters are leaving than are staying" [...] {{at the end of the}} season. Mike's parents are dealing with his college plans and appear on the show in [...] "Asian F" [...] to this end, and may be recurring characters.|$|E
