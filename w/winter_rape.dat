Brassica rapa (of Koch) has also given rise to two races, namely, common turnips and the oil-giving rape. The evidence is unusually clear that these latter plants, though so different in external appearance, belong to the same species; for the turnip has been observed by Koch and Godron to lose its thick roots in uncultivated soil; and when rape and turnips are sown together they cross {{to such a degree that}} scarcely a single plant comes true.

This issue may be solved by including a catch crop in a crop rotation. For instance, <b>winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> is a potential N catch crop for cold climates. Here, we studied <b>winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> as a catch crop from 2009 to 2011 in Finland. <b>Winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> was either undersown with barley in May or sown after harvesting barley in late July. In two reference treatments, the barley stubble was either left over the winter or ploughed into the soil in autumn. We collected samples from topsoil, 0 - 20  cm, and subsoil, 30 - 50  cm, in early autumn, before snowfall and in the following spring. We measured soil ammonium-N and nitrate-N, and the N content of <b>winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> plants. Results show that undersown <b>winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> did not change the yield and quality of barley. <b>Winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> decreased nitrate-N in the subsoil by 83  % in 2009 and by 61  % in 2010, compared to ploughed barley. By the end of October 2009, <b>winter</b> turnip <b>rape</b> undersown in May took up 74  kg N/ha, whereas the crop sown after barley in July took up 57  kg N/ha.

40|$|<b>Winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> {{can take}} up more {{nitrogen}} during autumn than cereal crops and requires high amounts of nitrogen (N) for maximum yield. In organic farming clover-grass leys are often the previous crop to <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> since large amounts of nitrogen are mineralised during the autumn, after ploughing the ley, and the following growing season. Whether the Nsupply to <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> is affected by harvesting the ley once or twice or keeping it as a green mulching crop are discussed in organic farming. <b>Winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> gives a good residual- N effect on the following crop but increased amounts of soil mineral nitrogen (Nmin) is often found at harvest of oilseed rape and late autumn which increases the risk for N-losses during winter. Consequently {{there is a need}} to optimise the N-supply to <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> and reduce the risk for N-losses. This is especially important in organic farming where N often is a limiting source. In five field trials (2001 - 2006) the effect of three treatments of a clover- grass ley (no harvest, one harvest, two harvests) on Nmin, net N-mineralisation, N-uptake and seed yield of organically grown <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> (with and without application of dairy slurry in the spring) was studied. In the subsequent year the effect on Nmin, N-uptake and grain yield was studied in winter wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing) and in spring wheat (following early soil cultivation/ploughing, catchcrop/late ploughing and no catchcrop/late ploughing). Different amounts of above ground ley crop incorporated into the ground (in the three treatments) had no impact on oilseed rape seed production or Nmin in late autumn after ploughing the ley, in early spring or at harvest of the following <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape.</b> The reason for this could be that the roots are of more importance for the N-supply after leys and were most likely similar in all treatments. The impact of the slurry application to the <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> was surprisingly small and increased yield with 300 kg ts/ha. In late autumn after harvest of oilseed rape Nmin was reduced by 50 % with catch crop (or spontaneously occurring crop) and late ploughing compared to where winter wheat was sown after early cultivation and ploughing or early cultivation followed by late ploughing. The results showed that catch crop (or spontaneous crop) and late ploughing (followed by spring wheat) were efficient methods to reduce the risk for N-losses after <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape.</b> Subsequent wheat yield was relatively high, indicating a sufficient N-supply, but was not affected by the ley treatments, slurry application or various soil cultivation (with or without catchcrop) after harvest of oilseed <b>rape.</b> Yield of <b>winter</b> and spring wheat was similar and with a price 0, 5 kr/kg higher for spring wheat, economically as well as environmentally the best choice of subsequent crop to <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> was spring wheat...|$|R

The subject of this study was analysis of weed infestation of <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> canopy and seed yield depending on the rate of soil NPK fertilization and foliar application (autumn spraying with solution) : 100 % and 75 % NPK and urea + nickel chelate + MgSO 4 H 2 O; 100 % and 75 % NPK, as well as urea + Plonvit R + MgSO 4 H 2 O). The control was plots without foliar fertilization (only 100 % NPK). Foliar sprayings were carried out as a single rate in autumn between 10 th and 20 th of October. The second experimental factor was seed sowing rate (2. 5 kg·ha- 1 – row spacing 30 cm; 4 kg·ha- 1 – row spacing 18 cm). It was found that foliar fertilization of <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> in the autumn period contributes to a reduction in quantitative indexes of weed infestation and an increase in seed yield.

The {{analysis of data}} of the agrochemical soil properities in the vegetation of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> in a five year period showed if the fertilization system of Zemědělská společnost Chrášťany s. r. o. is set appropriately and where are the eventual reserves. 	The analysis rates between the yield of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> and the individual nutrients content in the soil (P, K, Mg, Ca) and pH were calculated {{with the use of}} the analysis of correlation and regression. The same method was used in the evaluation of pure nutrient dosage in the applied fertilizers. The order of importance of the nutrients for the yield was determined according to the value of the coefficient of the correlation between the yield of rape and the examined elements. The examined period was consisted of the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and the analysed area of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> reached averagely 190 ha in each year, which was divided into 10 soil blocks. 	The assumption that N fertilizing is going to have a greater influence on the growth of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> yield in soils with worse agrochemical soil properties, then on soils with greater nutrient reserve and a satisfactory soil reaction was confirmed.

In this study we aimed at measuring the services and disservices of this intercrop with three different legume mixtures, in terms of growth and yield for rapeseed, ground cover of weeds in autumn and damage caused by <b>rape</b> <b>winter</b> stem weevil. The experiment was carried out at four sites from 2011 to 2014.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{improving}} fertiliser nitrogen (N) strategies and reducing N leaching, seasonal changes in soil N supply in crop sequences with winter wheat after <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> were examined through field experiments. Break crop effects on wheat after oilseed rape, compared with after peas and oats, were determined as regards residual N, yield and optimum N rate (Opt-N). The impact of residues of the previous crops on net N mineralisation-immobilisation during autumn and winter was studied in field incubation experiments. The influence of spring N fertilisation on winter wheat yields was investigated. Nitrate leaching under <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape,</b> peas and oats, and under subsequent wheat was quantified, and measures against leaching were studied. Opt-N to winter wheat was 25 and 15 kg ha- 1 lower after <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> and peas, respectively, than after oats, despite a yield increase of 700 kg ha- 1 after both. The uptake of soil N by wheat until maturity was 26 and 20 kg N ha- 1 larger after oilseed rape and peas. Net N mineralisation (Nnet) between spring and maturity was higher after oilseed rape and peas than after oats. Nnet corresponded to 84 % of the uptake (or supply) of soil N. The variations in wheat yield at optimum, together with either uptake of soil N or Nnet, explained 70 % {{of the variation in}} Opt-N. Thus predicting wheat yield and supply of soil N, or Nnet, after previous crops is crucial for the calculation of Opt-N. Due to the large N uptake of <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> during the autumn, N leaching during the following winter was lower than during the winter with subsequent winter wheat. More soil mineral N was found at harvest of <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> and peas than after oats, affecting later leaching. Above-ground residues of oilseed rape, peas and oats incorporated into soil in September caused N immobilisation during autumn and winter, with the shortest duration for peas. Thus the residue N did not increase leaching risks. Perennial ryegrass as a catch crop undersown in spring in oilseed rape and peas reduced N leaching during winter, whereas direct drilling of winter wheat did not. Fertilisation of oilseed rape above Opt-N enhanced leaching by 0. 5 kg N ha- 1 per kg fertiliser N.

Although some deviations between observed and simulated parameters appeared, the model was able to mimic characteristic crop growth dynamics. One of the main shortcomings is that model {{is not able to}} simulate necrosis of leaves within winter period. On the other hand, the model was able to reproduce the effect of different climatic conditions within included locations (i. e. later onset of observed phenophases within cooler station with higher elevation etc.) and the parameters were estimated with higher accuracy at Domanínek station...|$|E
40|$|The aim was {{to assess}} the effects of {{fertilising}} by a different forms of suplhur on the conten of the water - soluble suplhur in the soil, yield of seed and the oiliness of <b>winter</b> <b>rape.</b> The experiment was conducted in the form of a small-plot field trial at ŠZP in Žabčice in the farming years 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014. There were 6 different variants enrolled in the experiment: 1. unfertilized variant, 2. LAD (ammonium nitrate with dolomite) + LAD, 3. DASA (ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate) + DAM 390, 4. DASA + DASA, 5. WIGOR + LAD, 6. WIGOR + DASA. Fertilizer DASA containing sulphate form and fertilizer WIGOR including elementary sulphur. All variants of experiment despite of unfertilized soil were fertilising with nitrogen (195 kg per hectare). It was divided to regeneration, the first and the second production fertilising. In the variant 5 and 6 was apllied 60 kg of Wigor S including elementary sulphur. In the variant 3, 4 and 6 was apllied DASA containing sulphate form. Fertilizers including sulphur had got the positive effect on the conten of the water - soluble suplhur in the soil. Fertilising with sulphur hadnt influenced ratio between nutrients in plants of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> and hadnt increased the yield of grain. Values relating to oiliness of seed were statistical different. Grain of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> from unfertilizing parcel had got higher oiliness than grain from fertilizing parcel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>rape</b> (Brassica napus, L) is annual or {{biennial}} {{crop which}} is growing for seeds containing rape oil. This {{is the third}} world´s most important oil, which is growing. In geographically smaller part of Czech Republic we talk about <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> as a {{the most important and}} most grown oilseed. <b>Winter</b> <b>rape</b> is represented up to 85 % harvesting area of all oilseeds which is growing in Czech Republic. When the exact parcel experiment with four replications, which was conducted in 2014 / 2015 season at the research station in FAPPZ in Č. Újezd, Prague - West district were monitored production and biological indicators of <b>winter</b> <b>rape</b> in autumn and at the start of spring vegetation. Differences between attempts were preparing the soil, fertilizer under the heel, the method of seeding, fertilization during growth. A comparison {{of the results of the}} fall collections of rape, it is clear that most grown plants were grown technologies, no. 2, it´s before sowing plowed land, sowing the seed drill Farmet Falcon 6. During the spring inventory of crops grown technologies, no. 2 - 4 showed comparable biological indicators, the other two stands slightly lagged. After threshing technology as the highest yielding seed technology emerged no. 3 (Farmet intensity). Conclusion of the experiment: there is no need to plow before planting, it is important to choose an appropriate method for establishing a modern stand a significant effect on seed yield should fall fertilization N. Attempting to penetrometric soil resistance in oilseed rape crops. In season 2015 / 2016 was the site of the 'Triangle Left ", which manages the company AGROCOM HRUŠOVANY spol. s r. o. divided into two parts. One part was plowed before sowing, the second part being plough before sowing. Next on two parts of the land made the autumn and spring inventorying oilseed rape crop. The findings of the experiment, when the autumn sampling plants are biological indicators of rape on plough section of higher parameters. Spring inventories fell in reverse, higher parameters showed plants on a plowed section. Measurement of penetrometric soil resistivity confirmed that the land was plowed soil of lower resistance...|$|E

Plant density of <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> during growth period is influenced by plant development in autumn and plant wintering. The aim of four year (2008 – 2011) research in the LLU Research and Study farm “Vecauce” {{was to investigate the}} influence of agronomical factors (sowing date, sowing rate, fungicide (metkonazole)) application and meteorological factors on two type (line, hybrid) <b>winter</b> oilseed <b>rape</b> varieties plant density changes from sowing till harvesting. Plant density in autumn, spring and during harvesting was influenced also by meteorological parameters such as air temperature and precipitation. On four year average, field germination was observed from 66 % to 95 %. Sowing date significantly (p 0. 05) influenced by fungicide as growth regulator application in autumn in any trial year. Influence of sowing date and sowing rate on the total plant density at harvest time was significant in all trial years (p< 0. 05) for both varieties. At higher sowing rate the plant loss during growing period was higher than at lower rates...|$|R
