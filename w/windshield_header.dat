25|$|Each car is {{required}} to display its number on each door {{of the car and}} on its roof. The front of the car and bottom of the rear bumper are required to match the decal specifications of the car manufacturer. Each car {{is required}} to display a series of around 30 NASCAR sponsor decals just to the left of each door and on the front fenders. These contingency decals represent series sponsors and bonus money teams are eligible to earn during the race, but may be omitted in the event in which they conflict with the team's sponsors or moral beliefs. The series sponsor's logo is displayed on top of the windshield, called the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> or windshield banner.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2013, the livery layout for the NASCAR Cup Series was altered, {{coinciding with}} the change to the Generation 6 model car. In lieu of the series sponsor like in lower series, the {{windshield}} prominently features the last name of the driver (as well as first name or first initial {{in the case of}} siblings and family members, as is the case for both Busch brothers, or suffixes for drivers such as Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Martin Truex, Jr.) placed {{in the center of the}} <b>windshield</b> <b>header.</b> Logos of the manufacturer are placed on each corner of the upper windshield. Number and sponsor logos were barred from being placed on the headlights and taillights, as not to obstruct each car model's unique characteristics. A new location for a single sponsor logo, however, was added to the rear of the roof adjacent to the number. In 2014, a new layout was created for participants in the NASCAR Chase for the Championship, requiring the cars to feature yellow roof numbers, front splitters and front fascias. The background of the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> would also be colored yellow, with the driver's name displayed in black lettering. A new Chase for the Championship logo would replace the normal NASCAR Cup Series logo in the contingency group. A decal would also be placed next to the driver's name above the door to signify each win a driver earned that season. For 2015, the liveries of the Xfinity and Camping World Truck Series would feature the driver's last name on the upper rear window. Starting in 2017, the Monster Energy logo is now on the front windshield with the driver name moving to the rear windshield in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.|$|E
2500|$|The Murciélago Roadster was {{introduced}} in 2004. Primarily designed to be an open top car, it employed a manually attached soft roof as cover from adverse weather, but a warning on the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> advises the driver not to exceed [...] with the top in place. The designer used the B-2 stealth bomber, the Wally 118 WallyPower yacht, and architect Santiago Calatrava's Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències in Valencia, Spain as his inspiration for the roadster's revised rear pillars and engine cover.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The iconic [...] "T-bucket" [...] custom. Exposed {{engine is}} {{virtually}} mandatory, as are flat <b>windshield,</b> <b>headers,</b> and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spokes, dropped tube axle, transverse front leaf spring, front disc brakes, open-face aircleaner, Weiand valve covers, and single 4-barrel (probably a QJ).|$|R
50|$|The {{collapsible}} textile {{roof section}} (of cloth or vinyl) over an articulated folding frame may include linings {{such as a}} sound-deadening layer or interior cosmetic headliner (to hide the frame) - or both - and may have electrical or electrohydraulic mechanisms for raising the roof. The erected top secures to the <b>windshield</b> frame <b>header</b> with manual latches, semimanual latches, or fully automatic latches. The folded convertible top is called the stack.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The 21 Wood Brothers Ford {{featuring}} {{the name of}} Trevor Bayne and Ford logos on the <b>windshield</b> <b>header.</b>|$|E
50|$|A 720p high-definition camera mounted {{within the}} <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> trim, which records the driver's point-of-view through the windshield, with audio {{recorded}} via a dedicated microphone in the cabin.|$|E
50|$|On January 30, 2014, a new Chase system {{resembling}} the playoff systems {{used in other}} major league sports was announced at Media Day. On July 15, NASCAR announced various design changes to identify Chase drivers in the field: on these drivers, their cars' roof numbers, front splitters and fascia, and the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> are colored yellow, and the Chase logo on the front quarter panel.|$|E
50|$|The Murciélago Roadster was {{introduced}} in 2004. Primarily designed to be an open top car, it employed a manually attached soft roof as cover from adverse weather, but a warning on the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> advises the driver not to exceed 100 mph with the top in place. The designer used the B-2 stealth bomber, the Wally 118 WallyPower yacht, and architect Santiago Calatrava's Ciutat de les Arts i les Ciències in Valencia, Spain as his inspiration for the roadster's revised rear pillars and engine cover.|$|E
50|$|Camaro ZL1 Touring Convertible {{concept is}} a Camaro ZL1 {{convertible}} with green exterior color, 10-spoke Chevrolet Accessories wheels with liquid metal finish and milled faces, <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> frame, taillamp bezels and exterior badges with liquid metal finish; matte black splitter and rockers, matte black upper fascia blackout, polished shock tower brace under the hood, ebony leather seats with Mojave perforated leather inserts and light Mojave stitching, Mojave leather-wrapped armrests, leather shift knob and console lid with Mojave stitching, Chevrolet Accessories Ice Blue interior lighting kit, ZL1-logo premium floor mats and sill plates.|$|E
5000|$|After World War II, {{the term}} fell into disuse. However, landau became a model name when Nash Motors {{introduced}} the Rambler in 1950. The new compact car was available {{during its first}} year of production only as a [...] "convertible landau". The Rambler's canvas top opened from the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> {{all the way to}} the back and stowed in the trunk area. This unique convertible design featured steel framed roof rails called a [...] "bridge beam" [...] around the car's doors and side windows. The Rambler's strong body structure eliminated the internal bracing that was normally needed on other open cars. Essentially it was a cabrio coach.|$|E

5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, <b>windshield</b> <b>header,</b> roof panels, and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).|$|E
5000|$|The top {{itself is}} a dual-layer, three-position power-retractable cloth top with a glass rear window, {{electric}} defroster and an integrated color-matched spoiler with a center high-mounted stop lamp that remains visible with the top in any position. The top retracts in three stages: over the two front passengers, over all four passengers (to the rear spoiler) and fully retracted with its stack folded behind the rear head restraints just above the rear cargo opening. The top is controlled either via the key remote or by open/close buttons at the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> adjacent to the interior ceiling light and retracts to the first two stages at speeds up to 60 kph (37 mph), to its third stage at up to 50 mph [...] - [...] and is available in black, tan or red.|$|E
5000|$|Sixty Special {{arrived with}} revised trim and more power ( [...] , to be exact) for 1955, {{and while the}} $4,342 price was lower than last year, {{production}} rose slightly to 18,300 units. The eight chrome louvers - mounted on the lower rear doors since 1950, were replaced by 12 louvers mounted {{just ahead of the}} bumper on the rear fenders. Chrome rocker panel moldings - taller than the ones used on Series 62s - stretched {{from the back of the}} rear wheel well to the rear bumper. A new grille held a bold eggcrate design, while the rear roof support fashioned a delicate Florentine curve - this design was also shared with the lower-rung Series 62. In back, six vertical chrome louvers were mounted on the panel below the trunk lid - three spaced on each side of the license plate mounting. The tinted band across the <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> changed from green to gray this year. A new option, the remote control trunk release, debuted this year.|$|E
40|$|A {{weighted}} {{logistic regression}} with careful selection of crash, vehicle, occupant and injury data and sequentially adjusting the covariants, {{was used to}} investigate the predictors of the odds of head/face and neck (HFN) injuries during rollovers. The results show that unbelted occupants have statistically significant higher HFN injury risks than belted occupants. Age, number of quarter-turns, rollover initiation type, maximum lateral deformation adjacent to the occupant, A-pillar and B-pillar deformation are significant predictors of HFN injury odds for belted occupants. Age, rollover leading side and <b>windshield</b> <b>header</b> deformation are significant predictors of HFN injury odds for unbelted occupants. The results also show that the significant predictors are different between head/face (HF) and neck injury odds, indicating the injury mechanisms of HF and neck injuries are different...|$|E
