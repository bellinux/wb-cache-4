50|$|The {{standard}} set was twofold: {{to define}} a maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> value per death benefit and {{to define a}} maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies {{for all of the}} benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.|$|R

The German welfare system is particularly strict for young individuals. We distinguish between mild and strong sanctions and we focus on the impact of these sanctions on job finding probabilities. Our results suggest that each type of sanction leads to an increased transition rate to work, and that this effect is higher for strong sanctions. However, strong sanctions for young welfare recipients involve a complete <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the basic <b>cash</b> transfer payments, and there exists evidence that these severe sanctions might go along with additional, negative effects for sanctioned individuals...|$|R

40|$|Atkinson’s book Inequality: What Can Be Done? (Harvard University Press, 2015) {{sets out}} {{a range of}} {{concrete}} proposals aimed at reducing income inequality, which cover a very broad span but include major changes to the income tax and social transfers system and the minimum wage. These are framed with specific reference to the UK but have much broader relevance in demonstrating how substantial the impact on inequality of such measures could be. This paper assesses the first-round effects of these tax, transfer and minimum wage reforms on income inequality and poverty based on a microsimulation approach using EUROMOD. The reforms involve a significantly more progressive income tax structure, a major {{increase in the minimum}} wage to the level which is estimated to represent the ‘Living Wage’, and alternative routes to reforming social transfers – either to strengthen the social insurance element or to restructure the entire system as a Participation Income (a variant of Basic/Citizen’s Income). The results show how the first-round effects of either set of tax and transfer proposals would be to substantially reduce the extent of income inequality and relative income poverty and the paper draws out how the two approaches differ in their effects. The additional impact of raising the minimum wage to the Living Wage is modest, reflecting in particular the position of beneficiaries in the household income distribution and the offsetting effects on household income <b>of</b> the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> means-tested <b>cash</b> transfers...|$|R

Tuition fee was $5000 in 2012.In 2009 Turin Polytechnik University was opened. It is the only university in Central Asia that prepares high quality employees for industries.With the closing or downsizing of many foreign firms, it is relatively easy to find qualified employees, though salaries are very low by Western standards. Salary caps, which the government implements in an apparent attempt to prevent firms from circumventing restrictions on <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> from banks, prevent many foreign firms from paying their workers as much as they would like. Labor market regulations in Uzbekistan {{are similar to those of}} the Soviet Union, with all rights guaranteed but some rights unobserved.

Uzbekistan's Ministry of Labor does not publish information on Uzbek citizens working abroad, but Russia's Federal Migration Service reports 2.5 million Uzbek migrant workers in Russia. There are also indications of up to 1 million Uzbek migrants working illegally in Kazakhstan. Uzbekistan's migrant workers may thus be around 3.5-4 million people, or a staggering 25% of its labor force of 14.8 million. The U.S. Department of State also estimates that between three and five million Uzbek citizens of working age live outside Uzbekistan.|$|E

Meanwhile if the business combination uses the pooling of interest method, then the amount of assets, debts and rights of shareholders that are reported by the affiliated companies will be recognized in accordance with its book value. APB No. 16 notes that there are 12 requirements that must be met when using pooling of interest method. If it does not meet any of these requirements then the combined companies must use the purchase method. There is no goodwill in pooling interest method.

40|$|In {{the first}} essay, "The Source <b>of</b> <b>Cash</b> and Its Marginal Value," we study the {{relation}} between the source <b>of</b> firms' <b>cash</b> holdings and the value <b>of</b> the <b>cash</b> to shareholders. The marginal value of a dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings depends on the source of the dollar: $ 1. 00 <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> has a value of $ 1. 27 when it is from operations, $ 0. 80 when from financing, and $ 0. 46 when from investing. Within the same source, the marginal value of an added dollar <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> holdings is significantly higher than the absolute value of a subtracted dollar. Shareholders of financially constrained or distressed firms value incremental cash holdings from almost any source more highly than do shareholders of unconstrained or stronger firms, but differences in value remain across the sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> within each subsample. Agency costs and information asymmetry are two frictions that appear to have the largest impact upon the value <b>of</b> <b>cash.</b> In the second essay, "Explanations for Diverging Values of Cash," we further explain the differing values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> found in the first essay. Intertemporal relationships among the sources and uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide a rational basis for shareholders to assign different values <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> based on the source. Sources <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> provide information about likely uses <b>of</b> <b>cash</b> up to two to three years in the future, and many of the intertemporal relations are statistically and economically significant.
