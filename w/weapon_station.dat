5|$|The Army {{wanted the}} vehicle to feature a commander’s weapons station, autocannon, coaxial weapon, and an {{anti-tank}} guided missile system. The weapons suite had to be manually operable when damaged and the commander's <b>weapon</b> <b>station</b> had to incorporate a shield. Additionally, a dismountable anti-armor weapon would be carried on board. The Army also stated that the weapon suite would emphasize modularity, be able to defeat other IFVs, and provide non-lethal capability to enable use in civilian environments.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2015, Doosan and CMI Defence {{revealed}} {{they had}} joined {{to create the}} Cockerill Protected <b>Weapon</b> <b>Station</b> (CPWS) to increase the firepower of the K200. [...] The turret can support cannons between 20–30mm, plus a 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, including the: CPWS20 20mm; CPWS 25mm which can be armed with the M242 Bushmaster, Nexter M811, or Oerlikon KBA; and CPWS30 armed with the M230LF.|$|E
2500|$|The RG Outrider is {{slightly}} larger than its predecessor, with the hull being [...] wider and [...] higher. In addition to the APC role, {{it can also be}} used as a command, liaison or scouting vehicle. The RG Outrider can provide ballistic protection against up to 7.62×39mm anti-personnel rounds (STANAG 4569 level 2). Anti-tank mine protection is of level 2a and 2b (under wheel and under center), and it can also provide side protection against Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). A 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun can be fitted to the <b>weapon</b> <b>station</b> on the roof.|$|E
2500|$|Brimstone is an air-launched {{ground attack}} missile {{developed}} by MBDA for Britain's Royal Air Force. It was originally intended for [...] "fire-and-forget" [...] use against mass formations of enemy armour, using a millimetric wave (mmW) active radar homing seeker to ensure accuracy even against moving targets. Experience in Afghanistan {{led to the}} addition of laser guidance in the dual-mode Brimstone missile, allowing a [...] "spotter" [...] to pick out specific targets when friendly forces or civilians were in the area. The tandem shaped charge warhead is much more effective against modern tanks than older similar weapons such as the AGM-65G Maverick, while the small blast area minimises collateral damage. Three Brimstones are carried on a launcher that occupies a single <b>weapon</b> <b>station,</b> allowing a single aircraft to carry many missiles.|$|E

2500|$|The turret and glacis are {{protected}} with [...] "Kanchan" [...] ("gold") modular composite armour, which derived {{its name from}} Kanchan Bagh, Hyderabad, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) is located. Kanchan is made by sandwiching composite panels between Rolled Homogenous Armour (RHA). This helps in defeating APFDS and HEAT rounds. Trials conducted in 2000, showcased the ability of Kanchan armour to protect the tank, even when hit at point blank range by a T-72. It also demonstrated the capability to defeat HESH and APFSDS rounds, which included the Israeli APFSDS rounds. A new honeycomb design of Non-Explosive and Non-Energetic Reactive Armour (NERA) along with nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection equipment, along with mine sweeps and an automatic fire fighting system are {{set up on the}} Arjun Mark II variant. Electromagnetic-counter mine system can also be installed to disable magnetic mines and disrupts its electronics before the tank reaches them. Signature reduction suite is also available for this design to reduce the probabilities of the object to be detected by Infrared, Thermal, Radar-Thermal, and Radar bands. The planned improvements include Electro-optical/IR [...] "dazzlers", Laser warning receivers, aerosol grenade discharging systems and a computerised control system among few. The tank is fitted with infrared jammer, laser rangefinders and designators are used in navigation (GPS/INS), observation systems and sensors, real-time command and beyond-vision-range target engaging. Advanced Fire Control System (FCS) is linked to a millimetre band radar system, laser range-finder, crosswind sensor and IR and radiometer sensors on board. The millimetre band radar system mounted on the turret is capable of operating as a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS) and also has a Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) and radar jammer. Four all-bearing Laser warning receivers (LWR) for the new fire-control system enables the Arjun is capable of shooting down helicopters. Battle Management System has a panoramic sight with the commander's station equipped with eight periscopes for 360° vision. Commander's independent thermal viewer, <b>weapon</b> <b>station,</b> position navigation equipment, and a full set of controls and displays have been linked by a digital data bus for improved fire control system. The tank is fitted with digital maps, improved cooling system to compensate for heat generated by the additional computer systems, FBCB2 capabilities, New radars, EW Systems, C4ISR Systems, Gun Control System (GCS) Integrated Battlefield Management System (IBMS) and Active protection System.|$|E
