'We must do {{something}} that'll take Mr. Le Breton out of himself {{for a short time}} entirely--that'll give him occupation of a kind he thinks right, {{and at the same time}} put money in his pocket. Now, he's always talking about this socialistic business of his; but why doesn't he tell us what he has actually seen about the life and habits of the really poor? Mrs. Le Breton tells me he knows the East End well: why doesn't he sit down and give us a good rattling, rousing, frightening description of all that's in it? Of course, I don't care twopence about the poor myself--not in the lump, I mean--I beg your pardon, Mr. Berkeley,'--for the Progenitor gave a start of surprise and astonishment--'you know we women are nothing if not concrete; we never care for anything in the abstract, Mr. Le Breton used to tell me; we want the particular case brought home to our sympathies before we can interest ourselves about it. After all, even YOU who are men don't feel very much for all the miserable wretched people there are in China, you know; they're too far away for even you to bother your heads about. But I DO care about the Le Bretons, and it strikes me we might help them a little in this way. I know a lot of artists, Mr. Berkeley; and I know one who I think would just do for the very work I want to set him. (He's poor, too, by the way, and I don't mind giving him a lift at the same time and killing two birds with one stone.) Very well, then; I go to him, and say, [...] "Mr. Verney," [...] I say,--there now, I didn't mean to tell you his name, but no matter; [...] "Mr. Verney," [...] I shall say, [...] "a friend of mine in the <b>writing</b> <b>line</b> is going to pay some visits to the very poor quarters in the East End, and write about it, which will make a great noise in the world as sure as midday."' ...|$|E

5000|$|The Luttrell Psalter {{measures}} 370 x 270 mm (14 1/2 {{inches by}} 10 1/2 inches). It {{is written in}} Latin and comprises 309 high-quality vellum leaves with flyleaves of paper. Most of the pages are decorated in red paint with details in gold, silver and blind. The illustrations are stamped and tooled into the paper. The manuscript has eight cords which attach the pages together securely. It is sewn together and has a modern binding (post 1929) of dark brown Morocco leather. The scribes used ruling {{as a method of}} scribing, an expensive method. The scripts are fairly large. Each frame of the manuscript has about fourteen full lines of text. The strokes of the letters are flat and parallel to the <b>writing</b> <b>line.</b> This technique required a pen on which the nib is cut at an especially oblique angle, a [...] "strange pen". Unlike earlier illuminated manuscripts, the first letter of the first word on the line, for every two lines then other lines, are capitalized.

In the present article, a new method for text baseline detection, straightening, and slant correction for Arabic handwritten texts is proposed. The method comprises a set of sequential steps: first components segmentation is done followed by components text thinning; then, the direction features of the skeletons are extracted, and the candidate baseline regions are determined. After that, selection of the correct baseline region is done, and finally, the baselines of all components are aligned with the <b>writing</b> <b>line.</b>   The experiments are conducted on IFN/ENIT benchmark Arabic dataset. The results show that the proposed method has a promising and encouraging performance...|$|E

40|$|Arabic {{handwriting}} recognition {{systems have been}} evaluated in public at the ICDAR conferences in 2005 and 2007. This contest provides well defined training data and unpublished test data, which makes the performance of those systems well comparable among each other. The development of the winning system of 2007 is described here in some detail. It is an HMM-based recognition system for Latin script that has been adapted to Arabic script. Only the most fundamental modifications have been applied to the system, like the definition of Arabic character models, and the change of the feature sequences to Arabic writing direction. Other important properties like <b>writing</b> <b>line</b> identification and the features themselves have not been changed. A straightforward optimization process with many small improvements has finally lead to a very competitive high performance Arabic {{handwriting recognition}} system. This shows the generality of the selected approach...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that recognition of scanned typeset mathematical expression {{images can be}} done by extracting maximum spanning trees from line of sight graphs weighted using geometric and visual density features. The approach used is hierarchical contextual parsing (HCP) : Hierarchical in terms of starting with connected components and building to the symbol level using visual, spatial, and contextual features of connected components. Once connected components have been segmented into symbols, a new set of spatial, visual, and contextual features are extracted. One set of visual features is used for symbol classification, and another for parsing. The features are used in parsing to assign classifications and confidences to edges in a line of sight symbol graph. Layout trees describe expression structure in terms of spatial relations between symbols, such as horizontal, subscript, and superscript. From the weighted graph Edmonds 2 ̆ 7 algorithm is used to extract a maximum spanning tree. Segmentation and parsing are done without using symbol classification information, and symbol classification is done independently of expression structure recognition. The commonality between the recognition processes is the type of features they use, the visual densities. These visual densities are used for shape, spatial, and contextual information. The contextual information is shown to help in segmentation, parsing, and symbol recognition. The hierarchical contextual parsing has been implemented in the Python and Graph-based Online/Offline Recognizer for Math (Pythagor^m) system and tested on the InftyMCCDB- 2 dataset. We created InftyMCCDB- 2 from InftyCDB- 2 as a open source dataset for scanned typeset math expression recognition. In building InftyMCCDB- 2 modified formula structure representations were used to better capture the spatial positioning of symbols in the expression structures. Namely, baseline punctuation and symbol accents were moved out of horizontal baselines as their positions are not horizontally aligned with symbols on a <b>writing</b> <b>line.</b> With the transformed spatial layouts and HCP, 95. 97...|$|E

50|$|Word {{line core}} memory was {{often used to}} provide {{register}} memory. Other names for this type are linear select and 2-D. This form of core memory typically wove three wires through each core on the plane, word read, word write, and bit sense/write. To read or clear words, the full current is applied {{to one or more}} word read lines; this clears the selected cores and any that flip induce voltage pulses in their bit sense/write lines. For read, normally only one word read line would be selected; but for clear, multiple word read lines could be selected while the bit sense/write <b>lines</b> ignored. To <b>write</b> words, the half current is applied to one or more word <b>write</b> <b>lines,</b> and half current is applied to each bit sense/write line for a bit to be set. In some designs, the word read and word <b>write</b> <b>lines</b> were combined into a single wire, resulting in a memory array with just two wires per bit. For write, multiple word <b>write</b> <b>lines</b> could be selected. This offered a performance advantage over X/Y line coincident-current in that multiple words could be cleared or written with the same value in a single cycle. A typical machine's register set usually used only one small plane of this form of core memory. Some very large memories were built with this technology, for example the Extended Core Storage (ECS) auxiliary memory in the CDC 6600, which was up to 2 million 60-bit words.|$|R
