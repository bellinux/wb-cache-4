60|$|I gave no sign; but I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} if the auctioneer's brother's funeral took place <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Territory I would {{postpone}} all other recreations and attend it.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew the}} poor lad {{was to be}} maimed in some manner. The same {{blinding}} rush of rage which had come upon me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabin, overpowered all sense of danger.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{can readily}} understand,” she began, “that this morning’s affair was largely an accident; but I {{have been talking}} with Mr. Haskins. He {{tells me that the}} day we were rescued, even <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabin, two men were drowned, {{deliberately}} drowned—murdered.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{send this}} away to-night, and am sorry it must go <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> so much grief.|$|R
6000|$|Bel. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> lost, {{past all}} redemption.--Maskall, must you be smickering after wenches, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> calamity? [...] [Aside.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes: I {{thought of}} that <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room. But I could not get out before. I am now no longer a {{responsible}} being: Mrs. Goodman is mistress {{for the remainder of}} the day. Will you be introduced to anybody? Whom would you like to know?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Lily! Do you {{remember}} when she first called him Apollo? I do, well. I remember his coming here the day after Bernard brought him down, and how you were playing on the lawn, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other garden. I little thought then what it would come to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{told me that}} they'd had a queer {{lot about}} the house, and that {{three or four of}} them left just then. I think I heard that two or three men from the place went to New Zealand together. It just came out in {{conversation}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inn-yard." ...|$|E
60|$|Achil, He is {{a privileged}} man; proceed, Thersites. Ha, ha, ha! pr'ythee, proceed, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> the vein of laughing.|$|R
5000|$|Nelson Mandela {{wrote me}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> jail {{and told me}} to keep the faith, I have not yet given up hope! ...|$|R
5000|$|I never mixed {{politics}} with sports, I {{had worked with}} many (Muslims) <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> England, and <b>I</b> made friends with many of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{he tells}} it. It takes forty minutes by the watch. Did I laugh? Well, say! When I got my face {{straight}} he calls in old Pete, the superannuated darky, and sends {{him down to}} the hotel to bring up my valise. It was Elmcroft for me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|E
60|$|And as I {{was about}} to do so, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very act of {{summoning}} up all my eloquence to protest that I didn't know how to ride a bike and couldn't possibly learn in the brief time at my disposal, I'm dashed if the man didn't go and nip me in the bud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] {{returned}} the eagle. [...] "I saw your danger <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air, {{and determined to}} act quickly, although I might myself have been shot by the man had his gun been loaded. But I have noticed that a bold action is often successful because it causes surprise, and the foe {{does not know what}} to do." ...|$|E

60|$|All at once, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> this state, comes forth an object, an individual; and my mind, sleepy and unfixed, is awakened and {{fastened}} in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I promised {{my mother}} I wouldn't smoke or drink or gamble <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> college," [...] he retorted, {{struggling}} with shame and anger. [...] "And I--I won't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't {{have time}} to eat much <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Smiling Pool," [...] he explained. [...] "Couldn't eat and sing too, and while I was down there, I was {{supposed}} to sing. Now {{that it is time}} to quit singing, I begin to realize that I've got a stomach to look out for as well as a voice. See that bug over there on that leaf? Watch him." ...|$|E
60|$|In the American Navy {{there is}} an {{everlasting}} suspension of the Habeas Corpus. Upon the bare allegation of misconduct {{there is no law}} to restrain the Captain from imprisoning a seaman, and keeping him confined at his pleasure. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Neversink, the Captain of an American sloop of war, from undoubted motives of personal pique, kept a seaman confined in the brig for upward of a month.|$|E
6000|$|... [168] Giaffir, Pacha of Argyro Castro, or Scutari, I am {{not sure}} which, was {{actually}} taken off by the Albanian Ali, in the manner described in the text. Ali Pacha, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, married the daughter of his victim, some years after the event had taken place at a bath in Sophia or Adrianople. The poison was mixed in the cup of coffee, which is presented before the sherbet by the bath keeper, after dressing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it, exactly," [...] said Rob. [...] "I'm an American, {{and thought}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> London I'd {{drop in on}} His Royal Highness and say 'hello' to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{only say}} if, {{and we are}} cut off from all the world, {{he will be a}} {{companion}} to you, and keep you alive, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> the batteries." ...|$|R
6000|$|HE. How unhappy a lover <b>am</b> <b>I,</b> [...] <b>While</b> <b>I</b> sigh for my Phyllis in vain: [...] All {{my hopes}} of delight [...] Are another man's right, [...] Who <b>is</b> happy, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> pain! ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{was only}} too {{glad to get}} rid of them both, and to take the {{opportunity}} of writing to Philip. I insisted on an explanation of his conduct <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study--to be given within an hour's time, at a place which I appointed. [...] "You are not to attempt to justify yourself in writing," [...] I added in conclusion. [...] "Let your reply merely inform me if you can keep the appointment. The rest, when we meet." ...|$|E
6000|$|But you, {{who are in}} a great station here, (if {{anything}} here may be called great) cannot be ignorant, that whoever is understood by public voice to be chief minister, will, among the general talkers, share the blame, whether justly or no, of every thing that is disliked; which I could easily make appear in many instances, from my own knowledge, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world; and particularly {{in the case of the}} greatest, the wisest, and the most uncorrupt minister, I ever conversed with.[9] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] {{said his}} comrade, [...] "was <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gall of {{bitterness}} and bond of iniquity, and applies {{not to my}} walk or my ways now that I am called forth into the lists. Mr. Melchisedek Maultext compared my misfortune in that matter {{to that of the}} Apostle Paul, who kept the clothes of the witnesses who stoned Saint Stephen. He held forth on the matter three Sabbaths past, and illustrated the same by the conduct of an honourable person present, meaning me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. I {{have only}} to look into your own {{knowledge}} of yourselves, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> this trance, and while you have got my hands, to know both your names {{as well as you}} do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is a good}} idea," [...] {{declared}} the Grand Gallipoot. [...] "I'd like King Roquat for my own slave. He could black my boots and bring me my porridge every morning <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> bed." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I have no {{knowledge}} of this surveyor and I wonder what he said, that we studied Vieta's work together in Paris, because it is a book which I cannot remember having seen the cover, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> France." ...|$|R
6000|$|At this Captain Obadiah favored {{his brother}} {{with a look}} of exaggerated and sanctimonious humility. [...] "Alas, brother," [...] he cried out, [...] "for accusing me so unjustly! Fie upon you! Would you check a {{penitent}} in his confession? But you must know that it is to this gentleman that I address myself, and not to you." [...] Then directing his discourse once more to the Reverend Mr. Pettibones, he resumed his address thus: [...] "Sir, you must know that <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Indies I embarked, among other things, in one of those ventures against the Spanish Main of which you may have heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|Scarcely had I {{conceived}} {{this idea}} when the bird passed the first bush, and I {{glanced at my}} watch; then he passed the second, and I glanced again. Thus I noted that he took exactly ten seconds to pass from one bush to the other. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> act of jotting this down I heard the report of Peterkin's rifle, and looking up hastily, saw the tail-feathers of the ostrich knocked into the air, but the bird itself passed on uninjured. I was deeply mortified at this failure, and {{all the more so}} that, from past experience, I had been led to believe that my friend never missed his mark. Hurrying up, I exclaimed-- ...|$|E
60|$|R. C. {{stepped out}} upon the beach <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water. The {{bonefish}} {{lay on his}} side, a blaze of silver. I {{took hold of the}} line very gently and led the fish a little closer in. The water was about six inches deep. There were waves beating in--a miniature surf. And I calculated on the receding of a wave. Then with one quick pull I slid our beautiful quarry up on the coral sand. The instant {{he was out of the}} water the leader snapped. I was ready for this, too. But at that it was an awful instant! As the wave came back, almost deep enough to float the bonefish, I scooped him up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Your ladyship can do {{me a great}} favour, if {{you will}} please speak to my {{character}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your service. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> offered a place, to wait on an invalid lady who has lately come {{to live in this}} neighbourhood.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} bred a surgeon, {{and for the}} last few years have served a general {{practitioner}} in the City, as his assistant. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his employment <b>I</b> became acquainted with Jonas Chuzzlewit.

6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] replied Chatterer doubtfully. [...] "He {{was very}} good to me <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his prison, and--and I'm not so very much afraid of him now. Just the same, I don't mean to let him get hands on me again." ...|$|R
