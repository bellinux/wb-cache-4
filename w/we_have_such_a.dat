2500|$|In 2000, Anderson {{asked the}} Salt Lake City Police Department {{to end its}} {{participation}} in the DARE program. He told DARE officials: [...] "I think your organization has been an absolute fraud {{on the people of}} this country... For you to continue taking precious drug-prevention dollars when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> serious and, in some instances, growing addiction problem is unconscionable." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline took American {{television}} viewers {{on a tour}} of the White House with Charles Collingwood of CBS News. In the tour she stated that [...] "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place we see them best." [...] The film was watched by 56 million {{television viewers}} in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson. Kennedy was the only First Lady to win an Emmy.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, Timberlake {{released}} his second studio album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Critically and commercially acclaimed, the album spawned six singles, including the worldwide hits [...] "SexyBack", [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". After wrapping up a worldwide concert tour {{in support of}} the album in 2007, Timberlake took a break from his music career to focus on acting. In 2010, Timberlake's manager, Johnny Wright, began conversations with the singer about working on new music. The two had general decisions about ways to release new music, because according to Wright, [...] "a lot of the physical record sellers were gone, by the time we've got music again we need to think about different ways to deliver it". Wright proposed a promotion based on an application or releasing a new song every month. Timberlake, however, was not interested in going back into music and instead continued to focus on his film career. Around the [...] "late part of May/first week in June" [...] 2012, Timberlake asked Wright to dinner and revealed to him that he had spent the last couple of nights in studio with Timbaland working on new material. Wright was shocked at the revelation, telling Billboard magazine that he [...] "wasn't prepared for that." [...] The two immediately began marketing plans for how the album should be promoted and when it should be released. Ultimately, they agreed [...] "to do this in a shorter period of time, so let's put the single out and [...] seven or eight weeks after that– make it a short window, and because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> short window, we have to make a big impact." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This is damnable, sir--damnable--and you'll pardon me, but I {{can hardly}} believe <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> monstrous {{principle}} in the good, honest, well-meaning laws, of good, honest, well-meaning old England!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh {{you mean}} by the heat?”—Percy Beaumont rose to it. “We were rather knocked up, but we feel wonderfully better. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> jolly—a—voyage down here. It’s so very {{good of you to}} mind.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I should come, Mrs. Ray, if Miss Ray did {{not make}} her {{appearance}} at the brewery in the morning. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> nice party, and of course one wants to talk it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{make more}} row than anybody else; but I do {{say that as}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> lot of these things, and {{as we all know}} that we don't get cash for them as we want it, Grendall shouldn't take money and walk off with it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'John! It do sound lackadaisical. What I call womanish. But perhaps it's for the better. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> lot of Jacks.

6000|$|... "Then {{there are}} fifteen years {{difference}} between us." [...] The reader will please to read [...] "twenty."

6000|$|The boy {{had been}} poising as if on winged feet, and now he flew. He came back to say at the door, [...] "I don't believe I'll want any breakfast, mother; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> late supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> rogue in the North Country {{we should}} know how to serve him," [...] {{observed}} Sir William, and Warwick laughed as befitted a Westmoreland Nevil, albeit {{he was used to}} more civilised ways.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very {{sorry to}} leave you {{standing}} at the door, Sir,' said the girl, lighting a lamp, and addressing Mr. Pickwick with a winning smile, 'but you was quite strangers to me; and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> many trampers that only come {{to see what they}} can lay their hands on, that really--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{call this}} an {{excellent}} good book, {{by far the}} best of the autobiographic kind I remember to have read in the English language; and indeed, except it be Boswell's of Johnson, I do not know where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> picture drawn of a human life, as in these three volumes.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Ralph," [...] said Edna, [...] "if {{you knew}} how glad I am <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> man to manage things, {{you would not}} think in that way.

How glad I am that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{handsome}} new stand for it! it will look so much better." [...] And Mrs. Stephens laid down her work, and folded a piece of newspaper, on which the treasure was duly deposited.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{doubt whether}} we should have ever taken her {{if she had not}} been so deep in the water with the guns and stores she had on board. The French {{certainly}} know how to build ships; {{there is no question about}} that. I doubt whether <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good-looking gun-boat in the service. Anyhow I have not seen one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{decay of}} old families," [...] said the Master, [...] "is {{much greater than}} would appear {{on the surface of}} things. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{reluctance}} to part with them, that we are content to see them continued by any fiction, through any indirections, rather than to dispense with old names. In your country, I suppose, there is no such reluctance; you are willing that one generation should blot out all that preceded it, and be itself the newest and only age of the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY (delighted). Oh, {{that is so}} nice of you, Mr. Rankin. This is {{a delicious}} country! And the people seem so good!

6000|$|... "Because I {{know who}} makes the pastry," [...] says Mr. Laws, the judge, with a {{profound}} bow. [...] "I wish, madam, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> happy knack of pastry at home as you have at Castlewood.

60|$|I {{doubt whether}} two young birds {{could have known}} less about keeping house, than I and my pretty Dora did. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> a servant, of course. She kept house for us. I have still a latent belief that {{she must have been}} Mrs. Crupp's {{daughter}} in disguise, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> awful time of it with Mary Anne.|$|R
6000|$|Weissmann smiled indulgently. [...] "The {{scientist}} is {{defeated by}} the lover. I see; you would exclude all others from the sitting. Very well! that shall be as you wish; but it seems a shame now when <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> wonderful chance to duplicate the Crookes' experiments. But, as you say, {{it would be too}} much to ask of a young and lovely girl. We will sacrifice only men and the ugly crones, eh?" [...] Morton smiled faintly and his chief went on: [...] "Well, now, in case you find yourself sitting--" [...] he held up a warning hand--"I say if you find yourself unable to stop these trances--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] Harry agreed; [...] "but {{it must be}} done somehow. Every day matters {{grow more}} threatening, and those bands of scoundrels from Marseilles have not been brought all this way for nothing. The worst of it is, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> short time to act. Marat {{does not seem to be}} ever alone from early morning until late at night. Supposing we did somehow get the order of release from him at night we could not present it till the morning, and before we could present it some one might arrive and {{discover}} him fastened up, and might take the news to the prison before we could get them out." ...|$|E
60|$|Now here {{altogether}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> {{change in}} human life as to constitute a fresh phase of history. In {{a little more than}} a century this mechanical revolution has been brought about. In that time man made a stride in the material conditions of his life vaster than he had done during the whole long interval between the palæolithic stage and the age of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those of George III. A new gigantic material framework for human affairs has come into existence. Clearly it demands great readjustments of our social, economical and political methods. But these readjustments have necessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution, and they are still only in their opening stage to-day.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the same}} {{interview}} Jacqui talked about preparing {{to perform the}} new songs live, stating that “It’s just great to be singing again and I’m excited about playing these new songs live. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> good run together previously and it’s just a real pleasure {{to be working with}} him again and singing these fantastic songs.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! I don't {{mind that}} kind of thing. A real boy can't be hurt, and I don't care how wild he runs, {{so long as he}} is obedient and truthful.

5000|$|When Sa'd ibn Mu'adh {{pronounced}} the death-sentence on the Qurayza tribe, Sa'd ibn Ubadah and Habab ibn Mundhir came to tell Muhammad: [...] "The Aws tribe detest {{the killing of}} the Qurayza tribe because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>such</b> <b>an</b> important alliance." [...] Sa'd ibn Mu'adh countered: [...] "The good Aws do not detest it. May God disappoint the others!" ...|$|R
