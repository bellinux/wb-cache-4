5|$|Hartebeest {{are popular}} game and trophy animals {{as they are}} {{prominently}} visible and hence easy to hunt. Pictorial as well as epigraphic evidence from Egypt suggests that in the Upper Palaeolithic age, Egyptians hunted hartebeest and domesticated them. The hartebeest was a prominent source of meat, but its economic significance was {{lower than that of}} gazelles and other desert species. However, {{from the beginning of the}} Neolithic age, hunting became less common and consequently the remains of the hartebeest from this period in Egypt, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> extinct, are rare.|$|E

5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of Banksia paludosa are {{endemic to}} New South Wales. The nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis {{through to the}} Sydney region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, with a separate population {{in the vicinity of}} Eden just north of the Victorian border. It occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in 1966 from Hat Head on the Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, but has not been found there since despite field work in the area. This record aside, the northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> locally vanished. Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern Highlands.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 1990, {{the last}} Polish president-in-exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, handed the presidential insignia, {{including}} one of the banners rescued by Mościcki in 1939, to Lech Wałęsa, the first democratically elected president of post-war Poland. The ceremony, held at the Royal Castle in Warsaw {{was seen as a}} symbol of the Third Republic's continuity with the pre-war Second Republic. However, since legal regulations on national symbols did not recognize a national banner at that time, the banner brought by Kaczorowski did not become the presidential insignia again but was instead donated to the Royal Castle museum <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> on display. The other of the two banners remains in the Sikorski Institute in London. Today, a kilim embroidered with the design of the pre-war Banner of the Republic is hanging in the Senate chamber, above the chair reserved for the President of Poland.|$|E
