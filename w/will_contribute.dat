5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to help create a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E
5|$|The tax {{increase}} was implemented {{not only to}} improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure. The additional funds <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> to finance {{the extension of the}} Stockholm metro. As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day, the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 30. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} for entry under the skilled migrant plan applicants are assessed by an approved doctor for good health, provide a police certificate to prove good character and speak sufficient English.

Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe <b>will</b> <b>contribute</b> are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa. Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit {{for two years and}} are then eligible to apply for residency. Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work where there has been a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 1997 on a sample of 224 livestock farmers in 4 clusters representing the diversity in production systems of northern Côte d’Ivoire, in order to evaluate the willingness of beneficiaries to pay for tsetse control using traps and targets. Results of a contingent valuation survey indicate that 94 % of respondents are <b>willing</b> to <b>contribute</b> money, 86 % are <b>willing</b> to <b>contribute</b> labour and 81 % are <b>willing</b> to <b>contribute</b> in both money and labour. Average contribution proposed is CFA 246 (US$ 0. 46) per head of cattle per year and 8 days per month per farm family with significant differences in the level of resource contributions by production system and breed composition of herds. The estimated model of factors affecting willingness to contribute labour reveals the significance of knowledge of the tsetse fly and trypanosomosis symptoms, location, length of farmer’s experience as collective herd manager and the practice of transhumance. Few factors were found to be significantly associated with <b>willing</b> to <b>contribute</b> money. The organization of a scheme for resources contribution to sustain the benefits of control should take into account the differences in production systems, farm location and bree...|$|R
