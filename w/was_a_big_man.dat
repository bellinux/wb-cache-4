He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E

[...] He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as [...] "palaces"; he also likened them to his [...] "living room", where he would privately entertain guests.

500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man,</b> possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with {{broad shoulders and}} a big voice. He spoke {{the language of the}} common soldier, and led from the front. Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E

2500|$|An {{official}} from Greek Ministry of National Defence {{said the}} plane had entered Greek air space at 14:58 (UTC). The pilots transmitted the hijack squawk code twice at 14:55 (UTC), while the aircraft was cruising about 25kilometres (15mi) north of Thessaloniki. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato reported that the hijacker slipped into the cockpit with a package {{which could have been}} a bomb when flight attendants opened the cockpit door, and the pilots acted according to the international rules in the matter and did what the hijacker wanted. The flight's captain reported in Istanbul that [...] "while the chief stewardess entered the cockpit to ask if we needed anything, the terrorist entered by force. I tried to push him out but he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>man</b> and I failed to stop him". The captain {{went on to say that}} the hijacker said he had three friends and they had explosives. He wanted to go Rome to speak with the Pope, and Italian Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato reported that, the hijacker added there are other hijackers on another unspecified plane, [...] "would blow that plane up if the missive didn't get to the pope". The captain reported to the air-traffic controller in Thessaloniki that [...] "he had two undesirables who wished to go to Italy to see the Pope and to give him a message". Four Greek F-16 fighter jets took off and accompanied the plane until it left Greek airspace. Once in Italian airspace, two Italian F-16s intercepted, escorted, and forced it to land in Brindisi Airport in Brindisi. The airline spokesman said that Greek officials had alerted their Italian counterparts about the hijacking incident.|$|E
