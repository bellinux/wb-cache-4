5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. <b>We</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

In every situation in our business life, in every responsibility that comes before us, our chief thought shall be to fulfill that responsibility and discharge that duty so that when each of us is finished we shall have endeavored to lift the level of human ideals and achievement higher than <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything {{is that we can}} be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it.</b> If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} rumour circulated, Joe Goddard created a reverse rumour, saying that Minogue {{had written a}} track for Hot Chip. He told NME, [...] "Kylie wrote a song for us, She sent it through our {{management}} to us– it was totally bizarre. It was {{the beginnings of a}} track– I think she wrote it and just thought, 'This would be perfect for Hot Chip', or possibly for a collaboration. It's a crazy song. It's industrial and clanging and even has farmyard animal noises on it. It's the kind of music you'd never normally associate with Kylie. When I'm allowed to send it around it's going to change a few people's ideas about her. Maybe it's one for our next album, after Made in the Dark." [...] Taylor later admitted that it was a joke created to fool people because the band were tired of people phoning them up to ask why Minogue had apparently rejected a song she did not hear. Goddard said, [...] "We've been telling lots of lies and rumours about it because <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> quite funny." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{his last}} year of medical school Salk says: [...] "I had an {{opportunity}} to spend time in elective periods in my last year in medical school, in a laboratory that was involved in studies on influenza. The influenza virus had just been discovered about a few years before that. And, I saw the opportunity at that time to test the question as to whether we could destroy the virus infectivity and still immunize. And so, by carefully designed experiments, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> was possible to do so." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{also found}} the term itself too vague to rely on in this case. [...] "Maybe the term 'manifest disregard' was meant to name a new ground for review," [...] he speculated, echoing Posner in Bavarati, [...] "but maybe it merely {{referred}} to the § 10 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them." [...] In the past, the Court had [...] "merely taken the Wilko language as <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it,</b> without embellishment ... and now that its meaning is implicated, we {{see no reason to}} accord it the significance that Hall Street urges." ...|$|E

2500|$|Since Head was {{simultaneously}} collaborator {{and experimental}} subject, extensive precautions {{were taken to}} make sure that no outside factors influenced his subjective appreciation of what he was perceiving: [...] "No questions were asked until the termination of a series of events; for <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> was scarcely possible... to ask even simple questions without giving a suggestion either for or against the right answer... The clinking of ice against the glass, the removal of the kettle from the hob, tended to prejudice his answers... was therefore particularly careful to make all his preparations beforehand; the iced tubes were filled and jugs of hot and cold water ranged within easy reach of his hand, so that the water of the temperature required might be mixed silently." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{elected to}} push on and record 1997's Aftertaste as a three-piece. A {{first version of}} the album was {{withdrawn}} at last minute {{in the fall of}} 1996 when promotional activities had already begun. Eventually, release was delayed to March 1997 for a new audio mix, and the guitarist Chris Traynor (formerly of Orange 9mm) was recruited for the supporting tour. Although the song [...] "Exactly What You Wanted" [...] became a moderate radio hit, the album spent only a few weeks on the Billboard 200 and has sold 135,000 copies as of April 2006. The Aftertaste Tour in 1997–98 would prove to be the band's last. Amid long-standing private disputes, the members decided to call it quits. Asked about the breakup, Hamilton replied, [...] "9 years, 1,600 shows, 5 albums, and <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> hard to look at each other anymore" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point where we could determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two months later, Thursday {{announced}} they would reunite for Atlanta, Georgia's Wrecking Ball music festival in August 2016. In {{a statement about}} the reunion show, Rickly said: [...] "Five years ago, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> necessary to end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, {{we were able to}} reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we're happy to say that we'll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on Full Collapse and jointly worked on every record since." [...] Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform [...] "in our own way, including involving a charity" [...] and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival. The band had no intention to reunite before this decision. Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year.|$|E
