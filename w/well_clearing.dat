40|$|Abstract — Unmanned {{aircraft}} {{systems will}} be required to equip with a detect-and-avoid (DAA) system in order to satisfy the federal aviation regulations to remain <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> of other aircraft. For a DAA system to satisfy the requirement to stay <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> of other airborne traffic, a quantitative definition of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> needs to be defined and evaluated. This study investigates the implications of UAS using proposed <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> definitions as a separation standard for conducting operations in the national airspace system. The first analysis considers three <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> definitions and presents the relative state conditions of intruder aircraft as they encroach upon the <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> boundary. The second analysis focuses on the definition of the alerting criteria needed to inform the UAS operator of a potential loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear.</b> All analyses are conducted in a NAS-wide fast-time simulation environment using UAS aircraft models, proposed UAS missions, and historical air defense radar data to populate the background traffic operating under visual flight rules. The results presented in this study inform the safety case, requirements development, and the operational environment for DAA minimum operational performance standards.

40|$|This {{white paper}} {{summarizes}} NASA research results that have informed Special Committee 228 (SC- 228) discussions and decisions regarding {{the inclusion of}} a warning-level alert within the detect and avoid (DAA) alerting structure for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). For UAS, the removal of the pilot from onboard the aircraft has eliminated the ability of the ground-based pilot in command (PIC) to use out-the-window visual information to make judgments about a potential threat of a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> with another aircraft. As a result, the DAA traffic display will be the primary source of information that the PIC can use to execute the three primary <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> functions: 1) detect a potential loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear,</b> 2) determine a resolution maneuver, and 3) upload that maneuver to the aircraft via the ground control station (GCS). In addition, pilots are required to coordinate with air traffic control (ATC) prior to maneuvering off of their approved flight plan. In determining an appropriate resolution maneuver to avoid a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear,</b> the PIC must decide both when and how to maneuver, and both the timeliness and the accuracy (i. e., correctness) of the maneuver are critical to reducing the likelihood and/or severity of a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear.</b> Alerting information is one of three critical components of the DAA display, along with traffic information elements (e. g., relative heading, speed and altitude) and maneuver guidance. Alerting information and maneuver guidance, in particular, have been found to have a significant impact, both statistically and practically, on pilots' ability to avoid and minimize the severity of losses of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> While all three display components are key to pilots performing the traffic avoidance task of remaining <b>well</b> <b>clear,</b> in general, alerting information provides crucial information about when a resolution maneuver is required while maneuver guidance assists the pilot in determining how best to maneuver. A fundamental task of the DAA alerting system is to provide critical timing information to the pilot about the potential for a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> with another aircraft. This is done by employing both temporal and spatial thresholds that indicate to the pilot the likelihood and imminence of a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear.</b> The design of the DAA alerting thresholds is a balancing act between eliciting the desired pilot response in real loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> threat events and reducing excessive, unnecessary, and/or uncoordinated UAS maneuvering within the air traffic environment; larger thresholds, both spatially and temporally, may increase the likelihood of a pilot avoiding a loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear,</b> but it can also increase the frequency of maneuvering - especially in cases where a maneuver is not actually needed to maintain <b>well</b> <b>clear.</b> A series of human in the loop (HITL) simulations have been conducted as part of NASA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Integration in the National Airspace System (NAS) project. The purpose of these HITLs has been to provide empirical results in order to inform development of the minimum human-machine interface requirements for the DAA system. This white paper will present those results which provide evidence of a human performance benefit (in terms of response times and ability to remain <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> of other aircraft) of the DAA warning alert both with and without a collision avoidance system on board the aircraft...|$|R

5000|$|The {{penultimate}} {{event was}} the Kettlebell Throw, a tough explosive event where athletes were timed for each kettlebell they got over a 15'7 bar. JF Caron got things going by getting 5 over in 31.88 seconds. Martins Licis really struggled {{and did not}} get a good throw, giving him no points in that event. It was Eddie Hall next, and the Englishman took his time to make sure each throw counted. Despite making a few mistakes along the way, The Beast managed 5 in 56.92 seconds. Konstantine Janashia was quick on the first few, but just cleared the fourth and then got the crowd going for number five. The time spent doing so proved costly for the Georgian, who was a few seconds slower than Hall for five bells. Hafthor Bjornsson won the throwing event in the 2014 final, and was a favorite heading into this one. The first five cleared in just under 17 seconds for the Icelander, but his need for speed cost him dearly on the sixth. Thor didn't get the right launch angle and missed, which broke his rhythm. He had to take two more attempts to get it, and then lacked the necessary energy for the seventh. His score was of 6 in 40.22. Brian Shaw then knew what he had to beat, and was much more sensible in his throws. The man from Colorado paced himself <b>well,</b> <b>clearing</b> the sixth in 34.97 seconds, before trying the seventh for the roaring crowd but not quite getting it. Still, this meant Shaw now had a three-point lead heading into the stones, while the battle for third was a one-point affair between Janashia and Hall.|$|E
40|$|Protected {{areas are}} facing serious threat due to direct and {{indirect}} impacts of human activities. Official and vistor created trails monitored and investigated for management and protection purpose. Geospatial tools are highly implacable in impact assessment and inventory research. GIS inventory was conducted to understand the spatial distribution of formal and informal trails in the study area. We estimated that the linear distribution of trails is 151 km of which 52 % are informal trails. We have explored that the minimum width along user created trails is 0. 6 meters, and the maximum width is 3 meters with a mean value of 2. 3 m. The inventory estimated the trail footprint covers an area of 69 ha in the national park (out of 2676). User activity is {{an important aspect of}} trail inventory by analysing trails attributes (width, slope, TTF) off track activities have been identified as well. Flatter and wider trails are an indictaion of ORV and management vehicles driving on trails. Hotspots such as vandalism, TTFs, and informal boundary intersections were mapped as <b>well,</b> <b>clearing</b> vegetation on an area of 138 ha in the study area. We observed that approximately 197 ha of vegetation been lost due to planned, unplanned trails and hotspots. Trail slope is significant for impact assessment can be used to estimate erosion potential and hazard assessment. Slope distribution models (with 0 to 25 interval) were developed for formal, informal trails in the national park. Steeper slope, lower width is an indication of bike riding and walking on user created trails. We verified trail parameters and user related issues (Trail technical features, width, length, activity, vandalism, informal boundary intersects, ORV, bike riding on both planned and unplanned tracks) while ground-truthing survey (appendix figure 2). Comparing our inventory results with investigations conducted around the world accuracy were found around 75 % to 78 % (varying with a spatial and spectral resolution of available data). We concluded that GIS and remote sensing is capable of conducting inventory, efficiency can be improved by using higher spatial resolution data and then integrating inventory with field survey. We recommend that park management should involve users (bike riders) in data collection process as to educate them and understand their behaviour...|$|E

40|$|As Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{make their}} way to {{mainstream}} aviation operations within the National Airspace System (NAS), research efforts are underway to develop a safe and effective environment for their integration into the NAS. Detect and Avoid (DAA) systems are required to account for the lack of "eyes in the sky" due to having no human on-board the aircraft. The current NAS relies on pilot's vigilance and judgement to remain <b>Well</b> <b>Clear</b> (CFR 14 91. 113) of other aircraft. RTCA SC- 228 has defined DAA <b>Well</b> <b>Clear</b> (DAAWC) to provide a quantified <b>Well</b> <b>Clear</b> volume to allow systems to be designed and measured against. Extended research efforts have been conducted to understand and quantify system requirements needed to support a UAS pilot's ability to remain <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> of other aircraft. The efforts have included developing and testing sensor, algorithm, alerting, and display requirements. More recently, sensor uncertainty and uncertainty mitigation strategies have been evaluated. This paper discusses results and lessons learned from an End-to-End Verification and Validation (E 2 -V 2) simulation study of a DAA system representative of RTCA SC- 228 's proposed Phase I DAA Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS). NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) was called upon to develop a system that evaluates a specific set of encounters, in a variety of geometries, with end-to-end DAA functionality including the use of sensor and tracker models, a sensor uncertainty mitigation model, DAA algorithmic guidance in both vertical and horizontal maneuvering, and a pilot model which maneuvers the ownship aircraft to remain <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> from intruder aircraft, having received collective input from the previous modules of the system. LaRC developed a functioning batch simulation and added a sensor/tracker model from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center, an in-house developed sensor uncertainty mitigation strategy, and implemented a pilot model similar to one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL). The resulting simulation provides the following key parameters, among others, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the MOPS DAA system: severity of loss of <b>well</b> <b>clear</b> (SLoWC), alert scoring, and number of increasing alerts (alert jitter). The technique, results, and lessons learned from a detailed examination of DAA system performance over specific test vectors and encounter cases during the simulation experiment will be presented in this paper...|$|R
