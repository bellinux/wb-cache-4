50|$|A {{few months}} later, the band, under new moniker Fiction Plane, was signed to MCA/Universal. In {{the summer of}} 2002, Fiction Plane {{recorded}} its debut album, Everything <b>Will</b> Never <b>Be</b> <b>OK</b> with producer David Kahne and engineer Joe Barresi in Los Angeles.

50|$|At a live {{performance}} {{a few years}} later, they {{attracted the attention of}} David Kahne, a producer who escorted them into a studio to record their debut album, Everything <b>Will</b> Never <b>Be</b> <b>OK.</b> Lacking a full-time drummer, they invited Abe Laboriel Jr., a session musician who had played with them before. After the album was released, they hired Pete Wilhoit, a drummer from Bloomington, Indiana, and Fiction Plane was launched.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Hertzfeldt created The Animation Show with Beavis and Butt-head creator Mike Judge. It was a {{biennial}} North American touring festival {{that brought}} independent animated short films to more movie theaters than any distributor in history. The programs were personally curated by Hertzfeldt and Judge. A second Animation Show edition toured throughout 2005, featuring Hertzfeldt's short film The Meaning of Life and new films by animators like Peter Cornwell and Georges Schwizgebel. The third season of The Animation Show began its nationwide release in January 2007, featuring new work by animators Joanna Quinn and Bill Plympton, {{as well as}} Hertzfeldt's own Everything <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>OK.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hertzfeldt's work {{commonly}} features hand-drawn stick figures, {{in stories}} of black humor, surrealism, and tragicomedy. Some films contain existential and philosophical themes {{while others are}} more straightforwardly slapstick and absurdist. His animation is created traditionally with pen and paper, often with minimal digital aid. Hertzfeldt uses antique 16mm or 35mm–film cameras to photograph his drawings and often employs old-fashioned special effect techniques such as multiple exposures, in-camera mattes, and experimental photography. While some of these techniques are as established as an occasional stop-motion animation sequence or a universe of moving stars created by back-lit pin holes, other effects are new innovations on classical methods, as seen with the in-camera compositing of multiple, split-screen windows of action in the Everything <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>OK</b> films.|$|E
2500|$|Everything <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>OK</b> was {{released}} in 2006 and became Hertzfeldt's most critically successful piece to date, receiving his strongest reviews. The film was described as [...] "probably the best work he's done in his very incredible and consistently amazing young career." ...|$|E

5000|$|Fullarton was at high risk, {{and during}} intense {{fighting}} {{he was shot}} through the stomach. He lay, prone and silent, for several hours {{so as not to}} be identified by Franco's Nationalists. Without anaesthetics, doctors probed to find the bullet in his body with a long needle. As he wrote home from his sickbed: [...] "The bullet made an ugly hole but I <b>will</b> soon <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> again. These explosive bullets that the fascists are using make a helluva mess of you. It enters you and only makes a small hole, but when it is inside it explodes and where it comes out it blows all the flesh with it." [...] After a period of convalescence in Catalonia, on 23 December 1938, Fullarton was transported back to Great Britain, aged 19. In Glasgow he struggled to find work, his name tainted by association with the Spanish war, an experience repeated when he tried to join the Royal Air Force.|$|R

2500|$|The {{hijacking}} {{began at}} 8:14am—15 {{minutes after the}} flight departed—when beverage service would be starting. At this time, the pilots stopped responding to air traffic control, and the aircraft began deviating from the planned route. At 8:18am, flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney began making phone calls to American Airlines to report what was happening. Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38am, a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK.</b> We are returning to the airport." [...] "Nobody move, everything <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK.</b> If you try to make any moves you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] "Nobody move, please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves." [...] The plane's transponder was turned off at 8:28am. At 8:46:40am, Atta flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.|$|E
500|$|The first lap {{collision}} between Kvyat and Vettel {{that put}} the latter {{out of the race}} was a major talking point afterwards. The two had already been embroiled in an argument after the previous Grand Prix in China, when Vettel felt that Kvyat had caused a collision between the two Ferrari drivers. This time around, Vettel reacted to his retirement with what The Telegraph described as [...] "one of the most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years". He later demanded an apology from Kvyat, as did Red Bull teammate Ricciardo, who felt that Kvyat, who pushed Vettel into him, had ruined his race as well. Red Bull announced that they would summon Kvyat to talks about the incident, calling their race a [...] "disaster", with Helmut Marko, the team's young driver coordinator, calling him [...] "over-motivated". Kvyat received three penalty points on his licence {{as a result of the}} incident. He himself said after the race: [...] "I apologise to everyone who is involved and I will learn from it. I think we have to speak. It is easy now to attack me and I guess everyone <b>will,</b> but I <b>am</b> <b>OK</b> with that." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Hertzfeldt {{combined}} {{his short}} film trilogy {{about a man}} named Bill (Everything <b>Will</b> <b>Be</b> <b>OK,</b> I Am So Proud of You, and It's Such a Beautiful Day), into a seamless new feature film, It's Such a Beautiful Day, which had a limited theatrical release in autumn 2012.

2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK.</b> I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
