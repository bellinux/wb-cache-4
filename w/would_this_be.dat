25|$|People began petitioning the King {{for relief}} against unfair judgments, {{and as the}} number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King {{delegated}} the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism:Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure <b>would</b> <b>this</b> <b>be?</b> One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.|$|E
500|$|Process {{theology}} typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather {{than seeing}} God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands", {{and as the}} being who is supremely affected by temporal events. [...] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers â€“ so why <b>would</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> a praise-worthy quality in God? [...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. [...] However, process theology has been formulated {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a [...] "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Meade {{was close}} behind Lee, and had {{cut off the}} line of retreat back to Virginia. Lee had to fight, but first he had to rush to {{reassemble}} his scattered forces at the crossroads town of Gettysburg before Meade defeated them piecemeal. Lee had 60,000 infantry and 10,200 cavalry (Meade's [...] staff estimated Lee had 140,000). <b>Would</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> enough to challenge the United States on its home ground? This time it was Lee's turn to be fooled; he gullibly swallowed misinformation that suggested Meade had twice as many soldiers, when in fact he had 86,000.|$|E

50|$|A {{heat sink}} is {{sometimes}} {{used in conjunction}} with a fan to increase the rate of airflow over the heat sink. This maintains a larger temperature gradient by replacing warmed air faster than convection <b>would.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> known as a forced air system.|$|R
2500|$|In Earths in the Universe, it is {{stated that}} he conversed with spirits from Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Saturn, Venus and the Moon as well as spirits from planets beyond the solar system. From the 'encounters', he {{concluded}} that the planets {{of our solar system}} are inhabited and that such an enormous undertaking as the universe could not have been created for just one race on a planet or one 'Heaven' derived from its properties per planet. Many Heavenly societies were also needed to increase the perfection of the angelic Heavens and Heaven to fill in deficiencies and gaps in other societies. He argued: [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> to God, Who is infinite, and to whom a thousand or tens of thousands of planets, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be scarcely anything!" [...] Swedenborg and the question of life on other planets has been extensively reviewed elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|Amalgamation {{is also a}} {{term used}} in {{linguistics}} when a compound contains roots from several languages, without it {{being part of a}} blended language.

Do you think DÃ¼rer's work would be better if it were more like that? And would you have me, therefore, leaving the question of technical method of production altogether to the craftsman, consider pictorial engraving simply as the production of a light-and-shade drawing, by some method permitting its multiplication for the public? ...|$|E

Not anything short of that I should think. Can Christian Science banish that four-fifths? I think so. Can any other (organised) force do it? None that I know of. <b>Would</b> <b>this</b> <b>be</b> a new world when that was accomplished? And a pleasanter one--for us well people, as well as for those fussy and fretting sick ones?
