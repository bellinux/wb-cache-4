In 30 AD, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide.

25|$|As dance progressed {{into the}} 19th century, the {{emphasis}} on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe {{without the aid of}} wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad their toes for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.|$|E

In addition to the similarities and evidence of borrowing from Canon law and the Bible, scholars who hold this position ask how any non Clerics could have been sufficiently literate at this period to create the texts. Other scholars, known as nativists, have asked how the differences could arise if the authors of canon and secular law were indeed the same.|$|E

25|$|On May 8, Pavelić {{ordered that}} the columns from NDH {{continue}} to Austria, {{and that they}} refuse to surrender to the advancing Communists, instead planning to surrender to the British. However, they were instead turned back in the mid-May Bleiburg repatriations, and many were subsequently killed by the Partisans.

25|$|Some in the NDH and Slovene {{political}} and military leadership believed that the Western Allies will use them as anti-Communist forces and thus enable them to return to Yugoslavia and restore power with their support. Slovenian Bishop Gregorij Rožman made {{an appeal to the}} Allies to occupy Slovenia and prevent the Communists from taking power. The NDH leadership abolished racial laws and on 6 May sent a request for collaboration with the Allies, but all of these efforts failed. While the NDH leadership may have organized a civilian retreat to bolster their claims that the Yugoslav Communists were after innocent civilian victims, the sheer number of civilians slowed down the retreat, made surrender to the Allies unfeasible, and ultimately led to the belief that they <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a human shield to the Ustaša. However, the majority of the civilian refugees consisted of those that had anti-Communist views or feared reprisals.|$|E
25|$|The Poona Division's {{had planned}} on {{a maximum of}} 6 percent of the {{division}} becoming casualties. In addition to each battalion's surgeons, there were the field ambulance units assigned {{to each of the}} brigades. However, these units were not intended to function as hospitals, and were only supposed to triage and stabilize the wounded before sending them back to field hospital units. Line of communication troops had to donate their own supplies to the medical units that were overrun with casualties. With Townshend's offensive, there was only one river boat equipped as a hospital ship. With the ambulances full, many of the wounded were placed on A.T. carts, which <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> simple carts pulled by animals that performed most of the land hauling {{at this point in the}} campaign. In some cases, the wounded were simply laid atop boxes of ammunition or other supplies. With animal transport limited by short-sighted decisions of Nixon and his predecessors, the Poona Division only 330 animal pulled carts and 740 animals to pull them.|$|E

500|$|From the Persian perspective, {{such terms}} {{would not be}} so humiliating as they might at first seem. The Persians already allowed the Greek cities of Asia to be governed under their own laws (under the {{reorganization}} conducted by Artaphernes, following the Ionian Revolt). By these terms, the Ionians were still Persian subjects, as they had been. Furthermore, Athens had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the Eurymedon and Salamis-in-Cyprus, so any legal limitations for the Persian fleet <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> [...] "de jure" [...] recognition of military realities. In exchange for limiting the movement of Persian troops in one region of the realm, Artaxerxes secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm.|$|E

500|$|The course {{used for}} the race {{was the same as}} had been {{used for the}} 1904 and 1905 Gordon Bennett trials, a [...] course {{featuring}} over 420 corners which followed much of the modern day Snaefell Mountain Course, known as the Highroads Course (or Highlands). The lap began at Quarterbridge in Douglas and proceeded down the A5 road towards Castletown, then back up the A3 to Ballaugh where it then headed towards Jurby along the A10, but turned onto the A13 towards Ramsey. From Ramsey the course followed the A18, commonly known as the Mountain Road, back to Douglas. The elevation of the Isle of Man was challenging for the cars; the course rose from being barely above sea-level at Douglas to [...] at Brandywell. Many parts of the course <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> rough tracks. In order to minimise disruption to the public two footbridges were built over the roads of the course, one at Kirkmichael and the other at Ramsey.|$|E

500|$|The Lost Tapes was {{met with}} {{widespread}} acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 12 reviews. In Entertainment Weekly, Craig Seymour said Nas' [...] "gritty, yet hopeful, reflections made Lost Tapes a real find." [...] Rolling Stone critic Jon Caramanica hailed it as [...] "the real Stillmatic", writing that it [...] "displayed Nas' gifts for tightly stitched narrative and stunningly precise detail." [...] In The A.V. Club, Nathan Rabin deemed it a masterpiece whose assorted tracks cohered {{as well as any}} of Nas' official studio albums while reaffirming his reputation as [...] "rap music's poet laureate of urban despair". Ken Capobianco from The Boston Globe said the leftover songs proved why Nas had so much promise early in his career, while Spins Chris Ryan viewed the record as a hip hop version of Bob Dylan's much-bootlegged Basement Tapes—"a raw document [...] still proves that Nas had it all along." [...] PopMatters critic Marc L. Hill called it a [...] "masterfully arranged" [...] and [...] "necessary addition to the collection of any hip-hop fan". In The Village Voice, Christgau was particularly impressed by the four autobiographical songs closing the album, preferring them to other songs he felt <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> outtakes. In a less enthusiastic review, Brett Berliner from Stylus Magazine wrote that as good as the songs were, [...] "they don't make a real album ... like a superb mixtape", while Billboards Rashaun Hall believed the production on some of the songs sounded outdated.|$|E
500|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that the Pryor Mountains horses were direct descendants of the Barb horses brought to North America by Juan de Oñate's expedition to explore America north of the Rio Grande in the early 1600s. Bloodlines may also include American Saddlebred, Canadian, Irish Hobby, [...] and Tennessee Walking horses. In the early 1900s, stallions of Thoroughbred and Arabian ancestry were also turned out onto the range. However, the breeding of the Pryor Mountain herd was in dispute for many years. [...] One horseman hired {{by the federal government}} during the 1920s to round up excess feral horses on the range stated, [...] "The whole country around was overrun with thousands of homesteaders' horses... but this little band... were, and are, the genuine Spanish horses and there were about 70 head. [...] I did not try to get them and hoped that no one else ever would." [...] Other people claimed that the horses <b>were</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> local domestic horses which had escaped to the wild. [...] In 1992, equine geneticist Dr. E. Gus Cothran conducted genetic studies on the herd, and concluded that their primary bloodlines did descend from Spanish Barbs. Since no genetic variants were observed not also seen in domestic horse breeds, in 2010 Cothran also concluded the horses were not a unique species which had survived in North America from prehistoric times. Rather, they were linear descendants of the Spanish Barb, with some evidence of genetic similarity to light racing and riding breeds. The genetic tests also revealed that the Pryor Mountains horses carried a rare allele variant known as [...] "Qac" [...] that only Spanish horses brought to the Americas also carried. Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg of the Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, an expert on horse breeds, observed that, physically, the horses conform to the Colonial Spanish Horse type.|$|E
