25|$|Upon launch, Central's {{on screen}} {{presentation}} featured a sphere (which resembled a moon or a total eclipse) which <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> open with light, before reforming, {{accompanied by a}} light jingle, but was dropped and revised during 1983, so the moon ident would just appear of darkness with the colour spectrum appearing to its left hand side. This ident was dropped locally in 1985, but remained {{on the front and}} end of networked programmes until 1988.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1862, Henry J. Hunt {{attempted}} to get the Parrott eliminated from the Army of the Potomac's inventory, preferring the 3-inch ordnance rifle. During battles when the Parrott gun <b>would</b> <b>burst,</b> artillerists would chip out the jagged parts and continue firing. In 1889, The New York Times called on the Ordnance Bureau of the War Department to discontinue use of the Parrott gun altogether, following a series of mishaps at the West Point training grounds.|$|E

25|$|Predictions {{that the}} bubble <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> {{emerged during the}} dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. Predictions about a future burst {{increased}} following the October 27, 1997 mini-crash, {{in the wake of}} the Asian crisis. This caused an uncertain economic climate during the first few months of 1998. However conditions improved, and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May 2000 in an effort to cool the economy to achieve a soft landing. The burst of the stock market bubble occurred in the form of the NASDAQ crash in March 2000. Growth in gross domestic product slowed considerably in the third quarter of 2000 to the lowest rate since a contraction in the first quarter of 1992.|$|E
25|$|French war {{powder in}} 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 12.5% {{charcoal}}, 12.5% sulfur. English war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. The British Congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the British Mark VII gunpowder {{was changed to}} 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. The explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. Powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time—whereas powders for weapons such as flintlocks, cap-locks, or matchlocks need a higher burn rate to accelerate the projectile in a much shorter distance. Cannons usually used lower burn rate powders, because most <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> with higher burn rate powders.|$|E
25|$|One day, {{during an}} attack on the Somme, Z company {{encountered}} a party of Germans who were well dug in. Grenades did not succeed in shifting them, so Livens threw in two five gallon oil drums; the burning oil was so effective that Livens' comrade, Harry Strange, wondered whether {{it would be better to}} use containers to carry flame to the enemy rather than relying on a complex flame thrower. Reflecting on the incident, Livens and Strange considered how a really large shell filled with fuel might be thrown. Although the key idea of throwing a large container of oil was due to Strange, it was Livens who went on to develop a large, but simple, mortar that could throw a three-gallon drum of oil which <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> when it landed...|$|E

[...] The carbon dioxide that resulted from the fermentation remained trapped in the bottles and dissolved into the liquid, resulting in high levels of carbonation. [...] During this period, an average of four to five percent of the bottles <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> due to carbonation levels exceeding the strength of the bottles.|$|E
500|$|The {{combustible}} liquid could be shot from catapults, and <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> into flames on impact. Siphons, frequently of copper, were also developed, first {{appearing in the}} 10th and 11th centuries. The siphons could shoot a blazing stream, which a 10th-century Mesopotamian source claimed could engulf twelve men. [...] Mardi bin Ali al-Tarsusi, who wrote a military manual for Saladin in the 12th century, suggested that [...] "naft" [...] could be placed inside blown eggshells, which could be thrown from horseback.

It was found that when uranium was cut, the shavings <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> into flame. Working with Alcoa and General Electric, the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.|$|E
500|$|The {{exploding}} pustules {{were carefully}} rigged to burst on command. Makeup supervisor Toby Lindala constructed a handheld device that connected via tube to the faux sores. When {{the device was}} pressed, the pustule <b>would</b> <b>burst.</b> Filming the scenes was particularly arduous; he later noted [...] "I was jammed underneath one of the bus seats with these extras basically stepping on my head." [...] The X-Files director Frank Spotnitz remarked, [...] "When we saw the pustule bursting on film, we just laughed {{because it was just}} so over-the-top grotesque." [...] The Costa Rican forest at the opening was shot at the Seymour Demonstration Forest in Northern Vancouver, which also served as Puerto Rico in season opener [...] "Little Green Men". The city of Delta served for both the gas station and the bus station—actually a redecorated Dodge/Chrysler car dealership.|$|E

50|$|The {{altitude}} {{of the explosion}} was important because a ground or near ground <b>burst</b> <b>would</b> produce radioactive fallout, whereas an air <b>burst</b> <b>would</b> produce only short distance and short lived initial radiations (but no fallout).

500|$|When {{other girls}} were {{thinking}} of marriage, Mimi Stanley talked of challenges and adventures.

She became a resident trainee nurse at the Woolton Convalescent Hospital, to which Smith delivered milk every morning. Smith started seriously courting Mimi in the spring of 1932, but was constantly thwarted by her indifference and her father's interference.

500|$|Menken became {{involved}} with the film {{in the early stages}} of the film's development and invited Schwartz to resume their collaboration. They began the songwriting process by searching for the right moments in the story in which a song moment was allowed. Schwartz found that it was easier to justify situations in which the characters <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> into songs in Enchanted than in other live-action musicals as its concept [...] "allowed the characters to sing in a way that was completely integral to the plot of the story." [...] The three songs Giselle sings contain references to earlier Disney films. The first song played in the film, [...] "True Love's Kiss", was written to be [...] "a send-up of, and an homage to, the style of those Disney animated features", namely, [...] "I'm Wishing" [...] (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and [...] "A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes" [...] (Cinderella), during which Disney heroines sing about the joy of being loved. It posed a challenge for Menken and Schwartz because of the [...] "many preconceptions with that number"; it had to be reflective of the era of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Cinderella. Accordingly, Amy Adams performed the first song in an operetta style in contrast to the Broadway style of the later songs.|$|E
500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings {{had a profound effect}} on me. I had never seen anything that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that <b>would</b> <b>burst</b> out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E
