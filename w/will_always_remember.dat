[...] "It will crown my life" [...] he said.

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. It featured an unusual amount of animation glitches because the animation studio in Korea was training {{a new group of}} animators, and this episode was one of their first efforts. Show runner Mike Reiss said he <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> it as the episode [...] "that came back animated with a thousand mistakes in it and was just a complete and utter mess." [...] Reardon said there was [...] "literally a mistake in every other scene" [...] when the episode came back from Korea. Several scenes had to be re-animated in the United States because of these glitches, but according to Reardon, [...] "you can still see the lesser ones that got through, such as line quality problems particularly in the first act." [...] Though it aired in season three, [...] "When Flanders Failed" [...] was produced during the previous season. It was recorded in spring 1991 when the previous season came to an end, and was scheduled to air in autumn that year. The staff therefore had more time to fix the glitches during the summer.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{is portrayed as}} having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back, while in reality, Sparrow escaped the island by bartering with rum traders. The video game [...] bases itself on these tall tales, including the sacking of Nassau port without firing a shot. Depp has likened pirates to rock stars in that their fame preceded them. Sparrow insists on being addressed as [...] "Captain" [...] and often gives the farewell, [...] "This is the day you <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!" [...] which is sometimes humorously cut off. When Norrington accuses him of being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies, [...] "But you have heard of me." [...] In a deleted scene from The Curse of the Black Pearl Sparrow ponders being [...] "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow", and during At World's End he again is interested in immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns {{it can be a}} terrible curse. Sparrow ponders being [...] "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," [...] as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.|$|E

2500|$|... "Harry Schwarz will {{be remembered}} for his signal {{contribution}} to the development of our democracy. His piercing intellect, and long professional experience in banking, made him the most astute analyst in Parliament on economic and financial matters during his terms in office. He had strong leadership qualities and could inspire people to great achievements. He was an outstanding debater, both inside and outside Parliament. He could stand his ground against all-comers. His principled and steadfast resistance to racial nationalism was rooted in the key role he played in fighting Nazism during World War 2. He continued his resistance to racial nationalism through his long and distinguished career in South African opposition politics. He has engraved his place in South Africa's political history. We <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> him".|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War, after Nazi Germany {{commenced}} {{its mass}} executions of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid {{victims of the}} Holocaust and directed the Church to provide discreet aid to Jews. Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, said: [...] "Jews <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> what the Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory." [...] This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who in his book, Hitler's Pope, argues that the pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews {{out of fear of}} provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{lost their}} {{opportunity}} to return home, Fry, Bender, and the Professor resign themselves {{to going to}} the end of time. After the last existing proton decays, they are amazed to discover that the now empty universe undergoes another Big Bang, and furthermore that it replicates the same universe and its exact events, instead of having unique inhabitants and history. They realize that they can continue forward in time and eventually reach the moment that they left in the new copy of the universe. They succeed after overshooting their first attempt, though the new universe is about 10-feet lower than the previous one, causing the time machine to crush their duplicates in the new universe to death as they enter their machine (avoiding a [...] ). Fry rushes to meet Leela and manages to make it to their date on time. After dinner, Fry apologizes for losing his birthday card to her, but Leela dismisses it and tells him that she <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> their time together. Bender can be seen under the bridge they stand on, burying the bodies of the dead duplicates.|$|E

I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings {{as if he wanted to}} thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gilgamesh {{observes that}} Utnapishtim seems no {{different}} from himself, and asks him how he obtained his immortality. Utnapishtim explains that the gods decided to send a great flood. To save Utnapishtim the god Ea told him to build a boat. He gave him precise dimensions, and it was sealed with pitch and bitumen. His entire family went aboard together with his craftsmen and [...] "all the animals of the field". A violent storm then arose which caused the terrified gods to retreat to the heavens. Ishtar lamented the wholesale destruction of humanity, and the other gods wept beside her. The storm lasted six days and nights, after which [...] "all the human beings turned to clay". Utnapishtim weeps {{when he sees the}} destruction. His boat lodges on a mountain, and he releases a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven fails to return, he opens the ark and frees its inhabitants. Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell the sweet savor and gather around. Ishtar vows that just as she will never forget the brilliant necklace that hangs around her neck, she <b>will</b> <b>always</b> <b>remember</b> this time. When Enlil arrives, angry that there are survivors, she condemns him for instigating the flood. Ea also castigates him for sending a disproportionate punishment. Enlil blesses Utnapishtim and his wife, and rewards them with eternal life. This account matches the flood story that concludes the Epic of Atra-Hasis (see also Gilgamesh flood myth).|$|E
