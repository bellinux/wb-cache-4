500|$|Chris Fehn {{was brought}} in to replace Darner on {{percussion}} before Slipknot traveled to Malibu, California, to work on their debut album in September 1998. Partway through the recording process of the album, Slipknot returned to Des Moines for the Christmas period. During that period, guitarist Brainard decided to leave the band. Brainard said, [...] "some decisions were made that I wasn't particularly happy with". Slipknot later recruited Jim Root to complete their lineup and the band returned to Malibu to continue work on the album. [...] Work on the album concluded in early 1999, allowing the band to go on their first tour as part of the Ozzfest lineup in 1999. Ozzfest greatly increased Slipknot's audience, furthering the band's success with their self-titled album that was released on June 29, 1999. Slipknot released its first home video <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> Neighborhood, which was directed by Thomas Mignone, and the singles [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] and [...] "Spit It Out", which were also directed by Mignone. The singles received some airplay, but Slipknot quickly developed a large following, mainly from touring and word of mouth. The band toured several countries throughout 1999 and 2000 in support of the album. In early 2000, Slipknot was certified platinum; a first for an album released by Roadrunner Records.|$|E
500|$|Timbaland {{began his}} {{producing}} career for R acts. In the mid-1990s, {{he produced a}} few songs for R acts such as Jodeci and Sista. In 1996, he made his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. This included the major hit singles [...] "If Your Girl Only Knew" [...] by Aaliyah and [...] "Pony" [...] by Ginuwine. While Timbaland was initially producing for R artists, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip-hop with its fast-paced nature and clear drum breaks. He was taking a hip-hop sound and applying it to R, {{and in this way}} his sound was instrumental in blurring the distinction between hip-hop and R production. In 1997, he fully produced Supa Dupa Fly, the debut album of Missy Elliott, who had been a childhood friend of Mosley. In this album Timbaland continued with his now trademark electronic production style, but since Missy frequently rapped the music was considered hip-hop. Also in 1997, he released his first album with his partner Magoo, <b>Welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>Our</b> World, also a hip-hop album. In the late 1990s, his hip-hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high-profile hip-hop artists including Jay-Z, Nas, and The LOX. In 1999, he scored a major hit with Jay Z and rap group UGK with the hit [...] "Big Pimpin'". He also fully produced Missy's second album in 1999, Da Real World. Still Timbaland in this period produced primarily for R artists. He continued to produce for Ginuwine and Aaliyah, as well as contributing significantly to albums by Xscape, Nicole, Playa, and Total. He remixed Usher's major hit [...] "You Make Me Wanna". In the early 2000s Timbaland produced songs including Ludacris' [...] "Roll Out (My Business)", Jay-Z's [...] "Hola' Hovito", Petey Pablo's [...] "Raise Up", and Beck's cover of David Bowie's [...] "Diamond Dogs" [...] during this period. He also contributed three songs, all eventually released as singles, to Aaliyah’s self-titled third album, the exotic lead single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] (featuring himself rapping a verse), [...] "More than a Woman", and the ballad [...] "I Care 4 U". He also makes an appearance in Aaliyah's single [...] "Try Again", which he also produced and co-wrote.|$|E
