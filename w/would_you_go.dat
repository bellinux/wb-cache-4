2500|$|Grace took a vehemently pro-prosecution {{position}} {{throughout the}} 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, in which Crystal Gail Mangum, a stripper and North Carolina Central University student, falsely accused {{three members of}} Duke University's men's lacrosse team of raping her at a party. Prior to Duke suspending its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over a little thing like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to a cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] After the disbarment of District Attorney Mike Nifong, Attorney General Roy Cooper pronounced all three players innocent of the rape charges made by Mangum and Nifong. On the following broadcast of her show, Grace did not appear and a substitute reporter, Jane Velez-Mitchell, announced the removal of all charges.|$|E
2500|$|Among those giving {{extensive}} coverage {{to the matter}} was Nancy Grace. [...] Before Duke suspended its men's lacrosse team's season, she sarcastically noted on the air, [...] "I'm so glad they didn't miss a lacrosse game over a little thing like gang rape!" [...] and [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to a cop in an alleged gang rape case, say, and lie and give misleading information?" [...] Another, Susan Estrich, said [...] "I teach criminal law. But what are we dealing with here? The mafia, or a sports team from a first-class university. Instead, they hire them lawyers to trash the victim and the prosecutor." [...] Former prosecutor Wendy Murphy supplied the case {{with some of the}} most inflammatory claims and supported Nifong's withholding of evidence saying, [...] "Nifong should be rewarded for respecting the defendants' rights by not leaking the type of evidence that could help him personally respond to criticism." [...] Murphy said [...] "I never, ever met a false rape claim, by the way. My own statistics speak to the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|GM (Genetically modified) grains are {{not allowed}} in South Australia, where some grain {{producers}} have called for the moratorium to be lifted. [...] They argue the GM technology would help them tackle weeds and other pests, and that farmers {{should be able to}} choose how they run their enterprises {{and whether or not they}} wanted to grow the 'premium products' described by Leon Bignell, the South Australian (SA) Agriculture Minister. Producers have also said their GM-free grain is not translating to higher profits. Bignell conceded more work needed to be done to market produce as GM-free but said he was confident producers would see higher financial returns in the near future. [...] In March 2015, Bignell told farmers they should not use GM but should instead rely upon what he called [...] 'God's gifts'. [...] He said the [...] "amazing" [...] results of the Government's 'New Horizons' [...] soil improvement program [...] "prove," [...] in his view, that grain producers [...] "do not need genetic modification technology." [...] He said that [...] "Instead of using the top five centimetres of the soil, you go down to 50cm or even deeper. You put clay in it when it's needed, you put organic matter where it's needed as well." [...] Bignell said the trials had strengthened his view that South Australia should maintain a moratorium on GM technology, which he said gave the state's produce a [...] "market edge". [...] Bignell also said he believed results of the New Horizons program could be replicated in all grain growing areas of the state. Bignell added that [...] "If you look at GM and the promises around increases of about seven per cent in yields, why <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> for seven per cent when you can get 50 to 100 per cent increases in yield without having to use genetically modified seeds?" ...|$|E
