40|$|To develop high-flux and high-rejection forward osmosis (FO) {{membranes}} for <b>water</b> <b>reuses</b> and seawater desalination, we have fabricated polybenzimidazole (PBI) nanofiltration (NF) {{hollow fiber}} membranes {{with a thin}} wall and a desired pore size via non-solvent induced phase inversion and chemically cross-linking modification. The cross-linking by p-xylylene dichloride can finely tune the mean pore size and enhance the salt selectivity. High water permeation flux and improved salt selectivity for <b>water</b> <b>reuses</b> were achieved by using the 2 -h modified PBI NF membrane which has a narrow pore size distribution. Cross-linking at a longer time produces even a lower salt permeation flux potentially suitable for desalination but {{at the expense of}} permeation flux due to tightened pore sizes. It is found that draw solution concentration and membrane orientations are main factors determining the water permeation flux. In addition, effects of membrane morphology and operation conditions on water and salt transport through membrane have been investigated. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
25|$|Besides that, Article 12 of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive {{concerning}} the reuse of treated wastewater states that “treated wastewater shall be reused whenever appropriate”, is not specific enough to promote <b>water</b> <b>reuse</b> and it leaves too {{much room for}} interpretation as to what {{can be considered as}} an “appropriate” situation to reuse treated wastewater.|$|E

30|$|Based {{on current}} knowledge, we hypothesize that Nile tilapia can be cultured in biofloc using up to 100 % <b>reuse</b> <b>water</b> derived from other BFT systems because {{previous}} {{studies have shown that}} Nile tilapia tolerates adverse environmental conditions and is considered {{to be one of the}} most physiologically adaptable species to biofloc culture, which allows cultivation at high densities (Day et al. 2016; Pérez-Fuentes et al. 2016). If implemented successfully, this strategy could offer a sustainable alternative to both Nile tilapia production and water use. The objective of the study was to evaluate the productive performance, organosomatic indices and proximal composition of the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus, cultivated at a high density using <b>water</b> <b>reused</b> from prior BFT cultures.|$|R

25|$|Compared to {{the overall}} water use in Morocco, {{reclaimed}} water can only provide {{a fraction of the}} country's increasing water needs. Furthermore, there is no regulatory framework for <b>water</b> <b>reuse</b> and no established system to recover the costs for reclaimed water from users. The country's largest reuse project is currently under construction in Marrakech, where reclaimed water from a 90,000 m3/day plant will be reused primarily to irrigate golf courses. The tertiary treatment and the network to distribute the reclaimed water will be financed by private investors. Redal, the utility serving Rabat, was carrying out a study in 2009 to assess the feasibility of wastewater reuse to irrigate green spaces in the city. Besides this {{there have been a few}} scattered small-scale pilot reuse projects since the 1980s, some of which have been abandoned. Among the sustainable projects is a project to irrigate golf courses in Ben Slimane that has been operating since 1997 with a capacity of 5,600 cubic meter/day. In 2009 a large reuse project was planned in Agadir to irrigate a golf course and municipal gardens with 50,000 cubic meters/day. In 2009 there were also two projects for direct, planned reuse in agriculture in Oujda and Beni Mellal. These projects are financed by the National Environmental Fund and would add a tertia2bb03c3e1; centralauth_Session=1reatment plants.

25|$|The {{health and}} {{environmental}} safety conditions under which wastewater may be reused are not specifically regulated at the European Union (EU) level.

In the Water Framework Directive, reuse of water is mentioned {{as one of the}} possible measures to achieve the Directive’s quality goals, however this remains a relatively vague recommendation rather than a requirement: Part B of Annex VI refers to reuse as one of the “supplementary measures which Member States within each river basin district may choose to adopt as part of the programme of measures required under Article 11(4)”.|$|E
25|$|Planned reuse of {{reclaimed}} {{water from}} Greater Irbid in the Jordan Valley. A major <b>water</b> <b>reuse</b> project is being planned to reuse water from three {{wastewater treatment plants}} {{in the area of}} Irbid in the North of Jordan through a project supported in the framework of Jordanian-German cooperation. As of 2006, only 14% of the wastewater from these plants was being reused. An explanation for this is that farmers in the Jordan Valley are reluctant to use the reclaimed water, which they perceive to be of poor quality, for irrigation. The wastewater thus flows into the Jordan River, unused. In the future, the treated effluent from the three plants will flow through a pipe into the Jordan Valley, generating hydropower from the elevation differential of more than 1,000m. It will then be mixed with freshwater and delivered to the farmers in a quality that is acceptable to them.|$|E
