5|$|In November 2012, {{after a week}} of {{conflict}} between Israel and Palestinian militant groups, a ceasefire brokered by Egypt was announced on November 21. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. According to an analysis by the New York Times, men ages 20–29, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be militants, are most overrepresented in the death toll.|$|E

Langdon and Vittoria search for the preferiti in hopes that they will also find the antimatter canister. Their search is assisted by Camerlengo Carlo Ventresca (the late pope's closest aide), the Vatican's Swiss Guard and Commander Olivetti.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Satyajit Chavan is {{the head}} doctor at a civil {{hospital}} in Delhi. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but he has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, {{most of whom are}} young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients and that beds must be allocated to the ones <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals (especially in large cities like Mumbai) are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment.|$|E

25|$|One {{objection}} is that {{a democratic}} republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech {{in the context of}} the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism {{is that a}} government requiring or promoting this phrase violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Super Columbine Massacre {{was largely}} {{condemned}} by the press. Betty Nguyen of CNN labeled {{the game as}} an example of a subculture that worships terrorists. Newspapers called the game [...] "exploitive" [...] and a [...] "monstrosity". PC World declared the game #2 on its list of [...] "The 10 Worst Games of All Time." [...] Even critics who were supportive of Ledonne's intent found the game hard to play; Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica said that he left the game [...] "shaken", but that as an easily misunderstood game [...] "the people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> gain anything from it will never play it." [...] Crecente felt that the message of the game was obscured by the cartoon graphics of the medium. Ledonne has refused to alter the game as it represents his thoughts on the subject at a particular point in time, but has encouraged others to rework the game themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Familial DNA searching (sometimes {{referred}} to as [...] "familial DNA" [...] or [...] "familial DNA database searching") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found {{at the scene of}} a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match. After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the forensic profile. To eliminate the majority of this list when the forensic DNA is a man's, crime lab technicians conduct Y-STR analysis. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from public records and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members' involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as witness or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.|$|E

Are not these corruptions gotten among the meanest of our people, who, for a piece of money, will give their votes at a venture, for the disposal of their own lives and fortunes, without considering whether it be to those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> betray or defend them? But, if I were to produce only one instance of a hundred wherein we fail in this duty of loving our country, it would be an endless labour; and therefore I shall not attempt it.|$|E

60|$|In {{just the}} same way, I want the unfaithful husband or the unfaithful wife in a farcical comedy not to bother me with their divorce cases or the stratagems they employ to avoid a divorce case, but {{to tell me how}} and why married couples are unfaithful. I don't want to hear the lies they tell one another to conceal what they have done, but the truths they tell one another when they have to face what they have done without {{concealment}} or excuse. No doubt prudent and considerate people conceal such adventures, when they can, from those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be wounded by them; but it is not to be presumed that, when found out, they necessarily disgrace themselves by irritating lies and transparent subterfuges.|$|E

It is better not to break into houses and seize them; for, {{although}} we are acting legally and under the authority of act of parliament, it is always as well to avoid giving cause of complaint, which might tend to excite a feeling against the war and make the government unpopular, and which, moreover, might do you harm with the good citizens, and do me harm with those above me.

6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} there is no Saviour from sin of any kind but Jesus Christ. The remedy pointed out in that little book is, I am told, a good and {{effective}} one, but without the Spirit of God no man has power to persevere in the application of the remedy. He will get wearied of the continuous effort; he will not avoid temptation; he will lose heart in the battle unless he has a higher motive than his own deliverance to urge him on. Why, sirs, what would you expect from the soldier who, in battle, thought of nothing but himself and his own safety, his own deliverance from the dangers around him? Is it not those men who boldly face the enemy with the love of Queen and country and comrades and duty strong in their breasts, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> conquer? In the matter of drink the man who trusts to remedies alone will surely fail, because the disease is moral as well as physical. The physical remedy will not cure the soul's disease, but the moral remedy--the acceptance of Jesus-- will not only cure the soul, but will secure to us that spiritual influence which will enable us to `persevere to the end' with the physical. Thus Jesus will save both soul and body--`it is God who giveth us the victory.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that. I repeat the word principles; for {{when you have a}} class of men who are removed from a large range of temptations, without being placed above public opinion, you get {{precisely}} those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> uphold that sort of secondary, but highly useful morals which are not directly derived from purely religious duties. Against the last I shall not say one word, as it comes from the grace, which is of the power of God, and is happily as accessible to the poor as to the rich, and more too; but, of men as they are, not one in a hundred regulates his life by a standard created under such impulses; and even when they do, the standard itself is, in some degree, qualified by the ordinary notions I apprehend. The Christian morality of an East Indian is not identical with that of a Puritan, or that of a man of highly cultivated mind with that of one who has enjoyed fewer advantages. There is one class of principles, embracing all those that are adverse to the littlenesses of daily practice, which is much the more extended among the liberal-minded and educated, and it is to that set of principles I refer. Now we want a due proportion of that class of men, as our society is getting to be organized; of those who are superior to meannesses." ...|$|E
6000|$|How rich {{in strange}} and {{touching}} utterances {{have been the}} last fifty years of English literature. Do you think that God has been teaching us nothing in them? Will He not make our children listen to that teaching, whether we like or not? And suppose our most modern writers had added nothing to the stock of national knowledge, which I most fervently deny, yet are they not actually influencing the minds of the young? and can we prevent their doing so either directly or indirectly? If we do not find them right teaching about their own day, will they not be sure to find self-chosen teachers about it themselves, who will be almost certainly the first who may come to hand, and therefore as likely as not to be bad teachers? And do we not see every day that it is just the most tender, the most enthusiastic, the most precious spirits, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be misled, because their honest disgust at the follies of the day has most utterly outgrown their critical training? And that lazy wholesale disapprobation of living writers, so common and convenient, what does it do but injure all reverence for parents and teachers, when the young find out that the poet, who, as they were told, was a bungler and a charlatan, somehow continues to touch the purest and noblest nerves of their souls, and that the author who was said to be dangerous and unchristian, somehow makes them more dutiful, more earnest, more industrious, more loving to the poor? I speak of actual cases. Would to God they were not daily ones! ...|$|E
60|$|Now, my friends, {{this is the}} {{glance over}} the newsman's {{shoulders}} from the whimsical point of view, which is the point, I believe, that most promotes digestion. The newsman is to be met with on steamboats, railway stations, and at every turn. His profits are small, {{he has a great}} amount of anxiety and care, and no little amount of personal wear and tear. He is indispensable to civilization and freedom, and he is looked for with pleasurable excitement every day, except when he lends the paper for an hour, and when he is punctual in calling for it, which is sometimes very painful. I think the lesson we can learn from our newsman is some new illustration of the uncertainty of life, some illustration of its vicissitudes and fluctuations. Mindful of this permanent lesson, some members of the trade originated this society, which affords them assistance in time of sickness and indigence. The subscription is infinitesimal. It amounts annually to five shillings. Looking at the returns before me, the progress of the society would seem to be slow, but it has only been slow for the best of all reasons, that it has been sure. The pensions granted are all obtained from the interest on the funded capital, and, therefore, the Institution is literally as safe as the Bank. It is stated that there are several newsvendors who are not members of this society; but that is true in all institutions which have come under my experience. The persons <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> stand in need of the benefits which an institution confers, are usually the persons to keep away until bitter experience comes to them too late.|$|E
