5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, both ships <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> {{service with}} the new Turkish Navy, with lengthy {{overhauls}} in the mid-1920s. Both ships were extensively modernized in the late 1930s, and they remained in service to 1944, when they were finally decommissioned. Both vessels were ultimately broken up in the early 1950s.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, {{the tower}} was {{obscured}} by the surrounding buildings, and was accessed through the brick-built office in front of it, according to the antiquarian and engraver John Smith. The tower began to become too small for storing all the House of Lords' records, and from 1827 onwards only the acts, journals and minute-books <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the tower.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from Yellowstone National Park; however, {{some had}} died en route.

5|$|In 1945 Ole Lippman, {{leader of}} the Danish section of the Special Operations Executive, invited the British Royal Air Force to assist their {{operations}} by attacking Nazi headquarters in Copenhagen. Accordingly, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Basil Embry drew up plans for a spectacular precision attack on the Sicherheitsdienst and Gestapo building, the former offices of the Shell Oil Company. Political prisoners <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the attic to prevent an air raid, so the RAF had to bomb {{the lower levels of}} the building.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later {{spread to other}} parts of Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks kept Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|It {{was created}} in the 1950s, to {{overcome}} the problems with supersonic planes taking off and landing on aircraft carriers. The program was canceled after a series of unsatisfactory results and a tragic accident on 4 November 1954, when test pilot Charles E. Richbourg was killed when the Sea Dart he was piloting disintegrated in midair. The four surviving planes were retired in 1957, but some <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> reserve until 1962.|$|E

5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{constructed the}} necessary offices {{of a police}} station in the general areas of the bus station, which included {{the offices of the}} District Attorney and the Justice Department. Camp Greyhound did have several issues with police records due to flooding, and prisoners who had committed minor infractions <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the same areas as those with more serious allegations. The facility was run on backup generators and outdated fingerprinting methods were used, which added to the confusion of the facility.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} plant {{specimens}} to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition for future reference, adequate storage conditions are needed.

5|$|The Germans requisitioned {{the former}} Belgian army Fort Breendonk, near Mechelen, {{which was used}} for torture and {{interrogation}} of political prisoners {{and members of the}} resistance. Around 3,500 inmates passed through the camp at Breendonk where they <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> extremely degrading conditions. Around 300 people were killed in the camp itself, with at least 98 of them dying from deprivation or torture.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{public and}} much of the {{military}} command structure <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the dark about the extent of the defeat: Japanese news announced a great victory. Only Emperor Hirohito and the highest Navy command personnel were accurately informed of the carrier and pilot losses. Consequently, even the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) continued to believe, for at least a short time, that the fleet was in good condition.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Menagerie is {{frequently}} referenced {{during the reign}} of HenryIII. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II had presented Henry with three leopards, circa 1235, which <b>were</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Tower. There is evidence, however, that King John (1166 – 1216) had first started keeping wild animals at the Tower. Records from 1210-1212 show payments to lion keepers.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} choice of what pages to <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory (as {{distinct}} from being paged out to auxiliary storage) is important: if too many {{pages of a}} process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time. If too few pages of a process <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then the page fault frequency is greatly increased {{and the number of}} active (non-suspended) processes currently executing in the system approaches zero.|$|R

5|$|The {{privileges}} of the Hasekura family were abolished {{at this point}} by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized.

5|$|Woodhaven Boulevard {{was opened}} on December 31, 1936, as Woodhaven Boulevard–Slattery Plaza. At the time, {{the station was}} part of the Independent Subway System.
