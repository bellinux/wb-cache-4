5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift {{in his first}} film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I Was a Male <b>War</b> <b>Bride,</b> also starring Ann Sheridan.|$|E

25|$|Some plays were {{documented}} either orally {{or through}} scripture yet these organizations depicted each topic {{in a way}} that it could educate its audience. The earliest documentation of production within the community started with the play called Isuda Ti Muna/They Who Were First in 1973. It mainly encircles the lives of Filipino agricultural workers in central California. The following year Mindanao (1974) came out in which talks about the land rights if Filipino Muslims and farmers in Mindanao. In 1976 a play called Tagatupad came out with a focus on the struggles of antieviction laws within the working class Filipino community. One of the most controversial plays within this time called The Frame Up of Narciso and Perez (1979) basically focuses on the murder of Narciso and Perez’ patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital. Within the same year, Visions of a <b>War</b> <b>bride</b> (1979) focused on a Filipina that came to the united states as a <b>war</b> <b>bride.</b> Years later Ti Mangyuna (1981) led by a collaboration between the KDP and ILWU Local 142 of Hawaii headlined throughout the community.

After attending Bishop Road Primary School and Fairfield Grammar School in Bristol, he toured the country as a stage performer, and decided to stay in New York City after a performance there.

40|$|They're Bringing Home Japanese Wives': Japanese <b>War</b> <b>Brides</b> in the Postwar Era" {{explores the}} {{immigration}} of Japanese <b>war</b> <b>brides</b> to the U. S. following World War II {{and why the}} United States so swiftly and dramatically reversed its views toward immigration from Japan following the war; {{the degree to which}} Americans, both those of Japanese descent and those of other heritages, accepted this influx of newcomers; and the lived experiences of these immigrant women during their first decade in America. Drawing on sources that range from government documents to interviews with <b>war</b> <b>brides</b> conducted in the 1950 s, I argue that postwar constructions of racialized gender eased the acceptance of these women into American society. However, sometimes the degree of acceptance was contingent on the race of the <b>war</b> <b>bride's</b> husband {{to such a degree that}} one might speak of racial or ethnic coverture in the mid- 20 th Century U.

2500|$|The G.I. Bride {{frequently}} {{featured in}} the pocket cartoons, and became a long running character in the Lobey Dosser series, always standing in Arizona with her [...] "wean" [...] in her arms (her baby, prophetically called Ned), invariably trying to thumb a ride with plaintive cries like [...] "Ony o' youse blokes goin' the length o' Pertick?". (A bronze statue of the G.I. Bride is now in Partick Station,(Rail and Underground), commissioned by SPT and sculpted by Ranald MacColl.) Neill was a regular theatregoer at the time, and this character was probably inspired by Tommy Morgan's popular stage character, Big Beenie, the G.I. <b>War</b> <b>Bride.</b> The popularity of the Glasgow stage comedian's pantomime-style parodies of the city's culture {{was not lost on}} Neill, and was to influence his best known cartoon strip.|$|E
