5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish and Soviet troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{soon found}} {{work with a}} new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also {{pursuing}} an acting career – in a comedy sketch called Repairs. In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon {{the star of the}} show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

Gandhi's campaign did not enjoy the support of Indian masses and many Indian leaders such as Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad. His campaign <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> Over 2.5million Indians ignored Gandhi, volunteered and joined the British military to fight on various fronts of the allied forces.|$|E
5|$|In April 1961, a 1,400-man {{force of}} Cuban exiles invaded Cuba {{in an attempt}} to end the regime of Fidel Castro. The {{invasion}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> and two hundred of the exiles were killed while an additional 1,200 were captured. Miskovsky, working with lawyer and lead negotiator James Donovan, and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, negotiated a release for the prisoners in return for around fifty million dollars in medicine, food and other supplies. The captured Cubans were released days before Christmas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1016 Basil II led his armies along the Struma valley and besieged the strong {{fortress}} of Pernik. The fort's defence was headed by the capable commander Krakra, who remained loyal to the Bulgarian cause. As all the previous attempts against Pernik, the 88-day siege <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> costing the Byzantines many casualties before {{they were forced to}} retreat south and regroup at Mosynopolis.|$|E

The resulting aircraft had a variety of names, including I-210, MiG-3-82, Samolyot IKh or Izdeliye 65. The design <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> but was promising enough to continue the program as the I-211.|$|E
5|$|The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{developed}} a battery-powered pigeon camera now {{on display in}} the CIA Museum's virtual tour. According to the website, the details of the camera's use are still classified. News reports suggest that the camera was used in the 1970s, that the pigeons were released from planes, and that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> {{as a result of}} poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E

5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> to recognize {{after the first}} wave of attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E
5|$|After {{securing}} {{the area around}} Arleux {{at the end of}} April, the British determined to launch another attack east from Monchy to try to break through the Boiry Riegel and reach the Wotanstellung, a major German defensive fortification. This was scheduled to coincide with the Australian attack at Bullecourt to present the Germans with a two–pronged assault. British commanders hoped that success in this venture would force the Germans to retreat further to the east. With this objective in mind, the British launched another attack near the Scarpe on 3 May. However, neither prong was able to make any significant advances and the attack was called off the following day after incurring heavy casualties. Although this battle <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> the British learned important lessons about the need for close liaison between tanks, infantry and artillery, which they would use in the Battle of Cambrai, 1917.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, {{a raid on}} Herm, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> After three {{attempts}} to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, {{but there were no}} signs of any German occupation troops or of the island's population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island's cliffs.|$|E

5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure,</b> as Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure</b> as a peace treaty, it was resurrected {{under the}} new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>failure.</b> As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
