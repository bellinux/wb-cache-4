25|$|Yellowcard {{recorded}} {{its first}} album, Midget Tossing, at the Music Factory in Jacksonville Beach with Michael Ray FitzGerald at the board. <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand,</b> Yellowcard's second album, featured the same lineup as Midget Tossing, and Mackin {{was brought in}} for more songs. Soon, however, the band fired Dobson and replaced him with former guest vocalist Key. This changed the band's style from hardcore punk to pop punk.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in January 1934, {{the group}} also began to produce a mimeographed {{discussion}} bulletin of [...] "programmatic documents" [...] under the title <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> <b>Stand.</b> At least 4 issues were produced.|$|E
2500|$|The early Adventists {{emphasized}} {{the concept of}} [...] "present truth"—see [...] (NKJV). [...] James White explained, “The church [...] ever had a present truth. [...] The present truth now, is that which shows present duty, and the right position for us…” ”Present truth is present truth, and not future truth, and the Word as a lamp shines brightly <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> and not so plainly on the path in the distance.” [...] Ellen White pointed out that “present truth, which is a test {{to the people of}} this generation, was not a test to the people of generations far back.” [...] The founders of the SDA church had a dynamic concept of what they called present truth, opposed to creedal rigidity, and had an openness to new theological understandings that built upon the landmark doctrines, or Pillars of Adventism that had made them a people.|$|E

60|$|Something in {{her eyes}} {{told me that she}} wished me to follow her, and I did so. Outside the portico <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> in the desolate, lighted street, she halted.|$|R
6000|$|... "No: this is Plumstead, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> but that's in Eiderdown. The parishes run {{in and out}} here. I {{never bought}} any other land as cheap as I bought that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if I command you to go--to {{make the}} attempt?" [...] he asked. [...] "Answer me, monsieur, {{let us know}} once for all <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> and who {{commands}} this expedition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I said," [...] {{the closest}} {{listener}} remarked, [...] "he produces a secondary state of revolt which is desirable, for {{in that state}} we begin to inquire not only <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> but where he stands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Rollo to Jennie, {{pointing}} down; [...] "there's {{the place}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> when <b>we</b> {{looked up to}} this whispering gallery {{at the time we}} first came in." ...|$|R
60|$|While Jack {{went to a}} brook {{that ran}} close to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood,</b> I tasted the fruit, and found it most excellent, the pulp being juicy, with a very {{pleasant}} flavour.|$|R
60|$|Far {{away in the}} north-west the sun glinted {{upon the}} high peak of Mount Throston. From <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood</b> <b>we</b> could see the smoke of the steamers as they {{ploughed}} along the busy water-way which leads to Belfast.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is supposed," [...] {{said the}} guide, [...] "that this floor, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> was Mary's drawing room, {{and the floor}} above was her bed chamber. The {{staircase}} where she went up is there, in the wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no hope left now," [...] she said, {{in a very}} {{resigned}} voice. [...] "We {{must make}} up our minds to die <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand.</b> But I thank you, oh, I thank you so much, so earnestly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} enlarge this circle, my friends," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Warren, [...] "and give room, I will address you here, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand,</b> {{and let you}} know my reasons why I think your conduct ought to be----" ...|$|E

60|$|Corny went ashore, {{but she did}} {{not stay}} there three minutes. From the edge of the wharf we could see that Silver Spring was better worth looking at than {{anything}} we should be likely to see on shore. The little lake seemed deeper than a three-story house, and yet, even from <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood,</b> <b>we</b> could see down to the very bottom.|$|R
6000|$|... "And isn't this a bank <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand?</b> Don't these {{soldiers}} {{call this the}} bank of the lake? And aren't there trees in thousands? And aren't twenty leagues narrow enough of all conscience? Who the devil ever heard of the banks of the ocean, unless it might be the banks that are under water?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} Captain. [...] "Now, {{that is a}} basis to work upon, and we know <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand.</b> You can take a little rest, and let the second mate find the island. But I can only give him three days in which to do it. We really {{have no time to}} spare." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{this is what}} modern civilization {{has come}} up against, {{and it is the}} {{essential}} riddle of the modern sphinx which must be solved if we are to live. All the European boundaries of to-day are impossibly small for modern conditions. And they are sustained by an intensity of ancient tradition and patriotic passion.... That is <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand.</b>|$|E
60|$|The road being narrow, and our {{vehicle in}} its centre, {{it was not}} {{possible}} for the new-comers to proceed until {{we got out of the}} way, and the divine pulled up as soon as he reached the spot <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood.</b>|$|R

60|$|As they spied {{me there}} was a concerted rush by those nearest the {{entrance}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stood,</b> but a line of radium bulbs inset along the threshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden halt--evidently they dared not cross that line of light.|$|R
6000|$|... "I move," [...] said Jack, [...] "that as {{the country}} just <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>stand</b> is well watered by this little brook, besides being picturesque and {{beautiful}} to look upon, we should encamp where we are, and leaving our men to guard the camp, cross this plain--we three take Mak along with us, and spend {{the remainder of the}} day in hunting." ...|$|E
60|$|Very well said: so they are, two {{or three}} hundred feet higher. But our part of them was left behind, {{standing}} up in banks, while {{the valley of the}} Thames was being cut out by the sea.

6000|$|... 'Let us not jump to conclusions.

60|$|When Woola {{had left}} us Thuvan Dihn and I, {{hiding in the}} seventh cave, {{discussed}} and discarded many plans for crossing the eighth chamber.
