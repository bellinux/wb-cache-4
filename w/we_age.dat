25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory {{is that there is}} a limit in attentional resources seen as <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands are more difficult to complete due to a reduction in mental energy. Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus they are more likely to strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|Speed of {{processing}} is another theory {{that has been}} raised to explain working memory deficits. As a result of various studies he has completed examining this topic, Salthouse argues that as <b>we</b> <b>age</b> our speed {{of processing}} information decreases significantly. It is this decrease in processing speed that is then responsible for our inability to use working memory efficiently as <b>we</b> <b>age.</b> The younger persons brain is able to obtain and process information at a quicker rate which allows for subsequent integration and manipulation needed to complete the cognitive task at hand. As this processing slows, cognitive tasks that rely on quick processing speed then become more difficult.|$|E

Sighted participants outperformed the visually impaired regardless of testing modality. This suggests that vision tends to shape the general supramodal mechanisms of memory.|$|E

However, only recently have advances in the genetics of aging started to reveal some answers to these questions. Aging is a complex process associated with the accumulation of age-related changes, and it is characterized by a progressive decline of physiological functions, increased frailty, and increased incidence of diseases.

25|$|Although Emanuel opposes legalized euthanasia, he {{believes}} that after age 75 life is not worth living, {{and the pursuit of}} longevity, not a worthwhile goal for U.S. health care policy.

25|$|Some theorists {{argue that}} the {{capacity}} of working memory decreases as <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> and {{we are able to}} hold less information. In this theory, declines in working memory are described as the result of limiting the amount of information an individual can simultaneously keep active, so that a higher degree of integration and manipulation of information is not possible because the products of earlier memory processing are forgotten before the subsequent products.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea that}} free {{radicals}} are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory {{of aging and}} even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such as fat, proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> including diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.|$|E
25|$|As <b>we</b> <b>age,</b> deficits {{are seen}} {{in the ability to}} integrate, manipulate, and reorganize the {{contents}} of working memory in order to complete higher level cognitive tasks such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and planning. More research must be completed in order to determine what the exact cause of these age-related deficits in working memory are. It is likely that attention, processing speed, capacity reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E
500|$|Carey's second book, Junk DNA: A Journey Through the Dark Matter of the Genome, {{examines}} {{developments in}} the study of junk DNA, or noncoding DNA. DNA that doesn't code for proteins has been dismissed as nonfunctional until recently. [...] She explains the [...] "most fundamental reason for the shift in emphasis is the sheer volume of junk DNA that our cells contain. One of the biggest shocks when the human genome sequence was completed in 2001 was the discovery that over 98 per cent of the DNA in a human is junk. It doesn't code for any proteins." [...] Carey describes how this Junk DNA maintains the integrity of our chromosomes; regulates the ways the protein-coding genes are expressed; influences how <b>we</b> <b>age</b> and generally introduces incredible degrees of subtlety and flexibility into how we use the relatively small numbers of genes that code for proteins... contributes to all sorts of situations, from the correct control of gene expression in female cells to the regulation of pathways that drive cancer.
