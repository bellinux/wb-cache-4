50|$|The <b>white-cheeked</b> <b>{{starling}}</b> or grey starling (Spodiopsar cineraceus) is a passerine bird of the starling family. It is {{native to}} eastern Asia where {{it is a common}} and well-known bird in much of its range. Usually, it is placed in the genus Spodiopsar.|$|E
50|$|Two others (red-billed starling, Sturnus sericeus & <b>white-cheeked</b> <b>starling,</b> Sturnus cineraceus) are {{probably}} basal {{in the group}} and might even be closer to Sturnia. The relationships of the white-faced starling are more unclear, but it is generally not held {{to be close to}} the present genus.|$|E
50|$|<b>White-cheeked</b> <b>starlings</b> are 24 cm in length. The {{adult male}} is mainly dark grey-brown with a paler belly and a whitish band across the rump. The head is blackish with whitish cheeks and forehead. There {{is a white}} border to the tail and white {{markings}} on the secondary wing feathers. The legs are pale orange and the bill is orange with a black tip. Adult females {{are similar to the}} males but paler and duller.|$|R
5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and <b>white-cheeked</b> <b>starlings),</b> where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer {{down the length of}} the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|R
