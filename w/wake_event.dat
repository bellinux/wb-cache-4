40|$|We {{propose a}} {{possible}} explanation for the second <b>wake</b> <b>event</b> observed by Cassini during the T 9 encounter with Titan. As shown in Hartle and Sittler [2007 a], ions will emanate from Titan's upper atmosphere as ion beams when the ion gyroradii are large compared to the neutral scale height. Furthermore, Sittler and Hartle [2007] and Hartle and Sittler [2007 b] showed that when this condition is satisfied and the electric field of the external flow is not reduced significantly due to draping field lines, the heavier pickup ions will be highly localized in space and velocity, or beam-like, in Titan's wake. This can cause these ion bunches to jump across the spacecraft trajectory and not be observed except for the lighter ions such as H+ and H 2 +, which have smaller gyroradii. These heavy ions will form a large pickup current which can deflect the tail position away from Saturn. We will discuss this model for the T 9 encounter, which was a wake pass, and also explore its possible application for T 5...|$|E
40|$|High-amplitude water waves {{induced by}} {{high-speed}} vessels are regularly observed in Tallinn Bay, the Baltic Sea, causing intense beach erosion and disturbing marine habitants {{in the coastal}} zone. Such a strong impact on the coast may {{be a result of}} a certain group structure of the wave wake. In order to understand it, here we present an experimental study of the group structure of these wakes at Pikakari beach, Tallinn Bay. The most energetic vessel waves at this location (100 m from the coast at the water depth 2. 7 m) have amplitudes of about 1 m and periods of 8 – 10 s and cause maximum run-up heights on a beach up to 1. 4 m. These waves represent frequency modulated packets where the largest and longest waves propagate ahead of other smaller amplitude and period waves. Sometimes the groups of different heights and periods can be separated even within one wave <b>wake</b> <b>event.</b> The wave heights within a wake are well described by the Weibull distribution, which has different parameters for wakes from different vessels. Wave run-up heights can also be described by Weibull distribution and its parameters can be connected to the parameters of the distribution of wave heights 100 m from the coast. Finally, the run-up of individual waves within a packet is studied. It is shown that the specific structure of frequency modulated wave packets, induced by high-speed vessels, leads to a sequence of high wave run-ups at the coast, even when the original wave heights are rather moderate. This feature can be a key to understanding the significant impact on coasts caused by fast vessels...|$|E

40|$|Dream recall {{is often}} {{considered}} to be poor, although it is rarely systematically compared to the retrieval of <b>waking</b> <b>event</b> memories. A diary paradigm was implemented to explore the memory profile of recalled dreams over time, in comparison to recalled waking experiences. Twenty-five participants completed a dream and waking-event diary over two weeks. Titles of reports were re-presented in a surprise recall task. Subsequently, extracts of the reports were re-presented for recognition. No {{significant differences were found}} between dream and <b>waking</b> <b>event</b> memories in terms of either recall or recognition although some differences were found in terms of recollective experience, with waking-events being “remembered” as episodic memories more than dreams. Diary dream memories that are recalled, reported and to some extent rehearsed are therefore accessible and detailed in a similar manner to waking experiences, providing that they are adequately encoded close to their time of occurrence. The continuity of retrieval processes over sleep and wake is outlined...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of wake/leading-edge {{interactions}} were studied at off-design conditions. Measurements were performed on the stator-blade suction surface at midspan. The leading-edge flow-field was investigated using hotwire micro-traverses, hotfilm surface shear-stress sensors and pressure micro-tappings. The trailing-edge flow-field was investigated using hotwire boundary-layer traverses. Unsteady CFD calculations were also performed to aid {{the interpretation of the}} results. At low flow coefficients, the time-averaged momentum thickness of the leading-edge boundary layer was found to rise as the flow coefficient was reduced. The time-resolved momentum-thickness rose due to the interaction of the incoming rotor wake. As the flow coefficient was reduced, the incoming wakes increased in pitch-wise extent, velocity deficit and turbulence intensity. This increased both the time-resolved rise in the momentum thickness and the turbulent spot production within the wake affected boundary-layer. Close to stall, a drop in the leading-edge momentum thickness was observed in-between <b>wake</b> <b>events.</b> This was associated with the formation of a leading-edge separation bubble in-between <b>wake</b> <b>events.</b> The <b>wake</b> interaction with the bubble gave rise to a shedding phenomenon, which produced large length scale disturbances in the surface shear stres...|$|R

40|$|As the {{resource}} wind is increasingly exploited to produce electricity, wind energy converter (WEC) deployment expands to more complex terrain such as hilltops or mountain ridges. In that context {{it is crucial}} to understand the interaction between the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow and the WEC in order to predict downstream flow characteristics. In the context of the Perdigão 2017 experiment, the German Aerospace Center performed full-scale wake measurements on a single WEC of type Enercon E 82 with three Leosphere Windcube 200 S longrange scanning Lidar systems. The experimental setup covers two parallel ridges 1. 4 km apart, separated by a 200 m deep valley. The ridges are oriented in NW-SE direction, perpendicular to the main wind direction, which is SW. Two of the three scanning Lidar systems are positioned downstream of the WEC in line with the main wind direction to span a vertical plane, perpendicular to the ridges, with range-height indicator (RHI) scans. This allows to investigate <b>wake</b> <b>events</b> with single or dual-doppler Lidar techniques. The third Lidar system, which is positioned along the WEC ridge, is used to measure the wake position outside the above mentioned measurement plane. <b>Wake</b> <b>events</b> in three different ABL regimes (neutral, stable and convective) are evaluated with respect to wake position, dispersion, propagation and the wind-speed deficit. It is found that wake position and propagation are strongly influenced by the atmospheric stability, forcing the wake to deviate from hub height, migrating to higher levels for convective regimes. For stable ABL conditions the wake descends into the valley and is clearly detectable up to at least nine rotor diameters downstream of the WEC, in some cases. Furthermore, the coplanar scanning strategy allows to calculate the two-dimensional wind vector in the vertical scanning plane, indicating that vertical wind components with up to 2 m/s {{play an important role in}} the interaction between ABL flow and WEC. With the help of the third Lidar system on the WEC ridge, wake meandering can be quantified. This work will provide a thorough analysis of three exemplary measurement days...|$|R

Data from 212 ship <b>wake</b> <b>events</b> in Tallinn Bay demonstrate that ship wakes in the nearshore have large heights (up to 1. 6 m) and periods (10 - 15 s), whereas wind waves have typical heights of 13) and have only weak wave amplification at the beach. On average the runup height of ship wakes exceeds the wave height offshore at the depth of 2. 7 m {{by a factor of}} 1. 3, and this amplification factor decreases with an increase in wave amplitude.

40|$|Waves {{generated}} by high-speed ferries sailing at near-critical speeds (depth Froude number 1) may substantially affect the coastal zone. As typical for large-amplitude waves in shallow water, waves from fast ferries frequently have a substantially nonlinear nature {{and are often}} able to seriously damage the coastal environment. We report wake characteristics of fast-ferries sailing in Tallinn Bay in June 2009. Waves were measured using an echosounder in the nearshore at Pikakari Beach {{at a depth of}} 2. 7 m, 2. 4 km from the sailing line. The record contains 150 <b>wake</b> <b>events</b> for which primary wake parameters as the maximum wave height, wake energy and its flux were estimated. The shape of the highest vessel waves was analyzed in terms of cresttrough asymmetry. Maximum wave heights (up to 0. 7 m) occurred exclusively for the longest waves with periods 10 s. These waves are substantially nonlinear with wave crests exceeding wave troughs typically by a factor of 1. 3. Incoming ferries generally excited smaller waves compared to a previous study of outgoing ferry wakes in north-west Tallinn Bay. This apparently reflects the high spatial variability of wake waves along the impacted coastal sections and is not an evidence of an overall decrease in the ship wave intensity...|$|R
