40|$|The paper {{presents}} a steady-state or transient, three-dimensional mathematical field model describing aircraft cabin fires. The fire is modelled {{by a simple}} heat source, and the simulation is intended to represent non-spreading fires. The computer code implementing the model uses a body-fitted coordinate (BFC) formulation to describe accurately {{the interior of the}} aircraft, that is neither Cartesian nor polar-cylindrical. The model is first used to predict the experimental results obtained from a series of fire tests performed in a Boeing- 737 fuselage (<b>without</b> <b>fittings).</b> Both steady-state and transient results are presented and discussed. Then the effect of openings in the fuselage and cabin compartmentation on the temperature distribution within the empty aircraft cabin is investigated. With the forward and aft bulkhead doors open, allowing for natural convection, the temperatures are kept to tolerate levels. When the forward door is closed while the aft is kept open, temperatures increase throughout the cabin even in the aft section. With both forward and aft doors open, the cabin is partitioned into two communicating sections, the forward section containing the fire. When compared to the non-compartmented case temperatures in the aft section decrease while temperatures in the forward section increase. With the cabin fitted with seats, ceiling panels and overhead stowage bins the effect of the aircraft's air-conditioning system on the temperature distribution within the burning fuselage is examined. The results suggest that a reverse flow situation (i. e. cold air injected through floor vents and hot air sucked out at ceiling vents) greatly reduces the temperature throughout the fuselage. It is concluded that, although insufficiently validated as yet {{due to the lack of}} extensive and suitable experimental data, the model is promising...|$|E

40|$|Housing {{units in}} China are {{sometimes}} sold with fittings (including internal finishes, interior decorations, fixtures, electrical appliances, etc.) and sometimes as bare units (<b>without</b> <b>fittings).</b> This study formulates hypotheses that explain these phenomena and test these hypotheses with empirical {{data from a}} sample of 1, 704 development projects in China that were sold in the primary market between 2003 and 2007. Based on developers’ risk-aversive behavior, we hypothesize that {{they are less likely}} to sell new units with fittings in areas with low land prices. The value of fittings is the highest if the developers can accurately predict the tastes of potential buyers. The risk facing the former is that the fittings may not suit the latter. The risks are higher when the cost of installing the fittings constitutes a relatively high proportion of the market value of a housing unit, which is the case when land prices are relatively low. Since housing construction costs are similar across the different regions in China, land price is a major determinate of housing prices. Due to the problem of information asymmetry between developers and buyers, the former’s reputable or goodwill is important. The market would give a higher valuation for fittings provided by more reputable developers. In addition, potential buyers may worry that the fittings had been used to cover up defective or sub-standard work. Therefore, we hypothesize that reputable developers are more likely to sell housing units with fittings, especially for developments with a high construction cost to market value ratio. Demand and supply conditions play a role in determining a developer’s decision to sell units with fittings. When supply is relatively abundant, competition amongst developers is keen. Developers will tend to compete by providing fittings as sweeteners to attract buyers. The provision of fittings may also be a non-price competition strategy used by developers to differentiate their products from that of their competitors. Therefore, we hypothesize that developers are more likely to sell housing units with fittings when demand is weak or when supply is abundant. Finally, we conjectured that as people’s incomes increase, their time becomes more valuable. Therefore higher income households are less likely to buy bare units, since the costs of shopping for interior decoration contractors, finishes and fittings, etc. are higher for higher income households. We conjecture that developers tend to provide units with fittings in areas with higher average household income. With the exception of the last hypothesis, our empirical results supported all hypotheses. The lack of empirical evidence to support the last hypothesis could be due to a possible opposing force. This force arises from the possibility that higher income households have more sophisticated tastes that are more difficult to predict. Developers, being risk-averse, would tend to supply bare housing units in high income areas. The results in this study contribute to our understanding of developers’ behaviors in the real estate market, particularly in China. The results are also of practical relevance to home buyers, developers, investors, and policymakers. published_or_final_versionReal Estate and ConstructionDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
