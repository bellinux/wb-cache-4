However, its storyline was met with mixed opinions. The game was followed by a number of sequels and spin-off titles, as well as other media.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's {{emergence}} as title challengers {{put an end}} to Arsenal and Manchester United's domestic duopoly. The London club won back-to-back league titles in 2004–05 and 2005–06 under José Mourinho, at a time when Arsenal and United underwent a period of transition. Vieira and Keane had left their respective clubs by the end of 2005, while Ferguson came under intense scrutiny over his management. Nevertheless, he guided his team to Premier League success in 2006–07, and won a further four league titles. At Arsenal, Wenger oversaw the club's relocation to the Emirates Stadium and made the decision to prioritise it over strengthening the squad. The club sold several experienced players, replenishing them <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> talent. The 2005 Cup win was their last piece of silverware until 2014.|$|E

The first decision made was to create a game about chocobos, market research showed that the characters are most popular <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> players, thus the game was designed for the Nintendo DS system, a popular system with that age group.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

40|$|Background: Mothers’ diets impact {{their health}} {{and the health of}} their children, but diet quality is {{suboptimal}} among women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children. Evening snacking among women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children, especially consumption of high-calorie, high-carbohydrate snacks, may impact overall diet quality and glucose metabolism. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality may be potential risk factors. We examined whether sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with diet quality and evening snacking among women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children. Methods: Data were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005 - 2012, nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of noninstitutionalized U. S. population. Eligible participants were non-pregnant women aged 20 - 44 years within 5 years of childbirth who completed two 24 -hour dietary recalls and completed questions on sleep duration and quality. Results: Among US women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children, sleep duration was not associated with diet quality. However, overall sleep quality was associated with poorer diet quality. Short sleep duration was not associated with the consumption of neither evening snacks, nor energy intake from or nutrient consumption of evening snacks. Conclusion: The findings of this dissertation provide information useful for informing the direction of future research of dietary quality and eating behaviors of U. S. women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children. Studies are needed to explore whether improvement in sleep quality may improve diet quality among women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children, which has the potential to improve both maternal and children’s health. Research may be better focused on identifying other psychosocial and behavioral risk factors for unhealthy dietary behaviors among US women <b>with</b> <b>young</b> children...|$|R
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, handing over JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E

In 1948–49, Harvey remained outside the first-choice team, and played in only two first-class matches against Tasmania when Victoria fielded a second-string team. He retired {{at the end of}} the season, having played only 22 first-class matches in an interrupted career. Harvey captained his state five times during the post-war phase of his career, standing in when regular captain Lindsay Hassett was away on national duty.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, <b>with</b> <b>younger</b> males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E
