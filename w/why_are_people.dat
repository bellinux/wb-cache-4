2500|$|This is the {{argument}} that all true atheists are at heart lying {{so that they may}} live {{in a way that is}} contrary to God's commands (as seen in particular interpretations of Romans 1:18-25). Critics note that there are atheists who are not lying and are not using their atheism as an escape to sin. Proponents note, however, that they could just as easily still be lying, perhaps not to others anymore but themselves (i.e. loving the wrong woman argument).

If a man is tried for three days you always think he'll get off, but if it lasts ten minutes he is sure to be convicted and hung. I'd have Mr. Finn's trial made so long that they never could convict him. I'd tire out all the judges and juries in London. If you get lawyers enough they may speak for ever."

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of human vulnerability to bushfires in the Wulgulmerang district of East Gippsland, Victoria, in south-eastern Australia. On January 30, 2003, bushfires devastated the small population of this isolated farming district. The fires destroyed homes, livelihood assets and public infrastructure. They also adversely affected the health, livelihoods and social lives of many local people. Australian bushfire research has traditionally focused on the geophysical dimensions of fire hazards and disasters, with little consideration of how cultural, economic, political and social factors shape people’s exposure to hazards and their capacities to cope and adapt to bushfire impacts. To date, {{there have been no}} systematic, social science analyses of human vulnerability to bushfires. The vulnerability analysis presented in this thesis concentrates on two key research questions: (1) How and <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> exposed to hazards during the bushfires? and (2) How and <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>people</b> differentially capable of coping and adapting to the fires’ impacts? Qualitative methods were primarily used to investigate these questions, including semi-structured interviews with residents and landholders of the Wulgulmerang district, representatives of government departments and authorities, and others who participated in responses to the fires. The thesis develops a multifaceted understanding of how and <b>why</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> vulnerable to the January 30 fires. Vulnerability is shown to arise from the circumstances of people’s day to day lives, which are shaped by factors both within and beyond their control. Local pressures and challenges – such as drought, declining farm incomes, depopulation, limited access to essential services, and political marginality – are shown to increase people’s exposure to bushfire hazards and reduce their capacities to cope and adapt. The thesis demonstrates the fundamental importance of sustainable livelihoods and regional economic and social vitality to the long-term goal of vulnerability reduction...|$|R

5000|$|Durack freely {{assumed the}} right to make Aboriginal art as Burrup. This was not {{appreciated}} by other Aboriginal artists nor the gallery owner who represented [...] "Burrup". Durack continued to make art as Eddie Burrup until her death on 25 May 2000, aged 84. Responses from the art world and the public ranged widely. Some censured Elizabeth Durack and dismissed Burrup paintings that previously had been acclaimed. Three works by Eddie Burrup from Native Titled Now were removed from the walls of the Gippsland Art Gallery in Sale, Victoria. Members of the Aboriginal art community claimed that Durack had stolen indigenous culture and John Mundine, an Aboriginal art curator, remarked that [...] "it's the last thing left that you could possibly take away other than our lives or shoot us all."
