5|$|It <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> {{that the}} Virginia was a novelty in naval architecture, wholly unlike any ship that ever floated; that her {{heaviest}} guns were equal novelties in ordnance; that her motive power and obedience to her helm were untried, and her {{officers and crew}} strangers, comparatively, to the ship and to each other; and yet, under all these disadvantages, the dashing courage and consummate professional ability of Flag Officer Buchanan and his associates achieved the most remarkable victory which naval annals record.|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> {{as a champion of}} the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
50|$|While Himes' tenure {{with the}} Cubs <b>will</b> surely <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> for the {{acquisition}} of Sosa, it <b>will</b> also <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> for the departure of pitcher Greg Maddux following the 1992 season, a season in which Maddux won 20 games and his first of four consecutive National League Cy Young Awards.|$|R
25|$|Zerka <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remember</b> by AS Nancy {{supporters}} for {{scoring the}} first goal of AS Nancy in the Final of the 2006 Coupe de la Ligue. It {{was the first}} major trophy won by the club since the 1978 French Cup.|$|R

5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as it happened to be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E
25|$|There {{was not one}} innings that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> {{in years}} to come; not even one that left behind {{pleasant}} memories after the day was over. This Test <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> - if, indeed, it is recalled at all in after years - because the fortunes changed so rapidly {{and because of the}} deed of individuals, chiefly the bowlers. Some, but only a few, came out with their reputations enhanced.|$|E

25|$|Sonnet 72 is a {{continuation}} from Sonnet 71. Both sonnets are an anticipatory plea regarding death and the afterlife from the writer to the reader.

25|$|Klusener <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> {{mainly for}} his {{contributions}} in One Day Internationals, {{in which he}} became feared as a hard hitting batsman and was voted as Man of the Tournament during the 1999 World Cup. He showed glimpses of his big-hitting in the years leading to the 1999 World Cup. His baseball-style backlift and thunderous hitting symbolised the tournament and his heroics nearly took South Africa to the final. He was also voted as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2000.|$|E

Unfortunately, two key members of Bosna championship team are not alive anymore. Mirza Delibašić and Sabahudin Bilalović have died, but they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> by the club and fans forever.

25|$|Walsh {{is one of}} {{only four}} bowlers to have bowled over 5000 overs in Test cricket, the other three being spinners: Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and Shane Warne of Australia, and Anil Kumble of India. These four, in {{addition}} to Glenn McGrath are also the only bowlers to have taken 500 or more Test wickets. Among the five, Walsh {{is the only one who}} has not taken 8 or more wickets in an innings. In ODIs, Walsh was not as successful although he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> for his best performance, 5 wickets for just 1 run against Sri Lanka in 1986. In first-class cricket, he took 5 wickets in an innings more than 100 times and 10 wickets in a match 20 times.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} with Bill Steigerwald in Reason Magazine, Jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> not for her work concerning city planning, but for the discovery of import replacement. Critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as Andre Gunder Frank. Import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier, whereas Jacob's idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution. However, even this would lead to confusion since in practice, import substitution in India and Latin America were government subsidized and mandated, whereas Jacobs' concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city.|$|E
25|$|Different {{emotions}} {{have been}} shown to affect memory. Life events that have stronger emotions attached <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> more vividly. In studies looking at emotional events and the reminiscence bump, older adults tend to remember more positive events than younger adults. Typically, during the reminiscence bump only happy memories and memories of important events are recalled. It is postulated that sad events are easier to forget because there may be an increased motivation to forget them. Conversely, individuals are more likely to recall and relive happy events because they produced pleasurable memories. A second explanation suggests that remembering positive events can help regulate emotions and even enhance moods. It is also possible to regulate emotions through remembering negative events and comparing these events to present positive events. Positive or negative events {{can also be used to}} share life experiences with others and compare life events.|$|E
