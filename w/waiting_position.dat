5|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} has {{a reputation}} as the biggest killer of large animals, including humans, on the African continent. It is widely distributed, found in many habitats and cryptically coloured. From a <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> with only its eyes and nostrils above the water, it can lunge at drinking animals, fishermen, bathers, or people collecting water or washing clothes. Once seized and dragged into the water, there is little chance for the victim to escape. Analysis of attacks show that most take place during the breeding season or when crocodiles are guarding nests or newly hatched young. Although many attacks go unreported, there are estimated to be over 300 per year, 63% of which are fatal. Wild saltwater crocodiles in Australia carried out 62 confirmed and unprovoked attacks causing injury or death between 1971 and 2004. These animals have also caused fatalities in Malaysia, New Guinea, and elsewhere. They are highly territorial and resent intrusion into their territories by other crocodiles, humans, or boats such as canoes. Attacks may come from animals of various sizes, but the larger males are generally responsible for fatalities. As their size increases, so does their need for larger mammalian prey; pigs, cattle, horses, and humans are all within the size range they seek. Most of the people attacked were either swimming or wading, but in two instances they were asleep in tents.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the crew}} and {{passengers}} had abandoned the ship, MSC Flaminia was left drifting in mid-Atlantic. Dutch salvage company Smit International signed a salvage contract for the stricken vessel, but {{the extent of the}} fire was not known until the first salvage tug, Fairmount Expedition, arrived at the scene on 17 July. According to the first reports, the fire was still burning in holds 4, 5 and 6, and the ship had developed a list of about 8.5 degrees {{as a result of the}} firefighting operations, but the engine room, superstructure and aftship were not seriously damaged. A second explosion occurred on the ship on 18 July, but the salvage efforts soon continued. The ship's own firefighting system was also started and the salvage personnel attempted to find the missing crewman. On 20 July, Fairmount Expedition began to tow MSC Flaminia towards Europe while Anglian Sovereign, another salvage tug with specialized firefighting equipment, continued to cool down the fire. On 24 July, it was announced that the fire on board MSC Flaminia was under control and an aerial high definition video, recorded by a helicopter on 26 July, showed the damage to the ship and its containers. By 29 July, the ship had arrived within [...] of the British coast. However, the deteriorating weather prevented the salvage crew from entering the ship, then listing at 10 degrees, on 31 July and she was moved away from the coast. Although the fires had been put out in holds 4, 5 and 6, temperatures in hold 7 were still rising.

Esterházy was aware that this idea is extremely unpopular in Slovakia because of previous Hungarian policy. Poland as a Slavic and Catholic state might play the helpful role of referee during the communications with the pro-Polish wing of HSĽS. Slovakia was to receive a similar status as Croatia had enjoyed in Austria-Hungary. This proposal presented more of his own ideas than the official attitude of the Hungarian government. Poland, which also had an interest in the breakup of Czechoslovakia, was willing to provide guarantees but the Hungarian government decided to maintain a <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> and did not initialise the first steps expected by Poland. Moreover, such an idea was strictly rejected by the leader of Slovak pro-Polish wing of HSĽS Karol Sidor who declared: [...] "We do not trust Hungarians and there cannot be a single word about a return to them". This statement was published in both the Polish and Slovak press. According to Esterházy's concept Slovakia was to receive autonomy within Hungary following upon its territorial division. After the occupation of Carpathian Ruthenia the eastern border should be adjusted to the west, to as great a degree as possible, and the southern part separated.|$|E

The Copper was a simple processor that could wait for a screen position and write to hardware registers. Using the GUI implemented in system ROM API's, programs could transparently display multiple independent screens, from non-consecutive memory, without moving the memory. This hardware-based scrolling does not use blitting, but something more like what is sometimes called hardware panning. The video output is simply told (once, or many times) where to display (scanline) and from what screen memory address.

40|$|Since {{crosswalk}} {{width and}} pedestrian green time directly affect {{the safety of}} signalized crosswalks, modeling an exact total crossing time model to estimate those two variables is imperative. The total crossing time needed {{by a group of}} pedestrians to cross a signalized crosswalk contains the discharge time and the crossing time. The discharge time depends primarily on the maximum queue length, which is determined by pedestrian arrival rate, red interval, <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> distribution, and the crosswalk width. Crossing time increases when interactions between bidirectional pedestrian flows become more serious. Thus, quantifying the impacts of the start-up process on the discharge time and the effects of the interactions on the crossing time is a prerequisite for optimizing the design of signalized crosswalks. This paper establishes a modified total crossing time model consisting of modified pedestrian discharge and crossing time. Discharge time is modeled by applying traffic wave theory, and crossing time is modeled based on drag force theory. The proposed models provide guidance for the design of crosswalk width and pedestrian green intervals...|$|E
30|$|On the {{individual}} level, stable significant influences are identified for all covariates in both age groups. The only exception {{is in line}} with our expectations: the third-quarter interview indicator has no significant impact in the older age group. 10 Being in a <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> for university entry, civil or military service is becoming very unlikely for the 20 – 24 age group, and there is no rationale suggesting the existence of systematic differences between quarters. In both age groups, the strongest impact on the probability of being in NEET status can be identified for the two migration indicators (country of birth and citizenship), in each case in Austrian youths’ favour. Further, females—when controlling for motherhood—are persistently confronted with a lower NEET probability than males, with a slight tendency for the gender effect to rise with increasing age. Systematic differences in young peoples’ NEET probability with regard to size of municipality occur only between urban areas with more than 30, 000 inhabitants and small villages with up to 5000 inhabitants. This result {{is in line with}} the NEET research in Great Britain. Bynner and Parsons (2002) pointed out that growing up in an inner-city housing estate residence negatively influences the life chances of young men in particular. Finally, the motherhood indicator—considering the fact that young females are in NEET status just because of maternity leave—has a positive impact on the NEET probability. As expected, its effect is considerably stronger in the older age group.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to modern}} enviromental {{packaging}} requirements {{the question of}} recyclability of used packaging plastics into new food packaging applications is of increasing interest. This question is currently still enforced since usual market applications for recycled plastics in the non-food area seem to approach saturation. Indeed, recycled plastics have already been used in food-contact plastics since several years around the world. However, these cases must be considered to have more pilot character than real market value, and, in most cases, the mass fraction of recycled plastics in these applications was relatively low, due to blending with virgin plastics or sandwiching with functional barrier layers of relatively high thickness extruded also from virgin polymer. Although considerable {{progress has been made}} from a scientific point-of-view in understanding and physico-mathematical modeling of diffusion processes of adventitious hazardous compounds from a recycled plastic in direct contact with food or from a core layer across a functional barrier, the translation into action of this knowledge about migration into industrial solutions remains still in a <b>waiting</b> <b>position.</b> One of the reasons has more "European" character and can be substantiated {{by the fact that the}} European legal requirements in this respect are not yet precisely defined. Whereas in the US a very concrete concept, the so-called "threshold-of-regulation" principle has been established and adopted by FDA. Another reason is clearly the non-availability of simple and economic test methods which in addition would need to have the status of generally accepted procedures and in the best case of standard test procedures. The aim of this work was to challenge the recycling process of OHL Paul Stehning GmbH, Limburg/Lahn, Germany, for used polyethylene terephthalate (PET) soft drink bottle with respect to its cleansing efficiency for artificially introduced model contaminants. The practical question was to investigate the potetial of this process to provide purified post-consumer PET suitable again for direct food contact application.

40|$|Patronage to bus public {{transport}} is growing quickly in Brisbane {{due to the}} development of its busway network. The busway corridors are at different stages of completion. However, with the increased public support travel demand, busway stations are becoming more crowded during the peak hours. Heavy boarding of passengers at some busway station platforms reduces comfort levels for passengers and makes the walking and manoeuvring to the bus door difficult. This in turn increases passenger boarding service times and hence dwell times of buses. Increased dwell times decrease the capacity of the loading areas on the platform and increase the bus delay through the station. Variation in delays through stations in turn affects the running time of buses along the corridor, which reduces the reliability of arrival times, with the associated flow-on impacts to later buses and formation of bus bunching. This paper looks into the operational efficiency of a busway station during the weekday afternoon school peak period in terms of passenger service times and station platform capacity. Mater Hill Busway Station on the South East Busway corridor of Brisbane was used as a case study. This station {{is one of the major}} stations on the corridor serving a large number of institutional employees, students and patrons with a nearby hospital, high schools, academic institutions, businesses and high density residential development. Passenger and bus flow data on the outbound peak direction platform was collected by using video recording technique and attributes including arrival time of bus, dwell time, departure time, number of passengers boarding and alighting was collected by viewing the video footage on a desktop computer. The extracted data was analysed. The passenger service times, and efficiency of each loading area considering the amount of time the loading area was empty as well as blocked for the bus entry, were calculated. In turn, the capacity of the bus station platform was calculated based on the methodology of the US Transportation Board’s Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB, 2003) calibrated using the site data. Field passenger boarding service times were significantly higher than the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TRB 2003) default value. Excessive passenger service times for loading area 3 arise due to “spent” dwell time as passengers walk from their <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> to the end of the platform. The lead loading area and second loading area were found to reduce in efficiency respectively over the 100 percent efficiency of loading area 3. This study found that blocking of a loading area, particularly for the lead loading area, has significant impact on the station capacity. However, loading area efficiencies were found to be very similar to TCQSM default values for a busway station. The analysis shows that the station platform was operating at a degree of saturation of 56 percent which accorded with field observations. Higher field passenger boarding service times resulted in a substantial capacity over-estimate using the TCQSM...|$|E
40|$|We {{are living}} in a world {{surrounded}} by the effects of climate change. A world exposed to the anxiety of future population and economic growth impacts such as decreasing resources and biodiversity. With a population of nine billion people by 2050, business as usual will not be an option. Sustainability has become more than a buzz‐word. It has turned into a global mindset. Already in 2007, the WWF report Deeper Luxury confirmed that environmental consciousness is rising amidst consumers and is no longer the preoccupation of a minority. In 2013, a report from GfK showed that an increasing interest in sustainability is equally reaching emerging markets. Luxury consumers expect excellence and would be scandalised if a luxury product wasn’t “green”. However, whereas most people believe that luxury is a guarantee for quality, most do not believe that it is a guarantee for sustainability. Especially the younger generation is increasingly socially conscious and suspicious at the same time. Despite a large interest in ethical engagement, the luxury consumer is lacking of information due to an absence of transparency from luxury brands on sustainability. An estimated 60 % of luxury brands are still hesitant and passive in regards to sustainable management integration. The motivations of the remaining brands have been classified in four distinct areas: Sustainability through conviction: These brands are characterised through the convictions of their founders aiming to educate and create value for all parties. Sustainability as a business model: Social and environmental commitment {{are an integral part of}} the DNA of these brands ensuring transparency and traceability through an integrated ethical management. Sustainability by nature: These brands did neither have a specific sustainable conviction nor do they communicate about it but sustainability is in fact part of their normal manufacturing process. Sustainability as risk management: Not adhering to social and sustainable standards is becoming a threat to the brand image, reputation and capital. Stakeholder’s interest is at the core of these businesses. Outside of the luxury sector, reputation management has become one of the top three reasons for executives to integrate sustainability into their operations. As the luxury industry is on the frontline of criticism for a lacking sustainable management, not so much for its objective impact but more for its symbolic power, and as its impeccable reputation is essential to keep high profit margins, luxury has a crucial interest in adhering to corporate responsibility. The sector needs to move out of its comfortable <b>waiting</b> <b>position</b> and prove excellence equally in sustainability. Although both sectors seem to contradict each‐other at first, they share values such as excellence, transmission, quality, heritage and craftsmanship. Eight drivers have been identified that ensure the success of future luxury: - Learning each‐others language - Safeguarding reputation - Creativity and innovation - Active engagement - Stakeholder pressure - The new generation - The sustainable dream - Sustainability as a selling tool If luxury does not want to miss the opportunity to lead in sustainable excellence it has to act now. An integrated sustainable management is the future of any business because it makes economic sense, it is demanded by people and the planet and it protects reputation...|$|E

This study, in its first chapter, tries to set the stage to uncover the factors that lead to success or failure of microbusinesses as seen from the unique point of view of the microentrepreneurs while doing business in the environment of the Brazilianfavela. The second chapter introduces the background literature on the relevant issues of the thesis. It presents a short historical overview and sheds light on the current social and economic situation of Brazil, on the general structure of microenterpises, on the importance of active entrepreneurship and on the personal traits of a entrepreneur. A vast set of information on the subject of help to microenterpises has been published by many support organizations, but as the predominant concern of the emerging enterprises seemed to be the lack of capital, most publications are restricted on how to collect and administer ftmds. These publications express the view of the donors, but almost no literature exists on the views of the receivers. It is the purpose of this study to l this apparent gap. The present research is geared to bringing to light views and perceptions at the grass root level. It intends to penetrate into the microenterprise culture of the favelas of Brazils megalopolises. A array of possible methodological approaches for achieving this aspired goal is presented in the third chapter and the final decision to use grounded theory, as a theory generating approach, is explained. The next chapter presents the scope of the field studies. Out of the almost homogeneous body of rural-urban migrants that constitute the majority of Brazils favela tenants, forty two microentrepreneurs were selected to form the target group of the thesis. I order to achieve a geographic spread, the megalopolises of Porto Alegre, Säo Paulo, and Salvador da Bahia were selected. The h chapter presents as its core section the extensive narratives of twelve micro-entrepreneurs, who represent a continuum of outcomes from cases of encouraging success to cases of complete failure. I the next chapter, chapter six, the data is screened using a extensive and methodical cross case analysis. From the statements of the interviewees nine distinct propositions emerge as the core findings of the study. These propositions match with the factors that influence the success or failure of the microenterprises as seen by the microentrepreneurs themselves: Drive and dedication, Schooling and competence, Family ties and other networks, Capital and loans, Business project, Chance and risk, Support, Rules and regulations, and Environment and context. The study postulates that the factors Drive and dedication, Schooling and competence, and Family ties and other networks are the most important. Chapter seven covers the effects of the demographical attributes of the microentrepreneurs and describes the casual relationships between the nine selected factors. Special attention is paid to the relative importance of each factor. The final chapter, the Conclusion, offers a summary of the findings and describes how they contribute to the three domains of knowledge: the structure and the agency of enterprises, the insight into the microentrepreneurs perceptions, and the development theory of micro- enterprises. It also highlights the implications of the findings for practitioners, support organisations, and official institutions, as well as making suggestions for further study. The final chapter ends with words of encouragement and caution...|$|E

The process {X(t), t {{greater than or equal to}} 0 } can be seen as the joint process of the number of servers and <b>waiting</b> <b>positions</b> occupied, and the number of customers in orbit of a generalized Markovian multiserver queue with repeated attempts and state dependent intensities. Using a simple approach, we derive closed form expressions for the stationary distribution of {X(t), t greater than or equal to 0 } when a sufficient condition is satisfied. The stationary analysis of the M/M/ 2 / 2 + 1 and M/M/ 3 / 3 queues with linear retrial rates is studied as a particular case in this process...|$|R
