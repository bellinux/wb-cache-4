25|$|There are four-day {{houses in}} the senior school. Students are {{assigned}} into studies, usually with 3 or 4 others, although the number usually decreases as the pupil moves into higher years. In these studies there is a <b>work</b> <b>space</b> and storage area. There are various activities annually between houses, including sports and Ely Scheme competitions. There is also a debating competition, quiz and popular house music competition. Pupils in each house meet weekly for a meeting, and also have a personal tutor who guides them throughout their time at the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was designed as}} a functional <b>work</b> <b>space</b> and home for the treatment of insane paupers, rather than a residence or civic building. This unfortunately led to poor ventilation, and together with overcrowding may be the reason behind the high rates of tuberculosis before the age of antibiotics. This was made worse when the basements were converted into sleeping dormitories and even a few extra wards, by excavating earth away from the basement walls and fitting windows. This worked quite well for much of the east side where the ground level is almost 5 metres lower than on the west due to the slope.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} North Dakota State Capitol building, built between 1883 and 1884, {{and expanded}} in 1894 (Senate wing) and 1903 (House wing), {{burned to the}} ground the morning of December 28, 1930. The fire was said to have been started by oily rags in a janitor's closet {{on the top floor of}} the main part of the building. The rags had been used to clean and varnish the legislators' desks in preparation for the upcoming legislative session. North Dakota Secretary of State Robert Byrne saved the original copy of the state's constitution, but he suffered cuts and burns on his hands while breaking a window to reach the document. Another state employee, Jennie Ulsrud, burned her hands when she attempted to save records in the North Dakota State Treasurer's office. Governor George F. Shafer came back from his visit to St. Paul, Minnesota while the fire was still burning. Upon arrival, he immediately assembled a team of state legislators and officials to discuss plans for coping with the loss of records and <b>work</b> <b>space.</b> The day after the fire, to save as many records as possible, 40 state prison inmates went to work trying to salvage materials from the ruins. The Legislature met temporarily in Bismarck's War Memorial Building and the City Auditorium.|$|E

The inspiration for these different <b>work</b> <b>spaces</b> came from Janesky. Basement Systems has been named one of Connecticut's Top Workplaces several times, most recently in 2015 and 2016.|$|R

In this paper, we explore the most suitable methods to represent the <b>work</b> <b>spaces</b> to support the time-space conflict analysis. Throughout the exploration, we apply three different methods (i. e., a method using isotropic “tolerance” concept, a method using traditional 3 D solid modeling, a method using parametric modeling) to represent the <b>work</b> <b>spaces.</b> From the application of these three different methods, we compare and discuss the strengths and weaknesses each of the three methods...|$|R

He further said that the lyrics feature [...] "a triumphant feeling of the possibilities that we all have." [...] Kelly Staskel of Billboard felt that [...] "stately drums and dramatic strings" [...] are paired with lyrics that take on a [...] "stark, apocalyptic tone", referring to the last verse of the song, which says [...] "The age of man is over / A darkness comes and all / These lessons that we learned here / Have only just begun".

[...] The building also contains a library, which contains a study lounge, <b>work</b> <b>space,</b> and a meeting room. It was renovated in 2007 by the Phi Sigma biology honor society, who provided new paint, carpet, and furniture. [...] The second floor contains The Meditation Room, with a small altar and limited seating. [...] It was furnished by funds provided by the Women's Auxiliary and is in memory of Helen Turnbull Waite Coleman, who authored Banners in the Wilderness, {{a book about the}} early years of the college. [...] The third floor contains a [...] greenhouse, with a potting room, wooden benches, and skylights. [...] During the winter, the plants are illuminated by timed electric lights. [...] The greenhouse is used for the cultivation of plant specimens, especially tropical, that are used for classroom experiments and demonstrations. [...] Space is also reserved for student projects. [...] The building is also home to the United States Department of Defense-funded Combat Stress Intervention Program to develop solutions to poor access to health care for soldiers returning from the Iraq and Afghanistan. [...] In 2008, the Biology Department (and the college) was awarded a $1 million programmatic grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a portion of which will be used to help establish bioinformatics lab space in Dieter-Porter.|$|E

40|$|New <b>work</b> <b>spaces</b> are {{emerging}} in physical and virtual domains and with it, an expectation {{of a new}} work culture. There is a shift in perception of what counts as a space of productivity. This corporate usurping and appropriation of leisure spaces is becoming visible across different sectors and across the globe, manifesting in technology, industrial, science or/and information parks. Simultaneously, we see corporations embrace and inhabit social and leisure spaces online, such as Blogger, Facebook and Twitter. This is seen as enabling the restructuring of the private-sector model from top-down to a more employee-driven and customer-oriented culture. This paper focuses on this new trend of corporate leisure spaces intended to foster innovation, networks and communication in this global and social media age. It synthesizes online and offline <b>work</b> <b>spaces</b> across geographies. It addresses this new architecting of <b>work</b> <b>spaces</b> and relates it to labor, leisure, innovation and networking in business culture...|$|R
