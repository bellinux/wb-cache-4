5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill based on that report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it <b>was</b> <b>much</b> scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|According to 20th Century Fox accounts, however, by April 1980 {{when the}} film had earned a {{reported}} $100million at the box office, after advertising, distribution fees, penalties and other costs were deducted, it was still recorded as having 'lost' $2.4million. This {{was seen as an}} example of Hollywood creative accounting and <b>was</b> <b>much</b> criticised. However, by August, Fox had started saying the film made $4 million in profit.|$|E
50|$|Males {{are similar}} to Cotana lunulata, but are larger and the outer one-third of the {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> paler and more yellow. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> brighter yellow and all transverse lines are more distinct. Females are also similar to Cotana lunulata, but <b>are</b> <b>much</b> darker and the white patch in the basal one-third of the forewings is reduced to a small dot.

5|$|According to Suetonius, {{the people}} of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army <b>was</b> <b>much</b> grieved, calling for his deification {{immediately}} after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting. As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E
5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei <b>was</b> <b>much</b> smaller, {{roughly the size of}} the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk through the process of insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|Anderssen {{was very}} {{successful}} in European tournaments from 1851 to early 1878, taking first prize in {{over half of the}} events in which he played. His only recorded tournament failures were a one-game-per-round knock-out event in 1857 and sixth place at Paris 1878 when his health was failing and he had only about a year to live. His match record <b>was</b> <b>much</b> weaker: out of the 12 that he played, he won only two, drew four and lost six.|$|E

5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth.

5|$|As the {{war began}} to draw to a close, the ships of Battleship Division Nine {{remained}} busy.

5|$|Between 1835 and 1850, Sir Charles Barry remodelled {{the castle}} in the Scottish Baronial style for the 2nd Duke of Sutherland.

The 14th-century tower, and the 17th-century and 18th-century extensions, were retained, and survive within Barry's 19th-century work.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism {{as well as the}} film's setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, which <b>was</b> <b>much</b> less thrilling than Speed setting on a fast-moving bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million.
