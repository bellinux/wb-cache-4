Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them.

500|$|After {{two centuries}} in which Monteverdi {{had been largely}} {{forgotten}} as a composer of opera, interest in his theatrical works revived in the late 19th century. A shortened version of Orfeo was performed in Berlin in 1881; {{a few years later}} the Venice score of L'incoronazione was rediscovered, leading to a surge of scholarly attention. In 1905, in Paris, the French composer Vincent d'Indy directed a concert performance of L'incoronazione, limited to [...] "the most beautiful and interesting parts of the work." [...] D'Indy's edition was published in 1908, and his version was staged at the Théâtre des Arts, Paris, on 5 February 1913, the first recorded theatrical performance of the work since 1651. The work was not received uncritically; the dramatist Romain Rolland, who had assisted d'Indy, wrote that Monteverdi had [...] "sacrifice freedom and musical beauty to beauty of line. Here <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have the impalpable texture of musical poetry that we admire in Orfeo." ...|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of Ultramega OK the band signed with A Records, which caused a rift between Soundgarden and its {{traditional}} audience. Thayil said, [...] "In the beginning, our fans came from the punk rock crowd. They abandoned us when they thought we sold out the punk tenets, getting on a major label and touring with Guns N' Roses. There were fashion issues and social issues, and people thought <b>we</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> belonged to their scene, to their particular sub-culture." [...] The band later began work on its first album for a major label, but personnel difficulties caused {{a shift in the}} band's songwriting process, according to Cornell: [...] "At the time Hiro [...] excommunicated himself from the band and there wasn't a free-flowing system as far as music went, so I ended up writing a lot of it." [...] On September 5, 1989, the band released its second album, Louder Than Love, which saw it take [...] "a step toward the metal mainstream," [...] according to Steve Huey of Allmusic, describing it as [...] "a slow, grinding, detuned mountain of Sabbath/Zeppelin riffs and Chris Cornell wailing". Because of some of the lyrics, most notably on [...] "Hands All Over" [...] and [...] "Big Dumb Sex", the band faced various retail and distribution problems upon the album's release. Louder Than Love became the band's first album to chart on the Billboard 200, peaking at number 108 on the chart in 1990.|$|E
