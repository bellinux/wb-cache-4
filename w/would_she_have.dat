25|$|Dina Matos and McGreevey {{separated}} {{after he}} {{revealed that he}} was homosexual, and in late 2005 McGreevey and Australian-American executive Mark O'Donnell began a relationship. The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of Jacqueline and filing for child support. Matos demanded $600,000 plus alimony. The divorce trial started on May 6, 2008. On August 8, the divorce was granted. McGreevey received joint custody and pays child support. They will also be using a parenting coordinator. Matos was denied alimony. In her memoirs, Matos wrote {{that she would never}} have married McGreevey if she had known he was homosexual, nor <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> chosen to have a homosexual man father her child.|$|E
500|$|In February 1955, {{at the age}} of 36, Salinger married Claire Douglas, a Radcliffe student (her {{father was}} the art critic Robert Langton Douglas). They had two children, Margaret (b. December 10, 1955) and Matthew (b. February 13, 1960). Margaret Salinger wrote in her memoir Dream Catcher that she {{believes}} her parents would not have married, nor <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been born, had her father not read the teachings of Lahiri Mahasaya, a guru of Paramahansa Yogananda, which brought the possibility of enlightenment to those following the path of the [...] "householder" [...] (a married person with children). After their marriage, J.D. and Claire were initiated into the path of Kriya yoga in a small store-front Hindu temple in Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1955. They received a mantra and breathing exercises to practice for ten minutes twice a day.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth David was the doyenne of English cookery writers. She {{influenced}} the generations who came after her, whether they, too, were intending to be culinary experts or merely taking a well-thumbed Elizabeth David Penguin {{from the kitchen}} shelf for the next day's dinner party. [...] "Elizabeth David says..." [...] was the regular way of resolving how much spice—and which spices—should be added to a stew and how much garlic should {{be put in a}} dressing. At its best, her prose was as precise as her instructions, unlike that of some of her predecessors who sometimes wrapped up advice on what to do in the kitchen with impenetrable sentences. She was a pleasure to read, a stylist of true distinction. Perhaps only in Britain <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been classified as a [...] "food writer", too often rather a damning phrase. Elizabeth David combined a scholar's feeling for history with the traveller-aesthete's gift of conveying a sense of place.|$|E

2500|$|At first [...] gave no reply. He {{carefully}} weighed {{all that}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said. Then slowly {{he placed his}} arm around her. She allowed him to do so. Then he promised her that {{all the things she}} wished for <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have.</b> <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a house in the west on the shimmering water. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gems, and animals. They would dwell together in harmony.|$|R

500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s. However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't have anyone to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something different. This girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... So what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have?</b> ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star {{ran a story}} alleging Archer {{had paid}} for sex with Coghlan, {{something}} The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather {{than that of a}} guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: [...] "Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. Your vision of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have,</b> without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?" [...] The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, [...] "Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Before closing arguments, Judge Perry {{ruled that}} the defense could argue that a {{drowning}} occurred due to reasonable conclusions aided by witness testimony, but that arguing sexual abuse was not allowed since {{there was nothing to}} support the claim that George Anthony sexually abused Casey Anthony. Baez began by contending that there were holes in the prosecution's forensic evidence, saying it was based on a [...] "fantasy". He told the jury that the prosecution wanted them to see stains and insects that did not really exist, that they had not proven that the stains in Anthony's car trunk were caused by Caylee's decomposing body, rather than from a trash bag found there. He added that the prosecutors tried to make his client look like a promiscuous liar because their evidence was weak. He said the drowning is [...] "the only explanation that makes sense" [...] and showed jurors a photograph of Caylee opening the home's sliding glass door by herself. He stressed that there were no child safety locks in the home and that both of Casey Anthony's parents, George and Cindy Anthony, testified that Caylee could {{get out of the house}} easily. Although Cindy Anthony testified that Caylee could not put the ladder on the side of the pool and climb up, Baez alleged that Cindy Anthony may have left the ladder up the night before. [...] "She didn't admit to doing so in testimony", he said, [...] "but how much guilt <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> knowing it was her that left the ladder up that day?" ...|$|E
60|$|But if {{that was}} {{the truth of the matter}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked and behaved {{differently}} in court--quite differently. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been looking for him. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> seen him....|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> <b>She</b> couldn't <b>have</b> {{been very}} nice herself, or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> gone and asked {{a man to}} marry her," [...] said Felicity.|$|R

6000|$|Elizabeth {{could not}} see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been {{presented}} to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> said? how <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> behaved?" [...] were questions with which she amused herself.|$|E

60|$|Miss Mackenzie did {{not dare}} to say that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{preferred}} to be wicked, {{but that is what}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> said if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> dared.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> taken it, Will. And <b>had</b> <b>she</b> done so, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been very}} wrong. Now {{she will be}} comfortable." ...|$|R
60|$|For no reward <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> {{looked at}} him just then, but with a deeper {{certainty}} than reason {{she knew that he}} was safe.|$|E

60|$|Yet <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> {{disturbed}} him, not {{for all the}} world. She {{never dreamed}} that he <b>would</b> be awake; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> thought of him lying--as Blanca said--exhausted from loss of blood.|$|R
