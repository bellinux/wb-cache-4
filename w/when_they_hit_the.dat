25|$|Flak from German {{anti-aircraft}} guns resulted in planes either going under or over their prescribed altitudes. Some {{of the men}} who jumped from planes at lower altitudes were injured <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground because of their chutes not having enough time to slow their descent, while others who jumped from higher altitudes reported a terrifying descent of several minutes watching tracer fire streaking up towards them.|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with electrically heated tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> surface of the mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E

25|$|Wood from mature giant sequoias {{is highly}} {{resistant}} to decay, {{but due to}} being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The Hume-Bennett Lumber Company {{was the last to}} harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924. Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.|$|E
25|$|A {{practice}} alert {{had been}} carried out {{earlier in the day}} within the town, and when the aircraft were finally spotted and an alert sounded, many people ignored the warning believing it to be another practice drill. 46 bombs were dropped over Gillingham and Chatham causing much damage. The Drill Hall suffered a direct hit. The bomb shattered the glass roof, sending dangerous shards of glass flying through the drill hall before exploding <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> floor. The clock upon the drill hall tower stopped at 11.12, giving the exact time the bomb exploded. The men asleep or resting inside had little chance of survival, those that were not injured from the explosion were cut to pieces by the falling pieces of glass from the roof.|$|E
25|$|The Legion of Doom would {{challenge}} the Outlaws {{several times in}} the next couple of months but could not win the gold. On one episode of Raw, the Outlaws shaved the head of Road Warrior Hawk and were beaten down further by DX. On February 23, 1998, on Raw, the Legion of Doom seemed to have won the Tag Team titles back <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Doomsday Device, but as Animal went for the pin, the referee was distracted by Hawk's celebration, allowing the Outlaws to take advantage and win the match. After the match, the Legion of Doom brawled with one another out of frustration and weren't seen on WWE television after that, indicating that the team was disbanded for good.|$|E

50|$|An elastic {{ball that}} bounces on water, the Waboba water balls flatten like a pancake <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> water surface, {{increasing}} its lift and propelling it upward. When it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> water at a shallow angle, it too creates a bowl-shaped depression. But {{because it is}} soft, the ball flattens into a disc-shape when it <b>hits</b> <b>the</b> surface and this allows it to aquaplane efficiently across the surface. And {{the angle of the}} bowl-shaped depression causes it to launch into the air where the ball regains its shape, making it look as if it has bounced. The process is remarkably similar to the way stones skip across water, even though they are denser than the liquid. A shallow impact with the water surface creates a bowl-shaped depression that launches the stone into the air as it leaves.|$|R

25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, {{there are two different}} deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} overturned while loading or lowering, spilling passengers {{into the}} sea; others were overturned by the ship's motion <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> water. It has been claimed that some boats, {{because of the}} negligence of some officers, crashed down onto the deck, crushing other passengers, and sliding down towards the bridge. This has been disputed by passenger and crew testimony. Some crewmen would lose their grip on ropes used to lower the lifeboats while trying to lower the boats into the ocean, and this caused the passengers to spill into the sea. Others tipped on launch as some panicking people jumped into the boat. Lusitania had 48 lifeboats, more than enough for all the crew and passengers, but only six were successfully lowered, all from the starboard side. Lifeboat 1 overturned as it was being lowered, spilling its original occupants into the sea, but it managed to right itself shortly afterwards and was later filled with people from in the water. Lifeboats 9 and 11 managed to reach the water safely with a few people, but both later picked up many swimmers. Lifeboats 13 and 15 also safely reached the water, each overloaded with around 70 people. Finally, Lifeboat 21 reached the water safely and cleared the ship moments before her final plunge. A few of her collapsible lifeboats washed off her decks as she sank and provided floatation for some survivors.|$|E
500|$|The {{great length}} of the [...] "Thin Man" [...] bomb led to {{aerodynamic}} instabilities. Subscale models of the bomb were dropped from a Grumman TBF Avenger at the US Navy test range at Dahlgren, Virginia starting in August, 1943. The bombs would spin sideways after being dropped, and broke up <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E

500|$|To {{fill the}} breach left by Augereau's {{decimated}} corps, Napoleon ordered Murat's cavalry reserve, 80 squadrons of 10,700 cavalrymen, into action at 10:30 in the morning. They had to cover [...] of snow-covered, obstacle-filled ground, {{which they could}} not do at a gallop. Murat's Reserve charged into the Russian squares in two columns: Grouchy's cavalry, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers and General Louis Lepic's grenadiers24 squadrons in totalwere flank to flank <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> Russian center. This was the occasion of Lepic's famous comment, [...] "Heads up, by God! those are bullets, not turds!"
