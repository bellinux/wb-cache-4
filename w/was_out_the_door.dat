6000|$|PADDY--And {{the loving}} way Yank heaved his shovel at {{the skull of}} her, only she <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door!</b> [A grin {{breaking}} over his face.] 'Twas touching, I'm telling you! It put the touch of home, swate home in the stokehole. [There is a roar of laughter from all.] ...|$|E
6000|$|After a time, {{it became}} largely {{a game of}} wits. I {{reasoned}} my acts, of course, while his were instinctive. One day, as he pretended to sulk in the corner, I glanced out of the woodshed doorway, simulated pleasure in face, voice, and language, and greeted one of my schoolboy friends. Immediately Rollo forgot to sulk, rushed out to see the newcomer, and saw empty space. The laugh was on him, and he knew it, and I gave it to him, too. I fooled him in this way two or three times; then be became wise. One day I worked a variation. Suddenly looking out the door, making believe that my eyes had been attracted by a moving form, I said coldly, as a child educated in turning away bill-collectors would say: [...] "No my father is not at home." [...] Like a shot, Rollo <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> He even ran down the alley {{to the front of}} the house in a vain attempt to find the man I had addressed. He came back sheepishly to endure the laugh and resume the game.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is dedicated}} to my wonderful family and friends for their immeasurable love and support. Thank you so much. Acknowledgements There {{are so many people}} without whom this penultimate milestone in my lifelong education would never have been achieved. It has been a long and bumpy road to this way point, yet I have had plenty of help. I must begin with my mother and father. The love and support I have received over the years has been more than I could ever have hoped for. From my early days as a scientist discussing why the sky was blue with my father to my mother always making sure I <b>was</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on time with all the creature comforts I could take with me, I say thank you for all that you have given me. If I was taught how to think by my parents, I was taught how to live by my sisters, Andi and Katie. Thanks for all the laughs (and fights) that have made me the person I am today...|$|E

50|$|Betty {{leaves her}} pet Pudgy home alone with three adorable little kittens. As soon as Betty <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>the</b> kittens {{begin to make}} mischief, turning the house into shambles. When Betty returns, she assumes the damage was caused by Pudgy, and punishes the {{innocent}} pup. The guilty kittens emerge from hiding and confess by singing the title song. A contrite Betty apologizes to Pudgy, and gives him a big bowl of ice cream shaped like a mountain.|$|R

60|$|Hours {{must have}} passed. Whether {{crouched}} {{on the cold}} stones or wandering in the fields among the snow, was {{more than he could}} tell; but hours had passed. The finger of the hall clock was close on twelve; a narrow peep of gas in the hall-lamp shed shadows; and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> back room--his father's room--was open and emitted a warm light. At so late an hour all this was strange; the lights should have <b>been</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> locked, <b>the</b> good folk safe in bed. He marvelled at the irregularity, leaning on the hall table; and marvelled to himself there; and thawed and grew once more hungry in the warmer air of the house.|$|R

60|$|But he didn't approach. He stopped, gazed absently {{toward our}} dusky mass a minute, evidently {{thinking}} about something else; then set down his light, moved musingly toward <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and before a body could imagine {{what he was going}} to do, he <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and had closed it behind him.|$|R
