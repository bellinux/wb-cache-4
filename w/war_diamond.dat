60|$|Yon lovely {{roadstead}} of Dominica--there it {{was that}} Rodney first caught up the French on the 9th of April, three days before, and would have beaten them there and then, had not {{a great part of}} his fleet lain becalmed under these very highlands, past which we are steaming through water smooth as glass. You glance, again, running down the coast of Martinique, into a deep bay, ringed round with gay houses embowered in mango and coconut, with the Piton du Vauclain rising into the clouds behind it. That is the Cul-de-sac Royal, for years the rendezvous and stronghold of the French fleets. From it Count de Grasse sailed out on the fatal 8th of April; and there, beyond it, opens an isolated rock, of the shape, but double the size, of one of the great Pyramids, which was once the British sloop of <b>war</b> <b>Diamond</b> Rock.|$|E

50|$|Blood {{diamonds}} (also called conflict <b>diamonds,</b> <b>war</b> <b>diamonds,</b> hot diamonds, or red diamonds") is a {{term used}} for a diamond mined {{in a war zone}} and sold to finance an insurgency, an invading army's war efforts, or a warlord's activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, and other nations have been given the label. The term conflict resource refers to analogous situations involving other natural resources.|$|R

50|$|The treacherous {{waters off}} the coast of the Outer Banks is known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic, Over 600 ships wrecked here as victims of shallow shoals, storms, and <b>war.</b> <b>Diamond</b> Shoals, a bank of {{shifting}} sand ridges hidden beneath the turbulent sea off Cape Hatteras, has never promised safe passage for ships. In the past 400 years the graveyard has claimed many lives, but island villagers saved many. As early as the 1870s, villagers served in the US Life-Saving Service. Others staffed lighthouses built to guide mariners. Few ships wreck today, but storms still uncover the ruins of the old wrecks that lie along the beaches of the Outer Banks.|$|E

40|$|After {{decades of}} growth and development, Iraq has become amongst the worst {{performing}} states worldwide as a legacy of successive wars and sanctions despite the rich endowment with ample natural resources and capable human resources. Many observers expected that the “new” Iraq after the US “liberation” in 2003 will be a tolerant and unified nation-state that “with a degree of civil society” will grant and secure the human rights for all the Iraqi people (Gresham 2006 : 27). However, due to the external military intervention lead by the US, the Iraq state collapsed after the 2003 <b>war</b> (<b>Diamond</b> 2005) {{as well as its}} economic, educational, health systems and infrastructure; and, Iraq’s development indicators are amongst the lowest globally (Hassin 2010). Australia’s controversial joining of Bush’s Coalition of Willing has been discussed by various intellectual studies from different angles. It is discussed in the socio-political discourse from an international relations perspective (Verrier 2003), social resistance to war (Hil 2008), and the implications on the Australian internal politics (McAllister and Bean 2006) and federal elections (Kelton 2008). However, there is scarce evidence about any research engaging with Australia’s roles in post-conflict nation building in Iraq. This article explores developmental roles and initiatives played and funded by Australia in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. Based on Hippler’s (Hippler 2004 - 2005) multi-faceted approach to nation building this paper will study Australia’s roles in the three interlinked dimensions or “starting points” for nation building: improvement of living conditions, structural reforms and integration of the national political system. <br /...|$|E

50|$|The Holywell Trust, {{formed in}} 1988, is a {{charitable}} organisation {{based in the}} centre of the walled city of Derry.

The trust initiated the <b>Diamond</b> <b>War</b> Memorial Project on 12 February 2007.

The project also {{led to the creation of}} a Commemorative Diary and a website which lists the names of those on the memorial and details their individual stories.

The Bobi mine near Séguéla produced 270000 carat kg per year until the late 1970s; it was closed in 1979.

50|$|During the <b>war</b> the <b>diamond</b> mines were {{constantly}} being fought over, making it unsafe for miners to work, and usually after the mine was re-taken {{by the other}} side there would be land mines planted everywhere. This {{made it difficult to}} extract the diamonds but did not prevent either the MPLA or UNITA from using the diamonds to help fund the war. The vast amount of diamonds and oil to be mined could have funded the civil war for another 27 years, but UNITA leader Savimbi was killed by MPLA soldiers in 2002. This led to an almost-immediate ceasefire.|$|R
5000|$|Diamond {{attended}} the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then New York University, {{graduating from the}} latter with a B.A. degree in English and philosophy.
