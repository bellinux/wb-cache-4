50|$|Wire mesh glass (also {{known as}} Georgian <b>Wired</b> <b>Glass)</b> has a grid or mesh of thin metal wire {{embedded}} within the glass. <b>Wired</b> <b>glass,</b> {{as it is}} typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it. The presence of the wire mesh {{appears to be a}} strengthening component, as it is metallic, and conjures up the idea of rebar in reinforced concrete or other such examples. Despite this belief, <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the glass. <b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired glass, as the wire amplifies the irregularity of any fractures.This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate <b>glass,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of <b>wire</b> <b>glass.</b> Original methods of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> {{is still}} {{utilized}} in the U.S. for its fire-resistant abilities, and is well-rated to withstand both heat and hose streams. This is why <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> exclusively {{is used on}} service elevators to prevent fire ingress to the shaft, and also why it is commonly found in institutional settings which are often well-protected and partitioned against fire. [...] The wire prevents the glass from {{falling out of the}} frame even if it cracks under thermal stress, and is far more heat-resistant than a laminating material.|$|E

50|$|Safety {{glass is}} glass with {{additional}} safety features {{that make it}} less likely to break, or less likely to pose a threat when broken. Common designs include toughened glass (also known as tempered glass), laminated glass, wire mesh glass (also known as <b>wired</b> <b>glass)</b> and engraved glass.

The skylight has been sheeted over externally, and the arch has moulded imposts and a central shield depicting an arm holding a sword. The rear section opens to an attached lean-to housing a kitchenette. A large room is located adjacent to the reception, with French doors with arched fanlight and sidelights of coloured glass.|$|E

50|$|The Fire Precautions Act 1971 {{came into}} force in 1972, when hotels and {{boarding}} houses {{were the first}} class of premises to be designated. Under the Fire Precautions (Hotels and Boarding Houses) Order 1972, (Statutory Instrument (SI) 1972 /238) any premises where there was sleeping accommodation for more than 6 persons (staff or guests) or sleeping accommodation above the first floor required a fire certificate issued by the local fire authority. This required partitioning to be built across previously open galleried landings, fireproofing of many doors and door frames, removal of combustible material, and installation of a fire alarm system. This means that many original features are now hidden behind plasterboard, corridors divided by modern fire doors or internal views seen through <b>wired</b> <b>glass.</b> The scale of this internal alteration can be appreciated by its cost in 1973 of £9000, {{the same as the}} average price of a house bought in the UK that year.|$|E

The corrugated iron hipped roof is hidden from the street a pedimented parapet that extends across the building's front and partially to each side. The rear rooms of the building are roofed with a simple corrugated iron skillion. The front awning is constructed of timber with plain posts and a convex profiled corrugated iron roof. In contrast, the front entry to the building is embellished by a pair of ornamented timber pilasters and wide solid panelled door. At both sides of the door are small double-hung arched windows that are fitted with opaque <b>wired</b> <b>glass.</b> Above the awning but immediately below the parapet cornice there are also three small fixed paned windows. Large windows to both sides of the central hall consist of fixed and pivoting panes. These panes have recently been fitted with textured and coloured glass.
