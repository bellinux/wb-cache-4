5|$|The Swedish {{automotive}} startup Uniti Sweden AB {{has been}} working on an electric city car entirely designed to be sustainable. The CEO Lewis Horne said “When people sell electric cars, the motivation is sustainability. So, <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> heavy, and why are they the same cars? Where you just take out petrol and you put in the huge battery and you call it sustainable. But it’s not.”. The company has been designing a car that uses sustainable and recycled material such as bio-composite to reduce the footprint of the car during production. In addition, the fully automated factory provided in partnership with Siemens will be able to work with the lights turned off during 22h per day to save energy.|$|E

6000|$|This {{is one of}} the {{dilemmas}} which constantly arise to confront the advocates of the theory that the Iliad is a patchwork of many generations. [...] "Late" [...] poets, if really late, certainly in every-day life knew small parrying bucklers worn on the left arm, and huge body-covering shields perhaps they rarely saw in use. They also knew, and the original poet, we are told, did not know bronze corslets and greaves. The theory of critics is that late poets introduced the bronze corslets and greaves with which they were familiar into the poems, but scrupulously abstained from alluding to the equally familiar small shields. <b>Why</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> recklessly anachronistic and [...] "up-to-date" [...] with the corslets and greaves, and so staunchly but inconsistently conservative about keeping the huge shields? ...|$|E

So he had them first to the spring. [...] "Lo," [...] saith he, [...] "this is the spring that Christian drank of before he went up this hill: and then it was clear and good; but now it is dirty with the feet of some that are not desirous that pilgrims here should quench their thirst." [...] Thereat Mercy said, [...] "And <b>why</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> envious, I wonder?" [...] But said their guide, [...] "It will do if taken up and put into a vessel that is sweet and good; for then the dirt will sink to the bottom, and the water come out by itself more clear." [...] Thus, therefore, Christiana and her companions were compelled to do. They took it up, and put it into an earthen pot, and so let it stand till the dirt was gone to the bottom, and then they drank thereof.|$|E

40|$|Extract] Many expeditions set {{out from}} Europe in the 18 ᵗʰ and 19 ᵗʰ centuries to {{discover}} new plants and animals. Some of them, {{such as that of}} Alexander von Humboldt, brought specimens back to Europe and employed artists so that their discoveries could be published. Other expeditions, such as those of Joseph Banks and Matthew Flinders, took illustrators with them. All depended on the skills of engravers, colourists and printers to publish pictures of the plants and animals they had found, to ensure their place in the history of science. But who were these artists and artisans, <b>why</b> <b>were</b> <b>they</b> <b>so</b> industrious and what did they really achieve...|$|R

5000|$|None of the Shanghai {{newspapers}} {{reported this}} tragedy [...]The front-page news were mainly the gossip {{of the players}} of Chinese opera.

The quietness was ominous. It was followed presently by a very stealthy sound--one of them was creeping upon her. Was Korak planning a joke upon his own account? Well, she would fool him. Cautiously {{she opened her eyes}} the tiniest bit, and as she did so her heart stood still. Creeping silently toward her was a huge bull ape that she never before had seen.
