40|$|A {{survey of}} local farmers {{was carried out}} to {{identify}} the current curfew practices on cattle at farms and holding grounds in West Timor prior to transport to Java. The survey was also aimed to recognise the potential stressors contributing to body weight loss {{and a lack of}} feed intake in the newly received cattle. There is little known about the current practices on Bali cattle at farms and holding grounds in West Timor before transportation. An interview and observation survey of 150 Bali cattle farmers and 9 traders was conducted in three different regencies throughout West Timor. There was no period of feed and water deprivation practiced by farmers prior to land transportation especially for cattle sold in traditional markets. The deprivation was only held for feedlot cattle for about 18 to 24 hours but then the animals were allowed to access feed and water for approximate 4 to 6 hours <b>before</b> <b>weighing</b> for <b>sale</b> and transportation. The animals were branded with hot iron after being sold. Duration of land transportation was depended on the distance from original farms or holding grounds to ports. As at farms, there were no deprivation practices in holding grounds prior to transport. All of the respondents reported that there was no written rule or protocols provided by government relating to transportation guidelines. In conclusion, the practices of feed and water deprivation, long duration of transportation, branded with hot iron, handling activities, mixing and different types of feeds in some stage of transportation might be potensial stressors contributing to the animals...|$|R
