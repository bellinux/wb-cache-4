40|$|A millimeter-wave {{imaging system}} has been {{developed}} operating at a center frequency of 94 GHz. The system has a single stationary mounted transmit and receive lensed horn antenna and two moving mirrors in x and y. The beam is generated by a FMCW-radar module. The final beam aperture is an off-set parabolic mirror which focuses the beam to a small spot at 2 m distance. Key component of the FMCW radar module is a MMIC, which includes a VCO, a MPA/HPA, two Lange-couplers, an LNA, a <b>Wilkenson</b> <b>splitter,</b> and an I/Q-mixer. This MMIC is fabricated using IAF's 100 nm metamorphic HEMT process...|$|E
