5|$|ML Pin {{recalled}} {{in his autobiography}} that although his mother <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> and loving figure, his father was rather strict and acted more like a teacher than a father, {{and that he was}} often fearful of him. A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{football}} was Atlanta's one major sports franchise {{during this time}} frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as on a Saturday in Athens when Georgia Tech {{was about to be}} upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of unbruising football other coaches couldn't understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.|$|E
5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated {{from the rest of the}} skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E

25|$|Despite its success, {{the drama}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. The audiences praised the beautiful costume, but complained the slow narrative rhythm {{and said the}} plot turns dramatically without foreshadowing, as it's broken and not linked well at all. Some reports noted that the drama <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Mary Sue story, and was not a factually accurate account of history. Wu Zetian had several battles with her opponent Zhangsun Wuji in history, but in the drama, Wu Zetian was shaped into an innocent woman.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the present center of Kreuzlingen was still largely agricultural. The first steamboats began to operate on Lake Constance in 1824. The first train line to Romanshorn was finished in 1871, and the second to Etzwilen in 1875. This brought commerce and industry to the region. In 1874, Kreuzlingen became the capital of the district, instead of Gottlieben. However, until World War I, Kreuzlingen <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of suburb of Constance. Most of its industry was in the hands of German firms. The war made Kreuzlingen more independent.|$|E
25|$|Pompey was {{supposedly}} infatuated with his bride.

A rumor suggested that the aging conqueror was losing interest in politics in favor of domestic life with his young wife. In fact, Pompey {{had been given the}} governorship of Hispania Ulterior, but had been permitted to remain in Rome to oversee the Roman grain supply as curator annonae, exercising his command through subordinates.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{correction}} fluid made its appearance, under brand {{names such as}} Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was the patch of dry {{correction fluid}} (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.|$|E
25|$|In September 1944, Chikatilo {{began his}} schooling. Although shy and ardently studious as a child, he was {{physically}} weak and regularly attended school in homespun clothing and, by 1946, with his stomach swollen from hunger {{resulting from the}} post-war famine which plagued much of the Soviet Union. On several occasions, this hunger caused Chikatilo to faint {{both at home and}} at school, and he was consistently targeted by bullies who regularly mocked him over his physical stature and timid nature. At home, Chikatilo and his sister were constantly berated by their mother. Tatyana later recalled that in spite of the hardships endured by her parents, their father, Roman, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> man, whereas their mother was harsh and unforgiving toward her children.|$|E

You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
