Their economy was primarily agricultural, cultivating corn, pineapple, yucca, {{and other local}} foodstuffs. The Tayrona are considered quite advanced for their time period. Surviving archaeological sites consisted of formed terraces and small scale underground stone channels. They also were known to actively collect and process salt, which was a significant trading commodity. <b>We</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> traded with other indigenous groups along the coast and interior. Archaeological excavations have recovered significant works in pottery, stonework and gold.|$|E

Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in World War I, has noted that their situation was not easy as they [...] "found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners." [...] Beach Thomas, however, received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as [...] "notoriously fatuous" [...] during the war period. Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as [...] "a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent" [...] and believes {{that he may have}} been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes him as [...] "charming but unlovable" [...] and thinks that the troops despised Beach Thomas more than they did the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the authorities while based in their headquarters.|$|E

However, unlike most series (which are often set in New York City), Runaways {{is set in}} Los Angeles, an unexplored area of the Marvel Universe. This, in turn, marked a significance for the story arc at the time; being a new series, [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] had been expected {{to take place in}} New York City. Matt Fraction, a prominent writer for various Marvel Comics series quotes, [...] "It was sort of great to see in Runaways that California was such a blank slate. It was refreshing to watch Brian create this sort of whole cloth." [...] Vaughan's decision prompted Fraction to create a new series to take place in Los Angeles as well. Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan quoted, [...] "I imagine that Angelinos in the Marvel Universe think of super heroes and villains the way that New Yorkers think of Hollywood celebrities.

The Midrash thus {{concluded that they}} were not the strongest of the brothers, and named them as Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Benjamin, and Issachar. The Midrash explained that Joseph took these five brothers, because he reasoned that if he presented the strongest to Pharaoh, then Pharaoh would on make them his warriors. Therefore, Joseph presented these five, who were not mighty men. The Midrash taught that <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not strong from the blessing of Moses in [...] where every brother whose name Moses repeated in his blessing was mighty, while every brother whose name Moses did not repeat was not mighty.

But the others, whose names were not repeated, were not mighty, therefore he presented them to Pharaoh. In the Babylonian Talmud, however, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari who the five were. Rabbah bar Mari replied that Rabbi Johanan said that they were those whose names were repeated in the Farewell of Moses, [...] (and thus the mightier of the brothers). Besides Judah, the five whose names Moses repeated were Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher and Naphtali. Explaining why Moses repeated Judah’s name in [...] but Joseph nonetheless excluded him from the five, Rabbah bar Mari explained that Moses repeated Judah’s name for a different purpose, which Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani recounted that Rabbi Johanan said. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words of [...] “Let Reuben live and not die, in that his men become few, and this is for Judah,” to teach that during the 40 years that the Israelites were in the wilderness, the bones of Judah rolled around detached in the coffin that conveyed the bones of the heads of the tribes from Egypt to the Promised Land along with Joseph's remains.

Therefore, in [...] Moses exhorted God: “Hear Lord the voice of Judah!” Thereupon God fitted each of Judah's limbs into its original place as one whole skeleton. Judah was, however, not permitted to ascend to the heavenly academy, until Moses said in [...] “And bring him in to his people.” As, however, Judah still did not know what the Rabbis were saying in that assembly and was thus unable to argue with the Rabbis on matters of the law, Moses said in [...] “His hands shall contend for him!” As again he was unable to conclude legal discussions in accordance with the Law, Moses said in [...] “You shall be a help against his adversaries!”.
