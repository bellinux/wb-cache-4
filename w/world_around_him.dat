His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|Renaissance humanism {{recognised}} no {{mutually exclusive}} polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies {{in science and}} engineering are sometimes considered as impressive and innovative as his artistic work. These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science). They were made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

In this novel, Juan Goytisolo, one of Spain's most celebrated novelists, takes the voice of those Spaniards who grew up during the Spanish Civil War, when the dictator Franco ruled with an iron grip around the population. The narrator discovers, upon his return, that he is torn between the Islamic and European <b>worlds</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> and in the end he finds that none of the two religions give him satisfaction.|$|R

5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and attributes {{of plants and animals}} in the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
5|$|At present, some 192 spells are known, {{though no}} single {{manuscript}} contains them all. They served {{a range of}} purposes. Some are intended to give the deceased mystical knowledge in the afterlife, or perhaps to identify them with the gods: for instance, Spell 17 is an obscure and lengthy description of the god Atum. Others are incantations to ensure the different elements of the dead person's being were preserved and reunited, and to give the deceased control over the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Still others protect the deceased from various hostile forces or guide him through the underworld past various obstacles. Famously, two spells also deal with the judgement of the deceased in the Weighing of the Heart ritual.|$|E

25|$|Belief {{in natural}} law and transcendent moral order lay the {{foundation}} for traditionalist conservative thought. Reason and divine revelation inform natural law and the universal truths of faith. It is through these universal truths of faith that man orders himself and the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Mankind organized society {{on the basis of these}} universal truths of faith. The traditionalist holds axiomatic the belief that religion precedes civilization (see T. S. Eliot's essays Christianity and Culture). Most traditionalist conservatives embrace High Church Christianity (e.g. T. S. Eliot, an Anglo-Catholic; Russell Kirk, a Roman Catholic; and Rod Dreher, an Eastern Orthodox Christian). However, not all traditionalists are High Church Christians. Other traditionalists whose faith traditions are notable include Caleb Stegall, who is an evangelical Protestant. Many conservative mainline Protestants are also traditionalist conservatives, including some of the writers for Touchstone Magazine. Many traditionalists are Jewish, such as the late Will Herberg, Irving Louis Horowitz, Mordecai Roshwald and Paul Gottfried.|$|E

Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew out of the darkness to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon a man whom the legend claims {{was the first of the}} Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water.

25|$|Throughout Lullaby, Streator is the reader's only narrator. True to his {{journalist}} occupation, he is {{detailed in}} many of his descriptions of the events going on around him. At the same time, Streator tends to be philosophical and cynical about the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him</b> and the people he meets, probably because of the tragedies that have haunted him for many years. In regards to the actual sequence and happenings of events, {{he seems to be}} a reliable narrator. But often his philosophical asides seem to overshadow his duty as a balanced narrator. At times, it is frustrating not knowing the true motives of Helen, Mona, or Oyster and, by the end, it is apparent that Streator could not always be trusted. But the nature of the story insists that we only get one perspective; one man retelling the past that has resulted in the present. Streator himself knows the issues with how he is telling the story, but in his recognition of the potential problems of a first person perspective, he becomes a more reliable narrator.|$|E
25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein‚Äôs ‚Äúquest‚Äù to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics is saying about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely ‚Äúself-certain actants‚Äù capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one‚Äôs relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E

25|$|Lysaker & Lysaker {{explained}} that Bakhtin theorized {{of human beings}} as entities composed of a multiplicity of voices (self-as-father, self-as-son, self-as-student, self-as-teacher, self-as-sad, self-as-happy, self-as-pro-life) that are in constant flux within him as he dialogues with and relates to the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him.</b> These voices constantly arrange and re-arrange themselves in hierarchies that are not governed by an overarching ego. Each hierarchy of voices (roles and dispositions) constitutes a dialogical position. Lysaker & Lysaker use the term dialogical positions because they are exactly the positions (roles and dispositions) Dasein takes {{up in the world}} when interacting with and relating to others‚Äî-and are constituted by his polyphonic nature. The flux, or re-arrangement, occurs from situational contexts that tells Dasein which dialogical position, or set of voices, must come to the foreground. The flux is also based on increased understanding of the world around human beings and their respective roles in it. Hermeneuts {{say that this is a}} stark contrast to mainstream paradigms in psychotherapy. Instead of a single ego, or voice, that makes up a person's identity and stands above and against the world, a constantly-rearranging hierarchy of multiple voices dialogues with others and co-constitutes a person's identity, and that this is the reason that Taylor writes that we should abandon paradigms such as the self as a highly autonomous individual and re-conceptualize that self as a dialogical self that is always-already a relational being constantly engaged in multiple ongoing conversations.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger‚Äôs work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing ‚Äúthem as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‚ÄòTo experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating‚Äù (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are ‚Äúaffective modes of awareness‚Äù (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don‚Äôt necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the <b>world</b> <b>around</b> <b>him,</b> they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor‚Äôs theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that this is where it rightfully belongs.|$|E
