500|$|Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its {{composition}} {{and noted that}} the disco and gospel genres are where middle-aged woman can [...] "thrive", whereby Carey [...] "fits in unsurprisingly well". He was, however, critical {{of the decision to}} include Wale on the song. Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required. Conversely, fashion designer Donatella Versace, a friend of Carey's, told Vogue that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as [...] "poetry", and that it made her <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance [...] "all summer".|$|E

I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. I wanted to talk about serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should be}} so glad!" [...] said Rose. [...] "What a lovely little thing she is! I hope she'll like it. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{something}} pretty for her. I think, {{at this time of}} the year, lawn teas are a little variety." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> {{the wall}} we won't want any scaling ladders," [...] remarked Tom grimly. [...] "Oh, {{if only we}} knew that Dick and Uncle Randolph were safe!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen! why he's got {{a double}} lot of candles--does the man want [...] to {{illuminate}} the house?--does he <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> a torch-light [...] procession?--what is he up to, any how?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I guess {{everybody}} will be glad," [...] returned Roger, {{and he was}} right.

But the boys had a time on the quiet, and thoroughly enjoyed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! then do, pray, let us play at it. Look, there's {{a little}} stand up there, where I have always so <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and be Hermione, and descend {{to the sound}} of slow music. There's a musical-box in the back drawing-room that will make the music.|$|R
6000|$|... "Taxicab? The {{last man}} {{to run a}} taxicab was Jim Lumpkins, and now Jim's struck oil and he's so rich he won't do nothing. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> to Smedley's I reckon you'll have to hoof it." ...|$|E
