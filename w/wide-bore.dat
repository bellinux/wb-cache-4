5000|$|The cimbasso (its name {{derived from}} 'corno basso' contra-basso) in its {{original}} form had a bell pointed upwards like the wider-bored tuba, the FF, EE and BB basses. Verdi disliked the <b>wide-bore</b> [...] "damned Bombardoni Austriche!", {{not only because of}} the hoarse, broad tone, but also because of the Austrian origin of those <b>wide-bore</b> 'Bombardone-tubas'. This attitude was inspired by the hated Austrian occupation of northern Italy in the years before the Risorgimento.

5000|$|Trocars {{are widely}} used by veterinarians not only for {{draining}} hydrothorax, ascites, or for introducing instruments in laparoscopic surgery, but for acute animal-specific conditions as well. In cases of ruminal tympany (bloat) in cattle, a <b>wide-bore</b> trocar may be passed through the skin into the rumen to release trapped gas. In dogs, a similar procedure is often performed for patients presenting with GDV (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus) in which a <b>wide-bore</b> trocar is passed through the skin into the stomach to immediately decompress the stomach. Depending on the severity of clinical signs on presentation, this is often performed after pain management has been administered but prior to general anaesthesia. Definitive surgical treatment involves anatomical repositioning of the stomach and spleen followed by a right-sided gastropexy. [...] Depending on the severity, partial gastrectomy and/or splenectomy may be indicated if the relevant tissues have necrosed due to ischemia caused by torsion/avulsion of the supplying vasculature. 72hr post-operative supportive care, fluid therapy and ECG monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias is highly recommended.|$|E

These rocket-type bo-hiya had {{the appearance of a}} thick arrow with large fins, a wood shaft and a metal tip; they resembled the Korean chongtong, a cannon-fired rocket. Bo-hiya were ignited by lighting a fuse made from incendiary waterproof rope which was wrapped around the shaft; when lit the bo-hiya was launched from either a <b>wide-bore</b> cannon, a form of tanegashima (Japanese matchlock) called hiya zutsu, or from a mortar-like weapon (hiya taihou). By the 16th century, Japanese pirates were reported to have used bo-hiya. During one sea battle it was said the bo hiya were [...] "falling like rain". Bo-hiya were standard equipment on Japanese military vessels, where they were used to set fire to enemy ships.|$|E
50|$|As {{proposed}} by Issigonis, the engine itself was also radical, being a water-cooled flat-four unit. One of Miles Thomas' few {{restrictions on the}} Mosquito project was {{that it had to}} have an engine that would not fall afoul of the British horsepower tax, which taxed cars under a formula relating to their engine cylinder bore. At the same time, Thomas wanted the car to appeal to the all-important export markets, which had no such restrictions, and generally favoured larger-engined cars. Issigonis' solution was the flat-four engine which could easily be produced in two versions - a narrow-bore 800 cc version for the British market and a <b>wide-bore</b> 1100 cc version for export. Both versions would use identical parts, except for the actual cylinder blocks (which could still be produced on the same machinery) and the pistons. The flat-four layout reduced the overall length of the engine, further increasing potential cabin space, and reduced the car's centre of gravity for improved handling.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} CT {{scanners}} with larger bore sizes have offered {{the potential for}} radiotherapy departments to undertake the majority or all treatment planning simulation via CT. <b>Wide-bore</b> scanners can present some unique issues when being commissioned for clinical use. During the process of converting a radiotherapy department to full CT simulation, several issues regarding images produced by a <b>wide-bore</b> scanner were identified. These were investigated by using electron density and image resolution phantoms. It {{was found that the}} reconstruction algorithm used by the scanner of interest for extended field of view (FOV) imaging, combined with the extended X-ray source-to-detector distance, influenced the resolution and quality of images. The reconstruction technique influenced the relationship between electron density and CT number with distance from the scanner axis, leading to image artefacts. A variation of 400 CT units is seen for cortical bone across the scanner FOV, with smaller variations for water and breast tissue. It is anticipated that this variation will impact on tissue delineation, and subsequent dose calculation would become questionable should beams pass through large areas of artefact. Image resolutions of 0. 5 and 0. 3 line-pairs per millimetre (lp/mm) were achievable in the primary and extended FOV regions respectively. Several aspects of image production with a <b>wide-bore</b> scanner that can influence imaging for radiotherapy treatment planning have been highlighted. Departments should be mindful of these issues when using a GE Lightspeed <b>wide-bore</b> scanner and should consider how scanner settings should be optimised for the use of images in treatment planning...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{possibility}} of operating a <b>wide-bore</b> column with an inner diameter of 530 m at vacuum conditions was investigated as a route towards fast gas chromatography. High analysis speeds can be obtained {{as a result of}} the sub-ambient pressure conditions present in the column, and the consequently high diffusion coefficient of the solute in the mobile phase. The advantage of using a <b>wide-bore</b> column is the high sample capacity. To enable vacuum operation through coupling a <b>wide-bore</b> column to a mass spectrometer, three types of restricting the column flow were investigated. The first method uses a narrow bore pre-column (60 cm length× 100 m i. d.), the second method relies on the use of a tapered on column supercritical fluid chromatography restrictor (SFC-restriction), whereas the third method makes use of a micro-injection valve. It was concluded that the best performance was obtained using the narrow-bore column restriction and the SFC-type restriction. Analysis examples in the seconds- and minutes-range are shown, with peak-widths ranging from 0. 1 to 2 seconds at half height. It was concluded that with a film-thickness above 1. 5 m, the advantage of the increase in analysis-speed due to low pressures is nullified due to retention time increase on a thick film column...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the reliability for quantitative measurement of glutamate concentration in the nucleus accumbens using a 70 -cm <b>wide-bore</b> clinical 3 T MRI. 1 H-MRS of the nucleus accumbens was acquired using the Point-Resolved Spectroscopic Sequence (PRESS) with echo time of 40 ms from 10 healthy volunteers (5 female; age range: 18 – 30 years) on two separate visits (a baseline, and 1 -month time point). The Java-based Magnetic Resonance User Interface (jMRUI) software package was used to quantitatively measure the absolute metabolite concentrations. The test-retest reliability and reproducibility were assessed using intraclass correlations coefficients (ICC), and coefficients of variation (CV). Glutamate concentrations were similar across visits (P = 0. 832). Reproducibility measures for all metabolites were good with CV ranging from 7. 8 to 14. 0 %. The ICC values of all metabolites for the intra-class measures were excellent (ICC > 0. 8), except that the reliability for Glx (glutamate + glutamine) was good (ICC = 0. 768). Pearson correlations for all metabolites were all highly significant (r = 0. 636 – 0. 788, P < 0. 05). In conclusion, the short-echo-time PRESS can reliably obtain high quality glutamate spectrum from a ~ 3. 4 cm 3 voxel of the nucleus accumbens using a 70 -cm <b>wide-bore</b> clinical 3 T MRI...|$|E

40|$|The vacuum {{variations}} at {{the apex}} of an artificial teat during simulated milking were measured in a factorial-design laboratory test involving six cluster types, two internal diameters (13. 5 mm and 16 mm) of long milk tube (LMT), three water flow rates (4, 6 and 8 l/min), simultaneous (4 × 0) and alternate (2 × 2) pulsation patterns and three pulsator ratios (60, 64, and 68 %). Four of the six clusters were fitted with <b>wide-bore</b> tapered liners and represented all combinations of two claw volumes (150 or 420 ml) and two short-milk-tube bores (8. 5 mm and 13. 5 mm). Two clusters were fitted with narrow-bore liners (22 and 25 mm) that had large-bore short milk tubes and large claw volumes. The vacuum variations were expressed as mean vacuum at the teat-end during the b-phase of pulsation (TVB), mean vacuum at the teat end measured over complete pulsation cycles (TV), minimum vacuum measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVM) and amplitude of vacuum fluctuation measured over complete pulsation cycles (TVF). The highest level of TVB was recorded with <b>wide-bore</b> tapered liners. For a milking unit fitted with a <b>wide-bore</b> tapered liner TVF was reduced and TVM increased by increasing either the bore of the short milk tube or the volume of the claw. When the bore of the LMT was increased TVB, TV and TVF increased. Simultaneous pulsation gave higher TVB (P < 0. 001) and higher TVF (P < 0. 001) than alternate pulsation for all cluster types. The overall effects of altering pulsator ratio were significant but small in practical terms. There were significant interactions between cluster type and water flow rate and pulsation pattern for TVB, TV, TVM and TVF. peer-reviewedEuropean Unio...|$|E

This study presents a range of normal adult straw drinking speeds and discusses clinical applications. Method: Straw drinking speed in a normal healthy population of 70 adults from 18 to 95 years of age was measured. Three types of straws were used: a Pat Saunders valved straw (PSVS), a <b>wide-bore</b> straw and a narrow-bore straw (NBS). Participants drank 40  ml of water for each straw tested. All {{participants were asked to}} comment on the straws used. A mixed-method design was used wherein both quantitative and simple structured qualitative data were collected. Results: Drinking speed was quickest for the <b>wide-bore</b> straw, followed by the NBS and slowest for the PSVS. This was supported by qualitative comments from the adults who reported that the PSVS was the most difficult straw to use. There {{were no significant differences between}} straw flow or straw type and sex of the participants. There were significant changes with aging and a decrease in flow speed with the NBS. Weight and height had some effect on straw drinking speeds. There was a slight correlation between age and sex and age and height, but not between age and weight.
