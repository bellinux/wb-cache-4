40|$|AbstractCyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in the gas solid separation processes. Their dimensions and configurations have a great influence on their performance {{and they have been}} widely studied in literature. In this research, the impacts of using a ceramic <b>wear</b> <b>liner</b> inside the wall of a special dust collector cyclone, installed in the Golgohar mining and industrial company in Iran, is investigated. In this research some numerical calculations and software analysis, based on the CFD, have been carried out and the results have been compared with the results of the practical tests and recorded data. This comparison shows the conformity {{of the results of the}} practical tests and the calculated results. In this research, the flow is a two-phase, gas-solid, type and the collision of the solid materials, which are mainly iron material with 200 ∼ 700 micron dimensions, with the cyclone wall will increase the erosion. Therefore, to reduce the erosion a special ceramic <b>wear</b> <b>liner</b> is used as a protective layer for cyclone wall. Adding this protective layer has changed the geometry of the cyclone wall from different aspects; so the impacts of this type of liner on the performance and the separation efficiency of the dust collector cyclone should be investigated. The dilute two phase flow inside a cyclone is simulated using an Euler-Lagrange hybrid method. The gas phase is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. This investigation can be a starting point for more research that can be result in producing more appropriate and efficient cyclones. For more accuracy, the comparison have been done for different speed of flow and the results show that this liner has a negative impact on the dust separation efficiency in this cyclone...|$|E
40|$|BHP Billiton Iron Ore is in {{the process}} of {{selecting}} wear liners for installation in their transfer chutes. Wear liners are chosen to maximise service life, while minimising maintenance costs and downtime. Since there are many types available, it is desirable to obtain empirical evidence from preliminary wear tests prior to making final selections for site trials. The purpose of this project was to develop laboratory tests that could be applied to full sized <b>wear</b> <b>liner</b> samples to compare their abrasion and impact resistance. A large scale Dry Sand Rubber Wheel abrasion test was designed and constructed at UWA, accommodating the large samples whilst simulating the required abrasion mechanism. Furthermore, a new method for quantifying abrasive wear using surface replication techniques was attempted. This showed that the need to weigh samples could be eliminated if the abrasion test produces a clearly defined wear scar. A drop-weight impact test rig was also constructed, to investigate impact resistance. Preliminary tests and surface examination indicated that forces required to cause observable microcracking were greater than those able to be created using this test rig...|$|E

40|$|This study proposes {{two methods}} for {{exploring}} the wear volume of a <b>worn</b> <b>liner.</b> The first method is a numerical method, in which SolidWorks(A (R)) software is used to create models of the worn out regions of <b>liners</b> at various <b>wear</b> directions and depths.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. In the comminution industry, cone crushers are widely used for secondary and subsequent stages of size reduction. For a given crusher, the achieved size reduction is governed by the closed-side setting. Hadfield Steel is commonly used to line the crushing members to minimize <b>wear.</b> Yet, <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> caused by some rock types can still be excessive. Enlargement of discharge opening induced by <b>wear</b> of <b>liners</b> produces a drift in product size which, if unchecked, can lead to high volumes of re-circulating load. Alteration of closed-side setting is now commonly achieved via hydraulic means. However, compensation of <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> still involves plant shut down and loss of production.

40|$|Cone crushers {{are used}} in the {{aggregates}} and mining industries to crush rock material. The pressure on cone crusher liners is the key factor that influences the hydraulic pressure, power draw and <b>liner</b> <b>wear.</b> In order to dynamically analyze and calculate cone crusher performance along with <b>liner</b> <b>wear,</b> a series of experiments are performed to obtain the crushed rock material samples from a crushing plant at different time intervals. In this study, piston die tests are carried out and a model relating compression coefficient, compression ratio and particle size distribution to a corresponding pressure is presented. On this basis, a new wear prediction model is proposed combining the empirical model for predicting <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> with time parameter. A simple and practical model, based on the wear model and interparticle breakage, is presented for calculating compression ratio of each crushing zone along with <b>liner</b> <b>wear.</b> Furthermore, the size distribution of the product is calculated based on existing size reduction process model. A method of analysis of product size distribution and shape in the crushing process considering <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> is proposed. Finally, the validity of the wear model is verified via testing.

40|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines are widely utilized in modem automobiles. Around 10 % {{of the total}} fuel energy is dissipated to heat due to mechanical friction, among which 20 % {{is caused by the}} contact between the cylinder liner and the piston rings. The <b>wear</b> of cylinder <b>liner</b> not only leads to surface damage, but also results in the change of liner lubrication conditions. Therefore, a large number of tests are performed by researchers to investigate the <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> process and its impact on engine lubrication. This work {{is the first step toward}} developing a wear model to predict the evolution of liner roughness and ring pack lubrication during break-in period. A physics-based <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> model is built in this work, with focus on two mechanisms: surface plastic flattening and fatigue wear. Both mechanisms are simulated through a set of governing equations and are coupled together to complete the algorithm of the <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> model. Simulations of break-in wear are performed to different liner surfaces finishes, with different external normal pressures. Simulation results indicate that the <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> rate depends on the size and shape of liner surface asperities, which may provide guidance for surface manufacturing. The results also show consistence with the Archard's wear law, describing the proportional correlation between normal pressure and steady state wear rate. This wear model is then used to study the influence of <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> on engine lubrication. Through the friction for entire engine cycles, simulated results are compared with experimental friction measurements. The comparison shows that the calculated friction evolution during break-in has the same trend and comparable magnitude as the measurements, indicating the efficiency of the wear model.

40|$|Gyratory crushers are {{frequently}} used for first stage sizing in the minerals processing industry and are typically critical path fixed plant equipment. Hence any associated downtime or inefficient operation can have serious consequences for downstream processing {{and therefore the}} overall plant productivity. Despite the pressing requirement to tightly control gyratory crusher operation, no accurate, reliable, cost efficient, or practical condition monitoring tools or holistic performance assessment methods have been utilized by practitioners to date. This paper introduces a new method combining laser scanning based CrusherMapperTM software 3 D liner shape information and Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling to assess the effect of measured concave and mantle <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> on gyratory crusher production.

40|$|The {{operation}} of SAG mills is variable over time {{due to their}} continually changing liner shape, mass and subsequent load motion.

40|$|Background/Aim. Recurrent vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} is relatively frequent condition, {{and may have}} serious health consequences, like chronic vulvovaginal pain syndrome. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} possible risk factors for recurrent {{vulvovaginal candidiasis}} in non-pregnant females within the reproductive age. Methods. The design of our study was of a case-control type. Case and control patients were selected from the gynecological patients at six primary care facilities in Serbia and in Montenegro. The data on the patients' health condition, concomitant therapy and diseases were taken from their records, and the data on habits were obtained by unstructured interview. For potential risk factors crude odds ratios were calculated, and then adjusted by logistic regression. Results. A total of fifty-one patients had four or more episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis during the last year (cases), and 132 patients with one to three episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis were sampled as controls, matched by age. The only two significant associations were found between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and continual <b>wearing</b> of panty <b>liners</b> during the last year (Odds ratio - ORadjusted: 3. 97; confidence interval - CI: 1. 57 - 10. 02; p = 0. 004), and between recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and predominant use of vaginal tampons during menstruation in the last year (ORadjusted: 4. 25; CI: 1. 11 - 16. 27; p = 0. 035).

Charge motion {{is one of the key}} parameters affecting grinding efficiency and mill power draw. Although there have been numerous investigations on the effect of liner design on charge motion, the effect of charge profile due to <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> during mill operation along the mill length has not received much attention. In this research, Powell’s analytical approach to calculate the charge trajectory with respect to the liner profile was used to develop a software based on Microsoft Excel©. As a case study, the <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> profile of the Sarcheshmeh copper complex SAG mill was used to model the <b>liner</b> <b>wear</b> rate and calculate the changes of lifter face angle and lifter height during mill operation. Results were then used to determine charge motion in the SAG mill at any given operation time. The results indicated that after 4000 h of operation the lifters face angle increased from 14 ° to 47. 1 ° and the height of lifters decreased from 15. 2 to 5. 8 cm. Modeling charge motion in the mill after 3000 h of operation showed 34 ° difference between the maximum and minimum of angles of impact along the mill length due to the nonuniform wear profile. It was also found that the variation in the pattern of the charge motion depends on the mill working hours and the distance of the desired point from the feed end. It was determined that the ratio of spacing to the height of lifters (S/H) plays an important role in the grinding efficiency and throughput. After 4000 h of operation, S/H ratio of the Sarcheshmeh SAG mill increased from 1. 7 to 4. 6...|$|R
