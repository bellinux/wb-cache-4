25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> above my head. Then I threw my left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
2500|$|Chase J. Nielsen, {{one of the}} U.S. airmen {{who flew}} in the Doolittle raid {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, was subjected to waterboarding by his Japanese captors. At their trial for war crimes following the war, he testified [...] "Well, I was put on my back on the floor <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and legs stretched out, one guard holding each limb. The towel was wrapped around my face and put across my face and water poured on. They poured water on this towel until I was almost unconscious from strangulation, then they would let up until I'd get my breath, then they'd start over again... I felt more or less like I was drowning, just gasping between life and death." [...] In 2007, Senator John McCain claimed that the United States military hanged Japanese soldiers for waterboarding American prisoners of war during World War II. A minimal sentence for Japanese soldiers convicted of waterboarding American soldiers was 15 years.|$|E

6000|$|... "What nonsense, mother--you know I don't love her--I--I {{tell you}} I DON'T love her--she doesn't even walk <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> because I don't want her to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What in thunder is {{the matter}} with me?" [...] he asked. [...] "What is this thing on my head? What {{is the matter}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> I don't seem able to move it?" ...|$|R
60|$|We entered {{with our}} prisoner, Pierre {{leading the way}} {{grasping}} Horry by the coat-collar, while I brought up the rear <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> around the Tory's neck so that I might keep a hand clapped over his mouth.|$|R
60|$|<b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{before me}} I walked {{steadily}} in. I should {{lie down in}} my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning.|$|E
60|$|I didn't answer him. I {{might have}} told 'im that there's about five million Bills in England, but I didn't. I stood there <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> folded acrost my chest, {{and looked at}} him, superior.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried she. [...] "I {{come close}} to you, holding you. Perhaps I am royal, perhaps I am sacred. If I hold you--Would God we could fly <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> about you!--it may be, they will not shoot at you--" ...|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} I had the paper rolled up and {{resting on the}} sill of the window, which was open. Not wishing to refuse him directly, I gave the sheet a slight shove <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and this sent it {{fluttering}} away.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} head dejectedly on my shoulder. My anger {{vanished}} atthose sad words; love only remained--love mingled with profoundest compassion and remorse {{for the pain}} I had inflicted. Supporting her <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> I tenderly stroked her dark hair, and, stooping, pressed my lips against it.|$|R
6000|$|If it's ever spring again, [...] Spring again, I shall {{go where}} went I when Down the moor-cock splashed, and hen, Seeing me not, amid their flounder, Standing <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> around her; If it's ever spring again, [...] Spring again, I shall go where went I then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said depreciatingly. [...] "They ain't {{big enough}} to stand the strain. I can hit like a mule <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and shoulders. They are too strong, an' when I smash {{a man on the}} jaw the hands get smashed, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} that, Uncle. It {{was just}} the same <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> when I began to climb. But I can't stand this any longer. I can no more get up than I can fly;" [...] and Dick rolled over on to his side.|$|E
6000|$|... "I arrived--to where I am now--pretty dizzy," [...] he responded, with a {{smile that}} was both radiant and sorrowful. He took her hands and held them close. [...] "Lenore!... if I come home from the war--still <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and legs--whole--will you marry me?" ...|$|E
60|$|The missionary still {{sat with}} his back toward us, and, being so intent upon his book, I found that by keeping my eyes upon him it was {{perfectly}} safe to walk <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> around Ruth until we had nearly reached him. Then I took her hand in mine, and we {{stepped in front of}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Twice, Monsieur," [...] she corrected, whereupon I {{recalled}} {{how she had}} surprised me <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> about the waist of the inn-keeper's daughter, and had Heaven given me shame I might have blushed. But if sweet Yvonne thought to bring Gaston de Luynes to task for profiting by the good things which God's providence sent his way, she was led by vanity into a prodigious error.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{you will}} not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show your belief in me by letting me clasp you <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm?</b> Come, between us two and nobody else, now. We know each other well; {{and you know that}} I love you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are. Mayn't I treat you as a lover?" ...|$|R
60|$|The man upon me held me down awkwardly, {{leaving me}} many openings--one of which I was not slow in taking {{advantage}} of, so that almost before the fellow knew that I was awake I was upon my feet <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{over his shoulders}} and about his waist and had hurled him heavily over my head to the hard rubble of the beach, where he lay quite still.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{stood there}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> folded acrost my chest, as calm as a cucumber. The other party stood there {{watching}} us, and wot ’e could ’ave seen in her, I can’t think. She was dressed {{more like a}} man than a woman, {{and it would have}} taken the good looks of twenty like her to ’ave made one barmaid. I stood looking at ’er like a man in a dream.|$|E
6000|$|Lord George laughed. [...] "A little matter pleases thee hugely," [...] said he; [...] "but as {{to being}} ungainly, who so sayeth that of thee belieth thee, Myles; thou art not ungainly, sirrah. But {{that is not}} to the point. I have chosen thee for my equerry to-day; so make thou haste and don thine armor, and then come hither again, and Hollingwood will fit thee with a wreathed bascinet I have within, and a juppon {{embroidered}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and colors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan, I {{will get}} you to undo this bandage and get off my coat; then I will make a pad of my {{handkerchief}} and dip it {{in the water and}} you can lay it on my shoulder, and then help me on again <b>with</b> <b>my</b> coat. <b>My</b> <b>arm</b> is getting horribly painful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the point, sir," [...] cried Belcher. [...] "By the Lord, I wish they'd let me {{take his}} place, even <b>with</b> <b>my</b> left <b>arm</b> {{strapped}} behind me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't bother {{about that}} sale, if I were you," [...] Burton whispered hoarsely. [...] "I {{tell you what}} it is, I daren't go on like this any longer. I shall do {{something}} desperate. This horrible place is getting attractive to me! I shall probably sit here and order more beer and wait till Maud comes; I shall stay to lunch and sit <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> around her afterwards! I am going to take a bean at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} to do," [...] said Kate, [...] "is to hire a ship; I know that my little {{property}} will yield me money enough for that. As for bringing him back, that's for me to do. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> around his neck he cannot be a pirate captain. And think of it, uncle! If my arms are not soon around his neck, {{it may be the}} hangman's rope which will be there. That is, if he is not killed by that revengeful Captain Vince." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{fell into}} a bunk, but his sorrow haunted him even in his troubled sleep, and his moans awed us as we listened. The next day he told us his story with more calmness. It was horrible indeed, and might well have frightened a less courageous woman than Polly Ann. Imploring her not to go, he became wild again, and brought tears to her eyes when he spoke of his own wife. [...] "They tomahawked her, ma'am, because she could not walk, and the baby beside her, and I {{standing}} by <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> tied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, for ever, for {{you shall}} never, {{never leave the}} house. Your pilgrimage, from which you derived so little benefit, is over now. And if you ever attempt to go forth again to find out new wonders in the world, I shall clasp you round <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> as I do now, and keep you {{prisoner}} against your will; and if you say 'Farewell' a hundred times to me, I shall blot out that sad word every time with my lips, and put a better one in its place, until my word conquers yours." ...|$|E
60|$|She trembled a little, great {{tears were}} brimming in her eyes, but again I read more than pity or sorrow in their liquid depths, {{and the next}} moment I had spread <b>my</b> wet <b>arms</b> about her and her head rested on my shoulder. There {{are some things that}} concern but two souls among all those on earth, and the low answer that came for the first time falteringly through her lips is to be {{numbered}} among them; but a little later, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> still about her, Grace smiled up at me wistfully as the remorseless waters lapped nearer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, Dermody," [...] he said, [...] "here {{is my son}} in your cottage--when {{he ought}} to be in my house." [...] He turned, and looked at me as I stood <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round little Mary, patiently waiting for my {{opportunity}} to speak. [...] "George," [...] he said, with the hard smile which was peculiar to him, when he was angry and was trying to hide it, [...] "you are making a fool of yourself there. Leave that child, and come to me." ...|$|R

60|$|I had not {{yet made}} up my mind in what manner I might best utter my last words among them so as to {{maintain}} the dignity of my character, and now I was standing over against Mr. Greene <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> folded on my breast. I had on my face a frown of displeasure, which I am able to assume upon occasions, but I {{had not yet}} determined what words I would use. After all, perhaps, it might be as well that I should leave them without any last words.|$|E
60|$|I stood <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> folded, {{feeling as}} glum as ever I did in my life, until their cutter {{was only a}} square hickering patch of white among the mists of the morning. It was breakfast time and the {{porridge}} upon the table before I got back, but I had no heart for the food. The old folk had taken the matter coolly enough, though my mother had no word too hard for Edie; for the two had never had much love for each other, and less of late than ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's my own watch, that I {{have been}} wearing for some time; but I've got another,--{{two or three}}, I believe, somewhere upstairs. You mustn't refuse me. I can't bear being refused. There are two or three little seals, too, which I have worn. I have taken off the one <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> because that's of no use to you, {{and it is to}} me. It doesn't want a key, but winds up at the handle, in this way," [...] and the earl {{proceeded}} to explain the nature of the toy.|$|E
60|$|I thank Mr. Chestle warmly, {{and shake}} hands. I think I am in a happy dream. I waltz with the eldest Miss Larkins once again. She says I waltz so well! I go {{home in a}} state of unspeakable bliss, and waltz in imagination, all night long, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> round the blue waist of my dear divinity. For some days afterwards, I am lost in rapturous reflections; but I neither see her in the street, nor when I call. I am imperfectly consoled for this {{disappointment}} by the sacred pledge, the perished flower.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{while he}} was doing this, I drove the thumb of my left hand, to the hilt into his eye-orifice and popped out his eye. This did not stop him. The meat had maddened him. He pursued the gushing stump of my wrist. Half a dozen times I fended <b>with</b> <b>my</b> intact <b>arm.</b> Then he got the poor mangled arm again, closed down, and {{stripped}} the meat off the bone from the shoulder down to the elbow-joint, where his teeth met and he was free of his second mouthful of me. But, at the same time, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> good <b>arm,</b> I thumbed out his remaining eye." ...|$|R
5000|$|Federer {{went on to}} play in the Davis Cup {{tie with}} Italy, and in his first match on the red clay courts at Valletta Cambiaso Club, in Genoa, won in a match against Simone Bolelli. He sealed Switzerland's {{qualification}} for the World Group with a victory over Potito Starace. Following the match, Federer was quoted as saying [...] "I was able to play very well. I have to go on holiday badly. I have a problem <b>with</b> <b>my</b> leg, I have a problem <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> — everything is hurting. And I've got to do some baby-sitting." [...] He later withdrew from the 2009 Japan Open and the Shanghai ATP Masters 1000.|$|R
