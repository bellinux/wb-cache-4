25|$|In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond {{to write}} and record a theme song for the Scotland {{national}} football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but he <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met {{on the same day}} when working on Illuminatus! in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.|$|E
25|$|After {{travelling}} through France, {{he settled}} in Italy in 1666 - at first as professor of anatomy at the University of Padua {{and then in}} Florence as in-house physician of Grand Duke of Tuscany Ferdinando II de' Medici, who supported arts and science and whom Steno had met in Pisa. Steno was invited {{to live in the}} Palazzo Vecchio; in return he had to gather a cabinet of curiosities. Steno went to Rome and met Pope Alexander VII and Marcello Malpighi, whom he admired. On his way back he watched a Corpus Christi procession in Livorno and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the right belief. In Florence Steno focused on the muscular system and the nature of muscle contraction. He became a member of Accademia del Cimento and had long discussions with Francesco Redi. Like Vincenzo Viviani, Steno proposed a geometrical model of muscles to show that a contracting muscle changes its shape but not its volume.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} a colonel, Jackson {{considered}} resigning his commission. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> missed his chance for promotion to brigadier {{at the age of}} 44, and believed he might have [...] "reached [...] ceiling" [...] as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion. He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1989, after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper {{on the future of the}} Army and taking the Higher Command and Staff Course. He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade—a post he held until 1992, thus missing the Gulf War. He was promoted from Member to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992.|$|E

500|$|Remaining {{captain of}} England, Hammond led the M.C.C. side which toured Australia in 1946–47. The visit was {{unsuccessful}} as England lost the five-match Test series 3–0. According to Wisden, Hammond's inability to make large scores {{was one of}} the reasons for the failure. Nor was he a success as captain. He was criticised for his field placement and people at home <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost control of the team. While he suffered some ill luck, Wisden said that he [...] "was not the same inspiring leader as at home against Australia in 1938". Other journalists noted that he did not consult his players, one of whom later commented that he showed little imagination in his use of bowlers. Hammond approached the tour as an exercise in goodwill, promising his men an enjoyable time. It was noted that Bradman, the Australian captain, took a more competitive attitude towards the series. Team spirit was good on the outward journey, but Hammond's forthcoming divorce and other domestic concerns caused him to become isolated from the players and increasingly moody. He had poor relations with the press, who were very critical of his captaincy and reporting details of the dissolution of his marriage. As the tour progressed, he lost his dynamism as a leader, gave poor advice to the batsmen and made poor selections for the team.|$|E
500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that he <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E
2500|$|Ishida and Abe {{returned}} to Ogu, where they remained until his death. During their love-making this time, Abe put the knife {{to the base}} of Ishida's penis, and said she would make sure he would never play around with another woman. Ishida laughed at this. Two nights into this bout of sex, Abe began choking Ishida, and he told her to continue, saying that this increased his pleasure. She had him do it to her as well. On the evening of May 16, 1936, Abe used her obi sash to cut off Ishida's breathing during orgasm, and they both enjoyed it. They repeated this for two more hours. Once Abe stopped the strangulation, Ishida's face became distorted, and would not return to its normal appearance. Ishida took 30 tablets of a sedative called Calmotin to try to soothe his pain. According to Abe, as Ishida started to doze, he told her, [...] "You'll put the cord around my neck and squeeze it again while I'm sleeping, won't you... If you start to strangle me, don't stop, because it is so painful afterward." [...] Abe commented that she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> wanted her to kill him, but on reflection decided he must have been joking.|$|E
