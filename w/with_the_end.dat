5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Wilfrid's long struggle {{to regain the}} Bishopric of York, and the two-year delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election {{may have been due}} to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E

25|$|When kept as a talisman, a {{horseshoe}} is said {{to bring}} good luck.

Others believe that the horseshoe should be hung <b>the</b> other way (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> pointing down), as it will then release its luck to the people around it.
