25|$|The {{historians who}} relay such stories, principally Tacitus and Suetonius, wrote some 70 {{years after the}} events in an {{environment}} hostile to the imperial line to which Messalina had belonged. Suetonius' history is largely scandal-mongering. Tacitus claims to be transmitting 'what was heard and written by my elders' without naming sources other than the memoirs of Agrippina the Younger, who had arranged to displace Messalina's children in the imperial succession and was therefore particularly interested in blackening her predecessor's name. It {{has been argued that}} <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for history is largely a result of the political sanctions that followed her death.|$|E
25|$|In October 2016, 1500 passes {{were put}} up for sale, giving {{exclusive}} access to the park when it first opened and valid until September 2017. The NZ$759 passes sold out within three days. The price for annual passes, set at NZ$1199, was not released until {{the day of the}} opening party. Passes for day entry (NZ$75) and single chairlift rides (NZ$19.75) are also available. Entry to the park itself is free, including riding the tracks, and <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> give access to is the chairlift. Access to the zip-line is available via separate passes. The park was opened by the Mayor of Christchurch, Lianne Dalziel, on 21 December 2016.|$|E
25|$|Also {{writing in}} 1971, Hugh M. Richmond offered {{an entirely new}} view of the play's love story lines. He argued that <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for love in this play is {{actually}} a self-destructive expression of passion. He argued that the play's significant characters are all affected by passion and by a sadomasochistic type of sexuality. This passion prevents the lovers from genuinely communicating with each other. At {{the same time it}} protects them from the disenchantment with the love interest that communication inevitably brings. The exception to the rule is Bottom, who is chiefly devoted to himself. His own egotism protects him from feeling passion for anyone else. Richmond also noted that there are parallels between the tale of Pyramus and Thisbe, featured in this play, and that of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} the modern concept of {{consciousness}} is often attributed to John Locke's Essay Concerning Human Understanding, published in 1690. [...] Locke defined consciousness as [...] "the perception of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> in a man's own mind". His essay influenced the 18th-century view of consciousness, and his definition appeared in Samuel Johnson's celebrated Dictionary (1755).|$|E
500|$|Music critic Chet Flippo {{wrote in}} a Texas Monthly article {{entitled}} [...] "Mathew, Mark, Luke and Willie: Willie Nelson's latest album {{is more than a}} good country music; it's almost Gospel": [...] "The difference between Nelson's Red Headed Stranger and any current C album, and especially <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for a soundtrack for Nashville, is astounding. What Nelson has done is simply unclassifiable; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as otherworldly. Red Headed Stranger conjures up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally obsessing".|$|E
500|$|Larkin's {{public persona}} {{was that of}} the no-nonsense, solitary Englishman who disliked fame and had no {{patience}} for the trappings of the public literary life. The posthumous publication by Anthony Thwaite in 1992 of his letters triggered controversy about his personal life and political views, described by John Banville as hair-raising, but also in places hilarious. Lisa Jardine called him a [...] "casual, habitual racist, and an easy misogynist", but the academic John Osborne argued in 2008 that [...] "the worst that anyone has discovered about Larkin are some crass letters and a taste for porn softer than <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for mainstream entertainment". Despite the controversy Larkin was chosen in a 2003 Poetry Book Society survey, almost two decades after his death, as Britain's best-loved poet of the previous 50 years, and in 2008 The Times named him Britain's greatest post-war writer.|$|E

500|$|The {{decision}} also contradicted previous precedent as to {{the nature}} of evidence. John Baker notes that it violates strong rules which exclude the use of written evidence to interpret a document, unless the evidence was found in said document. Baker also argued that ministerial statements should not be used as evidence because they are irrelevant; [...] "no individual member of Parliament {{is in a position to}} state what that intention is or to speak for the silent majority. Parliament acts as a corporate body and the only expression of its common intention is the text to which the Queen and both Houses have given their unqualified assent. <b>What</b> <b>passes</b> in one House is not formally known to the other". An individual MP's statements, minister or not, may be based on a false understanding of the legal issues; MPs regularly vote for proposals having disagreed with the statements of the spokesman simply because they like the proposal itself.|$|E
500|$|Modi {{said that}} the media had exaggerated while {{covering}} the extent of violence and criticised the media for [...] "provoking the violence by naming the religion of victims". Newspapers, particularly Sandesh, were reported by various organisations to have published [...] "inflammatory headlines, stories and pictures". A headline in Sandesh on 28 February 2002 read, [...] "Avenge Blood With Blood". After the massacre, when Muslims had returned from Hajj, Sandesh had published the headline, [...] "Hindus Beware: Hajj pilgrims return with deadly conspiracy", which caused terror among the returning Muslim community, and they were escorted by Army officials to their homes and were given protection to avoid attacks. A report by the People's Union for Civil Liberties stated, [...] "Major effect of media under long period has been to feed on the prevalent anti-Muslim prejudices of its Hindu readership and provoke it further by sensationalizing, twisting, mangling and distorting news or <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trapped in the Sky" [...] {{received}} a positive, contemporary critical response from L. Marsland Gander of The Daily Telegraph, who commented, [...] "It {{is a show}} {{that has to be}} seen to be disbelieved." [...] Writing for the same newspaper in 2011, Simon Heffer remembered his enthusiastic impressions of watching [...] "Trapped in the Sky" [...] as a boy in 1965, and how it endeared him {{to the rest of the}} series: [...] "... I had just watched the first episode of Thunderbirds. I felt as though the whole landscape of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for my imagination had been changed... It caused an excitement of the sort that is possible only for the very young, and it lasted for days. Indeed, every Saturday night was a renewal of the miracle." [...] Co-creator Sylvia Anderson observes that, by necessity, the pilot episode comprises many examples of exposition for the purposes of introducing the primary characters and vehicles. However, she considers the roles of Lady Penelope and Parker to be [...] "brief but effective".|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but I suggest he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E

2500|$|Poignant {{testimony}} and persuasive speaking is not <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> legislation, however; political compromise, arm-twisting, and parliamentary creativity are {{what is necessary}} to get a bill signed into law. The Senate Environmental and Land Use Committee, of which Macpherson was a member but not the chair, stood as an obstacle to passage, with only a minority of 3 of its 7 members supportive of SB 100. All efforts to clear compromise legislation through the committee failed. An end run was made around the legislative logjam through the establishment of a new ad hoc committee chaired by former legislator L. B. Day, which attempted to [...] "breathe life into a dead bill," [...] as Day phrased it.|$|E
2500|$|... "Fortunately the Socialist League is dormant for {{the time}} being. Our good Bax and Morris, craving to do {{something}} (if only they knew what?), are restrained only {{by the fact that}} there is absolutely nothing to do. Moreover they have far more truck with the anarchists than is desirable.... All this will pass, if only because there is absolutely nothing to be done over here [...] just now. But with Hyndman, who is well versed in political imposture and capable of all sorts of folly when his self-advancement is at stake...on the one hand and our two political babes in arms on the other, prospects are no means bright. Yet now we have socialist papers abroad proclaiming at the top of their voices that socialism in England is marching forward with gigantic strides! I am very glad to say that <b>what</b> <b>passes</b> for socialism here in England is not on the march — far from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>passes</b> in {{the world}} for [...] "good-nature", Hazlitt argues, [...] "is often no better than {{indolent}} selfishness". The Lord Chancellor, {{as an example of a}} good-natured man, [...] "would not hurt a fly ... has a fine oiliness in his disposition .... does not enter into the quarrels or enmities of others; bears their calamities with patience ... listens to the din and clang of war, the earthquake and the hurricane of the political and moral world with the temper and the spirit of a philosopher ...". But this sort of good-natured person, exemplified by Eldon, is, if one scrutinises the case, good-natured out of selfishness: [...] "tread on the toe of one of these amiable and imperturbable mortals, or let a lump of soot fall down the chimney and spoil their dinners, and see how they will bear it." [...] "All their patience is confined to the accidents that befal others: all their good humour is to be resolved into giving themselves no concern about any thing but their own ease and self-indulgence. Their charity begins and ends at home." [...] Their mode of self-focus cuts them off from human connexion: their [...] "being free from the common infirmities of temper is owing to their indifference to the common feelings of humanity".|$|E
