60|$|Seeing {{that his}} {{assistance}} was not needed Sparrer had busied himself elsewhere. He went {{along the road}} for some little distance in each direction, studying the ground carefully. The top surface of the ground had softened {{a little in the}} sun and in places the <b>wheel</b> <b>marks</b> were visible. This was especially true of the wrecked car, as this had been fitted with chains. It was comparatively easy to trace the course of this car, and Sparrer was soon satisfied in regard to it. On the <b>wheel</b> <b>marks</b> of the other car he spent more time, and he had just completed his examination as two mounted police dashed up. Swinging down from their horses they made hasty examination of the victims.|$|R
