25|$|Forced {{uses the}} Unity engine. BetaDwarf {{was formed by}} {{a small group of}} {{students}} in 2010, who moved into an unused classroom in Aalborg University – Copenhagen, Denmark and began developing the game. After seven months, the university discovered them when a lecturer accidentally <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> They were removed and made a successful Kickstarter campaign involving a picture on Imgur, which described their progress as a team; they were then able to set up their office in Copenhagen. Steffen Kabbelgaard, Game Director and CEO of BetaDwarf, credited the 1996 videogame Crash Bandicoot as an inspiration for the campaigns and gem rewards in Forced. A demo of the game was available in the 2013 Gamescom and PAX Prime. A beta version of Forced was initially released on Steam Early Access for Windows, OS X and Linux in the same year. Its full release was on October 24, 2013 which was also for Wii U. On March 19, 2014, BetaDwarf announced that the game would be available on Xbox One.|$|E
25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E

500|$|The Edge overdubbed the song's slide {{acoustic}} guitar, {{which was}} [...] "amplified through a blaster", {{while working on}} guitar compositions in a lounge next to the main studio of Windmill Lane Studios. Lanois <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and, impressed {{by the sound of}} the Edge's playing, wanted to record it on the spot rather than in the studio. Lanois brought the Edge headphones and plugged his guitar directly into the microphone input of the mixing console to record it. The producer said: [...] "The blaster was amplifying his slide guitar in a lovely way. He had honed in on this sound and sort of altered the EQs and controls so that it was pleasant to him".|$|E
500|$|Tess Harper was {{performing}} {{on stage in}} Texas when she attended a casting call for a minor role in the film. Beresford {{was so impressed with}} her that he cast her in the lead. He later said that the actresses he had seen before her demonstrated a sophistication and worldliness inappropriate for the part, while she brought a kind of rural quality without coming across as simple or foolish. Beresford said of Harper, [...] "She <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead. Harper said she knew she won the role when Beresford appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of champagne in each hand. Tender Mercies was Harper's feature film debut, and she was so excited about the role she bit her script {{to make sure it was}} real. When filming ended, Duvall gave her a blue cowgirl shirt as a gift with a card that read, [...] "You really were Rosa Lee".|$|E
500|$|The Wolverines {{were the}} {{unanimous}} pre-season Number 1 pick in 1981 but lost their opener to Wisconsin 2114. In the team meeting the next day, Schembechler <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and wrote [...] "Ed Muransky" [...] and [...] "Stan Edwards" [...] on the chalkboard, and then barked out, [...] "The {{rest of you}} are quitters. I want nothing {{more to do with}} you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. If we start to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

500|$|In November 1972, {{the group}} {{arranged}} a showcase with Don Ellis, the Epic Records executive who earlier had rejected Wicked Lester's album. While one Epic executive, Tom Werman, {{was impressed by}} the power and theatrics of this new incarnation of Wicked Lester, Ellis once again turned them down. As Ellis was leaving, Peter Criss's brother, who was drunk, vomited on his foot. In early December, Paul Stanley placed an ad in The Village Voice stating, [...] "LEAD GUITARIST WANTED with Flash and Ability. Album Out Shortly. No time wasters please." [...] The ad ran for two issues, December 7 and December 14, 1972, leading to several audition sessions. One audition was by Paul [...] "Ace" [...] Frehley who showed up wearing different-colored shoes, <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> without saying a word, hooked up his guitar and started playing. Frehley was asked back for a second audition and {{was a member of the}} band by Christmas 1972. Within a few weeks, the group changed its name to Kiss and played their first concert on January 30, 1973.|$|E
500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
2500|$|Doug Moon {{left the}} band {{because of his}} dislike of the band's {{increasing}} experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon's becoming so angered by Van Vliet's unrelenting criticism that he <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, [...] "Get that fucking thing out of here, {{get out of here}} and get back in your room", which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have [...] "passed through" [...] the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would {{have a profound effect on}} the quality of the Safe as Milk work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.|$|E

5000|$|Describing the band's 2011 lineup, Elizabeth Day of The Observer {{described}} Hercules and Love Affair as [...] "possibly {{the most}} disparate bunch ever to come together, call themselves a band and release an album. <b>The</b> five members <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in {{a blaze of}} colour and mismatched clothes like a pick'n'mix bag of sweets." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2003, Rihanna {{formed a}} musical trio {{with two of}} her classmates. She was {{discovered}} in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers. Without a name or any material, the girl group managed to land an audition with Rogers who commented, [...] "The minute Rihanna <b>walked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{it was like the}} other two girls didn't exist". Rihanna went to Rogers' hotel room, where she performed renditions of Destiny's Child's [...] "Emotion" [...] and Mariah Carey's [...] "Hero". Impressed, Rogers scheduled a second meeting with her mother present, and then invited her to his hometown in the United States to record some demo tapes which could be sent to record labels. She recorded the demo over the next year intermittently, due to only being able to record during school holidays. [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] and [...] "The Last Time" [...] were two tracks recorded for the demo tape, which were eventually included on her debut album Music of the Sun. That same year, Rihanna was signed to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's production company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions.|$|E
