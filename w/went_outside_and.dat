O'Brien claimed that he <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> told the group what had happened; around twenty people were present.|$|E
5|$|The Chili Peppers {{collaborated with}} {{producer}} Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Rubin {{felt that it}} was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion, and the band agreed. Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom <b>went</b> <b>outside,</b> <b>and</b> spent most of their time smoking marijuana. Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned of what was going on, but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E

Ford purchased a lot and on May 29, 1892 opened Ford's Exchange, said to have been a dance hall. Six days later, the entire business district, including Ford's Exchange, burned to the ground in a major fire. Ford opened a tent saloon until he could rebuild.|$|E
25|$|On Day 52 Jen, who {{was named}} as a {{replacement}} nominee for Amber, packed and scattered her belongings through the House, destroyed and bleached Dick's cigarettes. Dick, in retaliation, later threw Jen's clothing over the surrounding walls of the Big Brother house. Big Brother later informed Dick they would replace the cigarettes. Jen began to cook food while on a slop restriction Later that night, Jen <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> ate food while on slop. Big Brother told Jen she would receive a penalty nomination, she must be a nominee for the entire week and cannot win HoH or Veto for Week 8 if she survived Week 7. This was found unfair to Jameka, the other Week 7 nominee, and the penalty nomination was removed. Jen would instead receive a penalty eviction vote for Week 7 plus any votes cast against her by her fellow HouseGuests.|$|E
500|$|On August 27, 1964, Kemper's grandmother, Maude Matilda Hughey Kemper (1897–1964), {{was sitting}} at the kitchen table when she and Kemper had an argument. Enraged by the argument, Kemper stormed off and grabbed the [...]22 caliber rifle which his {{grandfather}} had given him for hunting. He then returned to the kitchen and, when Maude told him not to shoot any birds, fatally shot her in the head before firing twice more into her back. Some accounts allege that Maude Kemper additionally suffered multiple post-mortem stab wounds with a kitchen knife. He then dragged her body out of the kitchen and into her bedroom. When Kemper's grandfather, Edmund Emil Kemper (1892–1964), came home from grocery shopping, Kemper <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> fatally shot him in the driveway. He was unsure of what to do next and so phoned his mother, who urged him to contact the local police. Kemper then called the police and waited for them to take him into custody.|$|E

500|$|When Charlotte was eight, her father, whose {{affections}} {{had returned}} to Fitzherbert, decided that he wanted Carlton House to himself. [...] He took over his wife's apartments (Caroline received space in Kensington Palace instead), and moved their daughter into Montague House, adjacent to Carlton House. [...] As James Chambers, another Charlotte biographer, put it, the young Princess [...] "lived in a household of her own, {{in the company of}} no one who was not paid to be there". [...] The move took place without the presence of Charlotte's governess, Lady Elgin, with whom she was very close. [...] Lady Elgin had been forced to retire, ostensibly on account of age, but most likely because George was angry that Lady Elgin had taken Charlotte to see the King without George's permission. [...] George also dismissed the sub-governess, Miss Hayman, for being too friendly with Caroline—and the Princess of Wales promptly hired her. [...] Lady Elgin's replacement, Lady de Clifford, was fond of Charlotte, and too good natured to discipline the child, who had grown into an exuberant tomboy. [...] Lady de Clifford brought one of her grandsons, the Honourable George Keppel, three years younger than Charlotte, as a playmate for her. [...] Forty years later, Keppel, by then Earl of Albemarle, would remember Charlotte in his memoirs, the source of many of the anecdotes of Charlotte as a small girl. [...] In addition to tomboy tales of horses and fisticuffs, he remembered them seeing a crowd gathered outside the Keppel house at Earl's Court, who were hoping to see the young Princess. [...] The two children <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> joined the crowd, unrecognised.|$|E

Mayhem bassist Necrobutcher said that, after living {{together}} for a while, Dead and Euronymous [...] "got on each other's nerves a lot" [...] and [...] "weren't really friends at the end". Hellhammer recalls that Dead once went outside to sleep in the woods because Euronymous was playing synth music that Dead hated. Euronymous then <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> began shooting into the air with a shotgun. Varg Vikernes claims that Dead once stabbed Euronymous with a knife.|$|E

2500|$|The {{afternoon}} {{edition of}} the Tribune hit the streets shortly after 3 p.m., and soon news spread of a potential lynching. By 4pm, the local authorities were on alert. White people began congregating at and near the Tulsa County Courthouse. By sunset at 7:34pm, the several hundred whites assembled outside the courthouse appeared to have {{the makings of a}} lynch mob. [...] Willard M. McCullough, the newly elected sheriff of Tulsa County, was determined to avoid events such as the 1920 lynching of white murder suspect Roy Belton in Tulsa, which had occurred during the term of his predecessor. The sheriff took steps {{to ensure the safety of}} Rowland. McCullough organized his deputies into a defensive formation around Rowland, who was terrified. The sheriff positioned six of his men, armed with rifles and shotguns, on the roof of the courthouse. He disabled the building's elevator, and had his remaining men barricade themselves at the top of the stairs with orders to shoot any intruders on sight. The sheriff <b>went</b> <b>outside</b> <b>and</b> tried to talk the crowd into going home, but to no avail. According to an account by Scott Ellsworth, the sheriff was [...] "hooted down".|$|E
