40|$|Welding {{is widely}} used in {{industry}} for products made of joined sheet metal parts and beams. The virtual prototyping process of welds in standard CAD systems relies on functionalities to manually add <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> to the assembly models. <b>Weld</b> <b>beads</b> {{can be in the}} form of symbolic annotations or 3 D solid representations. The size of products in terms of number of parts and required <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> makes this process cumbersome and time consuming. This paper presents a method to analyze CAD models of product assemblies in order to automatically identify possible welds among the parts using geometric recognition rules. Adjacent faces are detected and Boolean operators on planar loops are used to identify bead paths. Beads are then split in homogeneous portions based on the topology of the connected parts. The geometrical analysis of the connected parts also allows a bead to be characterized in terms of thickness, type, length and accessibility. Finally, the user is provided with functionalities to edit manufacturing properties or exclude unwanted welds. The approach is applied at the design stage to rapidly come to the definition of the welds. If integrated with a CAD tool, this can be used as input for an efficient detailing phase. Moreover, the paper presents an application for the cost estimation of the designed welded product. <b>Weld</b> <b>beads</b> are given a realization time, and hence a cost, based on their geometric size and employed welding technology. Some examples from the industry are presented to show benefits in terms of time savings and accuracy of the cost estimation process. Copyright ?????? 2012 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. As {{a part of}} a {{study and}} {{analysis}} on the effects of process para-meters on <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume in sub-merged arc welding (SAW) of pipes, mathematical models were developed to relate the process parameters and the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters. Further, the optimization of <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> volume was carried out using the optimization module available in the MATLAB version 4. 2 b software package. The mathemati-cal models thus developed for optimiza-tion are also helpful in predicting the <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters and in set-ting process parameters at optimum val-ues to achieve the desirable <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality at a relatively low cost {{with a high degree of}} repeatability and increased production rate. Total volume of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead,</b> an important bead parameter, was optimized (minimized), keeping the di-mensions of the other important bead pa-rameters as constraints, to obtain sound and superior quality welded pipes. Sen-sitivity analysis was also carried out to predict the direct and few interaction ef-fects of important bead parameters on the total volume of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead,</b> and the results are presented in graphical form. The results of the sensitivity analy-sis are very useful in understanding the interdependence of various <b>weld</b> <b>bead</b> quality parameters in controlling the vol-ume of the <b>weld</b> <b>bead,</b> to improve <b>weld</b> quality, to increase productivity with the available welding facilities and to mini-mize the total welding cost...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of laser welding {{technology has been}} considered to shipbuilding structure. However, when this technology is applied to primer-coated steel, good quality <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> are not easily obtained. Because the primer-coated layer caused the spatter, humping bead and porosity which are {{main part of the}} welding defect attributed to the powerful vaporizing pressure of zinc. So we performed experiment with objectives of understanding spatter and porosity formation mechanism and producing sound <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> in 6 t primer coated steels by a CO 2 CW laser. The effects of welding parameters; defocused distance, welding speed, coated thickness and coated position; were investigated in the bead shape and penetration depth on bead and lap welding. Alternative idea was suggested to suspend the welding defect by giving a reasonable gap clearance for primer coated thickness. The zinc of primer has a boiling point that is lower than melting point of steel. Zinc vapor builds up at the interface between the two sheets and this tends to deteriorate the quality of the weld by ejecting weld material from lap position or leaving porosity. Significant effects of primer coated position were lap side rather than surface. Therefore introducing a small gap clearance in the lap position, the zinc vapor could escape through it and sound <b>weld</b> <b>beads</b> can be acquired. In conclusion, formation and suspension mechanism of the welding defects was suggested by controlling the factors...|$|E
