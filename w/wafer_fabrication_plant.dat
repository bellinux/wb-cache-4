Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest [...] contract chipmakers in the world, while MediaTek is the fourth-largest fabless supplier globally.

Key elements considered are actual process routes, process and throughput modelling as a function of equipment behavior, lot size, and available processing modules, process dedication at equipment level, equipment downs at mainframe level, estimated lot release strategy, send ahead wafers, dispatch rules, and setup. Typical application areas are proactive dedication management, preventive maintenance scheduling and WIP based sampling optimization. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{regardless}} of whether the world economy was in recession or prosperity, the semiconductor business has continued to propel not only the electronics industry but many other industries as well. However, semiconductor manufacturing is among the most complicated and capital-intensive manufacturing processes in the world. Effectively operating <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> is the greatest challenge and an important task. In this study, a framework to develop learning-based scheduling systems is proposed. The key components of the framework include a learning-biases selection procedure, and a three-level scheduling mechanism. Through the case studies conducted, the proposed bias selection procedure has demonstrated its capability to select appropriate learning biases. In addition, the learning-based scheduling system derived from the framework proposed shows promising results in increasing system throughput and reducing the time required to process semiconductor wafers. ...|$|R
40|$|Fluctuations of {{work-in-progress}} (WIP) levels cause {{variability of}} cycle time and {{often lead to}} productivity losses in semiconductor <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants.</b> To identify sources of such variability, we are developing a root cause analysis tool with history logs of operational events, such as high WIP or equipment downtime, as inputs to automatically find the chains of events that create the variability. In the root cause analysis, {{one of the key}} steps is to aggregate the observed events into groups that are likely in cause-effect relationships. For operational events that involve time lags in cause-effect relationships, grouping the events requires identification of the time windows of causality based on discrete event simulations. This paper describes a design and implementation of a simulator for this purpose. The simulator does not assume any statistical or mathematical model, and thus is simple to maintain. ...|$|R

Generalized stochastic Petri nets (GSPNs) for the modelling of exponentially distributed processes and of timeless processes enable the most comprehensive analytical investigations.

These GSPNs are especially suited for the modelling at limited puffer capacity allowing the analysis of problems with several knots and the treatment {{of different types of}} blocking. Bottlenecks in the computer capacity are solved by distributed Petri net simulators. The enlarged Petri net is realized by the tool PETSJ, while with PETNET a prototype of the distributed simulation concept is presented.

40|$|<b>Wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> (FABs), are {{typically}} arranged in two dimensional (2 D) layouts {{on a single}} floor. These layouts imply various constraints on the work-in-process (WIP) and the material handling systems. In contrast, automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS) are arranged in 3 D aisles, where each aisle is served by a robotic arm that moves {{back and forth between}} the aisle’s entrance point and its storage locations. This paper offers an AS/RS-based 3 D layout for FABs. First, a general 3 D layout design problem is formulated and a heuristic algorithm is developed to solve it. Then, the proposed layout is evaluated with respect to its 2 D counterpart, and the scenarios in which the former may outperform the latter, more conventional, layout are specified. Finally, the performance of the proposed 3 D layout is compared to a corresponding 2 D layout through a simulation which is based on actual data taken from the semiconductor industry...|$|R
40|$|Photolithography {{is often}} the {{constraining}} equipment in semiconductor <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> due {{to the number of}} times the product must process through it. Modern day photolithography is performed on a cluster tool that is a combination of a stepper and track. It is obvious that the combined availability of the cluster tool is critical to throughput, but what is not so obvious is the throughput restriction from a secondary constraint known as a reticle. Every layer of a product needs a unique reticle for processing. Setup issues arising from the requirement of reticles affects productivity of photolithography and the entire <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> line if photolithography is the bottleneck. Efficient management of reticles (with regard to setup and storage on a stepper) based on current system status provides a strategic and tactical advantage. In this paper, a SLAM discrete event simulation model is to mimic the setup and storage of reticles. This enables the collection of information that can used to identify potential gains in tactical reticle management. The simulation model will be explained in detail along with output results for the tactical issues. The relationship between the simulation and the network flow model for proactive reticle management will also be discussed. ...|$|R

Examples belonging to different categories are then learned with the same FBPN but with different parameter values. Production simulation is also applied in this study to generate test examples. According to experimental results, the prediction accuracy of the proposed methodology was significantly better than those of two existing approaches, FBPN without example classification, and evolving fuzzy rules (EFR), in most cases by achieving a 15 %~ 45 % (and an average of 31 %) reduction in the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} China still plays second fiddle in {{all sectors of}} the semiconductor industry. The global semiconductor industry critically depends on China’s market. Yet, the main drivers of China’s semiconductor consumption are foreign companies that conduct final assembly in China of electronic equipment that is sold in the US, the EU, Japan, or India. China’s semiconductor production has experienced significant growth, {{but it is not}} yet a major force in the global semiconductor industry. While recent capacity expansion means that China has newer <b>wafer</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> than its competitors, these plants use older technology (in terms of geometry and wafer size) or are second-hand plants. China’s IC design industry keeps growing rapidly, but its technological capabilities are still limited, in terms of process technology and design line-width. As for innovation, China remains a technology taker, following the established technology road map at some distance. China {{still has a long way}} to go before it can shape or at least co-shape the industry’s technology trajectory. In sum, China’s position in the Global Semiconductor Value Chain remains way behind the government’s aspirations. The global semiconductor value chain is dominated by the US, and to a lesser degree by Japan and the EU, Korea as well as Taiwan. China remains a lower-tier player, and it has a long way to go to catch up with the global leaders. Longer-term, however, there is no doubt that China’s government is committed to accelerate the development of China’s semiconductor industry. During the 12 th Five-Year Plan, the focus of policy will shift away from the pursuit of capacity and output value growth toward improving R&D capabilities and competitiveness of Chinese firms. ...|$|R
