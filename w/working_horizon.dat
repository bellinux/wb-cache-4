40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} gain {{insights}} {{on the relationship}} between growth and employment when considering heterogeneous agents in terms of their <b>working</b> <b>horizon.</b> Using an OECD database, our empirical estimations suggest that growth positively influences the employment rate of workers having a long <b>working</b> <b>horizon</b> (young workers) while negatively influences the employment rate of workers having a short <b>working</b> <b>horizon</b> (senior workers). We then provide theoretical foundations to this result by means of an endogenous job destruction framework a laMortensen and Pissarides (1998) where we introduce life cycle features. We show that, under the assumption of homogeneous productivity among workers, growth negatively affects the employment rate of workers having a short <b>working</b> <b>horizon</b> before retirement (senior workers) while it positively affects the employment rate of workers having a long <b>working</b> <b>horizon</b> (young workers). Numerical simulations confirm these results, however a non standard calibration is required to reproduce the elasticity values obtained in our empirical estimations...|$|E
30|$|Using US data, Friedberg (2003) {{argues that}} age {{is not enough}} to explain why older workers use {{computers}} less. Impending retirement, which reduces the time horizon to recoup an investment in new skills, appears to play a major role. The importance of the <b>working</b> <b>horizon</b> on the retirement choices made by workers is also underlined by Hairault et al. (2010). They estimate that the shorter the distance to retirement (whatever the age of the worker), the lower the probability of being employed. This distance effect becomes active from ten years before retirement.|$|E

However, these figures {{may be subject to}} some selection bias. Indeed, we have already shown in Figure 1 that after 55, the probability to remain employed falls dramatically.|$|E

Using the exogenous variation in minimum retirement age induced by a sequence of Italian pension reforms during the 1990 s and 2000 s, we show that Italian males aged 40 to 49 reacted to the longer time to retirement by raising regular exercise and by reducing smoking and regular alcohol consumption.

The role of subsidence development with respect to different geological conditions is considered. Similarly, parameters which control the potential yield of an aquifer, as well as the techniques available for assessing them, are also discussed, with particular reference to Coal Measures strata. A reappraisal of existing test site data, collected by Nottingham University Mining Department is undertaken and concludes that permeability changes can be linked to subsidence profile development. Permeability monitoring techniques can be used for strata control investigations and reference is made to monitoring the caving characteristics of a massive sandstone roof. Similarly, problems connected with thick sandstone horizons and potential weight bump conditions are also examined. The effects of subsidence profile formation on the undersea coalfield workings of North-East England are examined with respect to the NCB 1968 guidelines for working under the sea.

30|$|We are not {{the first}} to analyze the {{retirement}} decision from the supply side. Using US data, Bartel and Sichermann (1993) show that workers in industries with higher average rates of technological change retire later than workers in industries with lower rates of technological progress, since they prefer to smooth the human capital investment they made. On the other hand, an unexpected increase in the rate of technological change induces earlier retirement, since workers do not have the required skills, and due to their short <b>working</b> <b>horizon,</b> they are not motivated to invest in human capital formation. Ahituv and Zeira (2011) suggest another interpretation. They consider that technical progress is made up of an aggregate part, which affects all sectors and a specific part that hits only one sector. They show that the specific part of technical progress has a positive and significant effect on the probability of not working among older workers. This effect may correspond to the standard skill obsolescence effect. In contrast, aggregate technical progress implies an increase in wages, encouraging therefore older workers to delay their retirement age.|$|E

The result is not just the mechanical consequence of delayed exit from parental home, of more investment in education or of more attachment to the labour market. In light of the Italian lowest low fertility we conclude that pension reforms may have had unintended inter-generational effects.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of wages varies with workers’age. In {{this article we}} build a model able to explain this evolution by taking into account two channels: {{the evolution of the}} wage game described in Burdett and Mortensen (1998), and the evolution of the workers’productivity within a match. The model considers three age groups, the juniors, the adults and the seniors. Using US data, we show that these two channels allow to reproduce quite well the aggregated wage distribution as well as the evolution of it over the workers life-cycle. The channel of the evolution of the wage game accounts for the lower density of low wages in the seniors’wage distribution. Yet firms are naturally induced to create lower quality jobs to seniors because of their short <b>working</b> <b>horizon.</b> In order to fit the data, we show {{that it is necessary to}} assume learning by doing of workers. The first aspect of learning by doing is to increase the workers’specific productivity, the second is to improve the adaptation to a new jobs of older workers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether the limitations, imposed by Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, encourage optimal asset allocation and reduce investment risk for retirement savings when contrasted to discretionary investment. A quantitative risk and return analysis was performed using available data for Regulation 28 compliant funds and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange indices. The analysis considers two hypothetical investors who are identical in all regards other than their choice of investments. The model used a 40 year <b>working</b> and saving <b>horizon,</b> whereby the investors contribute a portion of their income to a retirement savings vehicle of their choice. The savings in these vehicles accumulate and earn real returns until retirement. The analysis uses a life-cycle model (Modigliani & Brumberg, 1954) which accumulates capital to the retirement date and retirement withdrawals that result in zero capital at the date of death, which is assumed to be 20 years postretirement. The model is used to analyse the differential return required in order to make investors indifferent between investing in a regulated product which is incentivised through tax credits. The findings indicate that Regulation 28 is effective in reducing the investment risk of retirement savings, however may also force the investor to sacrifice wealth. Discretionary investment may be preferential to an investor depending on the tax bracket the investor is in. Further, the complex calculations required to smooth consumption over the life cycle may contain too many variables for the ordinary individual to compute. This study is limited by assumptions regarding changes in future tax legislation, the time frame of investment returns for discretionary investment and retirement funds, inflation, investor career length and life expectancy...|$|R
40|$|The foreign {{exchange}} (FX) market is worldwide, but the dealers {{differ in their}} geographical locations (time zones), <b>working</b> hours, time <b>horizons,</b> home currencies, access to information,transaction costs, and other institutional constraints. The variety of time horizones is large: from intra-day dealers, who close their positions every evening, to long-term investors and central banks. Depending on the constraints, the different market participats need different strategies to reach their goal, which is usually maximizing the profit, or rather a utility function including risk. Different intra-day trading strategies can be studied only if high-density data are available. Oslen & Associates (O & A) has collected and analysed large amounts of FX quotes by market makers around the clock (up to 5000 non-equally spaced prices per day for the German mark against US$). Based on these data, a set of real-time intra-day trading models has been developed. These models give explicit trading recommendations under realistic constraints. They are allowed to trade only during the opening hours of a market, depending on the time zone and local holidays. The models have been running real-time {{for more than three}} years, thus leading to an ex ante test. The test results, obtained with a risk-sensitive performance measure, are presented. All these trading models are profitable, but they differ in their risk behaviour and dealing frequency. If a certain profitable intra-day algorithm is tested with different working hours, its success can considerably change. A systematic study shows that the best choice of working hours is usually when the most important markets for the particular FX rate are active. All the results demonstrate that the assumption of a homogeneous 24 -hour FX market with identical dealers, following an identical 'rational expectation', is far from reality. To explain the market dynamics, a heterogeneous model of the market with different types of dealers is more appropriate. {{foreign exchange}} market, trading model, heterogeneous expectations,...|$|R
