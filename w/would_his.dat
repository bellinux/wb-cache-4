25|$|Barbour {{served as}} deputy sheriff of Orange County, {{beginning}} in 1792. In 1794, he {{was admitted to}} the Virginia Bar. With wedding gifts from his father, as well as by building his own legal practice and running his plantation, Barbour was able to build up personal wealth. His friend and somewhat neighbor at Monticello plantation, former President Thomas Jefferson, helped design the mansion in which Barbour lived most of his adult life, called Barboursville. By 1798, Barbour owned several slaves and would expand that plantation over the years, as <b>would</b> <b>his</b> somewhat neighbor on the other side, President James Madison at Montpelier plantation.|$|E
25|$|Gaelic Irish {{society was}} also patrilineal, with land being {{primarily}} owned {{by men and}} inherited by the sons. Only when a man had no sons <b>would</b> <b>his</b> land pass to his daughters, and then only for their lifetimes. Upon their deaths, the land was redistributed among their father's male relations. Under Brehon law, rather than inheriting land, daughters had assigned to them {{a certain number of}} their father's cattle as their marriage-portion. It seems that, throughout the Middle Ages, the Gaelic Irish kept many of their marriage laws and traditions separate from those of the Church. Under Gaelic law, married women could hold property independent of their husbands, a link was maintained between married women and their own families, couples could easily divorce or separate, and men could have concubines (which could be lawfully bought). These laws differed from most of contemporary Europe and from Church law.|$|E

25|$|One day, while Bennett was {{crossing}} the Miramichi River on the ferry boat, a well-dressed lad about nine years younger {{came over to}} him and struck up a conversation. This was the beginning of an improbable but important friendship with Max Aitken, later the industrialist and British press baron, Lord Beaverbrook. The agnostic Aitken liked to tease the Methodist Bennett, whose fiery temper contrasted with Aitken's ability to turn away wrath with a joke. This friendship would become important to his success later in life, as <b>would</b> <b>his</b> friendship with the Chatham lawyer, Lemuel J. Tweedie, a prominent Conservative politician. He began to study law with Tweedie on weekends and during summer holidays. Another important friendship was with the prominent Shirreff family of Chatham, the father being High Sheriff of Northumberland County for 25 years. The son, Harry, joined the E. B. Eddy Company, a large pulp and paper industrial concern, and was transferred to Halifax. His sister moved there to study nursing, and soon Bennett joined them to study law at Dalhousie University. Their friendship was renewed there, and became crucial to his later life when Jennie Shirreff married the head of the Eddy Company. She later made Bennett the lawyer for her extensive interests.|$|E
500|$|Asch {{told his}} colleagues that his studies of {{conformity}} were informed by his childhood experiences in Poland. He recalled being {{seven years old}} and staying up for his first Passover night. He recalls seeing his grandmother pour an extra glass of wine. When he asked who the glass of wine was for, she {{said that it was}} for the prophet Elijah. He then asked her whether Elijah would really take a sip from the glass and his uncle assured him that he <b>would.</b> <b>His</b> uncle told him to watch very closely when the time came. [...] "Filled with a sense of suggestion and expectation" [...] Asch [...] "thought he saw the level of wine in the cup drop just a bit". Thus, early in life, Asch succumbed to social pressure, an experience which led him to investigate conformity later in life.|$|E
500|$|In November 1539, Philip asked Bucer {{to produce}} a {{theological}} defence of bigamy, since {{he had decided to}} contract a bigamous marriage. Bucer reluctantly agreed, on condition the marriage be kept secret. Bucer consulted Luther and Melanchthon, and the three reformers presented Philip with a statement of advice (Wittenberger Ratschlag); later, Bucer produced his own arguments for and against bigamy. Although the document specified that bigamy could be sanctioned only under rare conditions, Philip took it as approval for his marriage to a lady-in-waiting of his sister. When rumours of the marriage spread, Luther told Philip to deny it, while Bucer advised him to hide his second wife and conceal the truth. Some scholars have noted a possible motivation for this notorious advice: the theologians believed they had advised Philip as a pastor <b>would</b> <b>his</b> parishioner, and that a lie was justified to guard the privacy of their confessional counsel. [...] The scandal that followed the marriage caused Philip to lose political influence, and the Reformation within the Empire was severely compromised.|$|E

The word of God replied that Eliezer would not be his heir, Abram's own son would. God took Abram outside and bade him to count the stars, for so numerous <b>would</b> <b>his</b> offspring be, and because Abram put his trust in God, God reckoned it to his merit.

2500|$|The {{character}} of Eleuterio Quiñones {{dates from the}} mid-1980s, when {{it was part of}} the lineup for [...] "Rompiendo el día" [...] a morning radio show Logroño used to host with fellow actor and member of the Puerto Rican political satire collective Los Rayos Gamma, Silverio Pérez. The radio station's studios were in Guaynabo, and whenever Logroño entered the building he would see the landscape attendant, an old man, struggling to pull weeds out. Logroño would discuss with Pérez how he would imagine the attendant's voice, what <b>would</b> <b>his</b> political persuasion be, and so on. Based on him, Logroño developed the character for his morning show. The show did not survive, but the character was well received by the show's audience.|$|E

2500|$|Maudgalyāyana {{was able}} to use his powers of mind-reading in order to give good and fitting advice to his students, so they could attain results quickly. He is {{described}} as using his psychic powers to discipline not only monks, but also devas and other beings. Once some monks were making noise as they were sitting in the same building as the Buddha. Maudgalyāyana then shook the building, to teach the monks to be more restrained. But the most-quoted example of Maudgalyāyana's demonstration of psychic powers is his victory over the dragon (naga) Nandopananda, which required mastery of the jhānas (states in meditation). Many of his demonstrations of psychic powers were an indirect means of establishing the Buddha as a great teacher. People would ask themselves, if the disciple had these powers, then how spiritually powerful <b>would</b> <b>his</b> teacher be? ...|$|E
2500|$|Bowers {{became a}} vest-pocket dealer in 1953, {{when he was}} not quite 15 years of age. He had begun {{collecting}} coins just a few months earlier, and he found he had an aptitude for buying and selling them advantageously. Bowers would start running advertisements in the classified section of the local paper seeking coins. [...] As his growing dealership prospered, so <b>would</b> <b>his</b> capital. He would buy coins locally from the public and from other collectors and then sell them at the coin club and to collectors he met there. In the early years, becoming a dealer had its challenges as there were no guides to use as a reference. One of the risks included the authenticity of a coin, while another point of tension was condition. As there were no published standards, what one person called Gem Uncirculated could be what another might call About Uncirculated.|$|E

He defined this in relation to social alienation and antisemitic prejudice, referring to himself in the third person: Throughout his life [...] was chased around [...] by a gang of vigilantes in cahoots with executioners, who sought to end his life.

2500|$|How can we {{find out}} of the single {{individual}} is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, [...] "Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he knew that if he was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. [...] If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, <b>would</b> <b>his</b> also being saved be able to disturb my salvation? ...|$|E
2500|$|Eckford {{extended}} extensive {{credit to}} the United States Government during the war, going bankrupt in the process because of difficulty the government had in paying him, although he never doubted that it eventually <b>would.</b> <b>His</b> efforts, {{along with those of}} Adam and Noah Brown, were key to American success on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Chauncey wrote in praise of Eckford to Secretary of the Navy William Jones on 8 October 1813, saying, [...] "...yet as Mr. Eckford has built 4 vessels at this place, and has become acquainted with the resources and people of this part of the country, I think that he could have built sooner and perhaps cheaper than perhaps any other man, and as to his talents as a ship carpenter, I am bold {{to say that there is}} not his equal in the United States, or perhaps the world. His exertions are unexampled...," [...] and in a letter of 15 January 1814, Jones replied, [...] "The talents and zeal of Mr. Eckford the builder, is a source of great satisfaction and confidence, which assures me that though the enemy has made great progress in the building of his two largest vessels, he will be over taken and surpassed in this branch of service by the superior energy and judgment of Mr. Eckford." [...] In the words of maritime historian Howard I. Chapelle, [...] "It was Eckford's extraordinary ability to design, lay down, and build ships, ranging in size from a very small schooner to the largest frigates, working in a wilderness and in severe winter weather with sick or dissatisfied labor, and to do all this in extremely short periods of time, that maintained American superiority on Lake Ontario." [...] Chapelle continues, [...] "From a naval shipbuilding point of view, the outstanding men of the War of 1812 were Eckford and the Browns, Adam and Noah. Through the efforts of these three, the [...] Navy held control of the lakes and prevented the British from invading the North and Northwest ... No officer or constructor of the Navy accomplished more. There were no competitors to the Browns and Eckford among the navy yards, or in the contract shipyards along the coasts, [...] on the lakes... building was made infinitely more difficult than on the coast because of climate and geographical conditions, to say nothing of scarcities of labor and some materials." [...] One advantage Eckford and the Browns may have had was a lack of attention by US government officials to their activities; Federal officials focused their efforts on the coasts, where they greatly interfered with shipbuilding decisions and progress during the war.|$|E
