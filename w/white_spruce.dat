5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (<b>White</b> <b>Spruce,</b> Black Spruce), Balsam Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, Balsam Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, <b>white</b> <b>spruce,</b> and balsam fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of grey jays live {{where there is a}} strong presence of black spruce (Picea mariana), <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> (P. glauca), Engelmann spruce (P. engelmanni), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), or lodgepole pine (P. contorta). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate Sierra Nevada of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis). The key habitat requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and tree bark with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the antibacterial properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies P. c. obscurus. It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius alnicola is an ectomycorrhizal species, and {{engages in}} a mutualistic {{association}} with certain plant species. In this association, the hyphae of the fungus permeate {{large volumes of}} soil and obtain scarce elements, especially phosphorus—which is often limiting for plant growth—which they pass on to the plant in exchange for metabolic products of the plant's photosynthesis. The ectomycorrhizae that the fungus forms in association with Picea engelmannii {{have been shown to}} contain lactifers (latex-producing cells) and pigments similar to the fruit body. Fruit bodies of the fungus grow in groups on the ground under alders and conifers, usually appearing between July and October. It is a fairly common species in the western United States and Baja California. Additional collection locations in Mexico include Veracruz, Villarreal, and Tapia. A population in central and southern California is known to associate with oak trees. In the Rocky Mountains it is associated with the subalpine tree species Englemann Spruce (Picea engelmannii), while at lower elevations it is commonly found with <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> (Picea glauca). It is also known to associate with Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (genus Pseudotsuga). The mushroom has also been collected from Bageshwar, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>spruce</b> {{grows in}} soils with pH values of 4.7—7.0, {{although}} they {{have been found in}} soils as acidic as 4.0 in subalpine fir forests in the Northwest Territories. A presence of calcium in the soil is common to <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> found in northern New York. <b>White</b> <b>spruce</b> most commonly grows in the soil orders of Alfisols and Inceptisols. Soil properties such as fertility, temperature, and structural stability are partial determinants of the ability of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> to grow in the extreme northern latitudes. In the northern limits of its range, <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is the climax species along with black spruce; birch and aspen are the early succession species.|$|E

50|$|A {{quaking bog}} or schwingmoor {{is a form}} of bog {{occurring}} in wetter parts of valley bogs and raised bogs, and sometimes around the edges of acidic lakes. The bog vegetation, mostly sphagnum moss anchored by sedges (such as Carex lasiocarpa), forms a floating mat approximately half a metre thick, {{on the surface of the}} water or on top of very wet peat. <b>White</b> <b>spruces</b> are also common in this bog regime. Walking on the surface causes it to move - larger movements may cause visible ripples on the surface, or they may even make trees sway. In the absence of disturbance from waves, the bog mat may eventually cover entire bays, or even entire small lakes.|$|R

25|$|<b>White</b> <b>spruce</b> {{becomes less}} {{accommodating}} of soil with increasing severity of climate. The distribution of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> in Labrador seems to depend {{almost entirely on}} the character of the soil (Sargent 1898), and between the southwestern shores of Hudson Bay and the northeastern regions of Saskatchewan, <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is confined to very local physiographic features, characterized by well-drained or fertile soils (Ritchie 1956).|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>spruce</b> {{can live}} {{for several hundred}} years. Ages of 200 to 300 years are {{commonly}} attained {{throughout much of the}} range, and Dallimore and Jackson (1961) estimated the normal lifespan of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> at 250 to 300 years.|$|E
25|$|<b>White</b> <b>spruce</b> {{is subject}} to severe damage from spring frosts. Newly flushed shoots of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> are very {{sensitive}} to spring frost (Smith 1949, Rowe 1955, McLeod 1964).

50|$|The {{majority}} of its territory is covered by old-growth forests {{with a wide variety}} of species both deciduous and coniferous, such as birch, poplar, sugar maple, beech, <b>white</b> pine, fir, <b>spruce,</b> hemlock, and cedar.|$|R
50|$|Researchers have {{identified}} 273 acre of old-growth {{sites in the}} forest. Species represented include eastern hemlock, <b>white</b> pine, red <b>spruce,</b> and hardwoods such as yellow birch, sweet birch, American beech, American basswood, and white ash.|$|R
25|$|On dry upland sites, {{especially}} south-facing slopes, {{the mature}} vegetation is <b>white</b> <b>spruce,</b> white birch, trembling aspen, {{or a combination}} of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after fire before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> will invade with the hardwoods or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> stands without an intervening hardwood stage.|$|E
25|$|The {{root system}} of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is highly {{variable}} and adaptable (Wagg 1964, 1967), {{responding to a}} variety of edaphic factors, especially soil moisture, soil fertility, and mechanical impedance. On soils that limit rooting depth, the root system is plate-like, but it is a common misconception to assume that <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is genetically constrained to develop plate-like root systems irrespective of soil conditions (Sutton 1969). In the nursery, or naturally in the forest, <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> usually develops several long “running” roots just below the ground surface (Mullin 1957).|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} {{limit of}} distribution of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is more complex. From {{east of the}} main range of coastal mountains in British Columbia, the southern continuous limit of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> is the forest/prairie interface through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine (Fowells 1965). Sargent (1922) and Harlow and Harrar (1950) also included Vermont and New Hampshire; and, while Dame and Brooks (1901) excluded New York and states further west, they included Massachusetts {{as far south as}} Amherst and Northampton, “probably the southern limit of the species” in that area. Nisbet (1905) gave the range of <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> as extending to “Carolina”, but he did not recognize red spruce as a species and presumably included it with <b>white</b> <b>spruce.</b>|$|E
50|$|Chrysomyxa ledi de Bary is a fungus. It {{occurs in}} Eurasia {{throughout}} {{the range of}} its broad-leaved hosts. The aecial stage is found on native and exotic spruces in Europe, including <b>white</b> and Engelmann <b>spruces</b> (Crane 2001).|$|R

50|$|The lakes are {{surrounded}} by forests made up primarily of jack pine interspersed with balsam fir, red and white pine, and <b>white</b> and black <b>spruce.</b> Stands of deciduous trees such as trembling aspen and white birch may {{also be found in}} the park.|$|R
25|$|On dry, deep, outwash {{deposits}} in northern Ontario, both <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> and aspen grow slowly (MacLean 1960). But, broadly, <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> {{is able to}} tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968). Soil fertility holds the key not just to <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> growth but to {{the distribution of the}} species. At least moderate fertility is needed for good growth, but <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, red spruce, Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960). Minimum soil-fertility standards recommended for <b>white</b> <b>spruce</b> sufficient to produce 126 to 157nbsp&m3/ha of wood at 40 years are much higher than for pine species commonly planted in the Lake States (Wilde 1966): 3.5% organic matter, 12.0 meq/100 g exchange capacity, 0.12% total N, 44.8nbsp&kg/ha available P, 145.7nbsp&kg/ha available K, 3.00 meq/100 g exchangeable Ca, and 0.70 meq/100 g exchangeable Mg.|$|E
