6000|$|Harris nodded. [...] "The {{strange thing}} is--they really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> there. They're {{completely}} rational; {{they could do}} something else, but they just don't care to." ...|$|E
60|$|I did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> but, as I said before, I {{felt that}} I must be politic, and so {{took a seat}} {{on the other end of}} the sofa.|$|E
60|$|EILEEN (dully--without {{opening her}} eyes). There's no pain. (There is another pause--then she murmurs indifferently.) There are {{chairs in the}} room you can bring out if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Or a doctor, driven <b>to</b> death, <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{and think}} out a case. Or a barrister--or a man cramming for an examination." ...|$|R
60|$|For he was <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> beside Istra Nash, just be near her; {{he had to}} be! So he ventured {{over and}} was {{instantly}} regarding all the rest as outsiders whom his wise comrade and himself were studying.|$|R
6000|$|When {{he got in}} he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> at once in {{the little}} creaky chair by the fire, but Ethel came flitting from the newly bought {{typewriter}} with arms extended and prevented him. [...] "Oh!--it has been dull," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'd {{show the}} gentlemen {{something}} of a sight more interesting that this," [...] the newcomer continued. [...] "They don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and drink with the scum of the earth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might just}} as well have done that before you opened the thing," [...] he remarked. [...] "Anyway, if you merely <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> it would have been quite as {{comfortable}} in the shanty." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{had it on}} {{his tongue}} to say, [...] "Well, not unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on some enemy," [...] {{but he did not}} venture this: when it comes to daring of that sort, the boldest man is {{commonly}} a little behind a timid woman.|$|E
60|$|The president, facing them, looked strained. It {{occurred}} to Carl that S. Alcott Wood had {{his side of}} the question. He argued about the matter, feeling detached from his stolidly defiant body. Then he cursed the president for keeping them there. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cry out....|$|R
5|$|I really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with Wale before I {{wrote the}} hook, because to me, it's really lame when people send you tracks, and they're like, 'All right, Gaga, throw your vocals on it.' This is Wale's record. It's not my record. It's {{one of those}} songs, one of those tracks {{and one of those}} videos that you can't stop {{listening}} to.|$|R
50|$|Acting {{upon the}} request of the Apostolic Delegate, Bishop Ferrero {{requested}} the fathers to return to the seminary. This they did in February 1902. Their first task was to condition the seminary for the opening of classes, for they had found it in disarray. As Fr. Mariano Napal said, if they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> they had <b>to</b> do it on the staircases.|$|R
60|$|I don't want {{to bother}} about {{describing}} to you his appearance; but, {{if you are a}} man reader, I will say that Stickncy looked precisely like the young chap that you always find sitting in your chair smoking a cigarette after you have missed a shot while playing pool--not billiards but pool--when you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't {{think it}} {{necessary}} to talk nonsense {{to me all the}} time," [...] she begged. [...] "Come! I am tired--I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> Don't you want to take my chair down {{by the side of the}} boat there? I like to watch the lights on the water, and you may talk to me--if you like." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> just in this way. I {{have been}} talking with so much levity that I have said no serious thing, and you are really no better or wiser, {{although}} Robert Buchanan has suggested that I am a person who deals in wisdom. I have said nothing which would make you better than when you came here.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{found out}} this, I turned so faint that I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and cover up my head. The Water-devil had us, {{there was no}} mistake about it, and no use {{trying to think of}} {{anything}} else. I staggered along the deck, went below, and cooked myself a meal. In a case like this there's nothing like a square meal to keep a man up.|$|R
50|$|Now imagine {{someone else}} {{comes along and}} <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> The empty row has a poor view; so he does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> there. Instead, {{a person in the}} crowded row moves into the empty seat the first person left behind. The empty seat moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the empty seat moves towards the edge of the row. Once the empty seat reaches the edge, the new person can <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Staffers also {{reported}} that Eastwood's use of the chair was a last-minute decision by the actor himself. [...] Eastwood confirmed this in a September 4 interview with The Carmel Pine Cone: [...] "There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea." [...] Eastwood further elaborated that he purposely avoided preparing for the speech {{to make it appear}} unpolished and more appealing to the average citizen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you boys}} are to take right hold an' help {{the best you}} know how," [...] the {{proprietor}} of the museum said as he pulled off his coat and vest preparatory to making ready for the feast. [...] "If them as comes <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> it must be on the ground, owing {{to the lack of}} chairs, therefore it don't make much difference if the table is a trifle high." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more England for mine," [...] the American snapped, good-humoredly. [...] "I'm {{going to}} get out of this foggy hole and get back to God's country just as soon as I can. I want to find out what's doing at the store, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to a plate of flapjacks. I'm good and plenty sick of tea and marmalade. Why, I wouldn't take this fool country for a gift. No, sir! Me for God's country--Sleepy Eye, Brown County, Minnesota. You bet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Canadian nodded. [...] "That's what he meant," [...] he said. [...] "There are {{two kinds}} of folks you {{and the rest of them}} are dumping into Canada. One's the kind that will get up and hustle, break land, and build new homes--log at first, frame and stone afterwards. They go on from a quarter-section and a team of oxen to the biggest farm they can handle, and every fresh furrow they cut enriches all of us. The other kind <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in the dirt and take life easily, as they've always done. The dirt worries {{everybody}} else, and we've no use for them. By and by our Legislature will have to wake up and stop them from getting in." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{shook hands}} with Cynthia, too, but it was across the barrier which had not been lowered between them since they parted. He spoke to Jackson about her, {{the day after he}} came home, when Jackson said he was feeling unusually strong and well, and the two {{brothers}} had strolled out through the orchard together. Now and then he gave the sick man his arm, and when he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in a sunny place he spread the shawl he carried for him.|$|R
60|$|But {{the bearded}} bloke had shot his bolt. He stood there, licked at last; and, {{watching}} him closely, I {{could see that}} he was now at the crossroads. I could spot what he was thinking as clearly as if he had confided it to my personal ear. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and call it a day, I mean, but the thought that gave him pause was that, if he did, he must then either uncork Gussie or take the Fink-Nottle speech as read and get straight on to the actual prize-giving.|$|R
50|$|Sam's Army {{is known}} for wearing red to matches. The group's chants are {{commonly}} bilingual in English and Spanish due {{to the number of}} soccer fans coming from the Hispanic community. They usually stand in seatings behind one of the goals, due to complaints from early games that they blocked people who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and watch the game. Sam's Army fans often utilize drummers in their chants, and there are chant leaders who lead the group {{for the duration of the}} game. They normally stand with other United States national team supporters' groups, including the American Outlaws.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, lad! Now, if {{you feel}} at all tired or shaky, all {{you have got to}} do is to hook this on to one of the steps. Do you see? One hook {{on each side of the}} cord. That way you can rest as long as you like, and then go on again. You say you can go down a rope with your hands only. I should advise you to do that, if you can, and not to use your legs unless you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on one of the long steps; for, as you know, if you use your feet the rope will go in till they are almost level with your head; while, if you use your arms only, it will hang {{straight}} down." ...|$|E
60|$|In America {{we have no}} annual supreme day; no day whose {{approach}} {{makes the}} whole nation glad. We have the Fourth of July, and Christmas, and Thanksgiving. Neither of them can claim the primacy; neither of them can arouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal. Eight grown Americans out of ten dread {{the coming of the}} Fourth, with its pandemonium and its perils, and they rejoice when it is gone--if still alive. The approach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellent people. They have to buy a cart-load of presents, and they never know what to buy to hit the various tastes; they put in three weeks of hard and anxious work, and when Christmas morning comes they are so dissatisfied with the result, and so disappointed that they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and cry. Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once a year. The observance of Thanksgiving Day--as a function--has become general of late years. The Thankfulness is not so general. This is natural. Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard time during the year, and this has a calming effect upon their enthusiasm.|$|E
60|$|However {{at first}} there were, he admitted, no {{untoward}} complications, no embarrassing consequences. To a telegram in guarded terms dispatched to de Barral no answer was received {{for more than}} twenty-four hours. This certainly caused the Fynes some anxiety. When the answer arrived late {{on the evening of}} next day it was in the shape of an elderly man. An unexpected sort of man. Fyne explained to me with precision that he evidently belonged to what is most respectable in the lower middle classes. He was calm and slow in his speech. He was wearing a frock-coat, had grey whiskers meeting under his chin, and declared on entering that Mr de Barral was his cousin. He hastened to add that he had not seen his cousin for many years, while he looked upon Fyne (who received him alone) with so much distrust that Fyne felt hurt (the person actually refusing at first the chair offered to him) and retorted tartly that he, for his part, had never seen Mr de Barral, in his life, and that, since the visitor did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down,</b> he, Fyne, begged him to state his business as shortly as possible. The man in black sat down then with a faint superior smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "And that is Francesco--Frank--" [...] Francesco gave a faint curl of his lip, half smile, as he saluted her involuntarily in a {{military}} fashion. He was dark, rather tall and loose, with yellow-tawny eyes. He was an Italian from the south. Madame gave another look at him. [...] "He doesn't like his English name of Frank. You will see, he pulls a face. No, he doesn't like it. We call him Ciccio also--" [...] But Ciccio was dropping his head sheepishly, with the same faint smile on his face, half grimace, and stooping <b>to</b> his chair, <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Winston flung two {{bundles of}} straw {{down beside the}} stove, and stood looking at her gravely. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and let me wrap this sleigh robe about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think one}} {{ought to make}} the most of oneself, just as you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> rise in your profession! No, indeed, I could not bear you if you <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and idle, or to dawdle yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{good of you}} to {{encourage}} me!" [...] proceeded Mrs. Eyrecourt. [...] "No, thank you, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> My confession won't take long--and I really must give that poor pale daughter of mine a glass of wine. A student of human nature like you--they say all priests are students of human nature; accustomed of course to be consulted in difficulties, and to hear real confessions--must know that we poor women are sadly subject to whims and caprices. We can't resist them as men do; and the dear good men generally make allowances for us. Well, do you know that place of Mr. Winterfield's is one of my caprices? Oh, dear, I speak carelessly; I ought to have said the place represents one of my caprices. In short. Father Benwell, Beaupark House is perfectly odious to me, and I think Clovelly the most overrated place in the world. I haven't the least reason to give, but so it is. Excessively foolish of me. It's like hysterics, I can't help it; I'm sure you will forgive me. There isn't a place on the habitable globe that I am not ready to feel interested in, except detestable Devonshire. I am so sorry you went there. The next time you have a holiday, take my advice. Try the Continent." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the roll}} was beginning, a flight {{attendant}} informed the cockpit that passengers who wanted to sit near their friends were still standing and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> The airline’s director general called {{the people in the}} cabin to order.|$|E
5000|$|The {{high altitudes}} of Everest {{can have a}} {{dramatic}} effect on the human body. One climber who summited Everest in 2016 described his coming back down this way: Words can't describe how tired you feel. You want to do one thing, you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> (and) go to sleep, and yet from {{all the things you}} have read, your experience and the lessons you've learned from others' mistakes, if you sit down and rest for a long time you are never getting up again. Especially if you should fall asleep. You'll just never wake up. Robert Kay ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>wanted</b> him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and eat something, but {{he would}} not do it. He said he wouldn't spoil such a unique {{performance}} for anything. It {{was one of the most}} comical meals he had ever heard of.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> here {{quietly and}} open the envelope," [...] he said, {{switching}} on the electric lamp. [...] "That is what he told you to do, isn't it? There may be a message for you inside." ...|$|R
5000|$|Dom Juan, in his apartment, <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> dinner, but is {{prevented}} {{by a series}} of unannounced visitors. First is creditor, Monsieur Dimanch, who is put off with many compliments and Dom Juan's sudden exit. Sganarelle is left to usher the man away. Then comes Dom Louis, who is Dom Juan's father, who scolds his son and then leaves in contempt. Donna Elvira enters. She is no longer furious, but now comes in a spirit of love, with a desire to warn her husband against [...] "heaven's wrath". She attempts in vain to get him to repent, then leaves. Dom Juan and Sganarelle finally <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> at the table, when the statue of the Commander appears. He won't <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> or eat, but invites Dom Juan to sup with him the following day.|$|R
