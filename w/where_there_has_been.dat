Skilled migrants are assessed by Immigration New Zealand and applicants that they believe will contribute are issued with a residential visa, while those with potential are issued with a work to resident visa. Under the work to residency process applicants are given a temporary work permit {{for two years and}} are then eligible to apply for residency. Applicants with a job offer from an accredited New Zealand employer, cultural or sporting talent, looking for work <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a long-term skill shortage or to establish a business can apply for work to residency.|$|E

25|$|Glycated {{hemoglobin}} measurement is {{not appropriate}} <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a change in diet or treatment within 6 weeks.

25|$|In {{the common}} law of England and Wales there is no {{criminal}} liability for failing {{to act in the}} event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action.
