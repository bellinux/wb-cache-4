Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>kids,</b> and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are.

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{depictions of}} a real person, the infamous {{criminal}} Mark 'Chopper' Read (Franklin) appears as a special guest in various incongruous situations, such as reading a story for children a la Play School or calling numbers for bingo.

Chopper also makes many threatening statements directed at Neville Bartos, a character based on a real person who the real Chopper allegedly shot before going to prison, but with whom Chopper is now good friends.

5000|$|Since 1984, Lorrie Moore {{has been}} {{teaching}} literature and writing at the University of Wisconsin at Madison where she holds the Delmore Schwartz Professorship in the Humanities. [...] It’s tempting to extrapolate that Moore has drawn heavily on her experiences with college students in creating Tassie Keltjin. However Moore generally rejects the idea that her work is ever at all autobiographical: “I don’t have an interesting enough life for a memoir—unless I get to fudge and exaggerate and lie. But then that’s fiction. As for personal exposure in fiction, well, sure. One has to be brave. There is always a little personal exposure ... and more than that there is the illusion of personal exposure, which may have the same annoying repercussions,” {{she said in a}} 2005 interview with The Believer Magazine. [...] In the same interview, Moore declined to discuss her upcoming novel. But she did comment: “everything is political, and I am interested in power and powerlessness as it relates to people in various ways. I’m also interested {{in the way that the}} workings of governments and elected officials intrude upon the lives and minds of people who feel generally safe from the immediate effects of such workings” [...] which has obvious applications to the military recruitment and death of the novel’s Robert Keltjin and his family’s inability to get a straight answer from the army about how he died. Telegraph Writer Helena de Bertodano notes that Moore’s own adopted son is African American which mirrors the attempted adoption of Emmie by the white Brink family in the novel. In the same Telegraph article, Moore states “'I wanted to describe what it is like to be a white person raising an African-American in this country. People look at you a little differently; you seem to be part of a different history.” [...] In her novel, an unidentified white parent of an African-American child says, “Do you get those looks in the aisles when you’re <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>kid?</b> That look that says I see you’ve been messing around with colored people—we hope you’re paying cash”. In the same article, de Bertodano notes that Moore’s short story “People Like That Are the Only People Here: Canonical Babbling in Peed Onk” is also based on Moore’s son’s battle with cancer as a baby. In an interview she gave for Elle, Moore also admitted that the French restaurant in her novel was based in part on L’Etoile, a French restaurant in Madison, Wisconsin to which she sometimes takes her students for celebrations.|$|R
