5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most <b>workers</b> are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and <b>workers</b> who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts <b>workers.</b> Foraging <b>workers</b> use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and <b>workers</b> who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of <b>workers</b> starts to emerge. In the second phase, <b>workers</b> appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of <b>workers.</b> Isolated termite <b>workers</b> may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E

5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive <b>workers</b> from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile <b>workers</b> target newly ovipositing <b>workers</b> by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile <b>workers.</b> However, once new ovipositing <b>workers</b> attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) <b>workers</b> ignore them. The signal used by the policing <b>workers</b> consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather than being a pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing <b>workers</b> is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing <b>workers,</b> not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} discussion {{concerning the}} comparison of employment and wage decisions between capitalist firms and <b>worker</b> cooperatives began with the seminal work of Ward (1958). The model assumes that <b>worker</b> cooperatives maximizes the net income per member instead of total profits.

For instance, some authors have argued that <b>worker</b> coops are not only concerned about income per <b>worker</b> but also employment levels. However, the empirical content of these competing theoretical models has been rarely analyzed.
