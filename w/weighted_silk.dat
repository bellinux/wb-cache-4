50|$|<b>Weighted</b> <b>silk</b> is silk {{which has}} been treated to restore or {{increase}} the weight lost {{during the process of}} degumming. This processing started in the 19th century with vegetable-based solutions such as tannins or sugar. Chemical solutions based upon salts of lead or tin were then used, as well as silicate, phosphate of soda, and astringent extracts. These increased the weight considerably but led to accusations of adulteration as the properties of the silk were impaired.|$|E

Morphological observations were made using high magnified images (100 X- 1000 X) and an electron dispersive analyzer at 10 – 15 KeV accelerating voltage.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Failure of {{historic}} textiles {{is directly related}} to chemical, physical and mechanical degradation. Chemical processes that take place within the molecular structure of silk (hydrolysis, chain scission, cross-linking…) can be correlated to the loss of strength as well as the increased brittleness of textiles. This paper {{is the result of the}} early tests run on new silk samples. The objective is to characterize the effects of different dyestuffs on the structural stability of silk fabrics under specific environmental conditions. Comparisons to the behavior of <b>weighted</b> <b>silks</b> are also made...|$|R
30|$|A set of degummed and <b>weighted</b> <b>silks</b> was {{prepared}} {{in order to}} recognize the vibrational profile associated with the processes used. On this basis, the Raman and ATR-IR spectral information allowed {{the identification of the}} weighting process and also the dyes used in some of the different historic silk objects studied. The different spectra also allowed infer about the deterioration observed in the samples. The silk fibroin displays slight conformational modifications by the weighting process. The degumming process seems to have no chemical effect on the fibroin stability.|$|R
30|$|Two sets {{of samples}} were {{selected}} from the costume collection of the Museo Histórico Nacional of Chile [22]; these samples belong {{to a group of}} textiles exhibiting worrying levels of deterioration. The first group includes light color <b>weighted</b> <b>silk</b> samples highly friable; its degradation has continued over time despite being stored under controlled conditions. A second group includes samples of dark silk belonging to the same period as the light samples, but differentiated by a lesser degradation with respect to the stability of the textiles. Samples of Bombyx mori silk fibroin, and its motif peptide component (GAGAGS) were also studied by using mainly Raman and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) techniques [67]. Silk degumming, weighting and dyeing processes effects on the degradation of Bombyx mori silk fibroin were investigated through the ATR-IR and Raman techniques along with SEM/EDS microscopy.|$|E
40|$|When {{assessing}} historic {{textiles and}} considering appropriate conservation, display and storage strategies, characterising the physical {{condition of the}} textiles is essential. Our work has concentrated on developing non-destructive or micro-destructive methodologies that will permit this. Previously, we have demonstrated a correlation between the physical deterioration of unweighted and ‘pink’ tin IV chloride <b>weighted</b> <b>silk</b> and certain measurable spectroscopic and chromatographic signatures, derived from polarised FTIR-ATR spectroscopy (Pol-ATR) and HPLC microsampling analyses. The application of the Pol-ATR technique to aged silk characterisation has now been extended to include a more comprehensive range of weighting methods and ageing regimes. This was intended to replicate {{the full spectrum of}} states of deterioration observed in silk textiles, from pristine to heavily degraded. Breaking strength was employed as a measure of the physical integrity of the fibres, and, as expected, decreased with ageing. An orientational crystallinity parameter, reflecting the microstructural ordering of the fibroin polymer within the fibres, was derived from the Pol-ATR spectra. A good correlation was observed between the breaking strength of the variety of fibres and this parameter. This suggests that the physical state of historic silk fabrics might be adequately characterised for conservation purposes by such indirect micromethodology...|$|E
40|$|The general {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this thesis is to extend the application of microstructural and microchemical analytical techniques, with the longer term objective of better informing textile conservation. The ability to identify the components of threads in historic textiles and characterise their state of degradation is essential when considering potential conservation treatments. Three particular constituents are considered here, namely metals, and plant and silk fibres. Metal threads are found in wide variety of historically important textiles, and their composite nature can complicate characterisation and treatment. Examples from a range of sources were assessed by a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. It was demonstrated that these approaches allowed the determination of the general type, composition, state of degradation and likely methods of manufacture of these materials. In addition, investigations of metal threads from two specific artefacts were performed: the Jesse Tapestry, a 15 th century ecclesiastical hanging; and a piece of 19 th century embroidered artwork, produced {{in the style of the}} 17 th century. Cellulosic fibres can prove difficult to distinguish due to their similarities in composition and structure. The work presented here describes the development of an ATR FT-IR spectroscopic technique for the characterisation of six species of commonly encountered plant fibres, using linear discriminant analysis on peak intensity ratios, to allow differentiation on the basis of characteristic lignin and cellulose contents. Further investigations using a polarised ATR technique allowed the fibre microstructure to be probed, permitting further distinction, for example of hemp and flax, on the basis of the characteristic angles and senses of winding of the cellulose fibrils. Metal <b>weighted</b> <b>silk</b> fibres, found in many important artefacts, are particularly susceptible to deterioration and so are a special area of concern. The research has concentrated on developing a micro-methodology to assess these materials, and specifically to identify spectroscopic signatures that correlate to physical properties. In order to do so, samples of habutae silk were weighted, using historically accurate methods, then aged by means of either elevated temperatures or intense illumination. Physical properties were assessed by measurement of breaking strength and Young's modulus. Subsequently TGA, HPLC, UV/Visible and ATR analyses were carried out. A good correlation was found between the physical state of the fibres and both the retention time of the major silk peak (measured in the H P L C experiment) and an orientational order parameter (derived from the pol-ATR data) ...|$|E
2500|$|What are the {{characteristics}} of the fibres? [...] For instance, cotton and linen, being plant fibers, are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk. [...] Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures. [...] All silks become brittle with age, but <b>weighted</b> <b>silks</b> (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care. [...] Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted. [...] Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1938 The {{question}} {{about the quality of}} Chinese silk has always been of interest not only to the manufacturer and consumers in China but also to people who are wearing and dealing with silk all over the world. Judging of silk fabrics by means of the feel and on the basis of sales information has been realized an inadequate and unreliable method. Hence, a more objective method of determining the quality of silk fabrics is desirable for everyone concerned with silk. Cognizance has been given to the use of scientific methods of textile testing in the United States. How far the tests are applicable to Chinese silk fabrics is not known. In this comparative study of both American and Chinese fabrics under the same methods of testing {{it was found that the}} American method of finding the amount of metallic weighting was unnecessary for Chinese fabrics. Fifty fabrics, 29 from China and 21 from the United States, were bought. The commercial standards of "woven dress fabric" promulgated by the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Bureau of Standards, and the Standards of the American Society for Testing Materials were adopted. Test methods of this study consisted of tensile strength test, resistance of yarn slippage, shrinkage after dry cleaning, color fastness, and metallic weighting content test. The findings indicate the difference in qualities demanded of silk fabrics in both countries. First, the width of Chinese fabrics varied a great deal, the most common being 27 - 30 inches; while those of the United States were wider, the popular width being 39 inches. Second, more brocades were found in the Chinese silk market, while there is more demand for plain weaves in the United States. Third, the colors of the Chinese silk fabrics were found more pure and there was a variety of different shades and tints that are more or less neutralized in the American fabrics. The results of this study show that of the 29 Chinese silk fabrics tested all except three were composed of pure cultivated worn silk. The tensile strength of 11 fabrics in the warp and 18 in the filling rated below 30 pounds, which seems rather low in comparison with all the studies and findings in regard to American silk. Seventeen fabrics did not slow any yarn slippage warp-wise at the seams, and 24 were not affected filling-wise. The percentage of shrinkage was not more than 5 per cent in any case. None were affected as to color by perspiration and dry cleaning, and only three fabrics changed color slightly when a hot iron was applied. Only one sample contained more than 10 per cent weighting. The tests made on the 21 American silk fabrics showed that the information given by sales persons concerning the composition of fiber was accurate. Only five fabrics in the warp and eight materials in the filling registered tensile strengths of less than 30 pounds, a result which is lower than those found by others. Seven fabrics in the warp and 19 in the filling did not pull at the seams. Shrinkage from dry cleaning was very slight. The shortcoming of these fabrics seemed to be in the resistance to spotting. Eleven out of 21 fabrics were either slightly or greatly affected by perspiration. No change was noted in the commercial dry-cleaning process. All but one was affected under the hot pressing test. Four fabrics were found to be weighted with more than the legitimate amount of metallic substance. Two of them, however, were specified as <b>weighted</b> <b>silks</b> at the time of the purchase. It may be concluded from this study that the facts about qualities of silk fabrics cannot help manufacturers to prosper their trade nor can they help the consumers to get more service out of their dresses. Facts are helpful in so far as they are adapted to the purpose and needs of the individual. Also, this points to the need of further study and working out of different sets of standards and specifications for various types of silk fabrics...|$|R
