25|$|In the {{subsequent}} story, The Edge of Destruction, {{tensions between the}} TARDIS crew reach the point of overt conflict when he accuses them of trying to sabotage the TARDIS {{in an attempt to}} return to 1963. Barbara remains level-headed and logical, allowing the Doctor to trace the source of the distress to telepathic influences from the TARDIS (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to warn them of a major failure). Seeing that Barbara has been hurt by his accusations, the Doctor apologises and begins to realise he can rely on the two teachers, sealing a friendship which lasts until their eventual departure from the TARDIS. Although mutually respectful and increasingly affectionate, the relationship between the Doctor and Barbara is often tested by their opposing viewpoints. In The Aztecs, Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a high priest, Yetaxa, after they find her in possession of his bracelet. Barbara seizes this opportunity to change the course of history, and tries to persuade the Aztecs to abandon human sacrifice, so that by the time Hernán Cortés - who overthrew the Aztec empire - lands he will find a glorious civilisation. The Doctor warns Barbara that she cannot rewrite history, but his protests fall on deaf ears. Barbara fails and, although she has influenced some Aztecs, history remains on course.|$|E

500|$|Bosnian media, {{political}} parties and Srebrenica survivors were likewise strongly critical. The Sarajevo-based newspaper Dnevni Avaz described the report as {{an attempt by the}} Bosnian Serb government to deny that genocide had taken place. The Srebrenica and Zepa Mothers Association condemned the report as [...] "false, [...] shameful and utterly amoral." [...] The Party for Bosnia and Herzegovina denounced it as [...] "yet another attempt by the Serb Republic authorities in an unscrupulous and brutal way to negate what probably is the worst crime in Europe after WW2." [...] Alija Behmen, the Prime Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, called it [...] "a surprising forgery <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to delude the public and especially the Serbs in BiH. I honestly believe that this is the last attempt to enliven the policy which marked the tragic past of BiH. Negating the genocide cannot {{be a part of the}} election campaign." ...|$|E

500|$|Charitable trusts can't be used {{to promote}} {{political}} changes, and charities attempting such have been [...] "consistently rebuffed" [...] by the courts. There are two justifications for this. The first is that, even when a campaign for political change is stated {{to be for the}} benefit of the community, it is not within the court's competence to decide whether or not the change would be beneficial. The second, laid out in National Anti-Vivisection Society v IRC, is that the courts must assume the law to be correct, and as such could not support any charity <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to alter that law. Academic Alastair Hudson describes this argument as [...] "a little thin. Given that judges contentedly take it upon themselves to interpret, limit and extend statutes (as well as occasionally recommending the creation of new statutes to shore up the common law), it is peculiar to see judges so coy in the face of an argument being advanced that legislation might be changed".|$|E

On December 15, 2011 the Park Grill operators filed a counter suit against the City and Park District. In June, 2013 O’Malley and Foxgrover were married by Illinois Supreme Court Justice Anne M. Burke. By October, 2013 the City had paid more than $749,000 and the Park District more than $585,000 in legal fees. Deposed in August, 2013 in the lawsuit, Daley responded [...] "I don't recall" [...] 139 times. “In the Park Grill situation, city taxpayers were taken advantage of.

500|$|The Masters of Luxor, {{originally}} titled The Robots, was a six-part story {{submitted by}} Anthony Coburn for Series 1, but never produced, {{in which the}} Doctor faces a self-aware robot <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to gain a soul. It {{was rejected by the}} production team in mid-September 1963 in favour of Terry Nation's first Dalek serial. Titan Books published the unused scripts in August 1992. Edited by John McElroy, it was the fifth in the series of Doctor Who script books, and the first to appear after a break in publication following The Daleks (December 1989), during which the rights to the stories were negotiated with BBC Enterprises. The text of Coburn's script was amended to fit in with accepted conventions - for example, consistent use of the name [...] "Susan", rather than the [...] "Suzanne" [...] and [...] "Sue" [...] used by Coburn. Major differences in style between these scripts and the transmitted series include a religious subtext, with the Doctor clearly presented as a believer. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories in August 2012.|$|E

60|$|All {{this is not}} {{sufficiently}} remembered by some of us when {{the period of the}} year comes <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>trying</b> to the farmer's heart, when the young clover is growing, and the barley has been just sown. Farmers, as a rule, do not think very much of their wheat. When such riding is practicable, of course they like to see men take the headlands and furrows; but their hearts are not broken by the tracks of horses across their wheat-fields. I doubt, indeed, whether wheat is ever much injured by such usage. But let the thoughtful rider avoid the new-sown barley; and, above all things, let him give a wide berth to the new-laid meadows of artificial grasses. They are never large, and may always be shunned. To them the poaching of numerous horses is absolute destruction. The surface of such enclosures should be as smooth as a billiard-table, so that no water may lie in holes; and, moreover, any young plant cut by a horse's foot is trodden out of existence. Farmers do see even this done, and live through it without open warfare; but they should not be put to such trials of temper or pocket too often.|$|E
