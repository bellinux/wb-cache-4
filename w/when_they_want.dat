25|$|Bharuch {{has always}} been prosperous because of its {{location}} on the Narmada River. Although water tends to be scarce in Gujarat, one never finds difficulty in getting water in Bharuch. As a result of this, agriculture and other linked commercial activities have flourished in Bharuch. Bharuch is also a central stopping point for many villages spread around its boundaries. People from these small villages come to Bharuch <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to shop for new clothes, or make a major purchase.

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

The evidence they point to <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to say: this is how good it can be.” New York Times columnist Jon Caramanica also credits the album with inadvertently spawning hip hop's counterculture. [...] "Illmatic" [...] he writes, [...] "mobilized a national network of dissidents craving something true to the streets but eager to distance themselves from what was beginning to be perceived as a scourge – gangster rap." [...] According to Caramanica, Nas' debut was received by these fans as a [...] "rebuke" [...] towards trends that were beginning to shape mainstream rap: [...] "the pop crossover, the exuberant production values, [...] the splintering of rap into [...] and concerned wings." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} types of housing {{co-operative}} financing methods, market rate and limited equity. [...] With market rate, the share price is allowed to rise {{on the open market}} and shareholders may sell at whatever price the market will bear <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to move out. [...] In many ways market rate is thus similar financially to owning a condominium, with the difference being that often the co-op may carry a mortgage, resulting in a much higher monthly fee paid to the co-op than would be so in a condominium. [...] The purchase price of a comparable unit in the co-op is typically much lower, however.|$|E

2500|$|Research on how gender {{stereotypes}} affect adolescent {{sexuality is}} important because researchers believe it can show sexual health educators how they can improve their programming to more accurately attend {{to the needs of}} adolescents. For example, studies have shown how the social constructed idea that girls are [...] "supposed to" [...] not be interested in sex have actually made it more difficult for girls to have their voices heard <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to have safer sex. At the same time, sexual educators continuously tell girls to make choices that will lead them to safer sex, but don’t always tell them ‘how’ they should go about doing this. Instances such as these show the difficulties that can arise from not exploring how society’s perspective of gender and sexuality affect adolescent sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|A {{persistent}} {{world can}} be achieved by developing and maintaining a single or dynamic instance state of the game world that is shared and viewed by all players around the clock.

Data persistence ensures that any world data is not lost in the event of computer system failure. World persistence means the world continues to exist and is available to players <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to access it. And, game persistence refers to the persistence of game events within the world (a Groundhog Day MUD is a virtual world where the entire (game) world is reset periodically). When referring a [...] "persistent world", world and game persistence are sometimes used interchangeably. The persistence criteria is the trait that separates virtual worlds from other types of video games.|$|E

Farrelly said that when he approached George Clooney about playing himself in a sketch (the gag was that Clooney is bad at picking up women), Clooney told him [...] "No fucking way". There were two sketches cut from the film that were originally shown during a test screening; one that starred Anton Yelchin as a necrophiliac mortician who worked at a hospital and had sex with the dead female bodies, and another starring Julianne Moore and Tony Shalhoub as a married couple being interviewed by a detective about their missing daughter. Producer Penotti said that the sketches would be seen on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases of the film, however only the latter was included in the release.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after iOS 11 was released, Vices Motherboard {{discovered}} new behaviors by the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth toggles in the Control Center.

The report further states that [...] "it's a feature, not a bug", referencing documentation pages by Apple confirming the new toggle behaviors as a means to disconnect from connections but remain active for AirDrop transfers, AirPlay streaming, Apple Pencil input, handoff and other features.
