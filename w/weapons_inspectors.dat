5|$|In late 2002 {{and early}} 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi {{disarmament}} mandates, precipitating a diplomatic crisis. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four {{days prior to}} the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The U.S. initially sought a UN Security Council resolution authorizing {{the use of military}} force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{requires that}} Syria eliminate its chemical stockpile and allow complete access to UN and OPCW chemical <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors.</b> If {{it does not}} comply with either demand, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution regarding imposition of military or other actions against Syria under the UN Charter's Chapter VII. The vote on the resolution was delayed until 27 September because the OPCW needed to vote first on its detailed implementation plan. Syria vowed {{to abide by the}} resolution.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005 the IRA {{declared}} it had ended its armed campaign and would disarm. In September 2005 <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> {{declared that the}} IRA had fully disarmed. In response, on 30 October that year, the LVF stated that it was standing down.|$|E

25|$|From August 1991 the U.S. {{government}} made a Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft available to UNSCOM. The imagery was analysed by U.S. analysts, but {{the volume of}} imagery exceeded analysis capacity. With UNSCOM authority, Scott Ritter and some other UNSCOM <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> also regularly took Lockheed U-2 imagery to Israel for analysis. Iraq protested about the supply of such information to Israel.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Stoiber {{publicly}} expressed {{support for}} the United States in their policy toward Iraq. During his election campaign, he made clear his opposition to war, and {{his support for the}} introduction of <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> to Iraq without preconditions as a way of avoiding war, and he criticized Schröder for harming the German-American alliance by not calling President George W. Bush and discussing the issue privately. He also attacked German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for his criticism of the U.S. position.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} issues during ElBaradei’s second term as the {{director}} general of the IAEA was the agency’s inspections in Iraq. ElBaradei disputed the U.S. rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq {{from the time of the}} 2002 Iraq disarmament crisis, when he, along with Hans Blix, led a team of UN <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> in Iraq. ElBaradei told the UN Security Council in March 2003 that documents purporting to show that Iraq had tried to acquire uranium from Niger were not authentic.|$|E

It was reported that [...] "'low tech, quick and cheap' methods were being used, such as filling equipment with concrete, smashing it, sometimes using heavy vehicles."

500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and 2000s, {{international}} interventions {{authorized by the}} UN took {{a wider variety of}} forms. The UN mission in the Sierra Leone Civil War of 1991–2002 was supplemented by British Royal Marines, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO.In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of the organization's effectiveness. Under the eighth [...] Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, the UN has intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and sent observers and chemical <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> to the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered [...] "systemic failure". One hundred and one UN personnel died in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the worst loss of life in the organization's history.|$|E

2500|$|Ritter was amongst a {{group of}} UNSCOM <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> that {{regularly}} took Lockheed U-2 imagery to Israel for analysis, as UNSCOM was not getting sufficient analysis assistance from the U.S. and UK.

2500|$|After {{the passing}} of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which demanded that Iraq give [...] "immediate, {{unconditional}} and active cooperation" [...] with UN and IAEA inspections, Saddam allowed U.N. <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> led by Hans Blix to return to Iraq.

2500|$|Additionally, Omaar has {{expressed}} regret {{about the way}} in which he covered the invasion of Iraq during his time as a BBC correspondent. He suggested that he and his colleagues did pieces on Sadam Hussein, his regime and <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors,</b> giving little coverage to the Iraqi people. Interviewed in John Pilger's documentary The War You Don't See (2010), Omaar also lamented that [...] "one didn't press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough" [...] and called the coverage [...] "a giant echo chamber".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2005, {{international}} <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors</b> {{supervised the}} full disarmament of the IRA. On 26 September, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) announced that [...] "the {{totality of the}} IRA's arsenal" [...] had been decommissioned. The IRA invited two independent witnesses to view the secret disarmament work: Catholic priest Father Alec Reid and Protestant minister Reverend Harold Good. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), complained that the witnesses were not unbiased, because they were appointed by the IRA itself. Nationalists saw his comments as reflecting his opposition to nationalists in government.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1998, his {{inspection}} team in Iraq was blocked from some weapons sites by Iraqi officials stating that information obtained from these sites {{would be used}} for future planning of attacks. UN Inspectors were ordered out of Iraq by the United States Government, shortly before Operation Desert Fox attacks began in December 1998, using information which had been gathered for the purpose of disarmament to identify targets which would reduce Iraq's ability to wage both conventional and possibly unconventional warfare.

[...] 7th F-117s fighters deployed to the Gulf in 1998 during Operation Desert Fox to upgrade the strike force's capability to attack high-value targets. But the 18-hour flight from Holloman AFB to Kuwait meant that the operation was over before the F-117 aircraft arrived in the Gulf.|$|E
2500|$|Others {{focused on}} what they termed as factual inaccuracies, such as Miller's claim that [...] "Hans Blix, {{the former chief of}} the {{international}} <b>weapons</b> <b>inspectors,</b> bears some responsibility [...] " [...] because he [...] "told the U.N. in January 2003 that despite America’s ultimatum, Saddam was still not complying fully with his U.N. pledges." [...] Her critics pointed out that, although Blix indeed reported that [...] "Iraq wasn't fully compliant," [...] he also reported that Iraq was [...] "largely cooperative with regard to process," [...] and, subsequently, [...] "made it abundantly clear, in an interview published in The New York Times, that nothing he'd seen at the time justified war," [...] an interview taken by Miller herself.|$|E
