The painting was made quickly, en plein air, on an easel at the beach, with the wind whipping up sand and nearly blowing Van Gogh off his feet. He managed to scrape most of the wind-blown sand off the thick <b>wet</b> <b>painting,</b> but some remains.|$|E

50|$|Forms of wet on <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> {{have been}} in use in {{industrial}} applications for some years. The German F.A.L. process used sulphurised linseed oil and was used for some years to paint United States Postal Service vans. With the development of quick-drying primers, it was used by Rank Xerox to paint parts for their copiers. The original clear on base system for automotive metallic finishes used an air drying base. This system, using a flash primer as well, was used for cycle finishes well before it was used for cars.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Golden began {{marketing}} a line {{of newly}} developed acrylic paints, called the OPEN Acrylic Painting System. These specially-formulated paints have increased drying and working time. The system is intended to give acrylic painters access to the wet in <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> techniques of oil painters. While Open colors and mediums dry slowly, they still dry far more quickly than traditional oil paints and mediums. There are 80 colors available in the OPEN formulation, all match perfectly with the colors in Golden's Heavy Body, Fluid and High Flow color lines. OPEN is the only truly slow-drying acrylic paint available.|$|E

The window was splashed with paint because Lloyd would stand in front of his <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> holding half a gallon of turps in one hand and put his other hand into the turps and throw it over the painting.

5000|$|Wet-on-wet, or alla prima (Italian, meaning {{at first}} attempt), is a {{painting}} technique, used mostly in oil painting, in which layers of <b>wet</b> <b>paint</b> {{are applied to}} previously administered layers of <b>wet</b> <b>paint.</b> This technique requires a fast way of working, because the work has to be finished before the first layers have dried. It may also {{be referred to as}} direct painting or the French term au premier coup (at first stroke).|$|R
50|$|The Pochade Box is {{a compact}} box {{that allows the}} artist to keep all of their {{supplies}} and palette within the box and have {{the work on the}} inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> canvases or panels within the lid. These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50 cm).|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, [...] "Max Ernst: A Retrospective" [...] {{opened at}} the Metropolitan Museum of Art and {{included}} works such as Celebes (1921), Ubu Imperator (1923), and Fireside Angel (1937), {{which is one of}} the few definitively political pieces and is sub-titled The Triumph of Surrealism depicting a raging bird-like creature that symbolizes the wave of fascism that enveloped Europe. The exhibition also includes Ernst's works that experiment with free association writing and the techniques of frottage, created from a rubbing from a textured surface; grattage, involving scratching at the surface of a painting; and decalcomania, which involves altering a <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> by pressing a second surface against it and taking it away.|$|E
50|$|Ross {{used the}} wet-on-wet oil {{painting}} technique, {{in which the}} painter continues adding paint on top of still-wet paint rather than waiting a lengthy {{amount of time to}} allow each layer of paint to dry. From the beginning, the program kept the selection of tools and colors simple so that viewers would not have to make large investments in expensive equipment. Ross frequently recommended odorless paint thinner (aka odorless mineral spirits) for brush cleaning. Combining the <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> method with the use of large one- and two-inch brushes, as well as painting knives, allowed Ross to paint trees, clouds, mountains, and water in a matter of seconds. Each painting would start with simple strokes that appeared as nothing more than smudges of color. As he added more and more strokes, the blotches would transform into intricate landscapes.|$|E
50|$|During the 16th to the 19th centuries, {{painters}} did numerous {{drawings and}} color studies {{in preparation for}} large works that might take {{a year or more}} to complete. Since the late 19th century studies have become less important as painters adopted of the wet-on-wet, or alla prima painting technique, in which layers of <b>wet</b> <b>paint</b> are applied to previous layers of <b>wet</b> <b>paint,</b> the sketch being merely the first layer. However, the use of studies has been maintained by the academic art tradition.|$|R

40|$|This thesis resumes both {{theoretical}} and practical knowledge with surface protection by <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> which the student achieved during her studies and within her practice which she got in the painting shop of cabs for building, handling and agricultural machines. In her thesis the student has found out that one of current trends focuses on the method which is ecologically friendly and preserves paint lifetime. To achieve that, ED-coat painting is used first and then followed by the painting of waterborne paint. Within the scope of her thesis objective she has also optimised the process of surface protection respective technological pre-treatments and parameters which are carried out during ED-coat and e-coat painting, such as optimal thickness of coating, temperatures or technological time outs...|$|E
40|$|The {{field and}} {{laboratory}} emission cell (FLEC) {{is becoming a}} standard method of characterizing pollutant emissions from building materials. It is significant to use the emission profiles from FLEC to scale the emissions of building materials in real buildings. The dynamics of mass transfer in such an FLEC {{are the key to}} perform this task. In this study, the mass transfer mechanisms of the total volatile organic compounds from a <b>wet</b> <b>painting</b> in an FLEC are experimentally and numerically investigated. A three-dimensional mass transfer model, which takes into account the convective mass transfer between the material and the air, the diffusion in the paint film and in the substrate, is developed. The emissions from a water-based emulsion paint are quantified to assess the model. The concentration fields in the film and substrate are calculated to demonstrate the processes of internal volatile organic compounds diffusion. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{wave phase}} {{measurements}} are {{reported on the}} drying of <b>wet</b> <b>paint</b> films on aluminium substrates. Measurements {{of the change in}} thickness as the paint dries have also been obtained using a differential focussing technique on an optical microscope. By including the optical microscope measurements of the drying paint film thickness together with estimates for the density and thermal properties of the drying and cured paint, predictions have been made of the thermal phase/thickness relationships for the wet, dry, curing and cured paints. It is concluded that a phase measurement on the <b>wet</b> <b>paints</b> could be used to predict a final cured paint thickness with an accuracy of approximately ¬± 2 Œºm. Errors in predicting cured film thickness from a wet film thermal phase measurement arises principally from uncertainty over the solvent content of the <b>wet</b> <b>paint</b> film, the state of cure, and the consequent uncertainty over the paint density and thermal properties...|$|R
