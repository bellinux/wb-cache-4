2500|$|Flavius Josephus in Jewish Antiquities , chapter 2 {{recorded}} {{the story of}} King Izates of Adiabene who decided to follow the Law of Moses at {{the advice of a}} Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it {{on the grounds that the}} subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such [...] "strange and foreign rites". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision (Robert Eisenman in James the Brother of Jesus claims that Ananias is Paul of Tarsus who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, [...] "a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.|$|E
60|$|But {{they found}} that it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> tell this well-dressed young man that he was under arrest, but quite another to enforce it.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> call {{ourselves}} Minute Boys; {{to write}} to Governor Henry and to be praised by him, and quite another matter {{to be able to}} do anything whatsoever in aid of the Cause.|$|E
60|$|That it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have a king, {{another to}} have a throne, and another to have neither.|$|R
5000|$|John Tomlinson says, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} {{cultural}} diversity is being destroyed, {{quite another to}} lament the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> said of it,' Louisa {{repeated}} in her former curious tone; 'it {{will be getting}} away from home. Yes.' ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no denying}} the fact that Dave was startled. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> have Roger missing, it was quite another to have his chum gone and have the berth made up {{as if it had}} never been occupied.|$|E
60|$|Darkness was {{now coming}} on, {{and the boys}} wished {{themselves}} safe at the ranch. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> ride through the timber in the daylight; it was quite another to do so at night, and especially when the wild animals were on the move.|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the sea!" [...] ejaculated Helen. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{have read}} {{of such a}} strange fact, but a vastly {{different}} one to realize it here among these lofty peaks. Dale was always showing her something or telling her something that astounded her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Lawton," [...] {{cried the}} exasperated operator, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> despise {{the lights of}} {{classical}} learning, and another to be despised for your own ignorance!" ...|$|R
60|$|Now it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> tell {{yourself}} that you are afraid, and it is quite another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be told by some one else that you are afraid.|$|R
60|$|It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> chase a horse; it {{is another}} <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> catch it. Little {{consideration}} and less sagacity is required to convince us of the truth of that fact.|$|R
60|$|The {{longer he}} thought, the meaner his action in calling Farmer Brown's boy looked. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> try to steal those eggs himself, {{but it was}} quite another matter {{to try to have}} them stolen by some one against whom Hooty had no {{protection}} whatever.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{fight against}} the Indians in the forest where we could find as good shelter as they, and quite another to advance in the open against a {{garrison}} of men equally skilful with ourselves in handling a rifle, and protected by a stockade.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be {{said for}} the trout on this side: they meant business. They did not rise shyly, like the others, but went for the fly if it came at all near them, and then, down they rushed, and bolted into the lily-roots.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may be right, Son. But {{you know}} what they say in court: It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> know the truth, and quite another to be able to prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Because it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{stop them}} {{on the high seas}} and another to stop them in United States waters. Remember, Porto Rico is now a part of Uncle Sam’s domain.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{thing of}} it is to prove he is doing {{something}} wrong," [...] answered Dick. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> know the truth and quite another to prove it in court." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{she could}} not. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> {{put up with}} embraces, quite another to pretend that. When at last he was gone, she sat {{smoothing}} her hair, staring before her with hard eyes, thinking: [...] "Here--where I saw him with that girl! What animals men are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, when Harrison at last returned, I {{learned that}} my son was {{actually}} matched to fight in a public prize-battle. That would not do, Charles! It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> fight as you and I have fought in our youth, and it was another to compete for a purse of gold." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remained}} gloomily silent. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> avail {{myself of}} the society of a very popular little maitre d'hotel, holiday making in his own capital, and quite another to take him even a few steps into my confidence. So I said nothing, but my eyes, which travelled around the room, were weary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thankful for," [...] said Dick, as they rested {{from their}} labors. [...] "That trunk {{might have gone}} through our sides or bottom and sunk us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Hawkins. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> attack {{her when}} she has Miss Greendale on board, but if she has gone ashore {{it would be very}} like an act of piracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thankful for," [...] he mused. [...] "I don't {{believe he}} {{captured}} Nellie Winthrop again {{after he left}} the cave. I wonder what has become of that girl?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{produced}} a vast sensation, naturally; Roxana was astonished at this admirable guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the exchange <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>to</b> guess {{who did it}} quite another. Pudd'nhead Wilson could do wonderful things, no doubt, but he couldn't do impossible ones. Safe? She was perfectly safe. She smiled privately.|$|E
6000|$|So she {{was delighted}} {{when she heard}} this, almost as much delighted as she was afraid that he might fail in the most {{difficult}} adventure. For it <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> egg on a Remora to kill a Firedrake, and quite another to find the princes if they were alive, and restore them if they were dead! ...|$|E
60|$|But {{at least}} there <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> be done. Where he had sinned, there he must make amends; not as a propitiation, not even as a restitution; but simply as a {{confession}} of the truth which he had found. And as his purpose shaped itself, he longed and prayed that Miriam might return, and make it possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} know Jack and Fred are innocent," [...] remarked Randy to his brother. [...] "But {{in a court}} of law it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> know it and quite another <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> prove it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you behaved very well, Charlie; but it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{standing}} {{on the top of}} a keep and another to be in the streets when a fray is going on all round." ...|$|R
6000|$|Osborn knitted his brows. [...] "I {{imagined}} {{that was done}} with. It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> take his help and another to give him Grace. After all, {{there is not much}} difference between his plan and Thorn's." ...|$|R
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Dick's heart beat loudly {{as he took}} his seat in the flying machine. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> talk about going up and quite another to really fly. He {{realized}} the danger far more than did merry-hearted Tom, or even Sam. But {{he was not going}} to show the white feather.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> talk of {{sweeping}} the Prussians before them, {{quite another to}} take {{a part in the}} performance. Still the steady drilling that went on had its effect. If the National Guard did not learn discipline they at least gained the power to make a respectable appearance and to go through simple manoeuvres fairly.|$|E
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do, {{and that}} one thing he did, [...] He lent her some clouts of his own, And she took 'em perforce; and while in 'em she slid, Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid, Thinking, [...] "O that the picter my duty keeps hid [...] To the sight o' my eyes mid be shown!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now it is {{our turn}} again," [...] Malcolm said. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> prepare a fire and another to light it, my fine fellows. I expect that you have {{forgotten}} that there are firearms here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But then, Jonas," [...] said Oliver, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thought of, {{and that}} is, that rich men's sons {{will not have}} to work when they grow up; and so they don't need so much to grow industrious." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the third}} {{proposition}} I am quite disposed to agree, though {{it must be}} recollected that it <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> allow that a given migration is possible, and another to admit {{there is good reason}} to believe it has really taken place.|$|R
