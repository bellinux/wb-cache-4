For example, the proposition ‘the earth is flat’ corresponds to the set of possible <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the earth is in fact flat.|$|R

5|$|Her novella Anthem {{was written}} {{during a break}} from the writing of her next major novel, The Fountainhead. It {{presents}} a vision of a dystopian future <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> totalitarian collectivism has triumphed {{to such an extent that}} even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with We the Living, Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character and depth of personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E

50|$|In the {{philosophy}} of language and modal logic, a term {{is said to be}} a non-rigid designator (or flaccid designator) if it does not extensionally designate (denote, refer to) the same object <b>in</b> all possible <b>worlds.</b> This is <b>in</b> contrast to a rigid designator, which does designate the same object <b>in</b> all possible <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> that object exists, and does not designate anything else <b>in</b> those <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> that object does not exist. The term was coined by Saul Kripke in his 1970 lecture series at Princeton University, later published as the book Naming and Necessity.|$|R

Nearly three centuries before the events of the first novel (see backstory), the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros were united under the Targaryen dynasty by Aegon I and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys, with Aegon Targaryen {{becoming}} the first king of the whole of the continent of Westeros, save for the southerly Dorne. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, 15 peaceful years have passed since the rebellion led by Robert Baratheon deposed and killed the last Targaryen king, Aerys II, and proclaimed Robert king of the Seven Kingdoms, with a nine year long summer coming to an end.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing in a <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key {{to the success of the}} American dream.|$|E
40|$|Incidence {{calculus}} is a probabilistic logic which possesses both numerical {{and symbolic}} approaches. However, Liu in [5] {{pointed out that}} the original incidence calculus had some drawbacks and she established a generalized incidence calculus theory (GICT) based on L/ukasiewicz's threevalued logic to improve it. In a GICT, an incidence function is defined to relate each proposition # in the axioms of the theory to a set of possible <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> # has truth value true. But the incidence function only represents those absolute true states of propositions, so it can not deal with the uncertain states. In this paper, we use two incidence functions i and i # to relate the axioms to the sets of possible worlds. For an axiom #, i (#) is {{to be thought of as}} the set of possible <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> # has truth value true, while i # (#) is the set of possible <b>worlds</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> # is true or undeterminable. Since i # can represent the undeterminable state, our newly defined theory is more efficient to handle vague information than GICT...|$|R

5|$|Crackdown, {{initially}} {{planned for}} release {{on the original}} Xbox console, was envisioned as a vast <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> players could experiment and explore freely. Microsoft Game Studios bundled specifically marked copies of Crackdown with an access code to the multiplayer test version of the much-anticipated Halo 3 Beta.

A sequel, Crackdown 2, was released in July 2010 by Ruffian Games without Jones' input, and a third title is planned for Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in spring 2018, with support from Jones.|$|E
5|$|Dwarf Fortress (officially called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress) {{is a part}} {{construction}} and management simulation, part roguelike, indie video game created by Tarn and Zach Adams. Freeware and in development since 2002, its first alpha version was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving solely on donations. The primary game mode {{is set in a}} procedurally generated fantasy <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the player indirectly controls a group of dwarves, and attempts to construct a successful and wealthy underground fortress. Critics praised its complex, emergent gameplay but had mixed reactions to its difficulty. The game influenced Minecraft and was selected among other games to be featured in the Museum of Modern Art to show the history of video gaming in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> players can {{interact with each}} other and the environment.

Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players who speak different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|Hunter (1991) {{has been}} {{described}} as the first sandbox game featuring full 3D, third-person graphics, thus making it an important precursor to the Grand Theft Auto series. The game consisted of a large, open <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> there were numerous possibilities to complete different missions. The character could travel on foot, or steal different vehicles such as cars, tanks, or even bicycles, boats, helicopters and hovercrafts. Moreover, Hunter also had many unique features such as day and night lighting, fuel modelling, a log book, aerial observation units, tank traps, land mines and computer-controlled rocket batteries and tracer guns. It was also possible to ride a bicycle, swim, windsurf or even make a parachute jump from a helicopter.|$|E

Billy first learns to communicate with a radio DJ, and eventually to control the world's computers.

5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means to respond to the post-9/11 <b>world</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
