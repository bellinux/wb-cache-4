Among these are mechanical requirements, fabrication method (e. g. press-molding, resin infusion, filament <b>winding,</b> <b>tape</b> layup), and use conditions. Primary among the environmental exposures encountered in aerospace structures are moisture and elevated temperatures, but certain applications may require resistance to other fluids and solvents, alkaline agents, thermal cycling, radiation, or rapid, localized heating (for example, lightning strike).

The MMC filament winding process is now capable of winding hoop and helical plies. Hydroburst testing of recent cylinder specimens have demonstrated delivered fiber strength of 320 ksi, which represents a translation efficiency of 80 %. This process is now ready to move to the next step of winding end domes and closures. The MetPreg tape manufacturing process has been extended into other materials combinations. Prepreg tape made from high-strength aluminum alloy matrices shows great promise for applications demanding high compression strength. Tape has also been manufactured with continuous carbon fibers in a magnesium matrix.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of {{composite}} prepreg tape winding, the compaction force could influence the quality of winding products. According to the analysis and experiments, during the winding process of a rocket motor nozzle aft exit cone with a winding angle, {{there would be an}} error between the deposition speed of tape layers and the feeding speed of the compaction roller, which could influence the compaction force. Both a lack of compaction and overcompaction related to the feeding of the compaction roller could result in defects of winding nozzles. Thus, a flexible winding system has been developed for rocket motor nozzle winding. In the system, feeding of the compaction roller could be adjusted in real time to achieve an invariable compaction force. According to experiments, the force deformation model of the <b>winding</b> <b>tape</b> is a time-varying system. Thus, a forgetting factor recursive least square based parameter estimation proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller has been developed, which could estimate the time-varying parameter and control the compaction force by adjusting the feeding of the compaction roller during the winding process. According to the experimental results, a winding nozzle with fewer voids and a smooth surface could be wounded by the invariable compaction force in the flexible winding system...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} experimentally validated three-dimensional transient {{simulations of}} the thermal phenomena of the <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> process, {{as well as}} a method to determine separately the heat transfer between the hot gas originating from a torch and the composite material. The computational model predicts the temperature of the incoming tape and the substrate during the winding process. Each numerical simulation is based on an explicit time integration scheme and covers the duration of the process. The simulation within each time step employs a steady-state model. This method takes into account the cyclic nonuniform heating of the material and the effect of the growing mass. The comparison of the simulation results with the experimental data shows good agreements. The experiments were performed with preconsolidated glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene tapes. The measurements were performed with infrared pyrometry. This technique can handle moving points during the entire process, and is nonintrusive.

40|$|Abstract — A tape {{system is}} {{time-varying}} as <b>tape</b> <b>winds</b> from one reel to the other. The variations in reel radii consist of two components: the nominal reel radii change due to <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> and the reel eccentricities {{as a result}} of non-circular reels. These variations introduce disturbances in the tape tension. This paper presents a feedforward control that addresses the time-varying reel radius to regulate the tension. The algorithm is {{based on the fact that}} the change of the nominal radius is slow and hence the nominal plant in two consecutive revolutions can be considered as the same. The reel eccentricity disturbance is then repetitive in these two revolutions. We investigate the tension error in the previous revolution and calculate the compensation input that should have cancelled it. The compensation input is interpolated properly and then fed forward to the system in the current revolution. A new compensation input sequence is computed for the immediately following revolution. This computation pattern continues until the end of the <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> process. Simulation results demonstrate and compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with other recently developed methods. I...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to monitor {{emission}} of chemicals at a factory where plastics products were fabricated by a new robotic (impregnated <b>tape</b> <b>winding)</b> production process. Stationary and personal air measurements were taken to determine which chemicals were released and at what concentrations. Principal component analyses (PCA) and linear regression were used to determine the emission sources of different chemicals found in the air samples. We showed that complex mixtures of chemicals were released, but most concentrations were below Dutch exposure limits. Based on the results of the principal component analyses, the chemicals found were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of short chain aliphatic hydrocarbons (C 2 –C 6). The second group included larger hydrocarbons (C 9 –C 11) and some cyclic hydro-carbons. The third group contained all aromatic and two aliphatic hydrocarbons.

The thermoplastic <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> process is an energy-efficient technique for the production of fiber reinforced plastics.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} two {{feedforward control}} algorithms to attenuate the tension error in digital tape systems.

We address the time-varying nature of the reel radii due to <b>tape</b> <b>winding</b> by introducing a time-varying feedforward filter for the reference input. To attenuate the periodic tension error caused by reel eccentricities, we investigate the error in previous periods and calculate the compensation input that cancels it. This input is then fed forward to the system for future periods. Simulations show that the time-varying reference input achieved from the feedforward filter leads to zero tension error if the variations in the radius are known. With unknown reel eccentricities, the feedforward compensation input reduces the tension error by about 3 orders of magnitude when the system is periodic. I...|$|R
