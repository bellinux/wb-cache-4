He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>this?</b> We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt." [...] "It sickened me," [...] said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, [...] "that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death {{on the basis of a}} cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal." ...|$|E

6000|$|Brisbane {{started a}} little. [...] "Why, {{of course you}} were; my memory is failing me. Well, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> man Curtis--he's a crank on the Indian question, like yourself, isn't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again he made {{no answer}} and I went on, [...] "And now, <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> journey to the north? If indeed I must make it, would you wish to {{accompany}} me?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Theologians I called them. Philologians {{would be}} a better word,--lovers of the [Greek: *Logos*], or Word, by which the heavens and earth were made. <b>What</b> logos, <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Logos, have they learned, or can they teach? ...|$|R
5000|$|... "You know <b>what's</b> good <b>about</b> <b>this</b> film?" [...] Bostwick later reflected. [...] "It's plausible. We need an {{international}} force {{like this to}} keep the peace. I wouldn't mind betting that one day there's a real Megaforce operating somewhere in the world." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to have a glance round. What a charming, old-fashioned room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute, until I have {{examined}} the floor. No, I see nothing. <b>What</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> curtain? You hang your clothes behind it. If anyone were forced to conceal himself in this room he must do it there, since the bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow. No one there, I suppose?" ...|$|E

Your wife will have to fill your mother's place,--and your mother was a pearl among women. Do you think this girl is worthy of it? It isn't possible!

6000|$|... "Used to when I was a kid. Too old now. Have to {{look after}} my digestion. I {{remember}}, three years ago, when Wain's won the footer cup, we got up and fed at about two in the morning. All sorts of luxuries. Sardines on sugar-biscuits. I've got the taste in my mouth still. Do you remember Macpherson? Left {{a couple of years}} ago. His food ran out, so he spread brown-boot polish on bread, and ate that. Got through a slice, too. Wonderful chap! But <b>what</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> thing of yours?

He feels himself to be well, reborn, as it were, in a new world--a world so bright and novel and jolly that he can't help laughing at the sight of it. He looks about him; the flies on the ceiling strike him as being extremely comic. How do they manage to walk upside down? They have suckers on their feet, says Sister Agatha, and wonders if her natural history is quite sound. Suckers on their feet--ha, ha! What an uproarious notion! Suckers on their feet--that's good, that's damned good! You can say charming, pathetic, positively tender things about the irrelevant mirth of convalescents the more so in this particular case, where the mirth is expressed by a young man who is to be taken back to jail as soon as he can stand firmly on his legs. Ha, ha! Laugh on, unhappy boy. It is the quacking of the Fates, the Parcæ, the Norns!" ...|$|E
