30|$|According to World Coal Institute, “It is not use of coal, but how coal is {{used that}} must {{be the focus of}} action”. It gives me immense {{pleasure}} to write the editorial of an emergent journal in a most vital area like coal science and technology. Coal, the world’s most abundant fossil fuel, can provide world’s energy needs for the next several decades. The special issue of International Journal of Coal Science and Technology (JCST) on “Indian coal” mainly aims at bringing out the current research activities in India for gainful utilization of the coal resources leading to societal development. I express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Suping Peng and his team for agreeing to publish the issue <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> editorship.|$|R

60|$|Of course I drank. I drank <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> and hosts. Also, I drank by myself. Doing {{the work}} of five men, I thought, {{entitled}} me to drink. Alcohol was good {{for a man who}} over-worked. I noted its effect on my small crew, when, breaking their backs and hearts at heaving up anchor in forty fathoms, they knocked off gasping and trembling at the end of half an hour and had new life put into them by stiff jolts of rum. They caught their breaths, wiped their mouths, and went to it again with a will. And when we careened the Snark and had to work in the water to our necks between shocks of fever, I noted how raw trade rum helped the work along.|$|E

The Minstrel, who had cost $200,000, was sold to America for $9 million; Alleged, bought for $175,000 as a two-year-old, went to Kentucky a year later for $16 million. These profits funded further {{purchases}} but by the mid-1980s, beginning <b>with</b> Be <b>My</b> <b>Guest,</b> Coolmore began {{to have its own}} champion sires in residence.

40|$|This final project {{report was}} written {{based on my}} {{internship}} experience at Great Tour and Travel Yogyakarta. The objectives were to practice the activities as a tour guide, {{to find out the}} problems and solutions as a tour guide The first step in job training, I escorted the senior tour guide. I could know the activities of tour guide in a tour. It was used as a reference for guiding the guests. In guiding process, there were three steps i. e. (1) Preparation: I saw the schedule of the tour for the day after. The schedule was written on the whiteboard by receptionist. After I knew my tour for tomorrow, I prepared the list of the guests and their hotel names,(2) Method of the tour:I picked up the guests at their hotel one by one. After all the guests were already in the car, I introduced myself and my driver. After that, I explained about the schedule, regulation, and interesting object. Then, when we arrived in the tourism destinations, I gave explanation about the general information, entrance fee and meeting point of the tourism destination, and (3) Closing: I thanked and said goodbye to all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> who joined Great Tour and Travel tour. There were three problems in my internship experience as a tour guide in Great Tour and Travel. The first problem was that not all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> could speak English. To overcome this problem, I communicated with them using body language. The second problem was neither I nor all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> was not a native speaker so we had restrictiveness about English vocabulary. To solve the problem, I used an online dictionary in my smartphone. The third problem was <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> felt uncomfortable <b>with</b> <b>my</b> driver who drove too fast. In this situation, I tried to convince all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> that they would be okay...|$|R

60|$|I made an evasive and {{laughing}} answer; but, being quite near the tent by this time, {{it was necessary}} to change the discourse. The reader may think it odd, but that was the very first time the possibility of my marrying Emily Merton ever crossed my mind. In London, I had regarded her as an agreeable acquaintance, with just as much of the colouring of romance and of the sentimental about our intercourse, as is common with youths of nineteen and girls a little younger; but as nothing more. When we met on the island, Emily appeared to me like a friend--a female friend--and, of course, one to be viewed with peculiarly softened feelings; still, as only a friend. During the month we had just passed in the same ship, this tie had gradually strengthened; and I confess to a perfect consciousness of there being on board a pretty girl in her nineteenth year, of agreeable manners, delicate sentiments, and one whose presence gave the Crisis a charm she certainly never enjoyed during poor Captain Williams's time. Notwithstanding all this, there was something--though what that something was, I did not then know myself--which prevented me from absolutely falling in love <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fair <b>guest.</b> Nevertheless, Marble's suggestion was not unpleasant to me; but, on the other hand, it rather conduced to the satisfaction of my present visit.|$|R
