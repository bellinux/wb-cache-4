50|$|The larvae feed on Chenopodium, and {{occasionally}} Alternanthera species. Adults feed on nectar from marigold, knotweed, spearmint, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> cucumber, dogbane, white sweet clover, and white clover.|$|E
50|$|The adult {{butterflies}} drink nectar from a {{wide variety}} of flowering plants, including buddleia, willows, dandelions, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> danewort, hemp agrimony, and clover; they also utilize tree sap and rotten fruit.|$|E
50|$|In the UK and in cooler or more mountainous {{areas in}} Europe, wild thyme is the food plant, {{marjoram}} {{being used by}} populations in warmer areas. Fertilized large blue females will lay their eggs only on the buds of <b>wild</b> thyme or <b>marjoram,</b> which young caterpillars feed on exclusively until after the third moult, when {{they are ready to}} seek out the appropriate ant nest. At sites where large blues occur, there is usually a high density of such nests. When the caterpillar is ready, it will drop itself off the food plant and wait to be picked up by a passing red ant, which will then carry it to its nest. Soon after it enters the nest, the caterpillar will seek out the nesting chambers and proceed to eat red-ant eggs and larvae. When winter draws near, the large blue caterpillar begins to hibernate.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{growing in}} the nature park include the Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), {{rockrose}} (Cistus), oak (Quercus ithaburensis), Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), salt cedar (Tamarix), sumac (Rhus), hackberry (Celtis), broom (Genista), mullein (Verbascum), milkvetch (Astragalus) and <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> (Origanum).|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a stretch}} of a former railway line. It is {{grassland}} and hedgerows {{with a wide variety}} of fauna and flora. There are flowering plants such as field scabious, greater knapweed, St John's wort, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> and bladder campion.|$|E
50|$|The {{large blue}} {{butterfly}} is well known among the behavioural ecology field as it exhibits a unique parasitic relationship with a single species of red ant, Myrmica sabuleti. The species also feeds on thyme and <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> oregano as food plants early in its life cycle.|$|E
50|$|Oregano is a {{perennial}} herb, growing from 20 - 80 cm tall, with opposite leaves 1 - 4 cm long. The flowers are purple, 3 - 4 mm long, produced in erect spikes. It {{is sometimes called}} <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> and its close relative O. majorana is known as sweet marjoram.|$|E
50|$|Other Latin {{names for}} the herbs called za'atar in Arabic include Origanum syriacum (also known as Bible hyssop, Arabic oregano and <b>wild</b> <b>{{marjoram}})</b> and Origanum majorana (sweet marjoram). Both oregano and marjoram are closely related Mediterranean plants of the Lamiaceae family, so it is unsurprising {{that they could be}} used interchangeably.|$|E
50|$|At {{lunch time}} when the {{ceremony}} begins, {{everyone in the family}} {{stands in front of the}} mirror to pray. Sharbat is drunk and then—as a good omen—sormeh is applied around the eyes. Handfuls of <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> lotus and sugar plum seeds are thrown over one another's heads while they embrace one another.|$|E
50|$|Oregano (Origanum vulgare), {{sometimes}} listed with marjoram as Origanum majorana) is {{also called}} <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram.</b> It is a perennial common in southern Europe in dry copses and on hedge-banks, with many stout stems 30 - 80 cm high, bearing short-stalked, somewhat ovate leaves and clusters of purple flowers. It has a stronger flavor than marjoram.|$|E
5000|$|Another species {{identified}} as [...] "wild za'atar" [...] (Arabic:za'atar barri) is Origanum vulgare, {{commonly known as}} European oregano, oregano, pot marjoram, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> winter marjoram, or wintersweet. This species is also extremely common in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Palestine, and is used by Palestinians to make one local variety of the spice mixture.|$|E
50|$|The open {{landscape}} species of dry, rocky calcareous grassland {{are also found}} in refuge in Grass Wood on the steep un-wooded scar edges of the limestone, especially along the sunlit areas of Dewbottom Scar. Here can be found the locally uncommon Rock Whitebeam (Sorbus rupicola) as well as Burnet Rose (Rosa pimpinellifolia), Common Rock-rose (Helianthemum nummularium), Bloody Crane's-bill (Geranium sanguineum), Salad-burnet (Sanguisorba minor), <b>Wild</b> <b>Marjoram</b> (Origanum vulgare) and Wild Thyme Thymus polytrichus.|$|E
5000|$|Take three {{pints of}} strong white wine vinegar, add {{a handful of}} each of wormwood, meadowsweet, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> and sage, fifty cloves, two ounces of {{campanula}} roots, two ounces of angelic, rosemary and horehound and three large measures of champhor. Place the mixture in a container for fifteen days, strain and express then bottle. Use by rubbing it on the hands, ears and temples {{from time to time}} when approaching a plague victim.|$|E
50|$|Oregano {{is related}} to the herb marjoram, {{sometimes}} being referred to as <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram.</b> Oregano has purple flowers and spade-shaped, olive-green leaves. It is a perennial, although it is grown as an annual in colder climates, as it often does not survive the winter.Oregano is planted in early spring, the plants being spaced 12 in apart in fairly dry soil, with full sun. Oregano will grow in a pH range between 6.0 (mildly acidic) and 9.0 (strongly alkaline), with a preferred range between 6.0 and 8.0. It prefers a hot, relatively dry climate, but does well in other environments.|$|E

5000|$|Freedom from a {{fairy ring}} often {{requires}} outside intervention. A tactic from early 20th-century Wales is to cast <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> and thyme into the circle and befuddle the fairies; another asks the rescuer {{to touch the}} victim with iron. Other stories require that the enchanted victim simply be plucked out by someone on the outside, although even this can be difficult: A farmer in a tale from the Llangollen region has to tie a rope around himself and enlist four men to pull him from the circle as he goes in to save his daughter. Other folk methods rely on Christian faith to break the enchantment: a stick from a rowan tree (thought to be the wood from which the cross of Jesus Christ was built) can break the curse, as can a simple phrase such as [...] "what, in Heaven's name", as in a 19th-century tale from Carmarthenshire. A common element to these recoveries is that the rescuer must wait {{a year and a}} day from when the victim entered the ring.|$|E
5000|$|... “The {{cinnamon}} shrub is {{only two}} cubits in height, at the most, the lowest being {{no more than}} a palm in height. It is about four fingers in breadth, and hardly has it risen six fingers from the ground, before it begins to put forth shoots and suckers. It has then all the appearance of being dry and withered, and while it is green it has no odor at all. The leaf is like that of <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> and it thrives best in dry localities, being not so prolific in rainy weather; it requires, also, to be kept constantly clipped. Though it grows on level ground, it thrives best among tangled brakes and brambles, and hence it is extremely difficult to be gathered... The thinnest parts in the sticks, for about a palm in length, are looked upon as producing the finest cinnamon; the part that comes next, though not quite so long, is the next best, and so on downwards. The worst of all is that which is nearest the roots, from the circumstance that in that part there is the least bark, the portion that is the most esteemed: hence it is that {{the upper part of the}} tree is preferred, there being the greatest proportion of bark there. As for the wood, it is held in no esteem at all, on account of the acrid taste which it has, like that of wild marjoram; it is known as xylocinnamum.” ...|$|E
40|$|Investigations of botanical and {{biochemical}} {{characters of}} <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> subspecies Origanum vulgare L. and Origanum vulgare subs. hirtum {{were carried out}} at the Lithuanian Institute of Horticulture. It is observed that subspecies of <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> Origanum vulgare subs. hirtum, which grows in the South Europe, differs from Origanum vulgare L native in Lithuania by aroma and especially large amount of essential oils. According to the data of investigations the productivity of <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> subspecies (grass yield) was similar in various growth stages. It was established that in various growth stages the grass of <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> subspecies Origanum vulgare L. and Origanum vulgare subs. hirtum had the similar chemical properties. The most significant differences were established when the amount of essential oils in <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> raw material was analyzed. It was found from 0. 04 to 0. 16 % of essential oils in the raw material of Origanum vulgare L. during various stages of growth. From 0. 56 to 1. 78 % of essential oils {{was found in the}} raw material of subspecies Origanum vulgare subs. hirtum. Consequently, amount of essential oils was ten times as large. Origanum vulgare subs. hirtum is a valuable subscpecies for use as aromatic and medicinal raw material...|$|E
40|$|The {{material}} was {{collected from the}} Botanical Garden and the Collegium Medicum Medicinal Plant Garden of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The investigated species were: lemon balm (Mellisa officinalis L.), common lavender (Lavendula angustifolia Mill.), horsemint (Mentha longifolia L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), and <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> (Origanum vulgare L.). The aim of the investigation was to identify fungi causing the death of leaf tissues of herbs from the mint family Lamiaceae. In mycological investigations, 180 fragments of each plant leaves (1, 080 dead leaf fragments in total) were placed in a 2 % PDA medium. Over 970 colonies of fungi belonging to 48 species were isolated from the dead leaf tissues of the six herb species. Alternaria alternata (toxin-producing), Epicoccum nigrum and Sordaria fimicola were the most frequently isolated. The largest numbers of colonies and species of fungi were isolated from horsemint, while the lowest numbers were from <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram</b> leaves. It was shown that the death of leaves of selected herb species from the Lamiaceae family was caused by various fungi. The results of the mycological analysis confirmed the diversity of species colonizing {{the leaves of the}} herbs...|$|E
40|$|We {{quantified}} insect visitation {{rates by}} counting how many flowers/inflorescences were probed per unit time for five plant species (four native and one garden: California lilac, bramble, ragwort, <b>wild</b> <b>marjoram,</b> and ivy) growing in Sussex, United Kingdom, by following individual insects (n= 2987) from nine functional groups (honey bees (Apis mellifera), bumble bees (Bombus spp.), hoverflies, flies, butterflies, beetles, wasps, non-Apidae bees, and moths). Additionally, {{we made a}} census of the insect diversity on the studied plant species. Overall we found that insect groups differed greatly in their rate of flower visits (P< 2. 2 e- 16), with bumble bees and honey bees visiting significantly more flowers per time (11. 5 and 9. 2 flowers/minute, resp.) than the other insect groups. Additionally, we report on a within-group difference in the non-Apidae bees, where the genus Osmia, which is often suggested {{as an alternative to}} honey bees as a managed pollinator, was very speedy (13. 4 flowers/minute) compared to the other non-Apidae bees (4. 3 flowers/minute). Our census showed that the plants attracted a range of insects, with the honey bee as the most abundant visitor (34 %). Therefore, rate differences cannot be explained by particular specializations. Lastly, we discuss potential implications of our conclusions for pollination...|$|E
