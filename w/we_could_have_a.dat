500|$|The thirteenth stage (13 July) of the 1967 Tour de France {{measured}} {{it started}} in Marseille, crossing Mont Ventoux (the [...] "Giant of Provence") before finishing in Carpentras. At dawn Tour doctor, Pierre Dumas, met journalist, Pierre Chany, near his hotel. Dumas noted the warm temperature, [...] "If the boys stick their nose in a 'topette' [...] today, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> death on our hands". At the start line, a journalist noticed Simpson looked tired and ask him if the heat was the problem. Simpson replied, [...] "No, it's not the heat, it's the Tour." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When the mom leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepiwall for HitFix {{called this}} the best overall episode since season four's December 2009 episode [...] "Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001". He {{wrote that the}} episode had [...] "some incredibly funny jokes", but noted that the [...] "most hilarious moments" [...] from [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] came from the main characters themselves. Sepinwall enjoyed Jack's videos to his unborn son, noting it was [...] "...the [...] I know and love best: supremely confident and... oblivious to his own insanity." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club liked that the series had moved on from making the Liz character [...] "asexual and vaguely repellent" [...] for men. In his recap, Rabin much enjoyed the episode and said [...] "If {{the rest of the}} season is as good as the first two episodes, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> big-time comeback on our hands." [...] Juli Weiner of Vanity Fair wrote that Paul Giamatti was a delight as his 30 Rock character. Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett was thrilled that the Tracy character was a contestant on Cash Cab, noting once the game began [...] "everything felt so right". Samantha Urban of The Dallas Morning News preferred [...] "When It Rains, It Pours" [...] to the episodes of Community and The Office, which aired on NBC the same night. Brad Sanders of the Indiana Daily Student wrote that Giamatti played his part brilliantly, and that his involvement in the main plot was [...] "well-written, well-organized, and by far the best thing about the episode".|$|E

60|$|And in the forenoon {{we took it}} down to the woods, but it wouldn't go {{into the}} pie. Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or sausage, or {{anything}} you choose. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>a</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> whole dinner.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2010, {{a police}} officer and his dog, on a routine {{training}} exercise, discovered the first body: [...] "the skeletal remains {{of a woman in}} a nearly disintegrated burlap sack". This discovery led to three more bodies being found two days later in the same area, {{on the north side of}} the Ocean Parkway. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said, [...] "Four bodies found in the same location pretty much speaks for itself. It's more than a coincidence. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> serial killer." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2016, when George Kerevan {{asked her}} {{whether she would}} be {{prepared}} to authorise the killing of a hundred thousand innocent persons by a nuclear strike; during the [...] "Trident debate" [...] inside the House of Commons, May said [...] "Yes. And I have to say to the honourable gentleman: the whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know that we {{would be prepared to}} use it. Unlike some suggestions that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nuclear deterrent but not actually be willing to use it, which come from the Labour Party frontbench." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, in a {{discussion}} forum, Lee Kuan Yew was asked whether the emotional bonds of various ethnic groups in Singapore could be a hurdle to nation building, Lee replied: [...] "Yes, I think so, {{over a long period}} of time, and selectively. We must not make an error. If, for instance, you put in a Malay officer who's very religious and who has family ties in Malaysia in charge of a machine-gun unit, that's a very tricky business. We've got to know his background. I'm saying these things because they are real, and if I don't think that, and I think even if today the Prime Minister doesn't think carefully about this, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tragedy.|$|E
50|$|As {{an outside}} half {{he was a}} player who {{certainly}} would be a regular in our midfield today. I would have been glad if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> player like him in our ranks in Argentina. When he played behind me, with his hardness, deftness and pace, I felt absolutely safe upfront. Kupfer's left foot was stronger than his right; when he moved with the ball from the right side to the center, he played diagonal passes with his left foot towards the right wing, which tore apart the defense. An exceptionally gifted player.|$|R

I only wish more people had caught on to our music sooner so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> easier time at being a band. Im not saying its over yet but I am saying that right now I {{need to focus on}} other things. Maybe in a while I will get the urge to write a new TC album but right now my hearts not in it.

In both cases, RAII ensures only that the resource in question is released appropriately; care must still be taken to maintain exception safety. If the code modifying the data structure or file is not exception-safe, the mutex could be unlocked or the file closed with the data structure or file corrupted.|$|R
2500|$|Pawlenty {{was raised}} a Roman Catholic. His {{conversion}} to an Evangelical Protestant faith has {{been attributed to}} his wife Mary, {{who is a member of}} Wooddale Church in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a member congregation of the Minnesota Baptist Conference. In a January 2011 interview, Mr. Pawlenty stated, [...] "I love and respect and admire the Catholic Church. I still attend Mass once in a while there. The church I now attend is an interdenominational church which has got many former Catholics in it, and so we share the Christian faith and the Bible. I had to reconcile my faith life with my wife so <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> consistent, integrated family faith life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, [...] "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks [...] were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then." ...|$|E

The re-elected Labour governance promised its attentions would be focused on two key aspects: the environment, in which a committee - or possibly sub-committee of the already existent Town Planning committee - would address environmental questions, and a deputation on the replacement of St. Catherine's school - an important issue during the campaign - would be organised as quickly as possible.|$|R
