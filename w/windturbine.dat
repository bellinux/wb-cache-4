40|$|Capítulos en librosThe current {{practice}} of maintenance applied to existing windturbines {{is based on}} periodical preventive maintenance actions recommended by their manufacturers. In most cases, this maintenance is applied without paying {{special attention to the}} real and local life of the windturbines: weather conditions at the location, stress caused by over-load, hours continuously working, etc. These factors determine the particular life of every <b>windturbine</b> and the maintenance applied must be planned taking them into account. This paper proposes a new method that, using a unique model named MAOL, integrates an evaluation of possible failure risk of a <b>windturbine</b> according to the historical unavailabilities which have occurred with an analysis about the effectiveness of the applied maintenance. A new tool has been developed for supporting these studies and its main features will be described.

40|$|A {{rapid growth}} of {{installed}} wind power capacity is expectedin the next few years. However, the siting of wind turbines ona large scale raises concerns about their environmental impact,notably with respect to noise. To this end, variable speed <b>windturbines</b> offer a promising solution for applications in denselypopulated areas like the European countries, as this designwould enable an efficient utilisation of the masking effect dueto ambient noise. In rural and recreational areas where <b>windturbines</b> are sited, the ambient noise originates from theaction of wind on the vegetation and about the listener's ear(pseudo-noise). It shows a wind speed dependence similar tothat of the noise from a variable speed wind turbine and cantherefore mask the latter {{for a wide range}} of conditions. However, a problem inherent to the design of these machines istheir proclivity to pure tone generation, because of theenhanced difficulty of avoiding structural resonances in themechanical parts. Pure tones are deemed highly annoying and areseverely regulated by most noise policies. In relation to thisproblem, the vibration transmission of structure-borne sound tothe tower of the turbine is investigated, in particular whenthe tower is stiffened at its upper end. Furthermore, sincenoise annoyance due to wind turbine is mostly a masking issue,the wind-related sources of ambient noise are studied and theirmasking potentials assessed. With this aim, prediction modelsfor wind-induced vegetation noise and pseudo-noise have beendeveloped. Finally, closely related to the effect of masking,is the difficulty, regularly encountered by local authoritiesand wind farm developers, to measure noise immission from <b>windturbines.</b> A new measurement technique has thus been developedin the course of this work. Through improving thesignal-to-noise ratio between wind turbine noise and ambientnoise, the new technique yields more accurate measurementresults.

40|$|Abstract. History of the {{development}} of DAWT’s stretches a period of more than 50 years. So far without any commercial success. In the initial years of development the conversion process was not understood very well. Experimentalists strived at maximising the pressure drop over the rotor disk, but lacked theoretical insight into optimising the performance. Increasing the diffuser area as well as the negative back pressure at the diffuser exit was found profitable in the experiments. Claims were made that performance augmentations with a factor of 4 or more were feasible, but these claims were not confirmed experimentally. With a simple momentum theory, developed along the lines of momentum theory for bare <b>windturbines,</b> it was shown that power augmentation is proportional to the mass flow increase generated at the nozzle of the DAWT. Such mass flow augmentation can be achieved through two basic principles: increase in the diffuser exit ratio and/or by decreasing the negative back pressure at the exit. The theory predicts an optimal pressure drop of 8 / 9 equal to the pressure drop for bare <b>windturbines</b> independent from the mass flow augmentation obtained. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted per unit of volume with a DAWT is also the same as for a bare wind turbine. Performance predictions with this theory show good agreement with a CF...|$|R
40|$|ISSN 0360 - 5442 International audienceThe {{objectives}} {{of this work}} have been to design and analyze a discrete Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller which contributes to the primaryfrequencycontrol of the grid and to {{the reduction of the}} drive-train fatigueloads of a <b>WindTurbine</b> (WT). The WT rotational speed and electrical power are controlled using the generator torque and the pitch angle as control variables. The rotational speed and electrical power references are generated in a higher control level depending on the wind speed and a frequency droop. The controller has been designed in Matlab® and has been simulated in Simulink®, in some linear simulation models corresponding to different operating points. These linear models have been obtained from a 5 MW WT model implemented in the commercial <b>windturbine</b> simulation tool Bladed.
