5|$|From 1915, Summer Hill {{was served}} by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road {{and went down}} Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street. They turned onto Lackey Street, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> right and {{terminated}} at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Georgetown's Floyd and North Carolina's Worthy also drew some {{attention from the}} media. The two players grew up in Gastonia, North Carolina together, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> to the same church and competed in high school against each other. Worthy commented that his family lives around two to three miles away from Floyd's. It was noted that the two would likely not interact much while playing as they did not play the same position.|$|E
5|$|Prior to her {{relationship}} with Anderson, Jovovich married on-screen boyfriend Shawn Andrews in 1992 while filming Dazed and Confused together. Andrews was 21, while Jovovich was 16; the marriage was annulled by her mother two months later. Shortly after the annulment, Jovovich moved to Europe with her friend and musician Chris Brenner where she met and then lived with her new boyfriend, ex-Jamiroquai bassist Stuart Zender, in London from May 1994 to October 1995. From 1995 to 1997, she dated photographer Mario Sorrenti. In Las Vegas, she married The Fifth Element director Luc Besson in 1997 <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> skydiving directly after the ceremony; they divorced in 1999. Between 1998 and 2001, she befriended the young poet and musician, Anno Birkin, and each was the other's inspiration behind many of their compositions. Jovovich became involved with Birkin romantically just {{before his death in}} a car accident on November 8, 2001.|$|E

They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on Árbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president {{did not wish to}} renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such gesture would have marked the end of his political career. Árbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA-orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960. A close friend of Árbenz, Carlos Manuel Pellecer, {{turned out to be a}} spy working for the CIA.|$|E
5|$|In the 197778 season Villa {{reached the}} quarter-final of the UEFA Cup <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> out 43 on {{aggregate}} against Barcelona. In the domestic league, however, they struggled and Saunders started rebuilding the team. As Saunders began restructuring his {{team in the}} summer of 1979, there were more changes in the boardroom. Doug Ellis set a resolution to have several directors removed from the board. The resolution was not successful and as a result, Ellis resigned from the board. Meanwhile, Saunders brought in several new players who were to become some of Villa's most prolific players in terms of goals and appearances. Allan Evans, Ken McNaught and Kenny Swain were brought into the defence and Des Bremner was brought into the midfield to play alongside Dennis Mortimer and Gordon Cowans. Tony Morley and Gary Shaw were the new strike partnership. When Peter Withe was signed from Newcastle United {{in the summer of}} 1980, Saunders had built a team that was to see much success in the next few years.|$|E

25|$|Sweeney {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list {{for the first time in}} his career on July 26, 2002 (retroactive to July 14) with a lower back and hip strain.

25|$|Due to the {{strongly}} British connotations {{attached to}} the name, Genoa were forced to change it by the fascist government to Genova 1893 Circolo del Calcio in 1928. The club competed in a proto-European Cup {{in the form of}} the Mitropa Cup, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> out in the quarter-finals after losing heavily to Rapid Vienna. They followed this with a runners-up position back at home in the league, they finished behind Ambrosiana in the 1929–30 season; this would be their last top level championship runners-up spot to date.|$|E
25|$|In 2007–08 Everton again broke their {{transfer}} {{record with}} {{the signing of}} Yakubu for £11.25 million from Middlesbrough. The club reached the group stage of the UEFA Cup, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> on to win all of their games, including against the eventual winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Having successfully negotiated the next round, Everton were knocked out in the last 16 by Fiorentina on penalties. In the Carling Cup, Everton reached the semi-final {{for the first time}} in 20 years, losing to Chelsea. Everton spent much of the season in the top four of the league, but were eventually overtaken by Liverpool and finished fifth, again qualifying for the UEFA Cup.|$|E
25|$|After the {{formation}} of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923, and after comparative trials against locomotives of the constituent companies, the Midland compound was deemed the best and adopted in a slightly modified version, the LMS Compound 4-4-0, from 1925 to 1932 as the LMS standard class 4 express locomotive reaching a final total of 245 locomotives. The LMS locomotives were not universally appreciated especially on the old LNWR section <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> hand in hand with operating methods imposed by the Midland Railway constituent but in Scotland they were received as the solution to serious endemic express locomotive problems and were generally well liked.|$|E

Thousands upon thousands of men, women, and children were treated - from Kings, Sultans, and Sheikhs to the least of the common people (Bedouin, farmers, and laborers). Beth and Wells retired to Stinson Lake, New Hampshire and Flint, Michigan in 1970.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{arrived in}} the 1520s. The first Spaniard to arrive here {{is said to have}} been Gonzalo de Umbria, sent by Hernán Cortés to explore the area to see if there was any gold. The conquest caused the native peoples to mostly abandon the area, and it is not known <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> Those left to provide tribute were known in the Mexican {{highlands}} for their cotton shawls and decorated conch shells. The oldest document with Zihuatanejo’s name is called the Matricula de Tributos (Record of Tribute). Today the local dialect has been lost and the only trace of the native population is a small archaeological site that was explored by INAH in the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the Notrim {{became part}} of the Jewish Brigade, where it grew and became more known among the Palestinian Jewish public. Many new {{recruits}} joined the organization, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> through a filtering process where it was decided what unit they were to be placed in. In 1944, an order was given by the Haganah to create its own military police in the Jewish Brigade, and the task was given to a captain therein, named Daniel Lifshitz (later Danny Magen). Lifshitz and three sergeants from the brigade who served at a base near Cairo, Egypt were the initial nucleus of the organization, and recruited soldiers mainly from within the brigade itself.|$|E

25|$|The Cubs {{rebuilt the}} {{starting}} pitching staff {{through a series}} of trades by Dallas Green after a disappointing 1983 season <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> 71-91. Green had been brought to the Cubs by the Tribune company which purchased the team in 1981. Before the season started, Green dealt Carmelo Martínez, Craig Lefferts, and Fritzie Connally to acquire right-hander Scott Sanderson. On May 25, the Cubs traded Bill Buckner to the Boston Red Sox for righty Dennis Eckersley and Mike Brumley. Finally on June 13, Mel Hall, Joe Carter, Don Schulze, and Darryl Banks were sent to the Cleveland Indians for starter Rick Sutcliffe, George Frazier, and Ron Hassey. The acquisition of these three starters solidified the rotation for the year.|$|E
25|$|Joshua {{secretly}} dispatched two spies from Shittim, instructing them to {{view the}} land and Jericho, {{and they went to}} the house of a harlot named Rahab. That night, the king of Jericho received word that Israelite men had come to search out the land, and the king sent a demand to Rahab to deliver the men who had come to her house. But Rahab hid the men among stalks of flax on her roof, saying that when it was dark the men had left, and she did not know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> The king's men left the city in pursuit of the spies {{on the road to the}} Jordan River, and the people of the city shut the city gate after them.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1876, Jesse and Frank James {{surfaced}} in the Nashville, Tennessee, area, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> by the names of Thomas Howard and B.J. Woodson, respectively. Frank seemed to settle down, but Jesse remained restless. He recruited a new gang in 1879 and returned to crime, holding up a train at Glendale, Missouri (now part of Independence), on October 8, 1879. The robbery {{was the first in}} a spree of crimes, including the hold-up of the federal paymaster of a canal project in Killen, Alabama, and two more train robberies. But the new gang was not made up of battle-hardened guerrillas; they soon turned against each other or were captured. James grew suspicious of other members; he scared away one man and some believe that he killed another gang member.|$|E
