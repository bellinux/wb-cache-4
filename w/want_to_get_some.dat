6000|$|... "One {{man is a}} plain {{honest man}} with no hunker-sliding about him. He goes in to {{represent}} the labour classes. This fellow you're working for only <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> job or other." ...|$|R

He uses his robotic {{counterpart}} (Robot-Jerry) to enter the room and fetch him some cheese. The robot mouse goes in the room, taking a pile of cheese before leaving.|$|R
50|$|The film {{is about}} a solitary Eurasian badger who just <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep.

6000|$|... "Where's Betts? I haven't {{seen her}} this morning. I am {{going over to}} Short Creek to-morrow or next day, and think I'll take her with me. You know I am to get a {{commission}} to lay out several settlements along the river, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> work finished at Short Creek this spring. Mrs. Raymer'll be delighted to have Betty. Shall I take her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I s'pose Mara <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> {{advice about}} makin' up her weddin' things," [...] said Miss Ruey, {{with a sort}} of humble quiver, as Miss Roxy began ripping and tearing {{fiercely}} at her old straw bonnet, as if she really purposed its utter and immediate demolition.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} her restaurant attracted local politicians {{as well as}} athletes, businessmen and reporters. Political reporter Rosemary James noted that she [...] "would not have missed a Friday before a major election at Ruth's Chris Steak House. That {{was the place to}} be if you <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> scoops." [...] Local celebrities like Fats Domino were regulars.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I fancy {{we are all}} {{feeling about}} the same except the Professor, and even he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> powder for his beetle. I had a moment's talk with Craig this morning, and from what he says I fancy they mean {{to make a move}} a little further in before long. It'll be all the more {{difficult}} to escape then." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{decided to}} take that line for the present. I made a few vague affirmatives. [...] "I want help," [...] I said hoarsely. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> stuff up the beach--stuff I can't very well leave about." [...] I became aware of three other pleasant-looking young men with towels, blazers, and straw hats, coming down the sands towards me. Evidently the early bathing section of this Littlestone.|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be nice. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> books, and Rita {{has been}} very anxious about one of her dolls, which she is sure {{was left in the}} nursery closet. If we are going to stop we ought to be turning back, Pat, for it is {{beginning}} to snow and will be dark early," [...] answered Gwen, suddenly realizing that great flakes were fast whitening the roads and the wind had risen to a gale.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure you're not," [...] he assented soothingly. [...] "Tell me--to-night I am {{a little}} tired of work. I thought of going out. Be a Good Samaritan and tell me where to find a {{restaurant}} in Broadway, somewhere where crowds of people go but not {{what they call a}} fashionable place. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> dinner--I haven't had anything decent to eat for I don't know how long--and I want to breathe the same atmosphere as other people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{suppose that}} it will take us a couple of days to unload. Master is going as usual to hire a couple of men <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the line out, so I shall be over here by breakfast. He says that I may as well do a job of digging in the garden, as he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> things in before we get frosty nights. Have you any message for him, missis?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear Lady Deringham," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have told}} you the exact truth. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> {{statistics}} for my paper. Mr. C. himself recommended me {{to try and get}} them from your husband; that is absolutely all. As for this attempted robbery of which you were telling me, believe me when I assure you that I know nothing whatever about it. Your son's interest is, after all, only natural. The study of the papers on which your husband has been engaged is the only reasonable test of his sanity. Frankly, I cannot believe that any one in Lord Deringham's mental state could produce any work likely to be of the slightest permanent value." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You make me tired! A nice lot of gazabas you are! If {{you talked}} less with yer mouth and did {{something}} with yer hands, he’d a-ben done with by now. Why couldn’t one of you, {{just one of}} you, get me a knife when I sung out? You make me sick! A-beefin’ and bellerin’ ’round, as though he’d kill you when he gets you! You know damn well he wont. Can’t afford to. No shipping masters or beach-combers over here, and he wants yer in his business, and he wants yer bad. Who’s to pull or steer or sail ship if he loses yer? It’s me and Johnson {{have to face the}} music. Get into yer bunks, now, and shut yer faces; I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sleep.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Everything in {{this monster}} city {{interests}} me, and I cannot keep from talking, {{even at the}} risk of being instructive. People here seem always to express distances by parables. To a stranger it is just a little confusing to be so parabolic--so to speak. I collar a citizen, and I think I am going to get some valuable information out of him. I ask him how far it is to Birmingham, and he says it is twenty-one shillings and sixpence. Now we know that doesn't help a man who is trying to learn. I find myself down-town somewhere, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> sort of idea where I am--being usually lost when alone--and I stop a citizen and say: [...] "How far is it to Charing Cross?" [...] "Shilling fare in a cab," [...] and off he goes. I suppose if I were to ask a Londoner how far it, is from the sublime to the ridiculous, he would try to express it in coin. But I am trespassing upon your time with these geological statistics and historical reflections. I will not longer keep you from your orgies. 'Tis a real pleasure for me to be here, and I thank you for it. The name of the Savage Club is associated in my mind with the kindly interest and the friendly offices which you lavished upon an old friend of mine who came among you a stranger, and you opened your English hearts to him and gave him welcome and a home--Artemus Ward. Asking that you will join me, I give you his memory.|$|E

50|$|Sir Daniel {{begins his}} {{examination}} convinced of her story, only <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> final detail. A slip {{of the tongue}} by Mrs. Dane (when she says “We had governesses”) reveals the presence of a cousin she has tried to conceal. This sets Sir Daniel on the right track and he follows up skillfully and mercilessly, finally drawing the confession out of her that she is indeed Felicia Hindermarsh and has taken her late cousin's identity.|$|R

5000|$|When {{it became}} clear to them that the Commission had omitted crucial {{information}} from its report, the widows called for a new independent panel. [...] "I'm very disturbed, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> answers," [...] said Breitweiser. [...] "I {{want to know what the}} truth is." [...] She called the 2004 findings [...] "an utterly hollow report." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{was getting}} disillusioned {{with the way}} we were doing business. It was getting harder and harder to survive - those tours where you'd come home with no money, that was getting less cool. Laughs. I didn't just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> temp job to survive and go on tour anymore. I wanted to play the drums; I wanted to play music and make a living off of it. And I thought I could. And we all could. I wanted some changes and Speedo and I were kind of at odds on that stuff; we {{disagreed}} on how we should go about it.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{contains}} four parts covering {{interviews with}} traders {{in a wide}} range of markets. The interviews contain a mixture of facts about the trading careers of the interviewees, their philosophy, and many trading anecdotes. After each of the interviews, Schwager summarises what he believes are the key things to be learned from that particular trader. The book also contains a fifth part on the psychology of trading and two appendices on program trading and basic options theory. If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> insights, by way of verbatim interviews, into the thought processes and trading rules.|$|E

5000|$|During {{her years}} with the Triangle studios, Williams had become known for her many gowns, and the phrase [...] "forty famous frocks" [...] was coined to {{describe}} her wardrobe. When Williams left Triangle for Paralta, the Los Angeles Times asked whether the famous frocks would move with her. It reported, [...] "Clara {{is now in a}} quandary. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> more frocks, but if she does it will spoil the phrase 'forty famous frocks,' and that would never do." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 Go-Kustom Rekords began reissuing the Kill Switch...Klick back catalog {{including}} ALT., deGenerate and Almost Ambient Collection Volume One {{as well as}} the edgy collection Mechanoid Collection. Says Sebasstian about Mechanoid Collection, [...] "Most of {{the disc}} is older material repackaged yet again- but released more for strategic reasons than anything else. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of my favorite songs on a single collection on my own label and quickly up on iTunes. Mechanoid was the vehicle to do this." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 1 July 2008, it was {{confirmed}} that Tottenham Hotspur had accepted {{a bid for}} Martin from Blackpool and that the player was discussing personal terms. On 2 July, he signed a two-year contract with an option for a further year with Blackpool for an undisclosed fee. [...] "Spurs offered me a new deal, but I wasn't really too keen on staying there. The first-team opportunities at White Hart Lane are limited and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> experience and play regularly in the first team, so {{it was a bit of}} a no-brainer for me." [...] Blackpool manager Simon Grayson added: [...] "I think Joe looked at the situation and probably realised he wasn't going to be a first-team player there and the next best thing after that is Championship football. We are delighted to have got him and he's delighted to be here." ...|$|E
5000|$|The game drew {{inspiration}} from the 1997 Bushido Blade developed by Bergsala Lightweight, another 3D weapons-based fighting game that utilizes a more realistic approach to combat. Prithvi felt that the game would fare better if it worked for both casual and advanced players, that the game was [...] "designed for easy pick up and play to appeal to casual gamers who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> quick carnage. The counter, guard break and parrying systems are there for the advanced players to master as well". As a result, the warriors were continuously tested against AI and human players {{in order to achieve}} proper balancing between warriors. Despite the violence, the developers wanted to keep it realistic with the combat, where even though players can perform executions, they did not want it to be similar to Mortal Kombat where fatalities were considered fanatical and exaggerated. The game features motion capture by the various martial artists who appear on the television series.|$|E
5000|$|She went on {{to criticize}} Rousey's {{stand-up}} fighting technique and challenging her to a boxing match, stating that [...] "a boxing point of view, {{she looked like a}} rookie amateur fighter, throwing very wide punches with no coordination. I heard that Cyborg is not willing to come down to the lightweight division to fight Ronda, but I can go up to 135, and we can settle a boxing match so I can prove her trainer wrong. I once went up to the lightweight division, and traveled to Argentina for a world title fight. At the end, the results was that I became the first ever Puerto Rican female boxer to captured a world title in two weight classes". Serrano's trainer noted that they [...] "do not challenge other fighting styles." [...] And that the reason for calling out Rousey was because they [...] "represent boxing and ... <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> respect." [...] by showing [...] "Edmond Tarverdyan how wrong he is about boxing".|$|E
60|$|Istra {{had gone}} up to her room to sleep, bidding Mr. Wrenn do {{likewise}} and avoid the wrong bunch at the Caravanserai; for besides the wrong bunch of Interesting People there were, she explained, a right bunch, of working artists. But he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> new clothes, <b>to</b> replace his rain-wrinkled ready-mades. He was tottering through the common room, wondering whether he could find a clothing-shop in Aengusmere, when a shrill gurgle from a wing-chair by the rough-brick fireplace halted him.|$|R
5000|$|He wrote plays, pamphlets, {{and novels}} and {{published}} prodigiously. Mercier often recycled passages from one work {{to another and}} expanded on essays he had already written. Mercier's keen observations on his surroundings and the journalistic feel of his writing meant that his work remained riveting despite {{the nature of its}} composition. [...] "There is no better writer to consult," [...] Robert Darnton writes, [...] "if one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> idea of how Paris looked, sounded, smelled, and felt {{on the eve of the}} Revolution." ...|$|R
5000|$|An {{investigation}} by the FBI resulted in {{the conclusion that the}} money in Wilson's suitcase had been a contribution by Hugo Chávez to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner's 2007 presidential election campaign. She called this claim “garbage.” Other theories proposed in the media were that the money was intended for pro-Chávez groups in Argentina, was “a kickback to Argentine government officials for a business deal,” was “a bribe for ENARSA,” or that “some renegade PDVSA officials <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> cash out of the party, creating personal reserves for a foreseeable end of the Venezuelan bonanza.” ...|$|R
