40|$|The {{transition}} to three-dimensional and unsteady flow in an annulus with a discrete heat source {{on the inner}} cylinder is studied numerically. For large applied heat flux through the heater (large Grashof number Gr), {{there is a strong}} wall plume originating at the heater that reaches the top and forms a large scale axisymmetric <b>wavy</b> <b>structure</b> along the top. For Gr approximate to 6 x 109, this <b>wavy</b> <b>structure</b> becomes unstable to three-dimensional instabilities with high azimuthal wavenumbers m similar to 30, influenced by mode competition within an Eckhaus band of wavenumbers. Coexisting with some of these steady three-dimensional states, solution branches with localized defects break parity and result in spatio-temporal dynamics. We have identified two such time dependent states. One is a limit cycle that while breaking spatial parity, retains spatio-temporal parity. The other branch corresponds to quasi-periodic states that have globally broken parity. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|Some {{examples}} from the Atmosphere Explorer E data showing plasma bubble development from wavy ion density structures in the bottomside F layer are described. The <b>wavy</b> <b>structures</b> mostly had east-west wavelengths of 150 - 800 km, in one example it was about 3000 km. The ionization troughs in the <b>wavy</b> <b>structures</b> later broke up into either a multiple-bubble patch or a single bubble, depending upon whether, in the precursor wavy structure, shorter wavelengths were superimposed on the larger scale wavelengths. In the multiple bubble patches, intrabubble spacings vaned from 55 km to 140 km. In a fully developed equatorial spread F case, east-west wavelengths from 690 km down to about 0. 5 km were present simultaneously. The spacings between bubble patches or between bubbles in a patch appear {{to be determined by}} the wavelengths present in the precursor wave structure. In some cases, deeper bubbles developed on the western edge of a bubble patch, suggesting an east-west asymmetry. Simultaneous horizontal neutral wind measurements showed wavelike perturbations that were closely associated with perturbations in the plasma horizontal drift velocity. We argue that the wave structures observed here that served as the initial seed ion density perturbations were caused by gravity waves, strengthening the view that gravity waves seed equatorial spread F irregularities...|$|E

After {{a large number}} of pulses, modification of the stainless-steel surface was observed, such as the formation of a <b>wavy</b> <b>structure,</b> irregular roughness, and cracks on the target surface. X-ray and optic microscopic analyses of targets revealed changes in the orientation and dimensions of crystallites (grains) over a depth of up to 20 μm for 316 L(N) -IG stainless steel after 200 pulses and up to 40 μm for 12 Cr 18 Ni 10 Ti stainless steel after 50 pulses, which is significantly larger than the depth of the layer melted in one pulse (∼ 10 μm). In a series of 200 tests of ITER-grade 316 L(N) -IG ITER stainless steel, a linear increase in the height of irregularity (roughness) with increasing number of pulses at a rate of up to ∼ 1 μm per pulse was observed. No alteration in the chemical composition of the stainless-steel surface in the series of tests was revealed. A model is developed that describes the formation of wavy irregularities on the melted metal surface with allowance for the nonlinear stage of instability of the melted layer with a vapor/plasma flow above it. A decisive factor in this case is the viscous flow of the melted metal from the troughs to tops of the <b>wavy</b> <b>structure.</b> The model predicts saturation of the growth of the <b>wavy</b> <b>structure</b> when its amplitude becomes comparable with its wavelength. Approaches to describing the observed stochastic relief and roughness of the stainless-steel surface formed in the series of tests are considered.

Vector-by-vector scanning MSL has a potential to create true 3 D micro-devices {{as compared to}} mostly planar (2 D- 21 / 2 D) devices fabricated by conventional MEMS techniques. Previous literature shows two different scanning methods :(1) Galvanomirror scanning, (2) Photoreactor tank scanning.

30|$|As for item (d), omega bands have a {{systematic}} and relatively stable ionospheric equivalent current system, {{which is caused}} by the large-scale <b>wavy</b> <b>structure</b> along the east-west direction. The ionospheric current shows a CCW rotation around the torch, corresponding to the upward FAC and negative potential, and a CW rotation around the dark region (i.e., inside the inverted capital Greek letter omega (Ω)), corresponding to the downward FAC and positive potential (Opgenoorth et al. 1983; Buchert et al. 1988; Wild et al. 2000; Amm et al. 2005; Vanhamäki et al. 2009). On the other hand, the ionospheric equivalent current of the EEASs indicates a quite dynamic behavior. It showed a CCW rotation around the auroral vortex structure at 00 : 16 : 20 UT for the second event (Fig.  5 b), which corresponds to the structure of the inverted letter Ω of the omega bands; namely, the direction of the rotation is opposite to that of the omega bands. It is expected from the CCW rotation that the upward FAC and negative potential existed inside the auroral vortex, although they depend on the distribution of the ionospheric conductivity. However, for the case of the third event at 00 : 33 : 10 UT (Fig.  5 c), the CCW rotation in the ionospheric current can be seen {{at the front of the}} surge. The difference in the ionospheric equivalent current of the EEAS from the omega bands (and from case to case) may be attributed to a large temporal variation in the surge structure, in contrast to the stable, well-defined <b>wavy</b> <b>structure</b> of omega bands; such a large temporal variation in the surge yields a variation in spatial distribution of the FACs and non-uniform ionospheric conductivity, which causes a deformation of the ionospheric current pattern.|$|R

The resistance increased by a factor of only 4. 8 compared to the initial value when 59 % strain was applied. The high performance of the O 2 -plasma-treated sample is attributed to the initial formation of large periodic <b>wavy</b> <b>structures</b> without cracks, which effectively release the external strain under the stretched condition. In addition, the sample showed a stable operation with no variation in the resistance under prolonged and cyclic strains of 20 % for 500 cycles.
