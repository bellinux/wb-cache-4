40|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are {{frequently}} used in various endourologic procedures {{to access the}} upper as well as lower urinary tract. Flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> have lesser complication rate of tissue injury as compared to stiff <b>guide</b> <b>wires.</b> Flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> are however more prone to bending and kinking due to their mechanical properties. We report an unusual complication of knotting of flexible <b>guide</b> <b>wires</b> during endourologic procedure and the trick to remedy this problem. We have also discussed the structural design and mechanical properties of commonly used <b>guide</b> <b>wires...</b>|$|R
50|$|This gap {{formation}} is additionally influenced during the winding-up {{of the wire}} by the surface quality of its coating, e.g. the sliding behavior {{as well as by}} the expansion behavior or stiffness of the copper. The wire elongation may be between 6% and 3% depending on the wire diameter and the supplier. Practice has shown that an orthocyclic winding can only be manufactured in an acceptable way when choosing a very high wire elongation level (stretching leads to a straight or even wire) at the beginning. For the reasons described above, it is therefore in practice impossible for the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> to determine a precise gradient according to the wire diameter.|$|E
50|$|A precise {{synchronization}} of {{the rotary}} motion with the stroke movement is required {{so that the}} needle does not touch the groove channel during {{the up and down}} movement. Influencing variables for the maximum winding speed are the needle stroke, the rotation angle of the stator (number of poles), the wire diameter and the groove channel width and the helix angle of the angularly grooved stators. The mass of the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> and the needle support experience a high acceleration. This can lead to unwanted vibrations that {{have an effect on the}} winding quality. The lifting motion is normally generated by ball screws. During this movement, the servo drives must constantly reverse in order to reverse the direction of the needle movement.|$|E
50|$|Even if {{the demands}} for low {{tolerances}} of the wire and the winding space had to be observed with correspondingly high technical effort, there would still remain the problem that the wire guiding on the machine side has to follow the previously described winding design also at high winding speeds. In practice, this is hardly possible at high winding speeds since, e.g., at 18.000 windings per minute, the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> for a wire with a thickness of 0.3 mm would need to perform a winding pitch in only 0.7 ms. The problem is amplified {{by the fact that}} in practice the ideal wire is never absolutely straight. These unevennesses and bends resulting from the winding of the wire on delivery rolls have the effect that the wires are never completely close together according to their actual diameter but at a distance according to their unevenness.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{from the}} second layer, the {{relocation}} is facilitated, since the wire is guided through the inter-spaces of the preceding layer. In case of deflections that are not too excessive {{as far as the}} process is concerned, the wire leads itself and with a constant number of windings per layer. It means for the wire guiding movement that the smaller the distance of the wire guiding nozzle towards the coil, the more precise the tracking must be. In certain circumstances it can be completely performed without a relocating movement, if the distance from the nozzle to the coil is that long that the force component against the guiding behavior of the wire itself has no longer an effect. Due to the self-guiding behavior of the wire, it is therefore possible that also during orthocyclic winding the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> can run continually and does not need to follow gradually.|$|E
50|$|These {{unpredictable}} circumstances may {{be prevented}} or counteracted {{at the beginning}} of the winding by forcing the wire, meaning, every single winding of the first layer on the inner coil diameter, into a predefined position. The wire places itself into a prefabricated groove geometry of the coil body and the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> does not need to follow it exactly but only approximately. Since the wire always loses in cross-sectional area due to the wire drawing to be used and the necessary deflections (mechanical stresses under tensile load) during winding, the distance between the grooves is designed only for the max. possible wire diameter. Effects of bends and tolerances of the wire and the coil body as well as changing surface qualities can be avoided that way. Especially wire bends that develop due to wire deflections caused by, e.g., pulleys, wire eyelets or even the wire guiding nozzle itself within the wire feeder of a winding machine can lead to deformations that remain on the winding of a coil. Applying grooves to the winding basis supports the layer-accurate position of the wire during the winding process. This behavior isparticularly beneficial for the winding processes where a plastic deformation of the wire is unavoidable immediately before the depositing of the wire onto the winding basis. This behavior can be observed especially in the needle winding technology. Due to physical reasons, it is unavoidable that the wire leaves the wire guiding nozzle at an angle of approx. 90°. Therefore, mechanical tensions remain inside the wire that are visible in the form of a bent winding on the winding basis. As a result, the following windings or also the following layers can change in their desired position.|$|E

50|$|<b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are {{an example}} of an {{application}} for biomedical coatings. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are used in coronary angioplasty to correct the effects of coronary artery disease, a disease that allows plaque build up {{on the walls of the}} arteries.

The <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> <b>guides</b> the balloon catheter to the obstruction where the catheter is inflated to press the plaque against the arterial walls. <b>Guide</b> <b>wires</b> are commonly made from stainless steel or Nitinol and require polymer coatings as a surface modification to reduce friction in the arteries. The coating of the <b>guide</b> <b>wire</b> can affect the trackability, or the ability of the wire to move through the artery without kinking, the tactile feel, or the ability of the doctor to feel the <b>guide</b> <b>wire's</b> movements, and the thrombogenicity of the wire.|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} left main {{bronchus}} intubation was developed {{based on a}} wire guide-based microscopic endotrachael mouse intubation technique. The authors used a 22 G x 1 inch catheter elongated by a 38 -mm silicone tube, and a <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> with a tag to assign {{the length of the}} wire completely covered by the silicon tube. The isoflurane-anesthetized mouse was hung perpendicularly with its incisors on a thread and transorally intubated under strict vision with the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> tip advanced 3 mm out of the catheter. Then the catheter was advanced about 6 to 8 mm into the trachea. Afterwards the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> was redrawn {{to the level of the}} catheter tip (blue tag on the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> appeared at the upper end of catheter) to prevent injury. Then the neck was pushed into a right lateral flexion with one finger against a foam block fixed on the vertical plate, causing a straight distance between mouth and left main bronchus. This positioning allows to gently advance the catheter into the left main bronchus by another about 20 mm, using the <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> with its tip just within the tube, to achieve there a wedge position with gentle pressure. The technique had a success rate of more than 80 % in 81 mice weighing 23 to 48 g. It may be of interest for unilateral lung intervention, e. g., with injurious substances or with drugs...|$|E
40|$|Tubal {{catheterization}} {{procedures have}} become {{standard of care}} as a primary treatment of proximal tubal occlusions. They successfully utilize a variety of catheter techniques, though all usually include a <b>wire</b> <b>guide.</b> This raises the question whether guide wire catheterizations alone {{can be used to}} treat proximal tubal occlusions. We therefore investigated consecutively 25 women with at least one proximally occluded oviduct by attempting <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulations bilaterally in 10 and unilaterally in 12 women with two tubes and in three women with a single tube. Among the 10 patients with bilateral occlusion, seven were recanalized bilaterally (70 %), one unilaterally (10 %) and two not at all (20 %). Among the 15 patients with unilateral tubal occlusion, 12 (80 %) were recanalized. In total, 27 out of 35 (77 %) obstructed oviducts were recanalized. In a follow-up period of 5 - 17 months only one pregnancy was, however, recorded and this was a tubal pregnancy. We conclude that <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulation of proximally obstructed tubes achieves tubal patency in a large percentage of cases, comparable to other catheter techniques reported in the literature. In contrast to those, however, <b>wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulations alone result in much lower pregnancy rates. This observation strongly suggests that wire guides, used with co-axial and balloon catheter systems, are not responsible for the pregnancy success reported for these procedures. <b>Wire</b> <b>guide</b> cannulation alone does not therefore represent adequate treatment for patients with proximally occluded Fallopian tubes.

50|$|Due to the {{separation}} between <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> and rotation of the component to be wound, the configuration of product and <b>wire</b> <b>guiding</b> can be duplicated in the linear winding technology.

40|$|AbstractEDM is {{a useful}} method for {{machining}} hard materials. Particularly, ED-milling using a simple bar or pipe electrode is an attractive method to machine 3 D cavities. However, {{it is difficult to}} suppress the electrode wear completely. On the other hand, in cases of WEDM and WEDG it is usually not necessary to consider the electrode wear.
