6000|$|Passing onward we {{find the}} {{explanation}} of a distinct type of colour or marking, often superimposed upon protective tints, {{in the importance of}} easy recognition by many animals of their fellows, their parents, or their mates. By this need {{we have been able to}} account for markings that seem calculated to make the animal conspicuous, when the general tints and well-known habits of the whole group demonstrate the need of concealment. Thus also we are able to explain the constant symmetry in the markings of wild animals, as well as the numerous cases in which the conspicuous colours are concealed when at rest and only become visible during rapid motion. In striking contrast to ordinary protective coloration we have [...] "warning colours," [...] usually very conspicuous and often brilliant or gaudy, which serve to indicate that their possessors are either dangerous or uneatable to the usual enemies of their tribe. This kind of coloration is probably more prevalent than has been hitherto supposed, because in the case of many tropical animals we are quite unacquainted with their special and most dangerous enemies, and are also unable to determine whether they are or are not distasteful to those enemies. As a kind of corollary to the [...] "warning colours," [...] {{we find the}} extraordinary phenomena of [...] "mimicry," [...] in which defenceless species obtain protection by being mistaken for those which, from any cause, possess immunity from attack. Although a large number of instances of <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> and of mimicry are now recorded, it is probably still an almost unworked field of research, more especially in tropical regions and among the inhabitants of the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Mimicry {{is one of}} the best-studied {{examples}} of adaptation, and recent studies have provided new insights into the role of mimicry in speciation and diversification. Classical Müllerian mimicry theory predicts convergence in warning signal among protected species, yet tropical butterflies are exuberantly diverse in <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> patterns, even within communities. We tested the hypothesis that microhabitat partitioning in aposematic butterflies and insectivorous birds can lead to selection for different colour patterns in different microhabitats and thus help maintain mimicry diversity. We measured distribution across flight height and topography for 64 species of clearwing butterflies (Ithomiini) and their co-mimics, and 127 species of insectivorous birds, in an Amazon rainforest community. For the majority of bird species, estimated encounter rates were non-random for the two most abundant mimicry rings. Furthermore, most butterfly species in these two mimicry rings displayed the <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> pattern predicted to be optimal for anti-predator defence in their preferred microhabitats. These conclusions were supported by a field trial using butterfly specimens, which showed significantly different predation rates on colour patterns in two microhabitats. We therefore provide the first direct evidence to support the hypothesis that different mimicry patterns can represent stable, community-level adaptations to differing biotic environments.

40|$|Aposematic organisms avoid {{predation}} by advertising defences with warning signals. The {{theory of}} aposematism predicts warning signal uniformity, yet variation in warning coloration is widespread. The chemically defended wood tiger moth Arctia plantaginis shows both geographic variation and local polymorphism in warning coloration. In this thesis, I studied whether predation by local avian predators {{is driving the}} evolution of wood tiger moth warning colours. The close relatives of the wood tiger moth designated here to genus Arctia do not show similar colour polymorphism. The wood tiger moth is thus apparently under evolutionary radiation and provides a natural laboratory for observing current selection and studying the mechanisms leading to population divergence. We found evidence of positive frequency-dependent selection as predicted by aposematic theory, but the direction and strength of selection varied geographically. Variation in predator behaviour and the quality and abundance of alternative prey affected selection on wood tiger moth <b>warning</b> <b>colour.</b> Experiments with wild-caught blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) and great tits (Parus major) indicate, that colour is of foremost importance in prey discrimination and avoidance generalization. Birds did not generalize their learned avoidance among morphs, but could generalize between vaguely similar prey species showing similar warning colours. I conclude, that a) the evolution of wood tiger moth warning coloration is driven by predation of local avian predators, b) the direction of selection is affected by variation in predator and prey qualities at different levels (from individuals to communities), which {{can contribute to the}} maintenance of polymorphism, and that c) the strength of selection can vary spatially and temporally, and be counterbalanced or overruled by other evolutionary processes, promoting variation in <b>warning</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|E
40|$|Conspicuous warning {{coloration}} {{helps to}} protect prey because it signals to potential predators that the prey is unprofitable. However, such signals only work once predators {{have come to}} associate the conspicuous colour with the unprofitability of the prey. The evolution of warning coloration is {{generally considered to be}} paradoxical, because it has traditionally been assumed that the first brightly coloured individuals would be at an immediate selective disadvantage because of their greater conspicuousness to predators that are naïve to the meaning of the signal. As a result, it has been difficult to understand how a novel conspicuous colour morph could ever avoid rapid extinction, and instead survive and spread in the population until predators have become educated about the signal. In the present study, we experimentally simulated the appearance of a single novel coloured mutant in small populations (20 individuals) of palatable artificial pastry “prey”. The colour morph frequencies in each “generation” of prey (presented on successive days of a trial) were determined by the relative survival of the previous generation under predation by free-living birds. We found that the novel colour morphs regularly persisted and increased from a starting frequency of 1 / 20 to reach fixation (100 %), despite being fully palatable, even when the novel morph was much more conspicuous against the background than the familiar morph. This was true for both green (not normally considered a <b>warning</b> <b>colour)</b> and red (a classic <b>warning</b> <b>colour)</b> novel morphs. Novel colours reached fixation significantly faster than could be accounted for by random drift, indicating differential predation in relation to prey colour by the birds. Our experiments show that the immediate demise of a fully palatable new prey morph is not an inevitable outcome of predator behaviour, because even very conspicuous prey can gain protection from conservative foragers, simply by being novel...|$|E

40|$|Kin {{selection}} is often though {{to be important}} or even necessary {{for the evolution of}} warning coloration. Kin selection however has often been invoked erroneously, and has been confused with a second but distinct effect of family grouping-production of a local abundance of similar phenotypes-which may be important during the initial evolution of traits which have density-dependent benefit. Separate discussion is made of the evolution of warning coloration in an already distasteful species, and the joint evolution of warning coloration and distastefulness. In both cases warning coloration {{is considered to be a}} green beard altruism trait, and in the first case it is uncheatable.

40|$|In aposematism a prey species use bright colours, often {{combined}} with a black contrasting pattern, to signal unprofitability as prey to potential predators. Although there are several different hypotheses {{about the presence of}} these internally contrasting patterns, there is little experimental evidence of any beneficial effects. In this thesis I have used bird predators and artificial prey signals to investigate if the contrasting internal patterns in warning displays may have evolved to increase signal efficacy, especially regarding the speed of avoidance learning. In paper I the relative importance of colour and pattern in avoidance learning was studied. The conclusion was that birds primarily attend to colour, not pattern, when learning the discrimination, which was further supported by the results in paper II-IV, all suggesting a secondary role of patterns. In paper II I show that predators may to some degree use patterns for discrimination, if they convey important information about prey quality. The predators showed a hierarchical way of learning <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> components, where colour is learned to a higher degree than pattern. In paper III I investigate if internal contrasting patterns promote avoidance learning by increasing conspicuousness as prey-to-background contrast does. The study did not support this idea, as the presence of internal black patterns did not improve avoidance learning on a colour matching background. In paper IV, however, I show that the presence of many internal colour boundaries resulted in faster avoidance learning on a multi-coloured background, and predator generalization favoured more internal boundaries, while there was no effect of pattern regularity. From these studies I conclude that internal pattern contrasts may function to increase the efficacy of the <b>warning</b> <b>colour,</b> its salience, and as a means for aposematic prey to be discriminated from harmful mimics. However, the major finding is the importance of colour over pattern.

40|$|Aposematic insects use warning colours {{to deter}} predators, but many also produce odours or sounds when {{attacked}} by a predator. One possible role for these additional components is that they promote the association between the <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> and the non-profitability it signals, thus reducing the chance of future attacks from visually hunting predators. This experiment explicitly tests this idea {{by looking at the}} effects of sound on a visual discrimination task. Young domestic chicks were trained to look for food rewards under coloured paper cones scattered in an experimental arena. In a subsequent visual discrimination task, they learned to discriminate between rewarded and non-rewarded hats on the basis of colour. Half the chicks performed this task in silence, whilst the other half had a tone played when they attacked non-rewarded hats. The presence of the tone improved the speed of colour discrimination learning. This demonstrates {{that there could be a}} selective advantage for aposematic coloured insects to emit sounds when attacked, since avian predators will learn to avoid their coloration more quickly.

40|$|This PhD. thesis {{contributes}} to the investigation of aposematism - the phenomenon explaining the occurrence of warning colouration in nature. Aposematism is an antipredatory strategy usually based on predator learning to avoid a noxious prey with a conspicuous signal. However, not only particular aspects of aposematic prey signalling (<b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> pattern, conspicuousness, unpalatability), but also predator's psychology leading to avoidance behaviour {{is an important factor}} for explaining the evolution of aposematism. The differential species-specific response of our common passerine birds to living aposematic prey (the firebug) and corresponding underlying variation in predator's ecology requirements has been the starting point of this PhD. thesis. The next parts of the present thesis have been focused mainly on the species responding positively (innate biases, learning, memory etc.) to the warning signal of aposematic prey. We investigate the diversity of psychological processes leading to avoidance behaviour in these species. Firstly, we investigate if the avoidance behaviour is acquired by learning or if the prey is avoided on the basis of innate biases in several species of the family Paridae. We focused on the mode of avoidance learning and the durability of the acquired behaviour in the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} maintenance of colour polymorphism in the leaf beetle genus Oreina CHEVROLAT (Coleoptera; Chrysomelidae). The remarkable colour variation in this seemingly aposematic and chemically defended genus forms a paradox with current scientific views concerning predator learning and mimicry. Using a variety of approaches we explore the selective forces that influence the dynamic colour polymorphic equilibrium. On {{the basis of a}} literature review we argue that there isn’t just one selective force of overriding importance but a multitude of factors in a heterogeneous landscape producing a geographic mosaic of coevolution in space and time. Using a phylogenetic approach we analysed the genetic structure and habitat use of Oreina speciosissima populations from the Swiss Alps. Specimens grouped according to their habitat, which was in turn mostly defined by plant associations. Via field experiments we test Müller’s theory of <b>warning</b> <b>colour</b> and mimicry in the wild and prove frequency-dependent selection using tethered beetles exposed to natural predators. By making use of TEM microscopy we prove that colour in Oreina gloriosa is structural and produced by microstructures in the epicuticle. Differences in colour are the result of minute differences in thickness of the electron lucent layers within the chirped multilayer reflector in the beetle’s elytra. I conclude by arguing that there is a multiplicity of factors driving the persisting prevalence of colour polymorphism in Oreina and provide suggestions for further investigation...|$|E
