5|$|Disney {{settled on}} the film's concept as work neared {{completion}} on The Sorcerer's Apprentice, an elaborate Silly Symphonies short designed as a comeback role for Mickey Mouse, who had declined in popularity. As production costs grew higher than <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> earn, Disney decided to include the short in a feature-length film with other segments set to classical pieces. The soundtrack was recorded using multiple audio channels and reproduced with Fantasound, a pioneering sound reproduction system that made Fantasia the first commercial film shown in stereophonic sound.|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the massive ship, V'Ger is {{revealed}} to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned, and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a focus other than its original mission; having learned <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> on its journey home, it finds its existence empty and without purpose. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Realizing that the machine wants to merge with its creator, Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs Enterprise out to space for future missions.|$|E

25|$|Philip Sidney {{was central}} to Scott's {{conception}} of what poetry was and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> achieve, and in the Model he cites Astrophel and Stella, the Arcadia and, of course, An Apology for Poetry. Gavin Alexander writes that The model of poesy {{is in many ways}} a commentary on The defence of poesy, adopting its basic theory, filling in its gaps, interrogating and weighing its sources, glossing and elaborating its difficulties. But it is also a very different sort of work, a much more ambitious and comprehensive exercise inspired by the Defence but not bounded or constrained by it' (p. liii).|$|E
25|$|Plymouth Argyle {{was limited}} in <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{do with the}} stadium {{throughout}} the 1900s, because of a long-standing lease agreement with the City Council. That changed in 2006 when the club purchased the freehold of the ground for £2.7m. Soon after, the club announced it would begin hosting live music in the summer months, starting in 2007, and the first act to perform there was Elton John. Other major acts have followed, including George Michael, Meat Loaf, Westlife, and Rod Stewart. The stadium also hosts an annual free-admittance carol service in December to celebrate Christmas, {{in association with the}} Plymouth branch of Christian organisation Faith and Football.|$|E

25|$|During the occupation, Faiz Mohammad {{was forced}} {{to take part in}} a {{delegation}} sent by Kalakani to negotiate with Hazara groups opposing the Tajik leader. According to his account, he managed to subvert Kalakani’s plans and caused the mission to fail. However, he and the mission’s leader, Noor al-Din Agha, a Qizilbash Shiʿite from Kabul, paid a heavy price for this: both were sentenced to death by beating. Faiz Mohammad alone survived the ordeal and was saved by a colleague. The Persian mission in Kabul, under a directive from Reza Shah to do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> to aid the Shiʿites of Kabul, sent medicines to his house. He eventually recovered enough to travel the following year to Tehran for more medical care. After less than a year there, he returned to Kabul, where he died on 6 Shawal 1349/3 March 1931, at the age of sixty-eight or sixty-nine.|$|E

500|$|The third {{method is}} the {{input-output}} cost method. [...] This looks {{at both the}} costs of inputs and includes any value added by the household. [...] "For instance, the value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> cost to purchase a similar meal (the output) in the market, then subtracting {{the cost of the}} capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor."

500|$|Development {{started in}} early 1989, when the Pickford {{brothers}} were still {{learning about the}} NES and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> do. At the same time, as being new to developing console video games, they were also learning about the market aspects and Nintendo's policies and restrictions on games. Feeling that the graphics {{in most of the}} games in the NES library were poor, they placed emphasis on the graphics and animation. Pickford was particularly pleased with the animation of the enemy eagles and their movement. Rare assisted with the sound, and all of the game's background music was composed by video game composer David Wise, who Pickford said [...] "did a fantastic job on IronSword". As far as gameplay was concerned, they tried to expand upon its predecessor, introducing more adventure-based gameplay and additional RPG elements such as magic, inns, and money.|$|E
500|$|Co-writer Howard Gordon {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this was an {{interesting}} place to reiterate Mulder's quest for his sister. We set out to tell a simple abduction story, which was played out behind the shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E

500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of psycholinguistics, which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try to imagine <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be true of".|$|E
500|$|With {{respect to}} Jon Snow's resurrection, Jeremy Egner of The New York Times wrote {{that it was}} [...] "a mostly {{perfunctory}} resolution." [...] He said [...] "Jon Snow's assassination was astonishing immediately when it happened but, upon further consideration, seemed destined to be overturned on magical appeal. There were too many questions (his parentage) and teased confrontations (the White Walkers) that would be left unresolved, and the show's entire Wall story line would be left with a bastard-sized hole in the middle." [...] Egner also referred to the previous plot in the show involving Beric Dondarrion and Thoros of Myr, and speculated <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> mean in regards to Jon Snow's personality being changed, or becoming less of his former self, as with Dondarrion. Sarah Larson of The New Yorker also reviewed the episode positively, saying, [...] "Last night's episode, still catching us up on all the characters while continuing to move its armies of plot lines forward, was full of fratricide, patricide, head-crushing, infanticide, trompe-l'oeil eyeballs, eunuch jokes, and glorious returns." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what a big city could offer you and <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} ship the game, Bungie began paring back their ambitions for the single- and {{multiplayer}} {{parts of the}} game. Chris Butcher commented, [...] "For Halo 2 we had our sights set very high on networking. ... Going from having no Internet multiplayer to developing a completely new online model was a big challenge to tackle all at once, {{and as a result}} we had to leave a lot of things undone {{in order to meet the}} ship date commitment that we made to our fans." [...] With only a year to go until release, Bungie went into the [...] "mother of all crunches" [...] in order to finish the game; in a 2007 interview, Jamie Griesemer, one of Halos design leads, said that this lack of a [...] "polish" [...] period near the end of the development cycle was the main reason for Halo 2s shortcomings. Butcher retrospectively described Halo 2s multiplayer mode as [...] "a pale shadow of <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> and should have been if we had gotten the timing of our schedule right"; the campaign mode's abrupt cliffhanger ending also resulted from the frenzy to ship on time.|$|E

[...] Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. [...] "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting and terrifying film. I'm really excited about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be", he said. In response to the criticism he said, [...] "I can understand because of people's love of the [...] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film.

500|$|After Rovelstad {{submitted}} his {{designs for}} the coin to the Mint, they {{were sent to the}} Commission of Fine Arts for its opinion. [...] The designs arrived on July 15, 1936, and were approved two days later, with the request that the head of the pioneer on the obverse, in three-quarter view (facing forward and to one side) as submitted by Rovelstad, be in profile instead. [...] The sculptor complied, and submitted plaster models by mid-August; photographs were sent to the commission by the Mint on August 15. [...] Two days later, commission chairman Charles Moore wrote to O'Reilly, stating that the sculptor member of the commission, Lee Lawrie, had viewed the designs, and complained he could not see what the object was behind the pioneers, and that the gun appeared to be held awkwardly. [...] Lawrie also stated that some of the lettering should be strengthened, but if the Mint director, Nellie Tayloe Ross, was not disturbed by these things, the coin should go forward. [...] Moore indicated that he had no desire to delay the coin, and forwarded the commission's recommendation, on condition that the Mint do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> to address these concerns.
