Our closest relatives, the great apes, are all endangered and particularly sensitive to infectious diseases. Both chimpanzees and western gorillas experience large seasonal variations in fruit availability but only western gorillas accordingly show large changes in their degree of frugivory. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate and compare {{factors affecting}} health (through records of clinical signs, urine, and faecal samples) of habituated wild ape populations: a community (N = 46 individuals) of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park (Uganda), and a western gorilla (G. gorilla) group (N = 13) in Bai Hokou in the Dzanga-Ndoki National Park (Central African Republic). Ape health monitoring was carried out in the wet and dry seasons (chimpanzees: July–December 2006; gorillas: April–July 2008 and December 2008 –February 2009). Compared to chimpanzees, western gorillas were shown to have marginally greater parasite diversity, higher prevalence and intensity of both parasite and urine infections, and lower occurrence of diarrhea and <b>wounds.</b> <b>Parasite</b> infections (prevalence and load), but not abnormal urine parameters, were significantly higher during the dry season of the study period for western gorillas, who thus appeared more affected by the large temporal changes in the environment in comparison to chimpanzees.

40|$|A {{bacterial}} {{soft rot}} disease on avocado fruit was found in Israel {{for the first time}} in December 1953. The causal organism was identified as Erwinia carotovora var. aroideae. Like other organisms of the same group it is a <b>wound</b> <b>parasite</b> and requires relatively high humidity to induce infection. The pathogenicity of the organism to 4 different varieties of avocado fruits and to several other hosts was tested. It produces lesions similar to those of the original avocado fruits on all 4 varieties. It induces soft rot in tomato and pepper fruits as well as on slices of potato or carrot in the presence of water. On potato plants it causes typical black leg symptoms, followed by collapse, and disintegration of the stems. Other tested isolates of E. carotovora var. aroideae as well as of E. atroseptica induce lesions similar to those produced by the avocado isolate on avocado and other hosts. The pathogenicity temperature range of the avocado isolate is wider, however. Infection spreads more rapidly at higher than at lower temperature. The optimal temperature for infection is 30 - 32 °C; very good infection is produced at 36 - 37 °C, and good, though slow infection is induced at 14 °C. No infection occurs above 38 or below 12 °C. The close relationship of the avocado organism and other isolates of E. carotovora var. aroideae with E. atroseptica, the causal organism of the black leg disease of potatoes is discussed.

40|$|Post-harvest non-chemical {{treatments}} {{consists of}} a large range of different approaches, including strengthening of the commodity’s natural defence mechanisms, thermotherapy, application of antagonistic microorganisms and natural antimicrobial substances. NEX 0101 is a promising antagonistic biocontrol agent containing the yeast Candida oleophila as the active ingredient. NEX 0101 was developed by Bionext, a spin-off from the laboratory of Dr. H. Jijakli, and is currently evaluated for commercial use. The product contains a yeast strain isolated from apple fruit and was originally developed for the control of post-harvest diseases on apple. The antifungal effectiveness of this antagonist can be increased by addition of calcium salts. As the mode of action of this yeast {{is based on the}} colonisation of wounds, the mean targets of NEX 0101 are blue mould, caused by Penicillium expansum, and grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea. Facing possible latent infections, thermotherapy by using hot water treatments could provide an advanced control towards lenticelrot (Gloeosporium spp.). A combination of both physical and biological treatment techniques could broaden the spectrum to all key pathogens on apple and pear. The use of NEX 0101 for the control of P. expansum was examined in combination with calcium gluconate. According to the results the combination NEX 0101 with calcium gluconate provides an advanced mould control towards P. expansum The best results were achieved using NEX 0101 in combination with post-harvest dipping by thermotherapy. The hot water treatment alone was clearly inefficient towards <b>wound</b> <b>parasite</b> P. expansum, on the contrary thermotherapy stimulates the decay caused by this postharvest pathogen. For the future a combination of biological and physical treatments could offer a worthy non-chemical alternative for organic and integrated fruit growers towards fruit rot decay, although more research is necessary to implement these methods in practice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Traditional plant use is of {{extremely}} high importance in many societies, and prevalent in African communities. This knowledge is however dwindling rapidly due to changes towards a more Western lifestyle. The influence of modern tourism cannot be neglected in this context. This paper examines the plant {{use of the}} Samburu of the Mt. Nyiru area in Northern Kenya. The Samburu pastoralists of Kenya are still amongst the most traditional communities {{of the country and}} have retained most of their knowledge about the use of {{a large part of the}} plants in their environment for a wide variety of purposes. The results indicate that the local population has a very high knowledge of the plants in their surroundings, and attributes a purpose to a large percentage of the plants found. 448 plant species were collected, identified and their Samburu names and traditional uses recorded. 199 species were reported as of "no use". The high proportion of 249 plant species however had some traditional use: The highest number (180 species) was used as fodder, followed by 80 species that had medicinal use. Firewood (59 species), construction (42 species), tools (31 species), food (29 species) and ceremonial use (19 species) ranked far behind. Traditionally the Samburu attribute most illnesses to the effect of pollutants that block or inhibit digestion. This can include "polluted" food, contagion through sick people as well as witchcraft. In most cases the treatment of illness involves herbal purgatives to cleanse the patient. There are however frequent indications of plant use for common problems like <b>wounds,</b> <b>parasites,</b> body aches and burns. The change from a nomadic to a more sedentary lifestyle, often observed in other areas of the country, has affected the Samburu of remote Mt. Nyiru to a much lesser extent and did so far not lead to a major loss of traditional plant knowledge.

40|$|Abstract Traditional plant use is of {{tremendous}} importance in many societies, including most rural African communities. This knowledge is however, rapidly dwindling due to changes towards a more Western lifestyle, {{and the influence}} of modern tourism. In case of the Sekenani Maasai, the recent change from a nomadic to a more sedentary lifestyle has not, thus far lead to a dramatic loss of traditional plant knowledge, when compared to other Maasai communities. However, in Sekenani, plants are used much less frequently for manufacturing tools, and for veterinary purposes, than in more remote areas. While the knowledge is still present, overgrazing and over-exploitation of plant resources have already led to a decline of the plant material available. This paper examines the plant use of the Maasai in the Sekenani Valley, North of the Masaai Mara National Reserve. The Maasai pastoralists of Kenya and Tanzania use {{a large part of the}} plants in their environment for many uses in daily life. The plant use and knowledge of the Sekenani Maasai is of particular interest, as their clan, the "Il-Purko", was moved from Central Kenya to this region by the British Colonial Administration in 1904. The results of this study indicate that despite their relocation 100 years ago, the local population has an extensive knowledge of the plants in their surroundings, and they ascribe uses to a large percentage of the plants found. One-hundred-fifty-five plant species were collected, identified and their Maa names and traditional uses recorded. Although fifty-one species were reported as of "no use", only eighteen of these had no Maasai name. Thirty-three were recognized by a distinctive Maa name. Thirty-nine species had a medicinal use, and 30 species served as fodder for livestock. Six species could not be identified. Of these plants five were addressed by the Maasai with distinct names. This exemplifies the Sekenani Maasai's in-depth knowledge of the plant resources. Traditionally, the Maasai attribute most illnesses to the effect of pollutants that block or inhibit digestion. These pollutants can include "polluted" food, contact with sick people and witchcraft. In most cases the treatment of illness involves herbal purgatives to cleanse the patient. There are alsofrequent indications of plant use for common problems like <b>wounds,</b> <b>parasites,</b> body aches and burns. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the former}} report, {{it was shown}} that {{bacterial}} <b>wound</b> <b>parasites</b> such as Erwinia aroideae, Corynebacterium sepedonicum and Pseudomonas solanacearum could not infect the wounded potato tubers at about 8 hours after wounding. With respect to this, changes of activities of some terminal oxidases of respiratory system, which may responsible to wound healing and to the defencing action of the host tissue against the invasion of pathogen, were tested microchemically with the wound potato tubers kept at 30 C. The results obtained were as follows. (1) Activity of peroxidase (Fig. 1) The activity of peroxidase of wounded potato tuber was obscure when tested within two hours after wounding. It reached to its maximum at 7 to 24 hours and deep stained band, 3 to 5 mm in width, was observed in the tissue beneath the surface. After 3 to 4 days, the activity of this enzyme was weakened gradually in the tissue near the surface, though it remained in the cork cambium layer when tested 10 days after wounding. (2) Activity of cytochrome oxidase (Fig. 2) Cytochrome oxidase activity was really found at the vascular bundle tissue of unwounded resting potato tubers. When they were wounded, {{the production of the}} enzyme was activated and the reaction due to the latter began to observed here and there at about 3 hours at 30 ℃ from wounding. After 7 to 9 hours, the enzyme activity reached to its maximum and the distinct reaction was observed in the tissue under the cut surface forming a band of 3 to 4 mm in width. After 3 to 10 days from wounding, the activity became indistinct {{as in the case of}} peroxidase. (3) Activity of tylosinase (polyphenol oxidase) (Table 1) Generally, the activity of tylosinase was obscure at first. Though it was remarkably activated at about 30 minutes from wounding. The activity of this enzyme changed with the intervals of 2 to 5 hours during the first 24 hours. Strong activity of the enzyme continued for 7 days and then it gradually decreased.

Approximately 100 individuals were collected by Flying Sharks in the sequence of an order from multiple public aquaria. Because there is vely limited knowledge about the capture, husbandry and transport of this species, it became necessary to investigate how to achieve this while causing minimum mortality and ensuring animal welfare. Collection was done in the Azores Islands, approximately 20 nautical miles from Horta, using a standard fishing rod and hook, after attracting blue sharks with bait. The animals were transported to shore inside plastic vats and introduced to large 2, 0 m wide holding tanks at the Porto Pim Aquarium, where they were held for 2 months. Multiple treatments for <b>wounds,</b> and <b>parasite</b> control, were used and are reported. Transport to mainland Portugal was done aboard a commercial vessel, inside 2, 4 m wide polyethylene vats with mechanical and chemical filtration consisting of cartridge filters and protein skimmers, respectively.

40|$|Activation of pro-phenol oxidase (proPO) in {{insects and}} {{crustaceans}} {{is important in}} defense against wounding and infection. The proPO zymogen is activated by a specific proteolytic cleavage. PO oxidizes phenolic compounds to produce quinones, which may help to kill pathogens and {{can also be used}} for synthesis of melanin to seal <b>wounds</b> and encapsulate <b>parasites.</b> We have isolated from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, a serine proteinase that activates proPO, and have cloned its cDNA. The isolated proPO activating proteinase (PAP) hydrolyzed artificial substrates but required other protein factors for proPO activation, suggesting that proPO-activating enzyme may exist as a protein complex, one component of which is PAP. PAP (44 kDa) is composed of two disulfide-linked polypeptide chains (31 kDa and 13 kDa). A cDNA for PAP was isolated from a hemocyte library, by using a PCR-generated probe based on the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the 31 -kDa catalytic domain. PAP belongs to a family of arthropod serine proteinases containing a carboxyl-terminal proteinase domain and an amino-terminal “clip” domain. The member of this family most similar in sequence to PAP is the product of the easter gene from Drosophila melanogaster. PAP mRNA was present at a low level in larval hemocytes and fat body, but became much more abundant in fat body after insects were injected with Escherichia coli.
