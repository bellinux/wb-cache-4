50|$|The white-throated bulbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Trichophorus (a synonym for Criniger) until moved to the genus Alophoixus in 2009. Alternate names for the white-throated bulbul include the ashy-fronted bearded bulbul, ashy-fronted bulbul, white-throated bearded bulbul, and yellow-bellied bulbul. The alternate names 'ashy-fronted bulbul' and 'yellow-bellied bulbul' {{should not be confused}} with species of the same name (Pycnonotus cinereifrons and Alophoixus phaeocephalus respectively). The common name 'white-throated bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for each of the white-throated <b>greenbul,</b> eastern <b>bearded</b> <b>greenbul,</b> puff-throated bulbul and yellow-bellied bulbul. The alternate name 'white-throated bearded bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for the eastern <b>bearded</b> <b>greenbul.</b>|$|R
50|$|The eastern bearded greenbul was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Hypsipetes. Formerly, some authorities considered the eastern bearded greenbul as conspecific with the <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> <b>greenbul.</b> Alternate names for the eastern bearded greenbul include the bearded bulbul, Congo bulbul, eastern bearded bulbul, green-backed bulbul, oriental bearded bulbul, white-throated bearded-bulbul, white-throated bearded-greenbul and white-throated bulbul. The latter two alternate names {{should not be confused}} with the species of the same name, Alophoixus flaveolus.

50|$|Reptiles inhabiting the Jarrah Forest include legless lizards, dragon lizards, skinks, blind snakes, pythons and venomous snakes. The <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragon (Pogona minor) {{was found}} in {{restored}} forest rather than old growth forest.|$|R

50|$|Pogona minor is {{a species}} of agamid lizard from a group {{commonly}} known as bearded dragons, and is found on the southwest coast and interior of Western Australia.

40|$|A Nankeen Kestrel Falco cenchroides was {{observed}} eating an apparently freshly killed <b>Western</b> <b>Bearded</b> Dragon Pogona minor at {{a beach in}} south-Western Australia. The Kestrel twice flew low over the landscape for 25 m, carrying the slain dragon. The mass of the dragon (43 g) was calculated as 26 % of the Kestrel's mass (164 g). Kestrels taking, and carrying, lizard prey of this size may be uncommon...|$|R
50|$|Pterostylis barbata, {{commonly}} known as the <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> greenhood or bird orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. Flowering plants have a rosette of leaves {{at the base of the}} plant and a single translucent white flower with dark green veins on a flowering stem with up to 20 stem leaves. It is one of a number of bearded orchids, some of which have yet to be formally described, all of which have a distinctive feather-like labellum.|$|R
25|$|Some of the mammals {{found in}} the Great Western Woodlands region include the greater long-eared bat (Nyctophilus timoriensis), western brush wallaby (Macropus irma), red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura), and the western quoll or chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii). Some of the {{reptiles}} {{found in the}} region include the carpet python (Morelia spilt imbricata), the <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragon (Pogona minor minima), and the common slender blue tongue (Cyclodomorphus branchialis). Birds found in the region include the Australian bustard (Ardeotis australis), the bush stone-curlew (Burins grallarius), Carnaby’s cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris), and the malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|R
50|$|Approximately 150 {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} including the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) and Australian pelican (Pelecanus conspicillatus). Some of the recorded mammal species in the interior include the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and spinifex hopping mouse (Notomys alexis). The only observed bat in the park is the Finlayson's cave bat (Vespadelus finlaysoni). The recorded reptile species include the thorny devil (Moloch horridus), <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragon (Pogona minor) and central netted dragon (Ctenophorus nuchalis). The only observed amphibian is Günther's toadlet (Pseudophryne guentheri). About 30 different arthropods have been recorded including a dragonfly called the Pilbara tiger (Ictinogomphus dobsoni) and the savanna black tree ant (Tetraponera punctulata).|$|R
50|$|Pogona minor minor lizards are large, 38 cm {{in length}} (15 cm from snout to vent), P. m. minima is {{slightly}} smaller. All bearded dragons have a chameleon-like colour, either blending into their environments or presenting brighter displays during interaction with others. They {{are similar in}} appearance to Pogona nullarbor and Caimanops amphiboluroides (mulga dragon), but are distinguished by smaller heads, and the arrangement of spines on their undersides and necks. The <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragon is widespread in Southwest Australia and central deserts; the range includes semiarid regions such as woodland or heathland, and arid desert or coastal dunes. This subspecies also occurs on Dirk Hartog Island.Pogona minor minima is found on West, North, and East Wallabi Islands, Houtman Abrolhos.|$|R
40|$|Forest areas {{restored}} after mining typically take decades, or longer, {{before they}} resemble the original vegetation community. Understanding how fauna succession varies with plant succession requires detailed knowledge of an animal’s ecology. Knowledge of an animal’s ecology {{can also be}} used to predict faunal responses to management manipulations and enable techniques to be developed that accelerate the return of fauna to restored sites. We radio-tracked <b>western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragons (Pogona minor) in a mix of unmined forest sites and sites restored after bauxite mining, in the jarrah forest of south-west Western Australia, to determine critical resources and important microhabitats for dragons. Dragons were generalists – utilising a range of microhabitats – and adaptable, adjusting their microhabitat use depending on availability. Individuals also differed significantly in their microhabitat use and did not appear to have a defined home range. We concluded that the species would rapidly recolonise restored sites and that no modifications to current restoration practices were required to accelerate their return. Prescribed burning of restored areas could negatively affect this species but the effect would be short-term (< 2 years). The approach used in this study could be used to develop management prescriptions that accelerate the return of late-successional species to restored sites...|$|R
40|$|A new species, Choleoeimeria pogonae n. sp. is {{described}} from a <b>Western</b> <b>bearded</b> dragon (Pogona minor minor) in Western Australia. Sporulated oocysts (n = 48) were cylindroidal in shape. Oocyst length, 27. 0 (26. 0 - 28. 3) μm, oocyst width, 15. 2 (14. 0 - 16. 5) μm, oocyst length/width ratio (L/W) 1. 8 (1. 6 - 1. 9), each with 4 sporocysts (Eimeria-like) and a polar granule, but lacking a micropyle and oocyst residuum. Sporocysts are ovoidal in shape, sporocyst length, 10. 0 (9. 0 - 11. 0) μm, sporocyst width 8. 5 (7. 0 - 9. 5) μm, sporocyst L/W ratio, 1. 2 (1. 1 - 1. 3). Stieda, substieda and parasubstieda bodies were all absent. Molecular {{analysis was conducted}} at the 18 S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) loci. Phylogenetic analysis of 18 S sequences revealed that C. pogonae n. sp. grouped together with another four Choleoeimeria spp. and exhibited 99. 1 %- 99. 4 % genetic similarity. At the COI locus, C. pogonae n. sp. was in an independent clade and had the highest similarity (80. 4 %) to Eimeria cf. mivati from a chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus). According to the morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species of coccidian parasite. This study further supports the taxonomy of Choleoeimeria spp. as a new genus based on molecular phylogenetic analysis...|$|R
