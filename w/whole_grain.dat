40|$|ABSTRACT Dietary {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} consumption of <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> to prevent chronic diseases. Epidemiologic studies support the theory that <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> are protective against cancer, especially gastrointestinal cancers such as gastric and colon can-cer, and cardiovascular disease. Components in <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> that may be protective include compounds that affect the gut envi-ronment, such as dietary fiber, resistant starch, and oligosaccha-rides. <b>Whole</b> <b>grains</b> are also rich in compounds that function as antioxidants, such as trace minerals and phenolic compounds, and phytoestrogens, with potential hormonal effects. Other potential mechanisms whereby <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> may protect against disease include binding of carcinogens and modulation of the glycemic response. Clearly, the range of protective substances in <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> is impressive and advice to consume additional <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> is justified. Further study is needed regarding the mechanisms behind this protection so that the most potent protective com-ponents of <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> will be maintained when developing <b>whole</b> <b>grains</b> into acceptable food products for the public.
