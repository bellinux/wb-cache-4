5|$|It {{is not a}} far {{stretch to}} imagine that if Agnew had contested {{corruption}} charges half as hard as Nixon denied culpability for Watergate – as Goldwater and several other stalwart conservatives <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> – today we might be speaking of Agnew-Democrats and Agnewnomics, and deem Agnew the father of modern conservatism.|$|E

He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not swim in Rome; team officials merely <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E

5|$|According to Dutton, Sigourney Weaver {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for his casting. In the years leading up the production of Alien 3, she promised him {{a role in the}} third film. While he was working on Broadway in December 1990, Weaver phoned him that the studio approved his casting and <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> fly to London. Although Dutton liked Alien 3, he found its production tumultuous; director David Fincher encountered resistance from 20th Century Fox, and Pinewood Studios was in need of renovation.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, {{which was the}} only one he received.

5|$|After the 1907 season, Stricklett {{returned}} to the California League to pitch for the San Jose Prune Prickers and Sacramento Sacts, and refused to report to Brooklyn in 1908 as his wife <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain closer to their California home. As the California League was not recognized in organized baseball at this time, Stricklett was banned by MLB for four years. Though he applied for reinstatement, his banishment was upheld. Stricklett continued to pitch for San Jose through 1910, pitching to a 23-12 record in 1909 and a 19-14 record in 1910.|$|E

5|$|Born in Purworejo, Dutch East Indies, Oerip {{exhibited}} {{leadership skills}} {{from an early}} age. As his parents <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> become a regent, after elementary school Oerip {{was sent to the}} School for Native Government Employees in Magelang. His mother died during his second year at the school, and Oerip left to undertake military training in Meester Cornelis, Batavia (modern-day Jatinegara, Jakarta).

5|$|In February 1854, the General Assembly's Whig {{majority}} gerrymandered the Eighth District, removing {{over 500}} Democratic voters and {{replacing them with}} several hundred Whig voters by removing Owen and Jessamine counties from the district and adding Harrison and Nicholas counties to it. The cooperation of the Know Nothing Party—a relatively new nativist political entity—with the faltering Whigs further hindered Breckinridge's re-election chances. With his family again in financial straits, his wife <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retire from national politics.|$|E

Other pilots indicated they <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> stay in Korea, considering him to be an able and effective leader.

5|$|Pearse {{found that}} there was no {{possibility}} of improvement but that Michael Schiavo's decisions might have been influenced by the potential to inherit what remained of Terri Schiavo's estate as long as he remained married to her. Due to a lack of a living will and questions regarding Michael's credibility, Pearse recommended denying his petition to remove her feeding tube. Pearse reported that the issue of conflict of interest applied to the Schindlers as well since, had Michael divorced Terri as they <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to,</b> they would have inherited the remainder of Mrs. Schiavo's estate upon her death.|$|E
5|$|Projected as a {{potential}} draft pick in the first eight rounds of the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, Gattis instead intimated {{that he intended to}} attend college and play college baseball. While Rice University offered him a scholarship to play first base, he accepted an offer from Texas A University, who <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play as their catcher. However, the divorce of his parents and anxiety derived from the fear of failing at college baseball led Gattis to abuse alcohol and marijuana. He went undrafted in the 2004 draft.|$|E

He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs <b>wanted</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> invest some of his money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
