5|$|In VLSI {{integrated}} circuit design, if {{a collection of}} modules must be connected by <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> can each bend at most once, then again there are two possible routes for the wires, {{and the problem of}} choosing which of these two routes to use, {{in such a way that}} all wires can be routed in a single layer of the circuit, can be solved as a 2-satisfiability instance.|$|E
5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also swing on ropes and walk on <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|In early 1979, Des Moines fire {{officials}} {{announced that a}} hydrogen buildup caused by alkaline water leaking from the store's heating and cooling system caused the fire. Court documents filed by prosecuting attorneys in 1981 stated that an electrical malfunction caused <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> were covered in polyvinyl chloride to overheat, giving off hydrochloric acid. Lawyers representing Younkers and {{the families of the}} eleven victims sued more than 20 companies that manufactured or were associated with polyvinyl chloride, including Monsanto Company and Underwriters Laboratories. Most of those lawsuits were settled out of court in 1984, while the last suit against B.F. Goodrich was dismissed by a Polk County district judge in April 1986.|$|E

5|$|The {{computer}} console {{explosion that}} causes the transporter malfunction was simulated using brillo pads. Weldon hid steel wool inside the console and attached an arc welder to operate by remote control when the actor pulled a wire. The welder was designed to create a spark instead of actually welding, causing the steel wool to burn and make sparks; so effective was the setup that the cast members were continually startled by the flare-ups, resulting in additional takes. Various canisters and cargo containers appear to be suspended by Anti-gravity throughout the film. These effects were executed by several of Weldon's assistants. The crew built a circular track that had the same shape as the corridor and suspended the antigravity prop on four small <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> connected to the track. The wires were treated with a special acid which oxidized the metal; the reaction tarnished the wires to a dull gray that would not {{show up in the}} deep blue corridor lighting. Cargo boxes were made out of light balsa wood so that fine wires could be used as support.|$|E

25|$|Simultaneous EEG {{recordings}} and fMRI scans {{have been obtained}} successfully, though successful simultaneous recording requires that several technical difficulties be overcome, such {{as the presence of}} ballistocardiographic artifact, MRI pulse artifact and the induction of electrical currents in EEG <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> move within the strong magnetic fields of the MRI.

25|$|One of the {{simplest}} linear polarizers is the wire-grid polarizer (WGP), which consists of many fine parallel metallic <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> are placed in a plane. WGPs mostly reflect the non-transmitted polarization and can thus be used as polarizing beam splitters. The parasitic absorption is relatively high compared {{to most of the}} dielectric polarizers though much lower than in absorptive polarizers.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a switch is an odd number of layers of smaller, simpler subswitches. Each layer is interconnected by a web of <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> goes from each subswitch, {{to a set of}} the next layer of subswitches. In most designs, a physical (space) switching layer alternates with a time switching layer. The layers are symmetric, because in a telephone system callers can also be callees.|$|E

25|$|Despite finding {{neither the}} {{specific}} <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> caused the short circuit (the usual cause of arcing sounds and the likely {{cause of the}} breaker trips) nor the origin point of the fire that later consumed the plane, investigators determined that a short circuit likely sparked and ignited surrounding materials (such as insulation blankets) that sustained and propagated a fire behind {{the wall of the}} lavatory, with the plane's outer skin serving as a conduit for smoke to seep in through the seams in the interior panels and collect near the apex of the cabin.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{central office}} may have tens of {{thousands}} of pairs of <b>wires</b> <b>that</b> appear on terminal blocks called the main distribution frame (MDF). A component of the MDF is protection: fuses or other devices that protect the switch from lightning, shorts with electric power lines, or other foreign voltages. In a typical telephone company, a large database tracks information about each subscriber pair and the status of each jumper. Before computerization of Bell System records in the 1980s, this information was handwritten in pencil in accounting ledger books.|$|E
