60|$|Everybody has {{a map of}} North America. A {{reference}} to such a map will show the peculiar position of Chicago. It is at the south or head of Lake Michigan, and to it converge railways from Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. At Chicago is found the nearest water carriage which can be obtained for the produce of {{a large portion of}} these States. From Chicago there is direct water conveyance round through the lakes to Buffalo, at the foot of Lake Erie. At Milwaukee, higher up on the lake, certain lines of railway come in, joining the lake to the Upper Mississippi, and to the wheat-lands of Minnesota. Thence the passage is round by Detroit, which is the port for the produce of the greatest part of Michigan, and still it all goes on toward Buffalo. Then on Lake Erie there are the ports of Toledo, Cleveland, and Erie. At the bottom of Lake Erie there is this city of corn, at which the grain and flour are transhipped into the canal-boats and into the railway cars for New York; and there is also the Welland Canal, through which large vessels pass from the upper lakes <b>without</b> <b>transhipment</b> of their cargo.|$|E

30|$|Between 1970 and 2010, {{developing}} countries’ {{share in}} the volume of seaborne exports rose from just 18 to 56 % of the world’s total (UNCTAD 2014). Despite this growing participation of developing countries in seaborne trade, evidence on maritime connections suggests that, except for few of them such as China, they may have not reached their full potential. Fugazza et al. (2013) find that {{the average number of}} direct maritime connections, meaning <b>without</b> involving any <b>transhipment</b> of the transported goods between the country of origin and their destination, is half for developing countries than what it is for developed ones.|$|R

We propose two solving algorithms using a decomposition {{of the problem}} into three main steps: construction of the network, filling vehicles with commodities and construction of the vehicle plannings. The resolution of these steps involves heuristic schemes, Mixed Integer Programming and Constraint Programming techniques. To evaluate the model and the solution algorithms, we produce instances based on a study of real-life data.

40|$|In {{passenger}} transport, hub-and-spoke networks {{allow the}} transportation of small passenger flows with competitive frequencies, {{in a way}} that direct line networks cannot. Equivalently, in freight transport, it can be expected that small shipper-receiver flows of high added value commodities transit through hub and spoke networks, while larger shipper-receiver flows of less expensive commodities are transported directly, <b>without</b> <b>transhipment.</b> The objective of this paper is first to present an analytical model, based on inventory theory, explaining how for a given commodity flow, the organisation of freight transport operations is closely related to the characteristics of the shipper-receiver relationship; second to assess empirically this model. Special emphasis is put on the number of transhipments in the transport operation, as an indication of organisation of the transport operations. The theoretical model is a simplified microeconomic model, built on principles of inventory theory. The empirical assessment of this model is based on the French shipment survey ECHO, which provides both the details of the transport operation and of the shipper-receiver relationships. With this database, we first provide a straightforward, graphical verification of the prediction of the theoretical model; secondly, we estimate it econometrically. © 2016, Editorial Board EJTIR.
