40|$|The {{current study}} {{compared}} {{quality of life}} and perceived social support in Indians and Whites <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems. Quality of life was assessed using the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support assessed perceived social support. The sample consisted of 45 participants recruited from <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> services and voluntary organisations. There was a positive relationship between perceived social support and quality of life. Differences in the strength of the relationship between {{quality of life and}} perceived social support were found (relationship with perceived family support stronger in Whites and perceived support from friends stronger in Indians <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems). These findings suggested different sources of support may have differing influences on quality of life for Indians and Whites <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems. Between-group differences were not found for Indians and Whites <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems on quality of life, overall perceived social support and perceived family support. The implications of these results were that there may often be more similarities than differences between Indians and Whites <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems. The findings are discussed in terms of developing supportive and life-enhancing programmes for those <b>with</b> severe <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems. Future directions for research are also outlined...|$|R

5|$|The World Health Organization, the European Union {{and other}} {{regional}} bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies {{in order to}} reduce the harm of alcoholism. Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, evidence based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> problems have also been suggested.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, the {{government}} made a Statement of Reconciliation– including an apology {{to those people}} who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools– and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The Foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.|$|E

Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{question}} of how insurance coverage has changed among individuals <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> problems compared to the general population in the last two years. DATA SOURCES: HealthCare for Communities, a national survey to track health system changes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The percentage of uninsured persons in the general population has not changed very much, and more respondents believe that health insurance coverage has improved rather than deteriorated over the years 1996 to 1998. However, among individuals <b>with</b> probable <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> disorders, more have lost insurance in those two years than have gained it and more report decreases in health benefits. Individuals <b>with</b> worse <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> consistently report a deterioration of access to care compared to individuals <b>with</b> better <b>mental</b> <b>health.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Substantial activity has taken place in state and federal legislation to increase the <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> benefits offered by health insurance. Although this activity could have improved health insurance especially for individuals <b>with</b> <b>mental</b> illness, such persons continue to fare significantly worse than the general population...|$|R
