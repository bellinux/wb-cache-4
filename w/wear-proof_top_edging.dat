40|$|Abstract. Micro {{abrasive}} air jet (MAAJ) cutting {{technology is}} being increasingly {{used in the}} precision machining of hard and brittle materials, due to its distinct advantages of negligible heat effect zone and small cutting force. In this paper, an experimental study on the kerf characteristics, especially for the effect of cutting parameters on the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> definition, is presented. It shows that the <b>top</b> kerf <b>edge</b> is straight but not sharp. The <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> definition of the kerf improves with {{a decrease in the}} air pressure, while the effect of abrasive flow rate and nozzle traverse speed are hardly discernible. The optimum jet incidence angle for highest <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> definition of the kerf is 60 °. The results of this paper may be useful for the cutting parameters optimization in the precision three-dimensional micro-structural machining...|$|R

40|$|Airborne sound {{insulation}} {{index of the}} noise barrier panel and the sound absorption coefficient of the barrier surface are the acoustic parameters that are usually determined in specialized laboratories, however they can be also determined in situ. Acoustic characteristics of a barrier include also the diffraction index difference determined from comparison of barriers with plain <b>top</b> <b>edges</b> and barriers with added devices installed on the <b>top</b> <b>edge.</b> The index is determined from the impulse response values determined for the acoustic wave propagation path from the sound source {{to a set of}} properly distributed measurement points. By means of the same method, one can also determine the difference in a barrier’s acoustic effectiveness between the plain top barrier structure and its version with added devices mounted on the top. The paper presents measurement results for three types of added devices mounted on the <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> of the barrier. The diffraction index differences have been determined for each added device type and the acoustic effectiveness for each device has been compared with the plain <b>top</b> <b>edge</b> acoustic barrier...|$|R
