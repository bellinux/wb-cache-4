The player controls Neku and his partner as they explore Shibuya to complete each day's mission. Although most missions require completion within a certain time for Neku and his partner, this timer is not correlated to the passage of time for the player.|$|E

500|$|Though {{previous}} albums {{were produced}} by David Kosten, they enlisted {{the support of}} producer Stuart Price after he impressed them with his work on a demo version of the eventual single, [...] "Regret". As Price was based in Los Angeles, the band emailed him samples of their work for him to critique and receive his suggested mixes in return. They had mixed reactions to his suggestions; {{at one point during}} production of [...] "Hapsburg Lippp" [...] – a track which did not make the final track listing – Price returned them a reggae-inspired mix as a joke. Higgs explained to Andy Morris of Gigwise that Price had an [...] "ability to become one of us very quickly". Price joined them in person for the last nine days of recording.

500|$|The album's artwork {{was created}} by English street artist D*Face. Barker was a fan of his work, having bought many of his pieces at his {{galleries}} in the past. According to D*Face, the trio [...] "wanted the artwork to represent California, but with a subversive side to show that it's not always great and there's always something under the surface, in the underbelly." [...] The artist was particularly busy, and employed pre-existing but unfinished illustration for the album cover. He also offered two alternate pieces that were rejected, but later posted on NME website. Skiba and Barker were pleased, but Hoppus was not as immediately receptive, according to the artist. While he did not admit to being {{a fan of the}} group, D*Face was happy with the commission, commenting, [...] "To have a band with such a great legacy and talent like Blink ask to work <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> a great honour and privilege." ...|$|E

[...] The unknown poet begins with a verse from the Second Epistle to Timothy, [...] "Remember that Jesus Christ … was raised from the dead" [...] (...) [...] The poet sees Thomas as similar to the doubtful Christian in general, whose heart is not at peace. The center of the cantata is the Easter hymn [...] "" [...] (The glorious day has appeared) by Nikolaus Herman (1560), praising the day of the resurrection. In contrast, movement 5 recalls the danger by the enemies, until in movement 6 Jesus appears, as he did to his disciples in Jerusalem, finally bringing peace. The line [...] "" [...] (Peace be <b>with</b> <b>you)</b> <b>is</b> repeated four times, framing three stanzas of a poem.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> <b>is</b> that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

It is a charming scene, and we may {{reasonably}} assume that there was reality in the salutations. Such civilities of intercourse between proprietors and their laborers are still, says Dr. W. M. Thomson, common in the East. [...] "The Lord be <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> merely the [...] "Allah makum!" [...] of ordinary parlance; and so too the response, The Lord bless thee" [...] ('The Land and the Book,' p.648). Modern Moslems are particular {{in the matter of}} salutations. [...] "Abuhurairah reports that he heard Mohammed say, You will not enter into paradise until you have faith, and you will not complete your faith until you love one another, and that is shown by. making salaam to friends and strangers" [...] (Kitto's 'Bible Illustrations,' in loc.).|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "I wait for Your salvation, O God," [...] Rabbi Isaac taught that {{everything}} is bound up with waiting, hoping.

Thus [...] says, [...] "Yea, in the way of Your judgments, O Lord, have we waited for You," [...] which alludes to suffering. The words of [...] "To Your name," [...] allude to the sanctification of the Divine Name. The words of [...] "And to Your memorial," [...] allude to ancestral merit.

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
