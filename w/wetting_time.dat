50|$|Time above {{liquidus}} (TAL), or time above reflow, measures {{how long}} the solder is a liquid. The flux reduces surface tension at the juncture of the metals to accomplish metallurgical bonding, allowing the individual solder powder spheres to combine. If the profile time exceeds the manufacturer’s specification, the result may be premature flux activation or consumption, effectively “drying” the paste before formation of the solder joint. An insufficient time/temperature relationship causes {{a decrease in the}} flux’s cleaning action, resulting in poor wetting, inadequate removal of the solvent and flux, and possibly defective solder joints. Experts usually recommend the shortest TAL possible, however, most pastes specify a minimum TAL of 30 seconds, although {{there appears to be no}} clear reason for that specific time. One possibility is that there are places on the PCB that are not measured during profiling, and therefore, setting the minimum allowable time to 30 seconds reduces the chances of an unmeasured area not reflowing. A high minimum reflow time also provides a margin of safety against oven temperature changes. The <b>wetting</b> <b>time</b> ideally stays below 60 seconds above liquidus. Additional time above liquidus may cause excessive intermetallic growth, which can lead to joint brittleness. The board and components may also be damaged at extended times over liquidus, and most components have a well-defined time limit for {{how long the}}y may be exposed to temperatures over a given maximum. Too little time above liquidus may trap solvents and flux and create the potential for cold or dull joints as well as solder voids.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} water quality on sheet/cloud {{cavitation}} on a NACA 0015 hydrofoil is explored. A surprising {{finding is that}} water quality can affect lift oscillations even when the hydrofoil is fully cavitating. The reason for the observed water quality effect is not completely understood. However, high-speed video observations have {{shed light on the}} problem. Video and lift data were recorded at gas contents of 16. 2 % and 27 % of saturation. Cavity length, leading edge fully <b>wetted</b> <b>time,</b> as well as lift oscillations were measured. It is noted that even for fully cavitating flows {{the leading edge of the}} foil becomes fully wetted for a fraction of each oscillation cycle. Thus inception must begin anew every cycle with the same water quality effects noted for other types of inception. This is seen not only in our experimental data, but in our numerical simulations as well. When scaling by the cavitation number divided by twice the angle of attack (σ/ 2 α), certain cavity shedding characteristics were noticed. Even for the relatively small changes in gas content in this study, fully <b>wetted</b> <b>times</b> appear dependent on gas content for values between 3 and 6 of σ/ 2 α. Near values of 4, water with the higher gas content had a slightly shorter fully <b>wetted</b> <b>time.</b> Shedding behavior in this region is very irregular as suggested by cavitating flat plate theory [1], and verified by Kjeldsen et al [2]. At the lower gas content, fully <b>wetted</b> <b>time</b> exceeded 20 % of the shedding period for certain values of σ/ 2 α. Even though the differences in gas content are small, we observed differences in percent of fully <b>wetted</b> <b>time</b> of the shedding period that varied by as much as 10 %. Our hypothesis is that the cavitation is delayed in strong water resulting in a longer fully <b>wetted</b> <b>time,</b> and a lower magnitude lift oscillation. This is confirmed by our data...|$|R

This study was aimed to formulate and evaluate an Orally Disintegrating Tablet (ODT) containing Rizatriptan while using semi-synthetic and natural superdisintegrants. Methods: Orodispersible tablets were prepared by direct compression using natural superdisntegrant (Plantago ovata mucilage) and semi-synthetic superdisntegrant (crospovidone). The prepared tablets were evaluated for hardness, friability, thickness, drug content uniformity, water absorption and <b>wetting</b> <b>time.</b> A 3 2 factorial design was used to investigate the effect of independent variables (amount of crospovidone and Plantago ovata mucilage) on dependent variables disintegration time, <b>wetting</b> <b>time</b> and Q 5 (cumulative amount of drug release after 5 minutes). A counter plot was also presented to graphically represent the effect of independent variable on the disintegration time, <b>wetting</b> <b>time</b> and Q 5.
