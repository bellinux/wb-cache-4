5|$|Sukartono (abbreviated as Tono) is a doctor, Tini's {{husband and}} Yah's lover. He treats poor {{patients}} {{for free and}} thus is well-liked by the general populace. He is also {{a big fan of}} traditional kroncong music: in medical school he preferred to sing rather than study, and as a doctor he keeps a radio in his treatment room. Suffering from loneliness in his loveless marriage with the modern-minded Tini, he becomes involved with Yah, whom he perceives as being more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the traditional wife. However, when Tini and Yah leave him, he is left alone.|$|E
5|$|Benet's band program, {{practically}} nonexistent in {{the late}} 1950s, was revitalized by director Andy Marchese in the mid-1960s, who introduced new uniforms, regularly scheduled concerts, and marching band trophies. Participation in the marching band also increased after the school became coeducational, since there were more musicians <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> instruments male students saw as feminine. Out of 1,275students at Benet in 1999–00, 130 were choir students and 115 were band students. Instrumental groups include two concert bands, a percussion ensemble, three jazz bands, a marching band, a pep band, and a string orchestra. In 1998 the pep band was one of eight schools chosen {{from a pool of}} 58 to perform at the state basketball tournament. In 2002, the school's symphonic band was one of three high school bands invited to play at the Illinois Music Educators Association All-State Conference in Peoria. Vocal music groups include five choirs, one of which is a student-led mass choir that participates in school liturgies.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 1992, at {{the onset}} of the 1992 NHL Entry Draft, the Nordiques entered into a verbal {{agreement}} on a trade involving Lindros with the Flyers. The trade was contingent on Lindros agreeing to play in Philadelphia. The Nordiques permitted Russ Farwell, the general manager of the Flyers, to call Lindros to discuss whether or not Lindros would be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the Flyers, and he received assurance that Lindros considered Philadelphia to be acceptable. Within 80 minutes of agreeing to a trade with Farwell, Marcel Aubut, the president of the Nordiques, had second thoughts about the trade with Philadelphia and verbally agreed to trade Lindros to the New York Rangers. The Flyers offer was reported to include Mike Ricci, Rod Brind'Amour, Mark Recchi, Steve Duchesne, Ron Hextall, Dominic Roussel, multiple first-round draft picks, and $15million, while the Rangers had reportedly agreed to trade Sergei Nemchinov, Tony Amonte, Alexei Kovalev, James Patrick, and either John Vanbiesbrouck or Mike Richter, as well as multiple first-round draft picks and $20million.|$|E

5|$|In a {{major change}} from 2001—when one unnamed former NBA {{executive}} stated that a franchise would not return to Vancouver in his lifetime—Stern revealed in February 2011 that Vancouver was being considered along with Pittsburgh, Tampa and Kansas City. Reasons for considering Vancouver are the strengthening of the Canadian dollar, which for several years in the early 2010s was roughly at par with the U.S. dollar; the influx of international players who would be more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in Canada; sell-outs for pre-season exhibition games at Rogers Arena (the new name of GM Place); Vancouver having a state-of-the-art venue; and an increased realization among NBA executives that the Vancouver failure was not predominantly {{because of lack of}} interest for basketball in Vancouver. The city has also been through a resurrection in professional sports, with the creation of the Vancouver Giants in junior hockey, the 2010 Winter Olympics, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC joining Major League Soccer. However, the location of the city also allows for more varied sports experiences, such as skiing, hunting, fishing and golf, which could partially limit the interest for spectator sports. In addition, the Canadian dollar dramatically weakened against its U.S. counterpart later in the decade, dropping as low as 68 U.S. cents during 2016. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman cited this as a major reason why the league deferred Quebec City's bid to rejoin the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself the equal of any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E

25|$|Henderson had to {{wait until}} 2001 to make his {{international}} debut after Nicky Boje needed surgery. He was selected to make his test debut against neighbours Zimbabwe in Harare. Following the retirement of Boje from the South African test side, Henderson was approached to replace him for the home series against India. Henderson rejected the approach because of his contract with Leicestershire, only <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for South Africa if he was given a contract with the South African cricket board.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{this period}} both the US and USSR {{were working on}} anti-ballistic missile systems. Developing an ABM system was largely an {{engineering}} issue, requiring radars with high resolution and targeting computers that could adjust trajectories fast enough given an approach speed in thousands of miles an hour. Even though these items would be expensive, the ABM interceptor itself was likely to cost {{about the same as}} an ICBM (or less), so any increase in the enemy's stockpile could be countered for an additional expenditure of about the same amount. This was a game the US was clearly <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> although it would seem the USSR was considerably less capable of doing so given the size of the two countries' respective economies.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the thirteenth race of the season, the inaugural Aragon Grand Prix, that Stoner {{achieved}} his first victory. His victory in Aragon started a run of three victories in four races, as he also won the delayed Japanese Grand Prix, and won for the fourth consecutive year at Phillip Island. He eventually finished fourth in the riders' championship once again. With Rossi having fallen out of favour with Yamaha following Lorenzo's championship-winning season and Honda no longer <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> second-fiddle to another Japanese manufacturer, an intense game of musical-chairs ensued in the MotoGP paddock that saw several of the top riders switch teams, Stoner among them. For 2011, Stoner joined Honda Racing Corporation after four years at Ducati Corse, where he was replaced by Valentino Rossi.|$|E

25|$|Market analysts had a mixed {{response}} to the October 2016 announcement of the Nintendo Switch. Following the financially under-performing Wii U, analysts had expected that Nintendo would recognize their vulnerable position in the console market when developing their next console, believing that the company would find a means to draw back the core gamer market. Instead, initial promotion of the Switch appeared to appeal to an audience that fell between the core gamer and casual gamer markets, the latter being mobile game players who would want a more engaging experience but would not be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> {{for hours at a}} time, according to The New York Times. Analysts were unsure if such a market existed in large enough numbers to justify the Switch. Other concerns about the Switch's announcement were related to yet-to-be-confirmed details that could make or break the system, such as its retail price, whether the unit includes a touchscreen, the unit's battery life, and the type of games that development partners would bring to the console.|$|E
25|$|Leeds {{reputation}} {{was built on}} strong organisation, professionalism, physical robustness (at a time when football was more physical than it is today), as well as free flowing attacking wing play and patient, possession based football. The team was built around a core of technically adept, intelligent and versatile players, who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in multiple positions and indeed could interchange positions and roles around the pitch. Most of Revie's team {{went on to become}} internationals; in 1970 the squad contained 17 full internationals. This was at a time when squads never had more than 20 players, when players from outside the British Isles were rare in English football, and international players correspondingly more rare. Two of Revie's players would feature in England's 1966 World Cup winning squad, with Jack Charlton playing a pivotal role at the heart of defence, a further four Leeds players would feature in England's 1970 World Cup squad (two more missed out through injury and fatigue), and five Leeds players featured in Scotland's 1974 World Cup squad. In the early 1970s the Leeds team could boast the captain of the Ireland, John Giles, the captain of Scotland, Billy Bremner and the captain of Wales, Terry Yorath. Leeds would also loan their first team coach Les Cocker to the England national team throughout this period; {{as one of the first}} holders of an FA certificate in coaching, he would combine his responsibilities to Leeds with that of the national team and play a pivotal role to the success of England in the 1966 world cup as team trainer.|$|E

500|$|McDonald {{was known}} {{primarily}} as an offensive player {{with a hard}} shot.

Red Kelly, McDonald's coach in his first NHL seasons, recalled that he was impressed with his young player's skill handling the puck and defended McDonald against critics who wanted him moved out of Toronto due to his early struggles. In his NHL career, McDonald led his team in goal scoring six times: 1976–77, 1977–78 and 1978–79 with Toronto, 1980–81 with Colorado, and 1981–82 and 1982–83 in Calgary.

By contrast, game testers elicited a variety of reactions. Many testers were initially angry and confused at the level's content, but eventually settled down and began shooting at the civilians. One tester, who at the time was enlisted in the United States Armed Forces, refused to play the level at all, but was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the rest of the game.
