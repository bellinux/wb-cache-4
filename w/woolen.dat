5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine <b>woolen</b> blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white <b>woolen</b> garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect a cotton maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>woolen</b> mill in Danville {{was built}} on Mahoning Creek. An {{agricultural}} fair was held on the creek in February 1856. Phillip Maus once built a sawmill on Mahoning Creek.

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{political}} career, Dekert's business enterprise was growing. He gathered enough savings {{to become a}} cofounder of the Company of <b>Woolen</b> Manufacture in 1766 (Kompania Manufaktur Wełnianych). In 1775 the Sejm granted him a request to buy landed estates (a privilege usually restricted only to the nobility). In 1776 he leased the Tobacco Monopoly (or Company; Kompania Tabaczna) from the Polish Treasury; ten years later, in 1786, he leased a theatre in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Between 1860 and 1865 {{southern}} cotton became unavailable {{during the}} Civil War, Harrisburg {{was one of}} the few cities in the Upland South during this time to have <b>woolen</b> mills, making the town an industrial asset early on to Southern Illinois. Several planing mills and flour mills also dotted the city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 by Ambrose Burnside, and American Civil War, Union Army, brigadier general Green Berry Raum, who was living in Harrisburg at that time.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1800s, a number of mills were built on tributaries of the creek. A number of other industries were established in the watershed in the early 1800s, including a sawmill, a <b>woolen</b> mill, an iron furnace, and a tannery. In {{the second half of the}} 1800s, railroads began to be built in the watershed. Heavy industries and fisheries also began to appear in the area around this time.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that much of Morris's {{preference}} for medieval textiles was formed– or crystallised– during his brief apprenticeship with G. E. Street. Street had co-written a book on Ecclesiastical Embroidery in 1848, and was a staunch advocate of abandoning faddish <b>woolen</b> work on canvas in favour of more expressive embroidery techniques based on Opus Anglicanum, a surface embroidery technique popular in medieval England.|$|E
5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{serves as}} a water supply source for nearby {{communities}} such as Millville. Slate has been quarried on the creek and limestone has also been produced there. In the early 1900s, there were <b>woolen</b> mills and tanneries in the watershed and agriculture was also practiced. The creek also powered several small gristmills. The Susquehanna, Bloomsburg, and Berwick Railroad historically crossed the watershed and followed the creek between its mouth and Millville.|$|E
5|$|Mid-19th century Navajo rugs {{often used}} a three-ply yarn called Saxony, {{which refers to}} high-quality, {{naturally}} dyed, silky yarns. Red tones in Navajo rugs of this period come either from Saxony or from a raveled cloth known in Spanish as bayeta, which was a <b>woolen</b> manufactured in England. With {{the arrival of the}} railroad in the early 1880s, another machine-produced yarn came into use in Navajo weaving: four-ply aniline dyed yarn known as Germantown because the yarn was manufactured in Pennsylvania.|$|E

5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy <b>woolen</b> garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the <b>woolen</b> garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with frock coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of frock coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Boise {{served on the}} board of {{trustees}} at Willamette University in Salem and Pacific University in Forest Grove. Pacific gave him an honorary doctor of laws degree. Additionally, he was a trustee at the La Creole Academy preparatory school in Dallas and a regent of the Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State University). He also spent five terms as the master of the state grange association, and owned the Ellendale <b>Woolen</b> Mill. A public speaker, he gave speeches for the Oregon Historical Society, the Oregon Pioneer Society, and the Oregon State Bar {{as well as at the}} dedication of a monument to missionary Jason Lee.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{at the mouth of}} Coal Mine Hollow, and the road it was on was used by the lumber and coal {{industries}} that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a <b>woolen</b> factory, and a tannery. By {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, these industries supported the inhabitants of two villages in Plunketts Creek Township.|$|E

5|$|The {{main problem}} the crew faced was the cold; in the morning, the {{temperatures}} peaked at around −22°F, while by mid-afternoon it often dropped to −50°. The stuntmen, dressed in <b>woolen</b> costumes, {{were in danger}} of catching pneumonia. Ice caverns producer Jaffe had scouted partially melted before filming; with only two-and-a-third days of time to film, the crew had to do the best they could. Batteries drained after minutes of filming in the cold, and the lack of snow was compensated by dropping fake precipitation into the scene by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was normally a floppy, wide brimmed, <b>woolen</b> body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, the hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|There are {{at least}} two major rock {{formations}} in the watershed of Little Fishing Creek: the Chemung Formation and the Hamilton Group. The creek's watershed includes part of the Greenwood Valley. Much of the watershed is forested and major roads in it include Pennsylvania Route 42. The first European settler first arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} creek during the 1760s or 1770s, with other settlers arriving in the 1790s. A number of sawmills, <b>woolen</b> mills, and tanneries historically operated on the creek. A number of covered bridges have also been built over it and there were historically some railroads in the watershed.|$|E

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three <b>woolen</b> garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|Ukuku: {{clad in a}} dark {{coat and}} a <b>woolen</b> mask, the ukukus (spectacled bear) {{represent}} the role of tricksters; they speak in high-pitched voices, and play pranks, but have the serious responsibility of keeping order among the thousands of pilgrims. Some also {{go up to the}} glacier to spend the night. They cut blocks of glacier ice and carry them on their backs to their people at the festival in the valley. When melted, the water is believed to be medicinal for body and mind. It is used for holy water in the churches during the next year. In Quechua mythology, ukukus are the offspring of a woman and a bear, feared by everyone because of their supernatural strength. In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
5|$|As {{industry}} and railroads left the Mississippi riverfront, people gradually {{became aware that}} the riverfront could be a destination for living, working, and shopping. The Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board acquired land along the river banks, including much of Nicollet Island, all of Boom Island, and the West River Parkway corridor. These properties were developed with trails and parkways, and this spurred the development of private land adjacent to the riverfront, creating the new Mill District neighborhood. The Stone Arch Bridge was opened to pedestrian traffic in 1994, creating a link in the trail system and providing spectacular views of Saint Anthony Falls. Some of the old commercial buildings were adapted to new uses. The Whitney Hotel was built {{in what used to}} be the Standard Mill, while the North Star Lofts was a new use for the former North Star <b>Woolen</b> Mills building. Other projects, such as Saint Anthony Main and a number of condominium and townhouse projects, provide residents with the opportunity to live within view of Saint Anthony Falls.|$|E
