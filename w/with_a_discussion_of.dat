He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) and aggressive (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|The text opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{virtues and}} {{lifestyle}} of a yogi, with 70 verses {{in the first}} chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas. The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, wherein the text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body.|$|E

5|$|Bodyguard of Lies {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} to Ultra, the codename for decrypted signals intelligence. It goes on to document {{the origins of the}} London Controlling Section (LCS) and the work of Dudley Clarke in the Middle East. In late 1942, Allied high command in London became aware of Clarke's successes during the North African Campaign. Based on his theories of deception, the LCS was created under Colonel John Bevan and granted broad powers to plan deception strategy. The introduction finishes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> how the Allies evolved deception strategy prior to 1943, including the Double-Cross System (the Allied system of double agents). The second section of the book introduces the German intelligence forces, in particular Admiral Canaris and his Abwehr intelligence agency. Brown discusses early deceptions, such as those surrounding Operation Torch, conducted against the Germans, and how the Abwehr struggled to decipher the information it was being fed.|$|E
5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{the sources of the}} work and a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had been edited by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer, and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.|$|E
25|$|Cantor's {{article is}} short, not even {{four and a}} half pages. It begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the real {{algebraic}} numbers and a statement of his first theorem: The set of real algebraic numbers can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the set of positive integers. Cantor restates this theorem in terms more familiar to mathematicians of his time: The set of real algebraic numbers can be written as an infinite sequence in which each number appears only once.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the English courts, in the “heroic act of judicial invention”, have developed a distinct vulnerability jurisdiction, separate and apart from the ancient jurisdiction of parens patriae, through the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the court. This new jurisdiction provides a legal basis and mechanism for the disruption of exploitative relationship contexts. The objective of that disruption is not protection per se (the parens patriae objective), but the safeguarding of individual autonomy rights in situations where those rights cannot be effectively exercised without intervention. The paper concludes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>of</b> implications of the English “invention” in Canadian jurisprudence. Peer reviewe...|$|R
25|$|Set {{membership}}: Tarski {{ended his}} lecture <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given {{the reduction of}} (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, {{the question of whether}} most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of type theory, but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory.|$|E
25|$|His scholarship, {{publications}} and political affiliations {{were considered to}} be on the far left. In 1979 the New York State Board of Higher Education formally apologized to Foner and other persons who lost their jobs {{as a result of the}} Rapp-Coudert Committee, saying it had seriously violated academic freedom. A controversy over Foner's work and scholarship practices arose in academic circles in 2003, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> plagiarism and sloppy scholarship. The New York Labor History Association had awarded Foner a lifetime achievement award in 1994. It reiterated its support in 2003 that the value of his work exceeded his shortcomings.|$|E

Unlike Love in Several Masques, Fielding cares more about {{revealing}} hypocrisy than <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites {{in a manner that}} emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.|$|E

25|$|Chapter 3. The Lost City of Francisco Grande. Developed {{at a cost}} of $4.5 {{million by}} San Francisco Giants owner Horace Stoneham, Francisco Grande was built {{adjacent}} to Casa Grande, Arizona as the spring training home for the Giants. The facility, opened in 1961, boasted a private airstrip, an 18-hole golf course, and five baseball fields as well as player rooms, training and administrative offices for the team. Rushin notes that many of Francisco Grande's buildings were decorated with baseball memorabilia such as bats, balls, and gloves and he then continues the chapter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the development of baseball gloves. The chapter concludes with an overview of how the catcher's position changed over time and how the development and use of the hinged catcher's glove revolutionized the sport by allowing catchers such as Johnny Bench to catch one-handed.|$|E
25|$|The session began <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{procedures}} and regulations, {{then moved on}} to the material and system of constitution. However, the most important debate in this session was that on the basis of state. There were three proposals. Firstly, a state based on Pancasila, the philosophical basis for the state as formulated by Sukarno in a speech on 1 June 1945. This was seen as a forum for all the different groups and beliefs in society that would be to the detriment of nobody. The second proposal was for a state based on Islam, and the third was for a socio-economic structure based on the family as set out in Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution. As none of the factions supporting these respective ideologies was able to command the necessary 2/3 of votes needed, this resulted in deadlock. Islamic parties accused the PKI of hypocrisy for supporting Pancasila with its commitment to belief in God rather than the socio-economic philosophy.|$|E
25|$|Renpō Niwa, {{a former}} abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first {{part is the}} preface in which Dōgen {{emphasizes}} the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without any thought of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.|$|E

500|$|Section four, [...] "InterOccupy", {{contains}} {{the transcript of}} {{a conference call with}} Chomsky chaired by Mikal Kamil and Ian Escuela on January 31, 2012, in which he answered pre-selected questions from the Occupy community. Beginning <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the media coverage of Occupy, he moves on to discuss the police repression that the movement has faced, arguing {{that the best way to}} avoid such repression was to gain [...] "active public support" [...] for their cause. He considers one of the primary achievements of Occupy to have been to bring together communities to discuss and debate in a democratic forum, thereby rejecting the ideologies of selfishness proposed by the likes of Ayn Rand. Chomsky then discusses how to get the corporate sector out of politics and how to introduce greater democracy to the U.S. He rounds off this chapter <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> the nature of the Republican and Democratic parties, the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci and the role of the U.S. housing bubble in the global depression.|$|E
500|$|Chapter seven, [...] "Cauldron of Animosities", opens <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> U.S. {{support for}} the {{increasing}} militarization of Israel and its illegal development of nuclear weapons, something Chomsky believes threatens peace in the Middle East by encouraging nations like Iran and Iraq to do the same. He explores the longstanding western exploitation of the Middle East for its oil resources, first by the British Empire and subsequently by the U.S. post-World War II, and then looks at the U.S.' role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, continually supporting Israel both militarily and politically, furthering human right abuses against the Palestinian people and repeatedly sabotaging the peace process.|$|E

500|$|In the odes of 1819 Keats explores his contemplations about {{relationships}} between the soul, eternity, nature, and art. His idea of using classical Greek art as a metaphor originated in his reading of Haydon's Examiner articles of 2 May and 9 May 1819. In the first article, Haydon described Greek sacrifice and worship, {{and in the second}} article, he contrasted the artistic styles of [...] Raphael and Michelangelo in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> medieval sculptures. Keats also had access to prints of Greek urns at Haydon's office, and he traced an engraving of the [...] "Sosibios Vase", a Neo-Attic marble volute krater, signed by Sosibios, in The Louvre, which he found in Henry Moses's A Collection of Antique Vases, Altars, Paterae.|$|E

Heins discusses the case of Nancy Richardson, dean of student affairs at the Boston University School of Theology, who was removed from her position by the school's administration in 1981. Heins represented Richardson in an unsuccessful lawsuit against Boston University for wrongful termination and sexism. Cutting the Mustard recounts the case, interspersing reflections on the lawsuit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> relevant case law, decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States related to affirmative action and multiple criticisms of contradictory court decisions in affirmative-action cases.|$|E
500|$|The book begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>of</b> {{targeted}} killing of non-combatants, followed by discussions of legalities, the rationale of self-defence, {{the choice of}} targets, and when and whether the ends {{can be used to}} justify the means. Several contributors defend targeting of non-combatants, while Jeremy Waldron discusses the morality associated with the tactic and argues against its use. Jeff McMahan identifies the problematic nature of {{targeted killing}} and emphasizes regulations for law enforcement to avoid abuse of process. Richard V. Meyer writes that any entity wishing to carry out targeted killing should first have to declare war on the targeted parties. [...] Kevin H. Govern examines the elimination of Osama Bin Laden and identifies this killing as justified and the product of a rational decision-making process. In the final portion of the book, Fernando Tesón says that targeted killing is particularly justified against terrorists because they use tactics specifically designed to kill civilians.|$|E

40|$|Context logic formalizes the way mathematicians apply {{logic in}} their reasoning, {{shifting}} context as {{they find it}} useful. Context logic is defined by only three axioms – simple reflection laws for falsity, conjunction and equality. From these, both classical and intuitionistic reasoning elements arise in a natural way; classical reasoning being about consistency (nonrefutability), intuitionistic reasoning about verifiability as the criterion for truth. In the class of categorical contexts, these criteria coincide, and classical reasoning is valid even for verifying statements.
