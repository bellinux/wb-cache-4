5|$|James Sunderland (Guy Cihi) is {{the protagonist}} of the main {{scenario}} of Silent Hill 2. He comes to the town after receiving a letter from his wife Mary (Monica Taylor Horgan), who died of an illness three years before. While exploring the town, he encounters Maria (also Monica Taylor Horgan), who strongly resembles Mary except for her different personality and clothing; Angela Orosco (Donna Burke), a teenage runaway searching for her mother; Eddie Dombrowski (David Schaufele), another teenage runaway who <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> brought to the town; and Laura (Jacquelyn Brekenridge), an eight-year-old who has met and befriended Mary.|$|E
5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> physically rigidly rotated.|$|E

Attitudes and network effects do not seem to differ much by gender.|$|R
5|$|Yvonne Navarro co-wrote a novelization {{based on}} the {{original}} screenplay with Dennis Feldman. The book gives several in-depth details about the characters not seen in the film, such as Sil's ability to visualize odors and determine harmful substances from edible items by the color. Gas appears black, food appears pink, and an unhealthy potential mate appears to give off green fumes. Other character details include Preston's background in tracking down AWOL soldiers {{as well as the}} process of decoding the alien signal. Although no clues are given as to its origin, it is mentioned that the message <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> routed through several black holes to mask its point of origin.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the {{population}} of the Northern states believed that the Davis government <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and although there was no evidence of their complicity, it was a political reality that had to be dealt with. One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union. Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this feud, Germanicus became ill and despite the fact Piso had removed himself to the port of Seleucia, he was {{convinced}} that Piso <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> poisoning him. Tacitus reports that there were signs of black magic in Piso's house with hidden body parts and Germanicus' name inscribed on lead tablets. Germanicus sent Piso a letter formally renouncing their friendship (amicitia). Germanicus died soon after on 10 October of that year. His death aroused much speculation, with several sources blaming Piso, acting under orders from Emperor Tiberius. This was never proven, and Piso later died while facing trial. Tiberius feared the people of Rome knew of the conspiracy against Germanicus, but Tiberius' jealousy and fear of his nephew's popularity and increasing power was the true motive as understood by Tacitus.|$|E
5|$|Teleology {{in biology}} {{is the use}} of the {{language}} of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some biologists and philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Teleology is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology to have been made to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Lana Tisdel's {{potential}} {{involvement in}} the {{rape and murder of}} Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel <b>was</b> <b>somehow</b> involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present {{at the time of the}} murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying. When nobody answered the door, Nissen alleges that Lotter broke in while Tisdel waited in the vehicle while the murders were carried out. Tisdel denied this and a lack of evidence meant that it could not be vigorously pursued in the proceeding court case—the residing judge considered most of Nissen's claims as nothing more than hearsay. Not only did Tisdel vehemently deny any involvement in Brandon's murder, she denied ever being present at Lisa Lambert's farmhouse on the night Brandon was murdered. Unlike Tisdel's own evidence and the admissions presented in court, Boys Don't Cry took the liberty of placing Tisdel at the crime scene, albeit without any intention of setting Brandon up.|$|E

However, necessary intramolecular rearrangement of the benzimidazole into sulfenamide posed severe geometric constraints. Optimal compounds would be those that were stable at neutral pH but were quickly activated at low pH.|$|E
