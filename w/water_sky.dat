A 91-meter (300ft) boardwalk weaves through {{the pond and}} two 16-meter (52ft) pedestrian bridges cross the pond to reach the Olympic Oval. Above the pond hangs the artist's [...] "sky lantern" [...] sculpture. The sculpture is made of Tenara architectural fibre, supported by painted galvanized steel rings. The entire garden is approximately 7,000 m2 (75,000 sq ft).|$|E

Just the place for a fort--a wee burn dancin' doon the hull, wi' a bit fa' to turn a grindstone, an' a long piece o' flat land for the houses, an' what a grand composeetion for a pictur',--wi' trees, gress, <b>water,</b> <b>sky,</b> an' such light and shade!

60|$|And what {{a vision}} of glorious beauty met his enraptured eyes, while the fresh sea-breeze entered, like life, into his heaving chest! It was still a {{profound}} calm. Earth, air, <b>water,</b> <b>sky,</b> seemed to be uniting in a silent act of adoration to their great Creator, while the myriad creatures therein contained were comparatively quiet in the enjoyment of His rich and varied bounties. It {{seemed as if the}} hour were too early for the strife of violent passions--too calm for the stirrings of hatred or revenge. Everything around spoke only of peace. Sitting down with his back to a sun-bathed rock, and his face to the silver sea, Leo drew out his Bible and proceeded to read the records of the Prince of Peace.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the distant}} {{days of my}} boyhood and early youth my chief delight was in nature, and when I opened a book it was to find {{something}} about nature in it, especially some expression of the feeling produced in us by nature, which was, in my case, inseparable from seeing and hearing, and was, to me, {{the most important thing}} in life. For who could look on earth, <b>water,</b> <b>sky,</b> on living or growing or inanimate things, without experiencing that mysterious uplifting gladness in him! In due time I discovered that the thing I sought for in printed books was to be found chiefly in poetry, that half a dozen lines charged with poetic feeling about nature often gave me more satisfaction than a whole volume of prose on such subjects. Unfortunately this kind of literature was not obtainable in my early home on the then semi-wild pampas. There were a couple of hundred volumes on the shelves--theology, history, biography, philosophy, science, travels, essays, and some old forgotten fiction; but no verse was there, except Shenstone, in a small, shabby, coverless volume. This I read and re-read until I grew sick of bright Roxana tripping o'er the green, or of gentle Delia when a tear bedews her eye to think yon playful kid must die. To my uncultivated mind--for I had never been at school, and lived in the open air with the birds and beasts--this seemed intolerably artificial; for I was like a hungry person who has nothing but kickshaws put before him, and eats because he is hungry until he loathes a food which in its taste confounds the appetite. Never since those distant days have I looked at a Shenstone or even seen his name in print or heard it spoken, without a slight return of that old sensation of nausea. If Shenstone alone had come to me, the desire for poetry would doubtless have been outlived early in life; but there were many passages, some very long, from the poets in various books on the shelves, and these kept my appetite alive. There was Brown's Philosophy, for example; and Brown loved to illustrate his point with endless poetic quotations, the only drawback in my case being that they were almost exclusively drawn from Akenside, who was not [...] "rural." [...] But there were other books in which other poets were quoted, and of all these the passages which invariably pleased me most were the descriptions of rural sights and sounds.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of its vespers/vigil setting, this psalm is {{understood}} to be a hymn of creation, in all the fulness wherein God has created it - it speaks of animals, plants, <b>waters,</b> <b>skies,</b> etc. In {{the scope of the}} liturgical act, it is often taken to be Adam's song, sung outside the closed gates of Eden from which he has been expelled (cf. Genesis 3). While the reader chants the psalm, the priest stands outside the closed Royal Doors wearing only his epitrachilion, making this symbolism more evident.|$|R
