5|$|Before 1856 there <b>was</b> <b>minimal</b> {{discussion}} of statehood within Minnesota.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} threat, Chris caused little {{impact in the}} Lesser Antilles. Overall damage from Chris <b>was</b> <b>minimal.</b> The storm dropped light {{rainfall}} in Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.09inches (78mm) in Fajardo. The rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks, which temporarily closed a highway in the northeastern portion of the island.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{fears of}} a repeat of Hurricane Iwa, which devastated the island group the {{previous}} year, officials issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches while seven shelters were opened, though few people actually used these shelters. On Oahu, a power outage was reported, affecting 2,400 customers. Jellyfish also stung 50 people. Locally heavy rainfall and rough seas led to minor damage while strong winds lead to extensive damage {{on the north side}} of the island. On Maui and Kauai, minor flooding, as well, though damage <b>was</b> <b>minimal.</b> Offshore, one person is presumed to have died in a shipwreck. In a separate shipping incident, three crewmen were slightly injured. The remnants of Gil later affected the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where near-gale force winds were measured. Throughout the state, damage <b>was</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carla, Texas' largest {{storm on}} record, struck the coast in 1961 causing {{substantial}} flooding and damage in Texas City and other communities. Loss of life <b>was</b> <b>minimal</b> thanks to evacuation efforts. Expansion {{of the flood}} control dike and construction on the Texas City seawall occurred a result. The project was completed in 1985.|$|E

5|$|In New England and Canada, overall damage <b>was</b> <b>minimal,</b> {{and only}} brief, {{sporadic}} power outages were reported. One indirect storm-related fatality {{was reported in}} Nova Scotia {{as a result of}} a person falling during minor roof repairs. In Newfoundland, over 1.96inches (50millimeters) of rain fell over parts of the eastern region of the province.|$|E
5|$|In Texas, {{the storm}} dropped heavy rainfall, causing minor flash {{flooding}} damage. The cold front, {{combined with the}} remnants of the storm, dropped moderate to heavy rainfall from Texas through the Mid-Atlantic. The worst of the flooding occurred in Indianapolis, where record rainfall affected over 700 homes. Despite the rainfall, damage <b>was</b> <b>minimal</b> along its path.|$|E

5|$|Nine {{people were}} killed in the Dominican Republic: two {{fishermen}} went missing at sea during the storm and the others were swept away by flood waters when rivers burst their banks in Guaricanos and Puerto Plata. Otherwise, the damage in the Dominican Republic <b>was</b> <b>minimal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Odette's {{rainfall}} caused flooding {{throughout the}} island's rivers. The river flooding destroyed three bridges, resulting in $20,000 in damages (2003USD). The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in Humacao. The rainfall also covered numerous roads, though overall damage <b>was</b> <b>minimal</b> throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Edouard dropped {{moderate}} rainfall across Florida, exceeding 7inches (175mm) in {{the western}} portion of the state. Though Edouard was a tropical storm at landfall, wind speeds along the storm's path over land were light.
