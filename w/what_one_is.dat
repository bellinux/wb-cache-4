5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E

25|$|Before one {{counters}} an insurgency, however, {{one must}} understand <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> countering. Typically {{the most successful}} counterinsurgencies have been the British in the Malay Emergency and the Filipino government's countering of the Huk Rebellion. In the Philippine–American War, the U.S. forces successfully quelled the Filipino insurgents by 1902, albeit with tactics considered unacceptable {{by the majority of}} modern populations.|$|E
25|$|According to the Halakha, {{a person}} may only recite the blessing while it is still night. If he or she remembers the count the next morning or afternoon, the count may still be made, but without a blessing.

The Omer may be counted in any language, however one must understand <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> saying.|$|E
25|$|On 9 February 2006, President Chen {{met with}} Taiwanese Muslims {{who had just}} come back from Saudi Arabia for {{performing}} the Hajj pilgrimage in January 2006. He said that Taiwan needs to have some of the Islamic spirit of standing in awe of the supreme God, upholding peace and justice, helping the weak and poor, promoting social stability, being content with <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> and working hard. The President urged Taiwanese Muslims to introduce the doctrine and spirit of Islam to their compatriots to enhance exchanges between the Muslim societies and other sectors in Taiwan. He also expressed government's concern for the Islamic development to promote religious harmony and added that the government always pays great attention to religious development and encourages all religions in Taiwan to communicate with one another to promote mutual tolerance and respect and to serve as a driving force for stability, peace and prosperity. He stressed that any minority religion in Taiwan is respected and enjoys full protection under the law.|$|E

500|$|Writing about Lee's {{style and}} use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: [...] "Laughter... the {{gangrene}} under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly... be controlled by <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> able to laugh at." [...] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her [...] "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons {{the best way to}} get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. [...] Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.|$|E
500|$|Very {{soon after}} its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that [...] "Witchfinder General is {{certainly}} [...] most successfully achieved work ... <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of what is on the screen... the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." [...] David Pirie, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book A Heritage of Horror, reviewed the film in 1971 for Time Out, commenting: [...] "...one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema... The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." [...] Danny Peary noted, [...] "The Conqueror Worm is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is {{that he was able to}} maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." [...] In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most [...] "artistically or culturally important" [...] movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film [...] "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" [...] and [...] "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." [...] In 2005, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film [...] "...has long been a cult item– in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before [...] the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil... Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance... it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Christian {{doctrine}} of the Trinity defines God as three consubstantial persons, or hypostases—the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit; [...] "one God in three persons". The three persons are distinct, yet are one [...] "substance, essence or nature". In this context, a [...] "nature" [...] is <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is,</b> while a [...] "person" [...] is who one is.|$|E

2500|$|Even in [...] "naked commerce", the {{possible}} methods of [...] "masking" [...] <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is,</b> what one represents or what one does, are extremely diverse. Human languages and numerical systems, for example, offer very subtle distinctions of meaning that can [...] "cover up" [...] something, or present it {{as different from}} what it really is. Anthropologists, sociologists and linguists have sometimes studied [...] "linguistic masking".|$|E
2500|$|Classical economists {{presented}} competing {{theories of}} those of Smith, termed the [...] "labour theory of value". Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith's labour theories, in part. The first volume of Karl Marx's major work, Capital, was published in German in 1867. In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he {{considered to be the}} exploitation of labour by capital. The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production. This contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics, that the value of a thing is determined by <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> willing to give up to obtain the thing.|$|E
2500|$|The show also {{received}} some negative criticism. Tim Walker {{wrote in the}} Sunday Telegraph: [...] "It is a great big empty vessel of a show that {{makes a lot of}} noise and not much else, and would have been better entitled 'Irredeemably Bland'. I was aware that for the whole of the two hours and 25 minutes that it ran, I was sitting among a group of people with vacant smiles on faces that otherwise seemed entirely numbed. That was how I looked, too. It is the expression that registers when <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> seeing doesn't entirely sync with {{what is going on in}} one's brain." [...] Quentin Letts wrote for Daily Mail, [...] "It is pink not just in the colour of many of the clothes and stage effects. It is pink to the core of its little, tiny soul ... The plot is pap, the musical unmemorable, the dancing often hefty except for one routine with skipping ropes." ...|$|E

5000|$|What {{does this}} all mean?: The idea is LTP is {{occurring}} {{all the time}} during wakefulness. All of this information flow and storage will eventually become too much, {{and that is why}} we sleep. The point of sleep is to downgrade and eliminate some of the synaptic potentials that are not necessary from throughout our day. <b>What</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> wearing on the third Tuesday last February is irrelevant, but knowing one's middle name isn't. Extensive LTP has been put in place to remember one's middle name, and therefore that synaptic pathway would not be so easily forgotten, whereas <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>was</b> wearing on that one particular day received so little potentiation it can be forgotten in a day or two. A lot of potentiation on a certain topic would help facilitate that memory, making it [...] "more important" [...] in the 'eyes of the cortex' so it is not forgotten.|$|R
2500|$|Yet, though {{freedom and}} {{happiness}} {{is a part}} of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, [...] "when Asian teachers do talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth". Nibbana is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, [...] "without drastic changes in lifestyle". Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives. The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia. According to Spiro, [...] "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," [...] but an eschatological message.|$|E
2500|$|The {{implications}} of the scandal also involved several Wikipedia entries, particularly those on Romanian Wikipedia. In June 2007, Vladimir Tismăneanu stated: [...] "I did not make efforts {{to respond to the}} wave of calumnies (which have infested the two Wikipedia articles about me in both English and Romanian) because I followed the precept 'You do not dignify them with an answer'." [...] During a 2008 colloquy on [...] "The Campaign against the Intellectuals", organized by Revista 22 and attended by several journalists and civil society members, Horia-Roman Patapievici stated: [...] "How does one respond to the claim that one has no right condemn communism over being <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is?</b> How come so many people are not indignant over this kind of argumentation? [...] page on Wikipedia was vandalized and has stayed that way. Viewers of the page are okay with the tendentious information there. You were outraged, for just cause, when a Jewish cemetery was vandalized, but, please, also express public outrage toward the vandalizing of Wikipedia pages on Vladimir Tismăneanu. [...] Why do those who supervise the Wikipedia franchise in Romania allow this grave disinformation of the public, by forcefully maintaining a vandalized page? The absence of such an indignation is the most significant contribution to our country's morally unbreathable air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to know that <b>what</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
