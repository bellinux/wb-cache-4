25|$|At {{the time}} Paulus wrote, there was notable {{intellectual}} consolidation {{taking place in}} astrology. Forty years earlier, Julius Firmicus Maternus had written Mathesis, a long and very detailed summary of the astrological technique of his time, which has come down to us intact. Contemporaneous with Paulus, an anonymous writer had produced a Treatise on the Fixed Stars in 379 AD, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> best record of how practical astrologers of the Roman period after Ptolemy dealt with stars {{in the context of}} the astrological chart; a few decades later came three books (Apotelesmatika) by the Egyptian Hephaistio of Thebes (415 AD) integrating Ptolemy with earlier traditions.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or implicit memory.|$|E

25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about {{an inch and a}} half outside the body; the Desire body, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects the outer world and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E

500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, but we do not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> aim now." ...|$|E

2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience.

[...] "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it.

2500|$|The Revolution {{was made}} to {{preserve}} our antient indisputable laws and liberties, and that antient constitution of government <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> only security for law and liberty... The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at {{the period of the}} Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon [...] alien {{to the nature of the}} original plant... Our oldest reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will see that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to Blackstone, are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavour to prove that the ancient charter... were nothing more than a re-affirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom... In the famous law... called the Petition of Right, the parliament says to the king, [...] "Your subjects have inherited this freedom", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles [...] "as the rights of men", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers.|$|E
2500|$|Because Kierkegaard read Schopenhauer, {{and because}} Schopenhauer was heavily {{influenced}} by Eastern philosophy, {{it would seem that}} Kierkegaard would have shown an awareness of Eastern philosophy. There is, however, little direct reference to Asian thought in Kierkegaard's writings. Anyone who is familiar with such Asian traditions as Buddhist, Taoist, or Shinto philosophy, will quickly see the philosophical similarities that Kierkegaard shares with these traditions. These similarities perhaps explain the Japanese reception of Kierkegaard and the fact that Japanese awareness and translations of Kierkegaard were appearing at least 30 years before any English translations. There is also extensive Japanese scholarship on Kierkegaard, a scholarship that interprets Kierkegaard's philosophy in terms of Asian thought. This interpretation is understandable when one sees that Kierkegaard's central concerns of subjectivity, anxiety, freedom, despair, and self-deception, are also of central concern to Buddhism and, consequently, that there is nothing exclusively Christian about such concerns. Both Kierkegaard and Zen Buddhism, for example, have seen the predicaments of existence in very similar ways. A specific example of the similarities here can be seen in Purity of Heart where Kierkegaard describes the state of awareness that one must enter in order to partake of confession. Kierkegaard's description of this state is similar to the state of meditation described by Buddhist philosophers. It is distinct, however, in that the aim of confession, for Kierkegaard, is [...] "to center itself upon this relation to itself as an individual who is responsible to God" [...] (cf. Kierkegaard, [...] "Purity of Heart"). Kierkegaard aims to claim back the subject from the [...] "crowd" [...] mentality of Christendom (cf. Kierkegaard, [...] "On the Dedication to 'That Single Individual' [...] ") and reaffirm the absolute responsibility to God, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> telos (cf. Kierkegaard, [...] "Fear and Trembling").|$|E
