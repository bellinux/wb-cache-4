Iridium proved to be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of weapons. In particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> left behind in France. One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, on {{the bicentennial}} anniversary {{year of the}} {{founding}} of Bangkok and the building of the Grand Palace, the building was selected as the site of a new museum.

In 1989, Ryder graduated from Petaluma High School with a 4.0 GPA. She suffers from aquaphobia because of a traumatic near-drowning at age 12.

On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E

Kettering, 1928) and the discovery of Teflon (Roy J. Plunkett, 1938), the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted {{a great deal of}} attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> produced in situ for use in chemical reactions. The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin-off from the Manhattan Project, during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Although airpower {{was to be}} a {{major factor}} in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without {{limitations}} and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 Tet Offensive was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November1967 to 11March1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF air effort, it was not crippling.|$|E

5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help if they want, but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|By the Second Dynasty at latest, ancient Egyptian {{trade with}} Byblos yielded a {{critical}} source of quality timber {{not found in}} Egypt. By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons. Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze. The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imported from far-away Afghanistan. Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil. In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, {{in addition to other}} finished goods including glass and stone objects.|$|E
5|$|Filming was {{supposed}} to start on 26 November 2011, but the first schedule began in January 2012, and lasted for 35 days. At Linking Road in Bandra, Mumbai, Vijay acted and operated the camera himself for one scene with cinematographer Santosh Sivan's assistance, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> filmed quickly with the unaware public. Sivan commented that it was shot perfectly and decided to retain it in the film. Sivan further told that {{a major part of}} the film was being shot in real locations with hidden cameras. He shot Thuppakki with an Arri Alexa camera, as opposed to traditional 35 mm film.|$|E

The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed {{the invasion of the}} Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless had serious consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Sinatra {{worked with}} Quincy Jones {{for the first}} time in nearly two decades on the album, L.A. Is My Lady, which was well {{received}} critically. The album was a substitute for another Jones project, an album of duets with Lena Horne, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> abandoned. In 1986, Sinatra collapsed on stage while performing in Atlantic City and was hospitalized for diverticulitis, which left him looking frail. Two years later, Sinatra reunited with Martin and Davis, Jr. and went on the Rat Pack Reunion Tour, during which they played a number of large arenas. When Martin dropped out of the tour early on, a rift developed between them and the two never spoke again.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme {{were the}} first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was {{considered}} too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} Japan, heian gentleman {{were not very}} {{interested}} in a woman's physical beauty and rarely {{had an opportunity to}} see it. The only physical attribute of interest was a woman's hair, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thick and longer than she was tall. The fascination with long hair was one reason why a woman's becoming a nun was regarded with such seriousness— it could never again grow to its full length. This explains why Genji refuses to let Murasaki (his de facto wife in the classical Japanese novel The Tale of Genji) take the tonsure when she is ill.|$|E
5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person from heaven, lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, <b>which</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|Puthiya Paravai was {{released}} on 12 September 1964. It was originally slated {{to be released in}} the theatre Shanthi, which is Sivaji Ganesan's family-held theatre.

It was Sangams lead actor, Raj Kapoor, who requested Ganesan to allow his film to continue running at Shanti, to which Ganesan obliged. The film was later dubbed in Telugu as Singapore CID.|$|E
